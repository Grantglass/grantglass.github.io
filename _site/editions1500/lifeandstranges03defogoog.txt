to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

ADVER TISEMENT. 



npHE Publifher of this fplendid Edition 
of Robinson Crusoe has often ex- 
perienced the moft liberal encouragement for 
works which, being large, might feem ha- 
zardous for an individual ; but on no occa- 
fion has he been honoured and affifted by 
a Subfcription more adequate to the great- 
nefs of his expences, or more encouraging 
to the adivity of his future endeavours.— 
He begs leave to return his fincere thanks ; 
and he will only add, that his gratitude for 
fuch repeated favours will continue through 
life. 

Jugt//l 20/*, 1790, 



Vol. I. 



THE 



PREFACE. 



T F ever the ftory of any private man's ad- 
ventures in the world were worth making 
public, and were acceptable when publifhed, 
the Editor of this account thinks this will be 
fo. 

The wonders of this man's life exceeds all 
that (he thinks) is to be found extant ; the life 
of one man being fcarce capable of a greater 
variety. 

The ftory is told with modefty, with fe- 
rioufnefs, and with a religious application of 
events to the ufes to which wife men always 
apply them ; viz. to the inftru£tion of others, 
by this example, and to juftify and honour 
the wifdom of Providence in all the variety 
of circumftances, let them happen how they 
will. 

The 



Xll 



The Editor believes the thing to be a juft 
hiftory of fads ; neither is there any appearance 
of fiction in it : and however thinks, becaufe 
all fuch things 'are difputed, that the improve- 
ment of it, as w^ell to the diverfion, as to the 
inftrudion of the Reader,' vsrill be the fame ; 
and as fuch, he thinks, without farther com- 
pliment to the world, he does them a great 
fersdce in the publication.

THE 

LIFE 

AND 

ADVENTURES 

O F 

ROBINSON CRUSOE, 



I WAS born in the year 1632, In the city ofTork^ 
of a good family, though not of that country^ 
my father being a foreigner of Brerimn^ who fettled 
firft at Hull: he got a good ^ate by merchandize, 
and leaving off his trade, lived afterward at Tqrkj 
from whence he had married my mother, whofe 
relations were named Robinfon^ a very good family in 
that country, and from whom I was called Robin/on 
Kreutznaer ; but by the ufual corruption of words 
in England^ we are now called, nay we call ourfelves,

hockhart^ and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk 
againft the Spaniards ; what became of my fecond 
brother I never knew, any ntore than my father or 
mother did know what was become of me. 

Being the third fon of the family, and not bred 
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early 
with rambling thoughts : my father, who was very 
ancient, had given me a competent fhare of learning, 
as far as houfe education, and a country free-fchool 
generally goes, and defigned me for the law \ but I 
would be fatisfied with nothing but going to fea; and 
my inclination to this led me fo ftrongly againft the 
will, nay the commands of my father, and againft 
all the entreaties and perfuafions of my mother and 
other friends, that there feemed to be fomething 
fatal in that propenfion of nature tending diredly to 
the life of mifery which was to befal me* 

My father, a wife and grave man, gave me ferious 
atid excellent counfel againft what he forefaw was 
my defign. He called me one morning into his 
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and 
expoftulated very warmly with me upon this fub- 
jeft :. he afked me what reafons more than a meer 
wandering inclination I had for leaving my father's 
houfe and my native country, where I might be well 
introduced, and had a profpefk of raifing my fortune 
by application and induftery, with a life of eafe and 
pleafure. He told me it was for men of defperate 
fortunes on one hand, or of afpiring fuperior for-^ 
tunes on the other, who went abroad upon adven« 
tures, to rife by enterprize, and make themfelves 
famous in undertakings of a nature out of the com* 
mon road j that thefe things were all either too far 

above 



t)F ROBmSON CRU$o£. 3 

Ubove me, or too. far below me ; that mine wa$ the 
middle ftate, or what might be called the upper 
ftation of low life^ which he had found by long 
^experience was the beft ftate in the world, the moft: 
fuited to human happinefs, not expofed to the mife- 
ries and hardfliips, the labour and fufterings of the 
mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrafled 
with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the 
upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge 
of the happinefs of this ftate, by this one thing, viz. 
That this was the ftate of life which all other people 
envied ; that Kings have frequently lamented the 
miferable confequences of being born to great things, 
and wifti they had been placed in the middle of the 
two extremes, between the mean and the great ; that 
the wife man gave his teftimony to this as the juft 
ftandard of true felicity, when he prayed to have 
neither poverty or riches. 

He bid me obferve it, and I fliould always find, 
that the calamities of life were fhared among the 
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the mid- 
dle ftation had the feweft difafters, and was not ex- 
pofed to fo many viciflitudes as the higher or lower 
part of mankind ; nay, they were not fubjefled to fo 
many diftempers and uneafmeffes either of body or 
mind, as thofe were, who by vicious living, luxury 
and extravagancies on one hand, or by hard labour, 
want of neceflaries, and mean or infufficient diet oix 
the other hand, bring diftempers upon themfelves 
by the natural confequences of their way of living ; 
that the middle ftation of life was calculated for all 
kind of virtues and all kind of enjoyments ; that 

B 2 peace 



4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

peace and plenty were the hand-maids of a middle 
fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietnefs, 
heakh, fociety, all agreeable diverfions, and all de- 
firable pleafures, were the bleffings attending the 
middle ftation of life ; that this way men went filently 
and fmoothly through the world, and comfortably 
out of it, not embarrafled with the labours of the 
hands or of the head, not fold to the life of flavery 
for daily bread, or harraffed with perplexed circum- 
ftances, which rob the foul of peace, and the body 
of reft ; not enraged with the pafGon of envy, or 
fecret burning luft of ambition for great things.; but 
in eafy circumftances Aiding gently through the world, 
and fenfibly tafting the fweets of living, without the 
bitter, feeling that they are happy, and learning by 
every day's experience to know it more fenfibly. 

After this, he prefled me earneftly, and in the 
moft affectionate manner, not to play the young 
man, not to precipitate myfelf into miferies which 
nature and the ftation of life I was born in "feemed 
to have provided againft ; that I was under no ne- 
ceffity of feeking my bread ; that he would do well 
for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the 
ftation of life which he had been juft recommending 
to me ; and tliat if I was not very eafy and happy in 
the world, it muft be my mere fate or fault that muft 
hinder it, and that he Ihould have nothing to anfwer 
for, having thus difcharged his duty in warning me 
againft meafures which he knew would be to my 
hurt : in a word, that as he would do very kind 
things for me if I would ftay and fettle at home as he 
directed, fo he would not have fo much hand in my 
misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go 

away :

away: and to clofe all, he told me I. had my elder 
brother for an example, to whom he had ufed the 
fame earned: perfuafions to keep him from going Into 
the low country wars, hut could not prevail, his 
young defires prompting him to run into the army, 
where he was killed ; and though he faid he would 
not ceafe to pray for me, yet he would venture to fay 
to me, that if I did take this foolilh ftep, God would 
not blels me, and I would have leifure hereafter to 
refleft upon having neglefted his counfel when there 
might be none to affift in my recovery. 

I obferved in this laft part of his difcourfe, which 
was truly prophetic, though I fuppofe my father did 
not know it to be fo himfelf ; I fay, I obferved the 
tears run down his face very plentifully, and efpe- 
cially when he fpoke of my brother who was killed; 
and that when he fpoke of my having leifure to re- 
pent, and none to affift me, he was fo moved, that 
he broke off the difcourfe, and told me, his heart 
was fo full, he could fay no more to me. 

I was fincerely afFefted with this difcourfe, as 
indeed- who could be otherwife ? and I refolved not 
to think of going abroad any more, but to fettle 
at home according to my father's defire. But alas ! 
a few days wore it all off; and in fhort, to prevent 
any of my father's farther importunities, in a few 
weeks after I refolved to run quite away from him. 
However, I did not adt fo haftily neither as my firft 
heat of refolution prompted, but I took my mother, 
at a time when I thought her a little plealanter than 
ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were fo 
entirely bent upon feeing the world, that I fhould 
never fettle to any thing with refolution enough to go 

B 3 through 



6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

through with it, and my father 4iad better give me 
his confent than force me to go without it ; that I 
was now eighteen years old, which was too late to 
go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; 
that I was fure, if I did, I fhould never ferve out 
my time, and I fhould certainly run away from my 
mafter before my time was out, and go to fea ; and 
if Ihe would fpeak to my father to let me go one 
voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not 
like it, I would go no more, and I would promife by 
a double diligence to recover that time I had loft. 

This put my mother into a great paffion : fhe told 
me, ftie knew it would be to no purpofe to fpeak to 
my father upon any fuch fubjefl: ; that he knew too 
well what was my intereft to give his confent to any 
fuch thing fo much for my hurt, and that fhe won-, 
dered how I could think of any fuch thing after fuch 
a difcourfe as I had had with my father, and fuch 
kind and tender expreffions as fhe knew my father 
had ufed to me ; and that in fhort, if I would ruin, 
myfelf, there was no help for me; but I might 
depend I fhould never have their confent to it : that 
for her part fhe would not have fo much hand in my 
deftrudtion; and I fhould never have it to fay, that 
my mother was willing when my father was not. 

Though my mother refufed to move it to my fa- 
ther, yet, as I have heard afterwards, fhe reported 
all the difcourfe to him, and that my father, after 
fliewing a great concern at it, faid to her with a figh, 
" That boy might he happy if he would ftay at 
home, but if he goes abroad, he will be the moft 
miferable wretch that was ever born ; I can give no 
cpnfent to it/*

It was not till ahnoft a year after this that I broke 
loofe, though in the mean time I continued obfti- 
nately deaf to all propofals of fettling to bufmefs, and 
frequently expoftulating with my father and mother 
about their being Usi pofitively determined againft 
what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. 
But being one day at Hully where I went cafually, 
and without any purpofe of making an elopement 
that time ; but I fay, being there, and one of my 
companions being going by fea to London, in his 
father's Ihip, and prompting me to go with them, 
with the common allurement of fea-faring men, -u/z. 
That it fhould coft me nothing for my paffage, I 
confulted neither father or mother any more, not 
fo much as fent them word of it j but leaving them 
to hear of it as they might, without afking God's 
blefling, or my father's, without any confideration 
of circumftances or confequences, and in an ill hour, 
God knows, on the firft of September 1651, I went 
on board a fhip bound for London ; never any young 
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began fooner, or 
continued -longer than mine. The fhip was no fooner 
gotten out of the Htanber, but the wind began to 
blow, and the waves to rife in a moft frightful man- 
ner ; and as I had never been at fea before, I was 
moft inexpreffibly fick in body, and terrified in 
mind : I began now ferioufly to reflefl: upon what I 
had done, and how juftly 1 was overtaken by the 
judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my fa- 
ther's houfe, and abandoning my duty; all the good 
counfel of my parents, my father's tears and my mo- 
ther's entreaties came now frefh into my mind, and 
my confcience, which was not yet come to the pitch 

35 4 ' of

of hardnefs to which It has been fince, reproached 
me with the contempt of advice; and the breach of 
my duty to God and my father. 

All this while the ftorm increafed, and the fea, 
which I had never been upon before, went very high, 
though nothing like what I have feen many times 
fmcej no,, nor like what I faw a few days after: 
but it was enough to affecil: me then, who was but 
a young failor, and had never known any thing 
of the matter. I expefted every wave would have 
fwallowed us up, and that every time the (hip fell 
down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the- 
fea, we fliould never rife more; and in this agony 
of mind I made many vows and refolutions, that if 
it would ple'afe God here to fpare my life' this one 
voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land 
again I would go direftly home to my father, and 
never fet it into a fliip again while I lived ; that I 
would take his advice, and never run liiyfelf into 
fuch miferies as thefe any more. Now I faw plainly 
the goodnefs of his obfervations about the middle 
ftation of life, how eafy, how comfortably he had 
lived all his days, and never had been expofed to 
tempefts at fea, or troubles on fliore ; and I refolved 
that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home 
to my father. 

Thefe wife and fober thoughts continued all the 
while the ftorm continued, and indeed fome time 
after ; but the next day the wind was abated and the 
fea calmer, and I began to be a little inur'd to it : 
however I was very grave for all that day, being alfo 
a little fea-fick ftill ; but towards night the weather 
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charm- 
ing

ing fine evening followed ; the fun went down per- 
fedly clear, and rofe fo the next morning ; and 
having little or no wind, and a fmooth fea, the fun 
fliining upon it, the fight was, as I thought, the 
moft delightful that ever I faw. 

I had flept well in the night, and was now no 
' more fea-fick, but very chearful, looking with won- 
der upon the fea that was fo rough and terrible the 
day before, and could be fo calm and fo pleafant in 
fo little time after. And now, , lead my good refolu- 
tions Ihould continue, my companion, who had in- 
deed inticed me away, comes to me, " Well^ Bob,'* 
fays he, (clapping me upon the Ihoulder,) how do 
you do after it ? I warrant you were frighted j wa^rCt 
you^ laji nighty when it blew but a cap full of wind? A 
cap full da you call it ? faid I, // was a terrible Jiorm : 
Ajiorm^youfoolyou^ replied he, do you call that a Jiorm?

let us make a bowl of punch and we'll forget all that j 
do you fee what charming weather it is now ? To make 
fliort this fad part of my ftory, we went the old way 
of all failors ; the punch was made, and I was made 
drunk with it, and in that one nights wickednefs I 
drowned all my repentance, all my refledions upon 
my pafl: conduft, and all my refolutions for my 
future. In a word, as the fea was returned to its 
fmoothnefs of furface and fettled calmnefs by the 
abatement of that ftorm, fo the hurry of my thoughts 
being over, my fears and apprehenfions of being 
fwallowed up by the fea being forgotten, and the 
current of my former defires returned, I entirely for- 
got 



10 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

got the VOWS and promifes that I made in my diftreft* 
I found indeed fome intervals of refleftion, and the 
ferious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to 
return again fometimes, but I fhook them oflf, and 
roufed myfelf from them as it were from a diftemper, 
and applying myfelf to drinking and company, foon 
mattered the return of thofe fits, for fo I called them, 
and I had in five or fix days got as compleat a vic- 
tory over confcience as any young fellow that re- 
folved not to be troubled with it could defire : But 
I was to have another trial for it ftill ; and Provi- 
dence, as in fuch cafes generally it does, refolved to 
leave me entirely without excufe. For if I would 
not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be 
fuch a one as the worft and moft hjardened wretch 
among us would confefs both the danger and the 
mercy. 

The fixth day of our being, at fea we came into 
Tarmouth Roads ; the wind having been contrary,, 
and the weather calm, we had made but little way 
fince the ftorm. Here we were obliged to come to 
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con- 
trary, viz. at fouth'Weft, for feven or eight days, 
during which time a great many Ihips from New^ 
cajlle came into the fame roads, as the common har- 
bour where the fhips ipight wait for a wind for the 

river. 

We had not however rid here fo long, but fhould 
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew 
too frefli ; and after we had lain four or five days, 
blew very hard. However the roads being reckoned 
as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our 
ground-tackle very ftrong, our men were unconr

cetned, and not in the leaft apprehenfive of danger, 
but fpent the time in reft and mirth, after the 
manner of the fea ; but the eighth day in the morning,- 
the wind increafed, and we had all hands at work 
to ftrike our top-mafts, and make every thing fnug 
and clofe, that the Ihip might ride as eafy as poffible. 
By noon the fea went very high indeed, and our jfhip 
rid forecajile in, fhippM feveral feas, and we thought 
once or twice' our anchor had come home; upon 
which our mafter ordered out the fheet anchor ; fo 
that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables 
vered out to the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible ftorm indeed ; and 
now I began to fee terror and amazement in the 
faces even of the feamen themfelves. The mafter, 
though vigilant in the bufinefs of preferving the fhip, 
yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I 
could hear him foftjy to himfelf fay feveral times. 
Lord be merciful to us, we Jhall he all lo/l, we Jhall be 
all undone ; and the like. During thefe firft hurries, 
I was ftupid, lying ftill in my cabin, which was in the 
fteerage, and cannot defcribe my temper : I could ill 
re-affume the firft penitence which I had fo apparently 
trampled upon, and hardened myfelf againft: I 
thought the bitternefs of death had been paft, and 
that this would be nothing like the firft. But 
when the mafter himfelf came by me, as I faid juft 
now, and faid we fliould be all loft, I was dreadfully 
frighted: I got up out of my cabin, and looked 
put ; but fuch a difmal fight I never faw : the fea 
^ent mountains high, and broke upon us every three * 
or four minutes : when I could look about, I could 
fe^ nothing but diftrefs round us : two fhips that rid 

near 



12 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

near us, we found, had cut their mafls by the 
board, being deep loaden ; and our men cried out, 
that a fhip which rid about a mile a-head of us was 
foundered. Two more fhips being driven from their 
anchors, were run out of the roads to fea, at all 
adventures, and that with not a mad {landing. The 
light fhips fared the beft, as not fo much labouring 
in the fea ; but two or three of them drove, and 
came clofe by us, running away with only their fprit- 
fail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatfwain begged 
the mafter of our fhip to let them cut away the fore- 
maft, which he was very unwilling to : but the boat- 
fwain proteftin^ to him, that if he did not, the fhip 
would founder, he confented ; and when they had 
cut away the fore-mafl, the main-mad flood fo loofe, 
and fhook the fhip fo much, they were obliged to 
cut her away alfo, and make a clear deck. 

Any one may judge what a condition I miifl be in 
at all this, who was but a young failor, and who had 
been in fuch a fright before at but a little. But if I 
can exprefs at this diflance the thoughts I had about 
me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of 
mind upon account of my former conviftions, and 
the having returned from them to the refolutions I 
had wickedly taken at firfl, than I was at death it- 
felf ; and thefe, added to the terror of the florm, 
put me in fuch a condition, that I can by no words 
defcribe it. But the worfl was not come yet ; the 
florm continued with fuch fury, that the feamen 
themfelves acknowledged they had never known a 
worfe. We had a good fhip, but fhe was deep loaden, 
and wallowed in the fea, that the feamen every now 

and 



<^F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 3 

and then cried out, Ihe would founder. It was my 
advantage in one refped, that I did not know what 
they meant by founder, till I enquired. However, 
the ftorm was fo violent, that I faw what is not often 
feen, the mafter, the boat-fwain, and fome others 
more fenfible than the reft, at their prayers, and ex- 
pelling every moment when the fhip would go to the 
bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all 
the reft of our diftreffes, one of the men that had 
been down on purpofe to fee, cried out, we had fprung 
a leak ; another faid there was four foot water in the 
hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At 
that very word my heart, as I thought, died within 
me, and I fell backwards upon the fide of my bed 
where I fat, into the cabin. However, the men 
rouzed me,* and told me, that I that was able to do 
nothing before, was as well able to pump as another; 
at which I ftirred up, and went to the pump and 
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the 
mafter feeing fome light colliers, who not able to 
ride out the ftorm, were obliged to flip and run aw^ay 
to fea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a 
gun as a fignal of diftrefs. I who knew nothing what 
that meant, was fo furprifed, that I thought the fhip 
had broke, or fome dreadful thing happened. In a 
word, I was fo furprifed, that I fell down in a fwoon. 
As this was a time when every body had his own life 
to think of, nobody minded me, or what was' be- 
come of me ; but another man ftept up to the pump, 
and thrufting me afide with his foot, let me lye, 
thinking I had been dead j and it was a great while 
before I came to myfelf.

14 LIFE AND ADVEl^ITtJIlES 

We worked on, but the water encreafing In th* 
hold, it was apparent that the Ihip would founder j 
and though the ftorm began to abate a little, yet as 
it was not poffible fhe could fwim till we might run 
into a port, fo the mailer continued firing guns for 
help ; and a light fhip who had rid it out juft a-head 
of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with 
the utmoft hazard the boat came near us, but it was 
impoffible for us to get on board, or for the boat to 
Ke near the (hip's fide; till at laft, the men rowing very 
heartily, and venturing their lives to fave ours, our^ 
men caft them a rope over the ftern with the buoy ta 
it, and then vered it out a great length, which they 
after great labour and hazard took hold of, and we 
haul'd them clofe under our llern and got all into 
their boat. It was to no purpofe for them or us after 
we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own 
fhip, fo all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull 
her in towards Aore as much as we could, and 
our mafter promifed them, that if the boat was 
ftaved upon fhore he would make it good to their 
mafter; fo partly rowing and partly driving, our boat 
went away to the norward, floaping towards the fhore 
almoft as far as Winterton-Nefs. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an 
hour out of our fhip but we faw her fink, and then 
I underftood for the firft time what was meant by a 
fhip foundering in the fea ; I muft acknowledge I had 
hardly eyes to look up when the feamen told me 
fhe was finking ; for from that moment they rather 
put me into the boat than that I might be faid to go 
in ; my heart was as it were dead within me, partly 

with 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE- 1$ 

\cith fright, partly with horror of mind, and the 
thoughts of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition, the men yet 
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the fhore, 
we could fee, (when our boat mounting the waves we 
were able to fee the fhore,) a great many people 
running along the fliore to affift us when we fhould 
come near, but we made but flow way towards the 
ihore, nor were we able to reach the fliore, 
till being pafl: the light-houfe at Winterton^ the 
flK)re falls off to the weflward towards Cromer^ and 
fo the land broke off a little the violence of the wind: 
here we got in, and, though not without much dif- 
ficulty, got all fafe on fliore, and walked afterwards 
on foot to Tarmouth^ where, as unfortunate men, we 
were ufed with great humanity, as well by the ma- 
gifl:rates of the town, who afligned us good quarters, 
as by particular merchants and owners of fliips, and 
had money given us fufficient to c*ry us either to 
London or back to H«//, as we thought fit. 

Had I now had the fenfe to have gone back to 
Hm//, and have gone home, I had been happy, and 
my father, an emblem of our blefled Saviour's 
parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for 
hearing the fliip I went away in was cafl: away in 
Tarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had 
any aflurance that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pufhed me on now with an obfli- 
nacy that nothing could refift ; and though I had 
feveral times loud calls from my reafon and my more 
compofed judgment to go home, yet I had no power 
to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I 
urge that it is a fecret over-ruling decree that hurries

US on to be the inftruments of our own deftruftion, 
even though it be before us, and that we pufh upon

we were at Tarmouthj which was not till two or 
three days, for we were feparated in the town to 
feveral quarters ; I fay, the firft time he faw me, it 
appeared his tone was altered; and looking me- 
lancholy, and Ihaking his head, afked me how I did, 
and telling his father who I was, and how I had 
come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go 
farther abroad j his father turning to me with a very 
grave and concerned tone, Toung many fays he, you

exhorted me to go back to my father and not tempt 
Providence to my ruin ; told me I might fee a vifible 
hand of heaven againft me, and young man^ faid he, 
depend npon it^ if you do not go backj wherever you gOj 
you will meet with nothing but difajiers and difappoint* 
mentSj till your father* s words are fulfilled upon you. 

We parted foon after; for I made him little an- 
fwer, and I faw him no more ; which way he >Yent, 
I know not. As for me, having fome money in my 
pocket, I travelled to London by land ; and there, as 
well as on the road, had many ftruggles with myfelf, 
what courfe of life I fhould take, and whether I 
Ihould go home, or go to fea. 

As to going home, fliame oppofed the beft motions 
that offered to my thoughts ; and it immediately oc- 
curred to me how I Ihould be laughed at among 
the neighbours, and fhould be afliamed to fee, not 
my father and mother only, but even every body 
elfe ; from whence I liave fmce often obferved, how 
incongruous and irrational the common temper of 
mankind is, efpecially of youth, to that reafon which 
ought to guide them in fuch cafes, viz^ that they are 
not afliamed to fin, and yet are afhamed to repent ; 
nor afliamed of the adion for which they ought 
juftly to be efteemed fools, but are afhamed of the 
returning, which only can make them be efleemed 
wife men.

iS LIFE AND AbVENTURES 

In this ftate of life however I remained feme time^ 
uncertain what meafures to take, and what courfe of 
life to lead. An irrefiftible reludtance continued to 
going home ; and as I flayed a while, the remem- 
brance of the diftrefs I had been in wore ofFj and 
as that abated, the little motion I had in my defires 
to a return wore off with it, till at laft I quite laid 
afide the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage^ 

That evil influence which carried me firfl: away 
from my father's houfe, that hurried me into the 
wild and indigefted notion of raifmg my fortune ; 
and that impreft thofe conceits fo forcibly upon me, 
as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the en- 
treaties and even the command of my father : I fay, 
the fame influence, whatever it was, prefented the 
moft unfortunate of all enterprizes to my view ; and 
I went oA board a veflel bound to the coaft of Africa; 
or as our failors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune that in all thefe adven- 
tures I did not fhip myfelf as a failorj whereby, 
though I might indeed have worked a little harder 
than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had learned 
the duty and office of a fore-maft man ; and in time 
might have qualified myfelf for a mate or lieutenant, 
if not for a mafter. But as it was always my fate to 
choofe for the worfe, fo I did here ; for having mo- 
ney in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, 
I would always go on board in the habit of a gentle- 
man ; and fo I neither had any bufmefs in the ihip, 
or learned to do any. 

It was my lot firfl: of all to fall into pretty good 
company in London^ which does not always happen 
to fuch loofe and unguided young fellows as I then 



bt kOBlNSON CRUSOE. T9 

V^as ; the devil generally not omitting to lay fome 
fnare for them very early : but it was not fo with me. 
I firft fell acquainted with the mafter of a fhip who 
had been on the coaft of Guinea; and who having had 
very good fuccefs there, was refolved to go again ; 
and who taking a fancy to my converfation, which 
was not at all difagreeable at that time, hearing me 
fay I had a mind to fee the world, told me if I would 
go the voyage with him I fhould be at no exp^nce ; 
I fliould be his mefs-mate and his companion, and if 
I could carry any thing with me, I Ihould have all 
the advantage of it that the trade would admit ; and 
perhaps I might meet with fome encouragement. 

I embraced the oflfer, and entering into a ftrift 
fiiendfhip with this captain, who was an honeft and 
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and 
carried a fmall adventure with me, which by the 
difmterefted honefty of my friend, the captain, I 
increafed very confiderably ; for I carried about 40/. 
in fuch toys and trifles as the captain direfted me to 
buy. This 40 /• I had muftered together by the affift- 
ance of fome of my relations whom I correfponded 
with, and who, I believe, got my father, or at leafl 
my mother, to contribute fo much as that to my firft 
adventure. 

This was the only voyage which I may fay was 
fuccefsful in all my adventures, and which I owe to 
the integrity and honefty of my friend the captain, 
under whom alfo I got a competent knowledge of the 
mathematics, and the rules of navigation, learned 
how to keep an account of the ftiip's courfe, take an 
obfervation, and, in fhort, to imderftand fome things 
that were needful to be underftood by a failor : for 

C 2 as 



jiO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

as he took delight to inftruft me, I took delight td 
learn ; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a 
failor and a merchant: for I brought home 5 pounds 9 
ounces of gold duft for my adventure, which yielded 
me in London at my return, almoft 300 /• and this 
filled me with thofe afpiring thoughts which have 
fince fo compleated my ruin. 

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ; 
particularly, that I was continually fick, being thrown 
into a violent calenture by the exceffive heat of the 
climate ; our principal trading being upon the coaftj 
from the latitude of 15 degrees north even to the line 
itfelf. 

I was now fet up for a Guinea trader ; and my 
friend, to my great misfortune, dying foon after his 
arrival, I refolved to go the fame voyage again, and 
I embarked in the fame veffel with one who was his 
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the com- 
mand of the fhip. This was the unhappieft voyage 
that ever man made ; for though I did not carry 
quite 100 /. of my new gained wealth, fo-that I had 
J200 left, and which I lodged with my friend's wi- 
dow, who was very juft to me, yet I fell into terrible 
misfortunes in this voyage ; and the firft was this, 
n)iz. Our fliip making her courfe towards the Ca^ 
nary Iflands, or rather between thofe iflands and the 
African Ihore, was furprized in the grey of the 
morning, by a Turkijh rover oi Sallee^ who gave 
chafe to us with all the fail fhe could hiake. We 
crowded alfo as much canvas as our yards would 
fpread, or our mails carry, to have got clear; but 
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer- 
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared 

to 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2t 

to fight ; our fhip having 1 2 guns, and the rogue 1 8. 
About three in the afternoon he came up with us, 
and bringing to, by miftake, juft athwart our quar- 
ter, inftead of athwart our ftern, as he intended, 
we brought 8. of our guns to bear on that fide, and 
poured in a broad-fide upon him, which made him 
fheer oflF again, after returning our fire, and pouring 
in alfo his fmall fhot from near 200 men which he 
had on bpard. However, we had not a man touched, 
all our men keeping clofe. He prepared to attack 
us again, and we to defend ourfelves ; but laying us 
on board the next time upon our other quarter, he 
entered 60 men upon our decks, who immediately 
fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging. 
We plyed them with fmall fhot, half-pikes, powder- 
chefls, and fuch like, and cleared our deck of them 
twice. However, to cut fhort this melancholy part 
of our flory, our fhip being difabled, and three of 
our men killed, and eight wounded, we were obliged 
to yield, and were carried all prifoners into Sallee^ a 
port belonging to the Moors. 

The ufage I had there was not fo dreadful as at firft 
I apprehended, nor was I carried up the country to 
the emperor's court, as the refl of our men were, but 
was kept by the captain of the rover, as his proper 
prize, and made his flave, being young and nimble, 
and fit for his bufinefs. At this furprifmg change of 
my circumflances, from a merchant to a miferable 
flave, I was perfeftly overwhelmed; and now I 
looked back upon my father's prophetic difcourfe 
to me, that I fhould be miferable, and have none to 
relieve me, which I thought was now fo efFeftually 
brought to pafc, that I could not be worfe ; that now 

C 3 the 



C2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was 
undone without redemption. But, alas ! this was 
but a tafte of the mifery I was to go through, as will 
appear in the fequel of the ftory. 

As my new patron or mailer had taken me home 
to his houfe, fo I was in hopes that he would take 
me with him when he went to fea again, believing 
that it would fome time or other be his fate to be 
taken by a Spanijh or Portugal man of war ; and that 
then I fhould be fet at liberty. But this hope of 
mine was foon taken away; for when he went to fea, 
he left me on fhore to look after his little garden, 
and do the common drudgery of flaves about his 
houfe; and when he came home again from his 
cruife, he ordered me to lye in the cabin to Ipok 
after the fhip. 

Here I meditated nothing but my efcape; and 
what method I might take to eflFe£l it, but found 
no way that had the leaft probability in it : nothing 
prefented to make the fuppofition of it rational ; for 
I had nobody to communicate it to, that would 
embark with me ; no fellow-flave, no Engllfhrnariy 
Jrijhman^ or Scotfjnan there but myfelf ; fo that for 
two years, though I often pleafed myfelf with the 
imagination, yet I never had the lead encouraging 
profpeQ: of putting it in practice. 

After about two years an odd circumftance pre- 
fented itfelf, which put the old thought of making 
fome attempt for my liberty again in my head : my 
patron lying at home ' longer than ufual, without 
fitting out his fhip, which, as I heard, was for want 
of money, he ufed conftantly, once or twice a weekj^ 
fometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take 

the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 23 

the fliip's pinnace, and go out into the road afifhing; 
and as he always took me and a young Marefco with 
him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and 
I proved very dexterous in catching fifh; infomuch 
that fometimes he would fend me with a Moor^ one of 
his kinfmen, and the youth, the Marefco as they cal- 
led him, to catch a difli of fifli for him. 

It happened one time, that going a fifhing in ^ 
ftark calm morning, a fog rofe fo thick, that though 
we were not half a league from the fliore we loft fight 
of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which 
way, we laboured all day, and all the next night, 
and when the morning came we found we had pulled 
oflF. to fea inftead of pulling in for the fhore ; and 
that we were at leaft two leagues from the ihorc: 
however we got well in again, though with a great 
deal of labour, and fome danger ; for the wind began 
to blow pretty frefh in the morning j but particularly 
Ve were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warn'd by this difafter, refolved to 
take more care of hirafelf for the future ; and having 
lying by him the long boat of our Englijh fhip he had 
taken, he refolved he would not go a fifhing any 
more without a compafs and fome provifion ; fo he 
ordered the carpenter of his fhip, who alfo was an 
Englijh flave, to biiild a little ftate-room or cabin in 
the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with 
a place to ftand behind it to fteer and hale home the 
main-fheet ; and room before for a hand or two to 
fland and work the fails ; fhe failed with that we call 
51 fhoulder of mutton fail ; and the boom gibed over 
the top of the cabin, which lay very fhug and low, 

C 4 and 



24 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and had in it room for him to lye, with a flave or 
two, and a table to eat on, with fome fmall lockers 
to put in fome bottles of fuch liquor as he thought fit 
to drink ; particularly his bread, rice and coffee* 

We went frequently out with this boat a fifhing, 
and as I was mofl dexterous to catch fifti for him, 
he never went without me : It happened that he had 
appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleafure 
or for fifh, with two or three Nfoors of fome diftinc- 
tion in that place, and for whom he had provided 
extraordinarily ; and had therefore fent on board the 
boat over night a larger ftore of provifions than ordi- 
nary ; and had ordered me to get readyv three fuzees 
with powder and and Ihot, which were on board his 
Ihip ; for that they defigned fome fport of fowling, a« 
well as fiftiing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and 
waited the next morning with the boat waflied clean, 
her ancient and pendants out, and every thing to ac- 
commodate his guefts J when by and by my patron 
came on board alone, and told me his guefts had 
put off going, upon fome bufinefs that fell out, and 
ordered me with the man and boy, as ufual, to go 
out with the boat and catch them fome fifh, for that 
his friends were to fup at his houfe ; and commanded 
that as foon as I got fome fifh I fhould bring it home 
to his houfe ; all which I prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance 
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was like 
to have a little fhip at my command ; and my mafter 
being gone, I prepared to fiirnifh myfelf, not for fifh- 
ing bufinefs, but for a voyage ; though I knew not, 

neither 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 25 

neither did I fo much as confider, whither I fliould 
fteer ; for any where to get out of that place was 
my way. 

My firft contrivance was to make a pretence to 
fpeak to this Moor^ to get fomething for our fubfift- 
ance on board ; for I told him we muft not prefume 
to eat of our patron's bread ; he faid, that was true ; 
fo he brought a large bafket of rulk or bifkct of their 
kind, and three jarrs with frefh water into the boat. 
I knew where my patron's cafe of bottles flood, which 
it was evident by the make were taken out of fome 
Englijh prize ; and I conveyed them into the boat 
while the Moor was on fhore, as if they had been 
there before for our mafter : I conveyed alfo a great 
lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above 
half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or 
thread, a hatchet, a faw, and a hammer, all which 
were, of great ufe to us afterwards ; efpecially jthe wax 
to make candles. Another trick I tryed upon him, 
which he innocently came into alfo ; his name was 
Ifmaelj who they call Muly^ or Moley ; fo I called to 
him, Moley J faid I, our patron's guns are on board 
the boat, can you not get a little powder and fhot, it 
may be we may kill fome Alcamies (a fowl like our 
Curlieus) for ourfelves, for I know he keeps the gun- 
ner's (lores in the ihip ? Yes, fays he, I'll bring fome, 
and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch 
which held about a pound and a half of powder, or 
rather more ; and another with Ihot, that had five or 
fix pounds, with fome bullets, and put all into the 
boat : at the feme time I had found fome powder of 
jny mailer's in the great cabin, with which I filled 

one 



26 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

one of the large bottles in the cafe, which was almoft 
empty ; pouring what was in it into another : and 
thus furniflied with every thing needful, we failed out 
of the port to fifli : the caftle which is at the entrance 
of the port knew who we were, and took no notice 
of us ; and we were not above a mile out of the port 
before we haled in our fail, and fet us down to filh : 
the wind blew from the N. N. E. which was contrary 
to my defire ; for had it blown foutherly I had been 
fure to have made the coaft of Spain, and at lead 
reached to the bay of Cadiz ; but my refolutions were, 
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that 
horrid place where I was, and leave the reft to fate. 

After we had fifhed fome time and catched nothing, 
for when I had fifh on my hook I would not pull 
them up, that he might not fee them ; I faid to the 
Moor, this will not do, our mafter will not be thus 
ferved, we muft ftand farther of: he thinking no 
harm agreed, and being in the head of the boat fet 
the fails ; and as I had the helm I run the boat out 
near a league farther, and then brought her to as if 
I would fifli, when giving the boy the helm, I ftept 
forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I 
ftoopt for Ibmething behind him, I took him by fur- 
prize with my arm under his twift, and toft him clear 
over-board into the fea ; he rofe immediately, for he 
fwam like a cork, and calling to me, begged to be 
taken in, told me he would go all over the world with 
me ; he fwam fo ftrong after the boat that he would 
have reached me very quickly, there being but little 
wind ; upon which I ftept into the cabin, and fetch-^ 
ing one of the fowling pieces, I prefented it at him, 

and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2/ 

and told him, I had done him no hurt, and if he 
would be quiet I would do him none : but faid I, you 
fwim well enough to reach to the fliore, and the fea is 
calm, make the bed of your way to fliore, and I will 
do you no harm, but if you come near the boat FU 
fhoot you through the head ; for I am refolved to 
have my liberty: fo he turned himfelf about and 
fwam for the fliore, and I make no doubt but he 
reached it with eafe, for he was an excellent 
fwimmer, 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor 
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was 
no venturing to trufl: him: when he was gone 
I turned to the boy, who they called Xury^ 
and faid to him, Xiiry^ if you will be faithful to 
me ril make you a great man, but if you will 
not ftroke your face to be true to me, that is, 
fwear by Mahomet and his father's beard, I mufl: 
throw you into the fea too ; the boy fmiled in my 
face, and fpoke fo innocently that I could not mif- 
trufl him ; and fwore to be faithful to me, and go all 
over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was fwim- 
ming, I flood out diredly to fea with the boat, rather 
ftretching to windward, that they might think me 
gone towards the Straits mouth (as indeed any one 
that had been in their wits mufl: have been fuppofed 
to do) for who would have fuppofed we were failed 
on to the fouthward to the truly Barbarian coaft, 
where whole nations of negroes were fure to fur- 
round us with their canoes, and deftroy us ; where 
we could nev^r once go on fliore but we fliould be 

devoured 



2H LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

devoured by favage beafts, or more mercilefs favages 
of human kind. 

But as foon as it grew dufk in the evening, I 
changed my courfe, and fleered direftly fouth and 
by eaft, bending my courfe a little toward the eaft, 
that I might keep in with the fhore ; and having a 
fair frefh gale of wind, and a fmooth quiet fea, I 
made fuch fail that I believe by the next day at three 
o'clock in the afternoon, when I firft made the land, 
I could not be lefs than 1 50 miles fouth of Sa/Iee ; 
quite beyond the emperor of Moroccans dominions, or 
indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we faw no 
people. 

Yet fuch was the fright I had taken at the Moors-^ 
and the dreadful apprehenfions I had of falling into 
their hands, that I would not flop, or go on fhore, or 
come to an anchor ; the wind continuing fair, till I 
had failed in that manner five days : and then the 
wind fhifting to the fouthward, I concluded alfo that 
if any of our vefTels were in chafe of me, they alfo 
would now give over ; fo I ventured to make to the 
coafl, and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little 
river, I knew not what, or where j neither what lati- 
tude, what country, what nation, or what river : I 
neither faw, or defired to fee any people, the prin- 
cipal thing I wanted was frefh water. We came in- 
to this creek in the evening, refolving to fwim on 
fhore as foon as it was dark, and difcover the country ; 
but as foon as it was quite dark, we heard fuch 
dreadful noifes of the barking, roaring, and howling 
of wild creatures of we knew not what kinds, that the 
poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of 
me not to go on fhore till dayj well Xury^ faid I, 

then 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. t^ 

then I won't, but it may be we may fee men by day, 
who will be as bad to us as thofe lions ; then we give 
ihem the Jhoot gurij fays Xury, laughing, make them 
run wey ; fuch pngli/h Xury fpoke by converfing 
among us flayes. However I was glad to fee the boy 
fo chearful, and I gave him a dram (out of our pa- 
tron's cafe of bottles) to chear him up: after all, Xury^s 
advice was good, and I took it, we dropped our 
little anchor and lay ftill all night ; I fay ftill, for we 
flept none ; for in two or three hours we faw vaft 
great creatures (we knew not what to call them) 
of many forts, come down to the fea-lhore and run 
into the water, wallowing and wafliing themfelves 
for the pleafure of cooling themfelves; and they 
made fuch hideous bowlings and yellings, that I 
never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fo was 
I too ; but we were both more frighted when we 
heard one of thefe mighty creatures come fwimming 
towards our boat ; we could not fee him, but we 
might hear him by his blowing to be a monftrous 
huge and furious bead : Xury faid it was a lion, and 
^it might be fo for ought I know ; but poor Xury cried 
to me to weigh the anchor and row away ; no, fays I, 
Xury, we can flip our cable with a buoy to it and 
go off to fea, they cannot follow us far ; I had no 
fooner faid fo, but I perceived the creature (whatever 
it was) within two oars length, which fomething fur- 
prized me; however I immediately flept to the cabin- 
door, and taking up my gun fired at him, upon 
which he immediately turned about, and fwam 
towards the Ihore again. 

But 



30 I.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

But It is impoffible to defcribe the horrible noifeS, 
and hideous cries and bowlings, that were raifed, 
as well upon the edge of the fhore, as higher within 
the country, upon the noife or report of the gun, a 
thing I have fome reafon to believe thofe creatures 
had never heard before; this convinced me that 
there was no going on fliore for us in the night upon 
that coaft, and how to venture on fhore in the day 
was another queftion too ; for to have fallen into the 
hands of any of the favages, had been as bad as to 
have fallen into the hands of lions and tygers ; at 
leaft we were equally apprehenfive of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on 
fliore fomewhere or other for water, for we had not 
a pint left in the boat ; when or where to get to it 
was the point : Xury faid, if I would let him go on 
fliore with one of the jarrs, he would find if there 
was any water and bring fome to me. I alked him 
why he would go ? why I fhould not go and he ftay 
in the boat ? the boy anfwered with fo much afFedion 
that made me love him ever after. Says he, if wild 
mans come^ they eat me^ you go wey. Well, Xuryj 
faid I, we will both go, and if the wild mans come, 
we will kill them, theyfliall eat neither of us ; fol 
gave Xury a piece of rulk-bread to eat, and a dram 
out of our patron's cafe of bottles which I mentioned 
before ; and we haled the boat in as near the fliore 
as we thought was proper, and waded on fliore ; car- 
rying nothing but our arms, and two jarrs for water. 

I did not care to go out of fight of the boat, fear- 
ing the coming of canoes with Savages down the 
river : but the boy feeing a low place about a mile 

up 



It. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. . 31 

tip the country, rambled to it; and by and by I faw 
him come running towards me. I thought he was 
purfued by fome favage, or frighted with fome wild 
beaft, and I run forward towards him to help him, 
but when I came nearer to him, I faw fomething 
hanging over his Ihoulders, which was a creature that 
he had fhot, like a hare, but different in colour, and 
longer legs ; however we were very glad of it, and it 
was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor 
Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good 
water, and feen no wild mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take fuch 
pains for water; for a little higher up the creek where 
we were, we found the water frefh when the tide was 
out, which flows but a little way up ; fo we filled our 
jarrs and feafled on the hare we had killed, and pre- 
pared to go on our way, having feen no foot-fleps of 
any human creature in that part of the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coafl before, I 
knew very well that the iflands of the Canaries^ and 
the Cape de Verd iflands alfo, lay not far off from the 
coafl. But as I had no inflruments to take an ob- 
fervation to know what latitude we were in, and not 
exadtly knowing, or at leafl remembering, what lati- 
tude they were in, I knew not where to look for them, 
or when to ftand off to fea towards them ; otherwife I 
might now eafily have found fome of thefe iflands. 
But my hope was, that if I flood along this coafl till 
I came to that part where the Englijh traced, I fhould 
find fome of their veffels upon their ufual defign of 
trade, that would relieve and take us in. 

By the befl: of my calculation, that place where 
I now was, mufl: be that country, which lying be- 
tween 



3^ LIFJC AND ADVENTURES 

tween the emperor of Moroccans dominions and the 
Negroes, lies wafte, and uninhabited, except by wild 
beafts ; the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone 
farther fouth for fear of the Moors ; and the Moors 
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reafon of its 
barrennefs ; and indeed both forfaking it becaufe, of 
the prodigious number of tygers, lions, leopards, 
and other furious creatures which harbour there j 
fo that the Moors ufe it for their hunting only, where 
they go like an army, two or three thoufand men at 
a time ; and indeed for near an hundred miles to- 
gether upon this coaft, we faw nothing but a wafte 
uninhabited country by day ; and heard nothing but 
howlings and roaring of wild bead by night. 

Once or twice in the day time I thought I faw 
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the 
mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries ; and had a great 
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither j 
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by con- 
trary winds, the fea alfo going too high for my little 
veflel, fo I refolved to purfue my firft defign and. 
keep along the (hore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for frefh water, 
after we had left this place ; and once in particular, 
being early in the mornirig, we came to an anchor 
under a little point of land which was pretty high, 
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay ftill to go 
farther in ; Xury, whofe eyes were more about him 
than it feems mine were, calls foftly to me, and tells 
me that we had beft go farther off the fliore ; for, 
fays he, look yonder lies a dreadful monfter on the 
fide of that hillock faft afleep : I looked where he 
pointed, and faw a dreadful monfter indeed, for it

was a terrible great lion that lay on the fide of the 
ihore, under the fhade of a piece of the hill that hung 
as it were a little over him. Xury^ fays I, you fhall 
go on fhore and kill him : Xury looked frighted, and 
faid, Me kill! he eat me at one mouth ; one mouthful 
he meant. However, I faid no more to the boy, but 
bade him lie ftill ; and took ouf biggeft gun, which 
Was almoft mufquet-bore, and loaded it with a good 
charge of powder, and with two flugs, and laid it 
down y then I loaded another gun with two bullets ; 
and the third, for we had three pieces, I loaded with 
five fmaller bullets. I took the bell aim I could 
with the firft piece, to have Ihot him into the head, 
but he lay fo with his leg raifed a little above his 
nofe, that the flugs hit his leg about the knee, and 
broke the bone. He ftarted up growling at firft, but 
finding his leg broke fell down again, and then got 
up upon three legs, and gave the moft hideous roar 
that ever I heard. I was a little furprifed that 1 had 
not hit bim on the head ; however, I took up the 
fecond piece immediately, and, though he began to 
move off, fired again, and Ihot him into the head, 
and had the pleafure to fee him drop, and make but 
little noife, but lay ftruggling for life. Then Xtiry 
took heart, and would have me let him go on fliore : 
Well, go, faid I ; fo the boy jumped into the water, 
and taking a little gun in one hand, fwam to fliore 
with the other hand, and coming clofe to the crea- 
ture, put the muzzle of. the piece to his ear, and 
fliot him into the head again, which difpatched him 
quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food ; 
and I was very forry to lofe three charges of powder

and (hot upon a creature that was good for nothing to 
us. However, Xury faid he would have fome of him ; 
fo he comes on board, and alked me to give him the 
hatchet. For what ^ Xury? faid I. Me cut off his headj 
faid he. However, Xury could not cut off his head, 
but he cut' off a foot, and brought it with him, and 
it was a monftrous great one. 

I bethought myfelf however, that perhaps the Ikin 
of him might one way or other be of fome value to 
us ; and I refolved to take off his Ikin, if I could. So 
Xury and I went to work with him ; but Xury was 
much the better workman at it, for I knew very ill 
how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole^ 
day; but at laft we got off the hide of him, and 
fpreading it on the top of our cabin, the fun effectu- 
ally dried it in two days time, and it afterwards fer- 
ved me to lie upon. 

After this flop, we made on to the fouthward 
continually for ten or twelve days, living very fpa- 
ring on our provifions, which began to abate very 
much, and going no oftener into the fliore than we 
were obliged to for frefli water; my defign in this 
was, to make the river Gambia or Senegal^ that is to 
fay, any where about the Cape de Verd^ ,where I was 
in hopes to meet with fome European {hip ; and if I 
did not, I knew not what courfe I had to take, but 
to feek for the I/lands^ or perifh there among the 
Negroes. I knew that all the fhips from Europe, 
which failed either to the coaft of Guinea or to Braftl, 
or to the Eajl Indies, made.this Cape, or thofe IJlands; > 
and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon 
this fingle point, either that I muft meet with fome 
fhip, or mull perifh. 

When

OF ROBINSON CRUSOEJ 35 

When I had purfued this refolution about ten days 
longer, as I have faid, I began to fee that the land 
vras inhabited; and in two or three places, as we 
failed by, we faw people ftand upon the fhore to look 
at us ; we could alfo perceive they were quite black, 
and ftark naked. I was once inclined to have gone 
on fliore to them ; but Xury was my better counfellor, 
and faid to me, No go^ no go ; however I hauled in 
nearer the fliore that I might talk to them, and I 
found they run along the fliore by me a good way ; 
I obferved they had no weapons in their hands, ex- 
cept one, who had a long flender fl:ick, which Xury 
faid was a lance, and that they would throw them a 
great way with good aim ; fo I kept at a diftance, 
but talked with them by figns as well as I could ; and 
particularly made figns for fomething to eat ; they 
beckoned to me to fl:op my boat, and they would 
fetch me fome meat ; upon this I lowered the top of 
my fail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the 
country, and in lefs than half an hour came back, 
and brought with them two pieces of dry flefli and 
fome corn, fuch as is the produce of their country ; 
but we neither knew what the one nor the other was ; 
however, we were willing to accept it, but how to 
come at it was our next difpute, for I was not for 
venturing on fliore to them, and they were as much 
afraid of us ; but they took a fafe way for us all, for 
they brought it to the fliore and laid it down, and 
went and fl:ood a great way off till we fetched it on 
board, and then came clofe to us again. 

We made figns of thanks to them, for we had 
nothing to make them amends ; but an opportunity 
offered that very inftant to oblige them wonderfully; 

D 2 for 



36 JLIFE AND ADVENT CIKES 

for while we where lying by the Ihore, came tw<y 
mighty creatures, one purfuing the other (as we' 
took it) with great fury, from the mountains to- 
wards the fea : whether it was the male purfuing the 
female, or whether they were in fport or in rage, we 
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether 
it was ufual or ftrange, but I believe it was the latter j 
becaufe, in the firft place, thofe ravenous creatures 
feldom appear but in the night ; and in the fecond 
place, we found the people terribly frighted, efpe- 
daily the women^. The man that had the lance or 
dart did not fly from them^ but the reft did j how- 
ever, as the two creatures ran direftly into the water^ 
they did not feem to offer to fall upon any of the 
Negroes^ but plunged themfelves into the fea, and 
fwam about as if they had come for their diverfion* 
At laft one of them began to come nearer our boat 
than at firft I expected, but I lay ready for him, for 
I had loaded my gun wrth all pofTible expedition, 
and bade Xury load both the others. As foon as he 
came fairly within my reach, I fired, and (hot him 
direftly into the head 5. immediately he funk down 
into the water, but rofe inftantly and plunged up and 
down as if he was ftruggling for life f and fo indeed 
he was : he immediately made to the fliorey but be- 
tween the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and 
the ftrangling of the water, he died juft before he 
reached the*lhore. 

It is impoffible to exprefs the aftonifliment of 
thefe poor creatures; at the noife and the fire of my 
gun ; fome of them were even ready to die for fear 3^ 
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But 
when they faw the creature dead^ and funk in the 

water^

water, and that I made figns to them to come to the 
fliore, they took heart and came to the fliore, and 
began to fearch for the creature. I found him by 
his blood ftaining the water ; and by the help of a 
rope, which I flung round him, and gave the Negroes 
to haul, they dragged him on fhore, and found that 
it was a moft curious leopard, fpotted and fine to 
an admirable degree, and the Negroes held up their 
hands with admiration to think what it was I had 
killed him v/ith. 

The other creature, frighted with the flafli of fire 
and the noife of the gun, fwam on (horc, and ran up 
direftly to the mountains from whence they came» 
nor could I at that diftance know what it was. I 
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flefh 
of this creature, fo I was willing to have them take 
it as a favour from me, which when I made figns 
to them that they might take him, they were very 
thankful for ; immediately they fell to work with 
him, and though they had no knife, yejt with a 
fharpened piece of wood they took off his (Idn as 
readily, and much more readily, than we could have 
done with a knife; they offered, me fome of the flefh, 
which I declined, making as if I would give it them, 
but made figns for the fkin, which they gave me 
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of 
their provifion, which though I did not underfland, 
yet I accepted ; then I made figns to them for fome 
water, and held out one of my jars to them, turn- 
ing it bottom upward, to fhew that it was empty, 
and that I wanted to have it filled. They called 
immediately to fome of their friends, and there came 
two women, and brought a great vefTel made of 

D 3 earth. 



38 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

earth, and burnt, as I fuppofe, in the fun 5 this they 
fet down for me, as before, and I fent Xury on Ihore 
•with myjarrs, and filled them all three. The women 
were as ftark naked as the men. 

I was now furniflied with roots and corn, fuch as 
\t was, and water \ and, leaving piy friendly Negroes^ 
I made forward for about eleven days more, w^ithout 
pfFejring to go near the fhore, till I faw the land ryn 
out a great length into the fea, at about the diftance 
of four or five leagues before me ; and, the fea being 
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point ; 
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues 
from the land, I faw plainly land on the other fide 
to feaward j then I concluded, as it was moft certain 
indeed, that this %as the Cape de Verd, and thofe 
the i/Ia?idsj called from thence Cape de Verd IJlands. 
However, they were at a great dift:ance, and I could 
not well tell what I had bed to do, for if I fhould 
be taken with a frefli of wind I might neither reach 
one nor the other. 

. In this dilemma, as I was very penfive, I ftept into 
the cabin and fet me down, Xury having the helm ; 
when on a fudden the boy cried out, Majier^ majler^ 
a jhip with a fail ! and the fooiifh boy was frighted 
out of his wits, thinking it mufl: ne^ds be fome of 
his mafter's fhips fent to purfue us, when I knew 
\^e were gotten far enough out of their reach. I 
jumped out of the cabin, and immediately faw not 
only the fhip, but what flie was, (1^/2.) that it was a 
Portuguefe fhip, and, as I thought, was bound to the 
coafl of Guinea for Negroes. But when I obferved 
the courfe fhe fleered, I was foon convinced they 
were bound fome other way, and did not defign to 

come 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

come any nearer to the fliore ; upon which I ftretched 
out to fea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with 
them if poflible* 

With all the fail I could make, I found I fhould 
not be able to come in their way, but that they would 
be gone by before I could make any fignal to them. 
But after I had crowded to the utmoft, and began to 
defpair ; they, it feems, faw me by the help of their 
perfpeftive-glaffes, and that it was fome European 
boat, which, as they fuppofed, muft belong to fome 
fhip that was loft ; fo they fhortened fail to let me 
come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had 
my patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it 
to them for a fignal of diftrefs, and fired a gun, 
both which they faw ; for they 01d me they faw the 
fmoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon 
thefe fignals they very kindly brought-to, and lay- 
by for nje, and in about three hours time I came 
up with them. 

They afked me what I was, in Portugtiefe^ and in 
Spanijh^ and in French ; but I underftood none of 
them ; but at laft a Scots failor, who was on board, 
called to me, and I anfwered him, and told him I 
was an Englijhman^ that I had made my efcape out 
of flavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade 
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, 
and all my goods. 

It was an inexpreflible joy to me, that any one would 
believe that I was thus delivered, as I efteemed it, 
from fuch a miferable and almoft hopelefs condition 
as I was in, and immediately offered all I had to the 
captain of the Ihip, as a return for my deliverance ; 
but he generoufly tpld me, he would take nothing 

P 4 from 



40 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

from me, but that all I had fhould be delivered fafc 
to me when I came to the Brqfils ; for^ fays he, / 
have faved your life on no other terms than I would be 
glad to be faved niyfelf; and it may one time or other be 
my lot to be taken up in the fame condition: beftdes^ faid 
he, when I carry you to the Brafils, fo great a way 
from your own country^ if I fhould take from you what 
you h'ave^ you will be flarved there ^ and then I only 
take away that life I have given. No^ no. Seignior 
Jnglefe, fays he, Mr. Englifhman, / will carry you 
thither in charity^ and thofe things will help you to buy 
your fubfiflence there ^ and your paffage home again. 

As he was charitable in his propofal, fo he was 
juft in the performance to a tittle, for he ordered the 
feamen, that noneThould offer to touch any thing I 
had J then he took every thing into his own poflef- 
fion, and gave me back an exa£t inventory of them, 
that I might have them ; even fo much as my three 
earthen jarrs* 

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he 
faw, and told me he would buy it of me for the fliip's 
ufe, and afked me what I would have for it ? I told 
him, he had been fo generous to me in every thing, 
that I could not offer to make any price of the boat, 
but left it entirely to him ; upon which he told me he 
\vould give me a note of his hand to pay me 80 pieces 
of eight for it at Braftl ; and v/hen it came there, if 
any one offered to give more, he would make it up ; 
he offered me alfo 60 pieces of eight more for my 
boy Xury^ which I was loath to take ; not that I was 
not willing to let the captain have him, but I was 
very loath to fell the poor boy's liberty, who had 
aflilled me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How- 
ever, 



\ 



OF ROBINSON CRJJSOE* 4 1 

ever, when I let him know my reafon, he owned it to 
-be juft, and offered me this medium, that he would 
give the boy an obligation to fet him free in ten years, 
if he turned chriftian. Upon this, and Xury faying he 
was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brajils^ and 
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Samos^ or AlUSaints^ 
Bay^ in about twenty-two days after. And now I 
was once more delivered from the moll miferable of 
all conditions of life, and what to do next with my- 
felf I was now to confider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can 
never enough remember : he would take nothing of 
me for my paffage, gave me twenty ducats for the 
leopard's flcin, and forty for the'^wi's Ikin, which I 
had in my boat, and caufed every thing I had in the 
fliip to be pundually delivered me ; and what I was 
willing to fell he bought, fuch as the cafe of bottles, 
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, 
for I had made candles of the reft ; in a word, I made 
about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with 
this ftock I went on Ihore in the Braftls. 

I had not been long here, but being recommended 
to the houfe of a good honeft man like himfelf, who 
had an Ingenio as they call it ; that is, a plantation 
and a fugar-houfe, I lived with him fome time, and 
acquainted myfelf by that means with the manner 
of their planting and making of fugar ; and feeing 
how well the planters lived, and how they grew 
rich fuddenly, I refolved, if I could get licenfe to 
fettle there, I would turn planter among them, re- 
folving in the mean time to find out fome way to 
|get my money, which I had left in London^ re- 
mitted 



42 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

mitted to me. To this purpofe, getting a kind of a 
letter of naturalization, I purchafed as much land 
that was uncured as my money would reach, and 
formed a plan for my plantation and fettlement^ and 
fuch a one as might be fuitable to the ftock which I 
propofed to myfelf to receive from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguefe of Lifbon^ but 
born of Englijh parents, whofe name was Wells, and 
in much fuch circumftances as I was. I call him 
neighbour, becaufe his plantation lay next to mine, 
and we went on very fociable together. My ftock 
was but low, as well as his : and we rather planted 
for food, than any thing elfe, for about two years. 
However, we be|^ to increafe, and our land began 
to come into ord" fo that the third year we planted 
1 fome tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of 
ground ready for planting canes in the year to come : 
but we both wanted help ; and now I found, more 
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my 
boy Xury. 

But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did 
right, was no great wonder : I had no remedy but 
to go on ; I was gotten into an employment quite re- 
mote to my genius, and diredly contrary to the life 
I delighted in, and for which I forfook my father's 
houfe, and broke through all his good advice ; nay, 
I was coming into the very middle ftation, or upper 
degree of low life, which my father advifed me to 
before ; and which if I refolved to go on with, I 
might as well have ftaid at home, and never have 
fatigued myfelf in the world as I had done; and I 
ufed often to fay to myfelf, I could have done this as 
well in England among my friends, as have gone 

500Q 



I. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

5000 miles off to do it, among ftrangers and favages 
in a wildernefs, and at fuch diftance, as never to hear 
from any part of the world that had the lead know- 
ledge of me. 

In this manner I ufed to look upon my condition 
with the utmoft regret. I had nobody to converfe 
with, but now and then this neighbour j no work 
to be done, but by the labour of my hands ; and I 
ufed to fay, I lived juft like a man caft away upon 
fome defolate ifland, that had nobody there but 
himfelf. But how juft has it been, and how fhould 
all men refleQ:, that, when they compare their pre- 
fent conditions with others that are worfe. Heaven 
may oblige them to make the exchange, and be 
convinced of their former felicJ(l|^, by their experi- 
ence : I fay, how juft has it been, that the truly foli- 
tary life I refleded on in an ifland of mere defolation 
Ihould be my lot, who had fo often unjuftly compared 
it with the life which I then led, in which, had I con- 
tinned, I had in all probability been exceeding prof- 
perous and rich. 

J was in fome degree fettled in my meafures for 
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend 
the captain of the fliip, that took me up at fea, went 
back ; for the ftiip remained there, in providing his 
loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three 
pionths ; when, telling him what little ftock I had 
left behind me in London^ he gave me this friendly 
and fmcere advice : Seignor Inglefe, fays he, for fo he 
always called me, if you will give me letters, and a, 
procuration here in form to me, with orders to the 
perfon who has your money in London^ to fend your 
effefts to Lijbonj to fuch perfons as I fhall dired, and 

in 



44 ^If^ AND ADVENTURE^ 

in fuch goods as are proper for this country, I will 
bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my 
return; but fince human affairs are all fubjefl: to 
changes and difafters, I would have you give orders 
but for one hundred pounds y?^r//;7^, which you fay is 
half your flock, and let the hazard be run for the 
firft ; fo that if it come fafe, you may .order the reft 
the fame way ; and if it mifcarry, you may have the 
other half to have recourfe to for your fupply. 

This was fo wholefome advice, and looked fo 
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the 
beft courfe I could take ; fo I accordingly prepared 
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my 
money, and a procuration to the Portuguefe captain, 
as he defired. ^ 

I wrote the Englijh captain's widow a full account 
of all my adventures, my ilavery, efcape, and how 
I had met with the Portugal Captain at fea, the huma- 
nity of his behaviour, and what condition I was 
now in, with all other neceflary direftions for my 
fupply ; and when this honeft captain came to Lijbon^ 
he found means, by fome of the Englijh merchants 
there, to fend over, not the order only, but a full 
account of my ftory, to a merchant at London^ who 
reprefented it effeftually to her ; whereupon, fhe not 
only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket 
fent the Portugal captain a very handfome prefent for 
his humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London vefting this hundred 
pounds in Englijh goods, fuch as the captain had 
writ for, fent them direftly to him at Lijbon^ and he 
brought them all fafe to me to the Brafils ; among 
which, without my direftion (for I was too young 

in 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45 

in my bufinefs to think of them), he had taken care 
to have all forts of tools, iron-work, and utenfils 
neceffary for my plantation, and which were of great 
ufe to me. 

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune 
made, for I was furprifed with joy of it ; and my 
good fteward the captain had laid out the five pounds 
which my friend had fent him for a prefent for him- 
felf, to purchafe, and bring me over a fervant under 
bond for fix years fervice, and would not accept of 
any confideration, except a little tobacco, which I 
would have him accept, being of my own produce. 

Neither was this all ; but my goods being all 
Englijh manufaftures, fuch as cloth, ftuflfs, baize, 
and things particularly valuable and defirable in the 
country, I found means to fell them to a very great 
advantage, fo that I may fay, I had more than four 
times the value of my firft cargo, and was now infi- 
nitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the 
advancement of my plantation ; for the firft thing I 
did, I bought me a Negro flave, and an Eurcpean 
fervant alfo ; I mean another befides that which the 
captain brought me from Lijbon. 

But as abufed profperity is oftentimes made the 
very means of our greateft adverfity, fo was it with 
me. I went on the next year with great fuccefs in my 
plantation : I raifed fifty great rolls of tobacco on 
my own ground, more than I had difpofed of for ne- 
ceffaries among my neighbours ; and thefe fifty 
rolls, being each of above loo wt. were well cured 
and laid by againft the return of the fleet from Lijbon. 
And now, increafing in bufinefs and in wealth, my 
head began to be full of projeds and undertakings 

beyond 



46 1.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

beyond my reach ; fuch as are indeed often the ruin 
of the beft heads in this bufinefs. 

Had I continued in the ftation I was now in, I had 
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen 
me, for which my father fo earneftly recommended a 
quiet retired life, arid of which he had fo fenfibly 
defcribed the middle ftation of life to be full ; but 
other things attended me, and I was ftill to be the 
wilful agent of all my own miferies ; and particularly 
to increafe my fault, and double the refleftions upon 
myfelf, which in my future forrows I fliould have 
leifure to make. All thefe mifcarriages were procured 
by my apparent obftinate adhering to my foolifh in- 
clination of wandering abroad, and purfuing that 
inclination, in contradiftion to the cleareft views of 
doing myfelf good in a fair and plain purfuit of thofe 
profpefts and thofe meafures of life, which nature 
and Providence concurred to prefent me with, and to 
make my duty. 

As I had done thus in my breaking away from my 
parents, fo I could not be content now, but I m'uft 
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich 
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to purfue 
a rafh and immoderate defire of rifing fafter than the 
nature of the thing admitted ; and thus I caft myfelf 
down again into the deepeft gulph of human mifery 
that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be confif- 
tent with life and a ftate of health in the world. 

To come then by the juft degrees to the particulars 
of this part of my ftory ; you may fuppofe, that hav- 
ing now lived almoft four years in the Brafih^ and 
beginning to thrive and profper very well upon my 
plantation, I had not only learned the language, but 

had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

had contraded acquaintance and friendfhip among 
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants 
at St» SalvadorCj which was our port ; and that in 
my difcourfe among them, I had frequently given 
them an account of my two voyages to the coaft of 
Guinea^ the manner of trading with the Negroes there, 
and how eafy it was to purchafe upon the coaft, for 
trifles, fuch as beads, toys, knives, fciflars, hatchets, 
bits of glafs, and the like, not only gold duft, 
Guinea grains, elephants teeth^ ^c. but Negroes for 
the fervice of the Brajilsy in great numbers. 

They hftened always very attentively to my dif- 
courfes on thefe heads, but efpecially to that part 
which related to the buying Negroes^ which was a 
trade at that time not only not far entered into, 
but as far as it was, had been carried on by the 
Affienio%^ or permiffion of the kings of Spain and 
Portugal^ and engrofled in the public, fo that few 
Negroes were bought, and thofe exceflive dear. 

It happened, being in company with fome mer- 
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking 
of thofe things very earneftly, three of them came to 
me the next morning, and told me they had been 
mufing very much upon what I had difcourfed with 
them of the laft night, and they came to make a 
fecret propofal to me ; and after enjoining me fecrecy, 
they told me, that they had a mind to fit out a (hip 
to go to Guinea ; that they had all plantations as well 
as I, and were ftraitened for nothing fo much as fer- 
vants ; that as it was a trade could not be carried on, 
becaufe they could not publickly fell the Negroes when 
they came home ; fo they defired to make but one 
voyage, to bring the Negroes on Ihore privately, and 

divide 



48 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

divide them among their own plantations ; and in a 
word, the queftion was, whether I would go their 
fuper cargo in the Ihip, to manage the trading part 
upon the coaft of Guinea ? and they offered me that 
I fhould have my equal fhafe of the Negroes^ without 
providing any part of the ftock. 

This was a fair propofal, it muft be confeffed, had 
it been made to any one that had not had a fettle- 
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which 
was in a fair way of coming to be very confiderable, 
and with a good ftock upon it. But for me, that was 
thus entered and eftabliflied, and had nothing to do 
but go on as I begun, for three or four years more, 
and to have fent for the other hundred pounds from 
England^ and who in that time, and with that little 
addition, could fcarce have failed of being worth 
three or four thoufand pounds fterling, and that en- 
creafing too ; for me to think of fuch a voyage, was 
the moft prepofterous thing that ever man in fuch 
circumftances could be guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own deftroyer, could 
no more refift the offer, than I could reftrain my firft 
rambling defigns, when my father's good counfel 
was loft upon me. In a word, I told them I would 
go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look 
after my plantation in my abfence, and would dif- 
pofe of it to fuch as I fhould direft if I mifcarried. 
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writ- 
ings or covenants to do fo ; and I made a formal will, 
difpofing of my plantation and effefts, in cafe of my 
death, making the captain of the fhip that had faved 
my life as before, my univerfal heir, but obliging 
him to difpofe of my effeds as I had direfted in my 

will. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 49 

'will, one half of the produce being to himfelf, and 
the other to be fhipped to England. 

In fliort, I took all poflible caution to preferve my 
eflfeds, and keep up my plantation ; had I ufed half 
as much prudence to have looked into my own 
intereft, and have made a judgment of what I ought 
to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly 
never gone away from fo profperous an undertaking, 
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum- 
ftance, and gone upon a voyage to fea, attended 
with all its common hazards ; to fay nothing of the 
reafons I had to expeO: particular misfortunes to 
myfelf. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the 
diftates of my fancy rather than my reafon : and 
accordingly the {hip being fitted out, and the cargo 
furniihed, and all things done as by agreement by 
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil 
hour, the firft of September ^ being the fame day 
eight years that I went from my father and mother at 
Hull^ in order to aO: the rebel to their authority, and 
the fool to my own intereft. 

Our fhip was about 120 ton burthen, carried 6 
guns, and 14 men, befides the mafter, his boy and 
myfeir; we had on board no large cargo of goods, 
except of fuch toys as were fit for our trade with the 
negroes, fuch as beads, bits of glafs, fliells, and odd 
trifles, efpecially little looking-glafTes, knives, 
fciflfars, hachets, and the like. 

The fame day I went on board we fet fail.

with defign to ftretch over for the African coaft, 
when they came about i o or 12 degrees of northern

50 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

latitude, which it feems was the manner of their 
courfe in thofe days. We had very good weather, 
only exceffive hot, all the way upon our own coaft, 
till we came the height of Cape St. Augujiino ; from 
"W^hence keeping farther off at fea we loft fight of 
land, and fteered as if we were bound for the ifle 
Fernand de Noronha^ holding our courfe N. E. by N. 
and leaving thofe ifles on the eaft. In this courfe we 
pafTed the line in about 1 2 days time, and were by 
our laft obfervation in 7 degrees 22 min. northern 
latitude, when a violent tournado or hurricane took 
us quite out of our knowledge : it began from the 
fouth-eaft, came about to the north-wefi, and then 
fettled into the north-eaft, from whence it blew in 
fuch a terrible manner, that for 1 2 days together 
we could do nothing but drive ; and fcudding away 
before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the 
fury of the winds direfted ; and during thefe 1 2 
days, I need not fay that I expefted every day to 
be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any in the fhip 
expeft to fave their lives. 

In this diftrefs, we had, befides the terror of the 
ftorm, one of cur men died of the calenture, and 
one man and the boy waflied over-bqard. ^bout the 
1 2th day, the weather abating a little, the mafter 
made an obfervation as well as he could, and found 
that he was in about 1 1 degrees north latitude, but 
that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference weft 
from Cape St. Augujiino ; fo that he found he was 
gotten upon the coaft of Guinea^ or the north part of 
Braftl^ beyond the river Amozo?iesj toward that of 
the river Oronoque, commonly called the Great River^ 
and began to confult with me what courfe he fhould 

take. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. gX 

take, for the fliip was leaky and very . much 
difabled, and he was going diredtly back to the 
coaft of BraJiL 

I was pofitively againfl that ; and looking over the 
charts of the fea-coafts of America with him, we 
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to 
have recourfe to, till we came within the circle of the 
Caribbee-ijlands^ and therefore refolved to ftand 
away for Barbodoes^ which by keeping oflF at fea, to 
avoid the indraft of the bay or gulph of Mexico^ we 
might eafily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen 
days fail ; whereas we could not pofTibly make our 
voyage to the coaft of Africa without fome affiftance, 
both to our fhip and to ourfelves. 

With this defign we changed our courfe, and 
fteered away N. W. by W. in order to reach fome of 
our Englijh iflands, where I hoped for relief; but 
our voyage was otherwife determined ; for being in 
the latitude of 1 2 deg. 1 8 min. a fecond ftorm came 
upon us, which carried us away with the fame 
impetuolity weft ward, and drove us fo out of the 
very way of all human commerce, that had all our 
lives been faved, as to the fea, we were rather in 
danger of being devoured by favages than ever 
returning to our country. 

In this diftrefs, the wind ftill blowing very hard, 
one of our men early in the morning cried out. 
Land! and we had no fooner run out of the cabin 
to look out in hopes of feeing whereabouts in the 
world we were, but the fliip ftruck upon a fand, 
and in a moment, her motion being fo ftopped, the fea 
broke over her in fuch a manner, that we expeded 
%ve Ihould all have periftied immediately ; and we 
E 2 were 



52. LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

were immediately driven into our clofe quarters, 
to flielter us from the very foam and fprye of 
the fea. 

It is not eafy for any one, who has not been in 
the like condition, to defcribe or conceive the 
confternation of men in fuch circumftances ; we 
knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it 
was we were driven, whether an ifland or the main, 
whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the 
rage of the wind was ftill great, though rather lefs 
than at firft, we could not fo much as hope to have 
the fhip hold many minutes without breaking in 
pieces, unlefs the winds by a kind of miracle ftiould 
turn immediately about. In a word, we fat looking 
one upon another, and expefting death every moment, 
and ervey man ading accordingly as preparing for 
another world, for there was little or nothing more 
for us to do in this : that which was our prefent 
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that 
contrary to our expeftation the fhip did not break 
yet, and that the mafter faid the wind began to 
abate. 

Now though we found that the wind did a little 
abate, yet the fhip having thus ftruck upon the fand, 
and flicking too fafl for us to expefl: her getting off, 
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had 
nothing to do but to think of faving our lives as well 
as we could. We had a boat at our ftern, jufl before 
the florm, but fhe was firfl flaved by dafhing againfl 
the fhip's rudder, and in the next place fhe broke 
away, and either funk or was driven ^ff to fea, fo 
there was no hope from her ; we had another boat 
on board, but how to get her off into the fea was a 

doubtful 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 53 

doubtful thing : however, there was no room to 
debate, for we fancied the fhip would break in pieces 
every minute, and fome told us fhe was aftually 
broken already. 

In this diftrefs, the mate of our veffel lays hold of 
the boat, and with the help of the reft of the men, 
they got her flung over the fhip's fide, and getting 
all into her, let go, and committed ourfelves, being 
eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild 
fea ; for though the ftorm was abated confiderably, 
yet the fea went dreadful high upon the fliore, and 
might well be called, den wild zee^ as the Dutch call 
the fea in a ftorm. 

And now our cafe was very difmal indeed j for 
we all faw plainly, that the fea went fo high, that 
the boat could not live, and that we fliould be 
inevitably drowned. As to making fail, we had 
none, nor, if we had, could we have done any thing 
with it ; fo we worked at the oar towards the land, 
though with heavy hearts, like men going to 
execution ; for we all knew, that when the boat 
came nearer the ftiore, ixio. would be daflied in a 
thoufand pieces by the breach of the fea. However, 
we committed our fouls to God in the moft earneft 
manner, and the wind driving us towards the fliorey 
we haftened our deftrudion with our own hands, 
pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the fliore was, whether rock or fand, 
whether fteep or flioal, we knew not; the only 
hope that could rationally give us the leaft fliadow 
of expedation, was, if we might happen into fome 
bay or gulph, or the mouth of fome river where 
by great chance we might have run our boat in, or 

E 3 got 



54. ^IF^ AND ADVENTURES 

got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made 
fmooth water. But there was nothing of this 
appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the 
fliore, the land looked more frightful than the fea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven about a 
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, 
mountain-like, came rolling a-ftern of us, and 
plainly bade us exped the coup-de-grace. In a word, 
it took us with fuch a fury, that it overfet the boat 
at once ; and feperatipg us, as well from the boat 
as from one another, gave us not time hardly to 
fay, O God ! for we were all fwallowed up in a 
moment. 

Nothing can defcribe the confufion of thought 
which I felt when I funk into the water ; for though 
I fwam very well, yet I could not deliver myfelf from 
the waves fo as to draw breath, till that wave having 
driven me, or rather carried me a vaft way on towards 
the fhore, and having fpent itfelf, went back, and 
left me upon the land almoft dry, but half dead with 
the water I took in. I had fo much prefence of mind 
as well as breath left, that feeing myfelf nearer the 
main land than I expefted, I got upon my feet, and 
endeavoured to make on towards the land as fall as 
I could, before another wave fhould return and take 
me up again. But I foon found it was impofiible 
to avoid it ; for I faw the fea come after me as high 
as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy which I 
had no means or ftrength to contend with ; my 
bufmefs was to hold my breath, and rife myfelf upon 
the water, if I could : and fo by fwimming to 
preferve my breathing, and pilot myfelf towards the 
fliore, if poffible; my greateft concern now being 

that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^^ 

that the fea, as it would carry me a great way 
towards the fliore when it came on, might not 
carry me back again with it when it gave back 
towards the fea. 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me . 
at once 20 or 30 foot deep*in its own body ; and I 
could feel myfelf carried with a mighty force and 
fwiftnefs towards the fhore, a very great way ; but 
I held my breath, and aflifted myfelf to fwim ftill 
forward with all my might. I was ready to burft 
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myfelf 
rifmg up, fo, to my immediate relief, I found my 
head and hands ftioot out above the furfece of the 
water ; and though it was not two feconds of time 
that I could keep myfelf fo, yet it relieved me 
greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was 
covered again with water a good while, but not fo 
long but I held it out ; and finding the water had 
fpent itfelf, and began to return, I ftruck forward 
againft the return of the waves, and felt ground 
again with my feet. I Hood ftill a few moments to 
recover breath, and till the water went from me, 
and then took to my heels, and run with what 
ftrength I had farther towards the fliore. But 
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the 
fea, which came pouring in after me again, and 
twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried 
forwards as before, the fliore being very flat. 

The laft time of thefe two had well near been 
fatal to me ; for the fea having hurried me along as 
before, landed me, or rather daflied me againft a 
piece of a rock, and that with fuch force, as it 
left me fenfelefs, and indeed helplefs, as to my own 

E 4 deliverance; 



56 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

deliverance ; for the blow taking my fide and breaft, 
beat the breath as it were quite out of my body ; 
and haditnot returned again immediately, I muft have 
been fl;rangled in the water : but I recovered a little 
before the return of the waves, and feeing! fhould be 
covered again with the water, I refolved to hold faft 
by a piece of the rock, and fo to hold my breath, if 
poffible, till the wave went back. Now as the waves 
were not fo high as at firft, being near land, I held 
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched 
another run, which brought me fo near the fhore, 
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did 
not fo fwallow me up as to carry me away ; and the 
next run I took I got to the main land, where, 
to my great comfort, I clambered up the clifts 
of the fhore, and fat me down upon the grafs, free 
from danger, and quite out of the reach of the water. 
I was now landed, and fafe on fliore^. and began 
to look up and thank God that my life was faved in 
a cafe wherein there v\^as fome minutes before fcarce 
any room to hope. I believe it is impoflible to 
exprcfs to the life what the extafies and tranfports of 
the foul are, when it is fo faved, as I may fay, out 
of the very grav6; and I do not wonder now at 
that cuftom, viz. that when a malefaftor, who 
has the halter about his neck, is tied up, and juft 
going to be turned oft', and has a reprieve brought 
to him : I fay, I do not wonder that they bring a 
furgeon with it, to let him blood that very mo- 
ment they tell him of it, that the furprize may not 
drive the animal fpirits from the heart, and over- 
whelm him :

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^y 

I walked about on the fnore, lifting up my hands 
and my whole being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the 
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thoufand 
geftures and motions which I cannot defcribe, 
refleding upon all my comrades that were drowned, 
and that there fliould not be one foul faved but 
myfelf J for, as for them, I never f2tw them after- 
wards, or any fign of them, except three of their 
hats, one cap, and two fhoes that were not fellows. 

I caft my eyes to the ftranded veffel, when the 
breach and froth of the fea being fo big, I could 
hardly fee it, it lay fo far off, and confidered. Lord ! 
how was it poffiblel could get on fhore! 

After I had folaced my mind with the comfortable 
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to 
fee what kind of place I was in, and what was next 
to be done ; and I foon "found my comforts abate, 
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance : 
for I was wet, had no clothes to fhift me, nor any 
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me ; neither 
did I fee any profpefl: before me, but that of perifhing 
with hunger, or being devoured by wild beafts ; and 
that which was particularly afflifting to me, was, 
that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any 
creature for my fuftenance, or to defend myfelf 
againft any other creature that might defire to kill 
me for theirs : in a word, I had nothing about me 
but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in 
a box y this was all my provifion, and this threw 
me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a 
while I run about like a mad-man ; night coming 
upon me, I began with a heavy heart to confider 
what would be my lot if there were any ravenous 

beafts 



58 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

beafts in that country, feeing at night they always 
come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that 
time, was, to get up into a thick bufhy tree like a 
fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where 
I refolved to fit all night, and confider the next day 
what death I fhould die, for as yet I faw no profpeft 
of life. I walked about a furlong from the fliore, to 
fee if I could find any frefh water to drink, which I 
did, to my great joy ; and having drank, and put a 
little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went 
to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to 
place myfelf fo, as that if I fhould fleep I might not 
fall ; and having cut me a fhort flick, like a 
truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging, 
and having been exceflively fatigued, I fell fafl afleep, 
and flept as comfortably as, I believe, few could 
have done in my condition, and found myfelf the 
moft refrefhed with it that I think I ever was on fuch 
an occafion. 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather 
clear, and the florm abated, fo that the fea did not 
rage and fwell as before : but that which furprized 
me mofl, was, that the fhip was lifted off in the 
liight from the fand where fhe lay, by the fwelling of 
the tide, and was driven up almofl as far as the rock 
which I firfl mentioned, where I had been fo bruifed 
by the dafhing me againft it ; this being within about 
a mile from the fhore where I was, and the fhip 
feeming to ftand upright flill, I wifhed myfelfon 
board, that, at leafl, I might fave fome. neceffary 
things for my ufe. 

When I came down from my apartment in the 
tree, I looked about me again, and the firft thing I 

found 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 59 

found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the fea 
had tofled her, up upon the land, about two miles on 
my right hand : I walked as far as I could upon the 
(hore to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of 
water between me and the boat, which was about 
half a mile broad ; fo I came back for the prefent, 
being more intent upon getting at the fliip, 
where I hoped to find fomething for my prefent 
fubfiftence. 

A. little after noon I found the fea very calm, and 
the tide ebbed fo far out, that I could come within a 
quarter of a mile of the ftiip ; and here I found a frelh 
renewing of my grief; for I faw evidently, that if we 
had kept on board, we had been all fafe, that is to 
fay, we had all got fafe on fliore, and I had not been 
fo miferable as to be left entirely deftitute of all com- 
fort and company, as I now was : this forced tears 
from my eyes again, but as there was little relief in 
that, I refolved, if pofTible, to get to the fhip ; fo I 
pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to 
extremity, and took the water ; but when I came to 
the fhip, my difficulty was flill greater to know how 
to get on board, for as fhe lay a-ground, and high 
out of the v/ater, there was nothing within my reach 
to lay hold of. I fwam round her twice, and the 
fecond time I fpied a fmall piece of a rope, which 
I wondered I did not fee at firft, hang down by the 
fore-chains fo low as that with great difficulty I got 
hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into 
the forecaftle of the fhip : here I found that the fhip 
was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, 
but that fhe lay fo on the fide of a bank of hard fand, 
or rather earth, and her flern lay lifted up upon the 

bank. 



6o LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

bank, and her head low almoft to the water; by 
this means all her quarter was free, and all that was 
in that part was dry ; for you may be fure my firft 
work was to fearch and to fee what was fpoiled 
and what was free : and firft I found that all the 
ihip's provifions were dry, and untouched by the 
water; and being very well difpofed to eat, I 
went to the bread-room and filled my pockets with 
bifcuit, and eat it as I went about other things, for I 
had no time to lofe. I alfo found fome rum in the 
great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and 
which I had indeed need enough of to fpirit me for 
what was before me : Now I wanted nothing but a 
boat to furnifli myfelf with many things which I fore* 
faw would be very neceflary to me. 

It was in vain to fit ftill and wifh for what was not 
to be had, and this extremity roufed my application . 
We had feveral fpare yards, and two or three large 
fparrs of wood, and a fpare top-maft or two in the 
fhip ; I refolved to fall to work with thefe, and flung 
as many of them over-board as I could manage of their 
weight, tying every one with a rope that they might 
not drive away ; when this was done I went down 
the fhip's fide, and pulling them to me, I tied four 
of them faft together at both ends, as well as I could, 
in the form of a raft, and laying two or three Ihort 
pieces of plank upon them crofs-ways, I found I could 
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to 
bear any great weight, the pieces being too light ; 
fo I .went to work, and with the carpenter's faw I 
cut a fpare top-maft into three lengths, and added 
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and 
pains : but hope of furniftiing myfelf with neceflaries, 

encouraged 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6l 

encouraged me to go beyond what I fhould have been 
able to have done upon another occafion. 

My r^ift was now ftrong enough to bear any rea- 
fonable weight ; my next care was what to load it 
with, and how to preferve what I laid upon it from 
the furf of the fea ; but I was not long confidering 
this ; I firft laid all the planks or boards upon it that 
I could get, and having confidered well what I moll 
wanted, I firft got three of the feamen's chefts, which 
I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them 
down upon my raft ; the firft of thefe I filled with 
provifions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch . cheefes, 
five pieces of dried goat's flefh, which we lived much 
upon, and a little remainder of European corn which 
had been laid by for fome fowls which we brought 
to fea with us, but the fowls were killed ; there had 
been fome barley and wheat together, but, to my 
great difappointment, I found afterwards that the 
rats had eaten or fpoiled it all; as for liquors, I 
found feveral cafes of bottles belonging to our fkipper, 
in which were fome cordial waters, and in all above 
five or fix gallons of rack ; thefe I ftowed by them- 
felves, there being no need to put them into the cheft, 
nor no room for them. While I was doing this, I 
found the tide began to flow, though very calm; and I 
had the mortification to fee my coat, fhirt, and waift- 
coat, which I had left on fhore upon the fand, fwim 
away ; as for my breeches, which were only linen, 
and open-knee'd, I fwam on board in them and my 
ftockings : however, this put me upon rummaging 
f6r clothes, of which I found enough, but took no 
more than I wanted for prefent ufe, for I had other 
things which my eye was more upon ; as firft, tools to 

work 



62 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

work with on fhore ; and it was after long fearching 
that I found out the carpenter's cheft, which was 
indeed a very ufeful prize to me, and much more 
valuable than a Ihip-loading of gold would have been 
at that time : I got it down to my raft, even whole 
as it was, without lofing time to look into it, for I 
knew in general what it contained. 

My next care was for fome ammunition and arms : 
there were two very good fowling-pieces in the -great 
cabin, and two piftols ; thefe I fecured firft, with 
. fome powder-horns, and a fmall bag of fliot, and two 
old rufty fwords : I knew there were three barrels of 
powder in the fhip, but knew not where our gunner 
had flowed them; but with much fearch I found 
them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken 
water : thofe two I got to my raft, with the arms ; 
and now I thought myfelf pretty well freighted, and 
began to think how I fhould get to ihore with them, 
having neither fail, oar, or rudder, and the leaft 
cap-full of wind would have oyerfet all my navi- 
gation. 

I had three encouragements : i. A fmooth, calm 
fea : 2. The tide rifmg and fetting into the fliore : 
3. What little wind there was, blew me towards the 
land : and thus, having found two or three broken 
oars belonging to the boat, and befides the tools 
which were in the cheft, I found two faws, an axe 
and a hammer, and with this cargo I put to fea : 
for a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, 
only that I found it drive a little diftant from the 
place where I had landed before, by which I per- 
ceived that there was fome indraft of the water, and 
confequently I hoped to find fome creek or river 

there. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6;^ 

there, which I might make ufe of as a port to get to 
land with my cargo. 

As I imagined, fo it was ; there appeared before 
me a little opening of the land, and I found a ftrong 
current of the tide fet into it, fo I guided my raft as 
well as I could to keep in the middle of the ftream : 
but here I had like to have fuffered a fecond fhip- 
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have 
broke my heart ; for knowing nothing of the coaft, 
my raft run a-ground at one end of it upon a fhoal, 
and not being a-ground at the other end, it wanted 
but a little that all my cargo had flipped off towards 
that end that was a-float, and fo fallen into the 
water : I did my utmoft, by fetting my back againfl: 
the chefts, to keep them in their places, but could 
not thruft off the raft with all my ftrength, neither 
durft I ftir from the pofture I was in ; but holding up 
the chefts with all my might, flood in that manner 
near half an hour, in which time the rifmg of the 
water brought me a little more upon a level ; and a 
little after, the water ftill rifmg, my raft floated 
again, and I thruft her off with the oar I had, into 
the channel ; and then driving up higher, I at length 
found myfelf in the mouth of a little river, with 
land on both fides, and a ftrong current or tide run- 
ning up : I looked on both fides for a proper place 
to get to fliore, for I was not willing to be driven 
too high up the river, hoping in time to fee fome 
fliip at fea, and therefore refolved to place myfelf as 
near the coaft as I could. 

At length I fpied a little cove on the right fliore of 
the creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I 
guided my raft, and at laft got fo near, as that, 

reaching 



64 i.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

reaching ground with my oar, I could thruft h^ 

direftly in ; but here I,had like to have dipped all my 

cargo in the fea again ; for that ifhore lying pretty 

fteep, that is to fay floping, there was no place to 

land, but where one end of the float, if it run on 

fhore, would lie fo high, ^nd the other fink lower as 

before, . that it would endanger my cargo again : all 

that I could do, was to wait till the tide was at the 

highefl, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor 

to hold the fide of it faft to the fhore, near a flat piece 

of ground, which I expected the water would flow 

over ; and fo it did. As foon as I found water enough 

(for my raft drew about a foot of wat6r), I thrufl: her 

on upon that flat piece of ground, and there fafl:ened 

or moored her by flicking my two broken oars into 

the ground ; one on one fide near one end, and one 

on the other fide near the other end j and thus I lay 

till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and 1ali 

my cargo fafe on IJiore. 

My next work was to view the country, and feek a 
proper plSce for my habitation, and where to flow my 
goods, to fecure them from whatever might happen ; 
where I was I yet knew not ; whether on the continent 
or on an ifland, whether inhabited or not inhabited, 
whether in danger of wild beafts or not : there was a 
hill not above a mile from me, which rofe up very fteep 
and high, and which feemed to over-top fome other 
hills which lay as in a ridge from it northward; I'took 
out one of the fowling pieces, and one of the piftols, 
and an horn of powder, and thus armed I travelled 
for difcoveryuptothetop of that hill, where, after I had 
with great labour and diflSculty got to the top, I faw 
my fates to my gr^^at afl9iidion, viz. that I was in an 

ifland 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6$ 

ifland environed every way with the fea, no land to 
be feen, except fome rocks which lay a great way 
off, and two fmall iflands lefs than this, which lay 
about three leagues to the weft. 

I found alfo that the ifland I was in was barren, 
and, as I faw good reafon to believe, uninhabited, 
except by wild beafts, of whom however I faw none j 
yet I faw abundance of fowls, but knew not their 
kinds, neither when I killed them could I tell what 
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, 
I fliot at a great bird, which I faw fitting upon a tree 
on the fide of a great wood ; I believe it was the firft 
gun that had been fired there fince the creation of the 
world : I had no fooner fired, but from all the parts of- 
the wood there arofe an innumerable number of fowls 
of many forts, making a confufed fcreaming, and 
crying every one according to his ufual note-; bufc 
not one of them of any land that I knew : as for the 
creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk, its 
colour and beak refembling it, but had no talons or 
claws more than common j its flefli was carrion, and 
fit for nothing. 

Contented with this difcovery, I came back to my 
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on fliore, 
which took me up the reft of that day; and what to 
do with myfelf at night I knew* not, nor indeed where 
to reft ; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, 
not knowing but fome wild beaft might devour me, 
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no 
need for thofe fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myfelf 
round with the chefts and boards that I had brought 
on fhore, and made a kind of a hut for that night's 

Vol. I. F lodging* 



65 LIFE AND ADVENTURIlS 

lodging ; as for food, I yet faw not which way to 
fupply myfelf, except that I had feen two or three 
creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I fhot 
the fowl. 

I now began to confider, that I might yet get a 
great many things out of the (hip, which would be 
ufeful to me, and particularly fome of the rigging 
and fails, and fuch other things as might come to 
land, and I rcfolved to make another voyage on 
board the veffel, if poffible ; and as I knew that the 
firft ftorm that blew muft neceffarily break her all in 
pieces, I refolved to fet all other things apart, 'till I 
got every thing out of the fliip that I could get ; then 
I called a council, that is to fay, in my thoughts, 
whether I fhould take back the raft j but this appeared 
imprafticable ; fo I refolved to go as before, when 
the tide was down, and I did fo, only that I ftripped 
before I went from my hut, having nothing on but 
a chequered fhirt, and a pair of linen trowfers, and 
a pairof pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the fhip, as before, and prepared a 
fecond raft j and having had experience of the firft, I 
neither made this fo unweildy, nor loaded it fo hard ; 
but yet I brought away feveral things very ufeful to 
me ; as firft, in the carpenter's ftores, I found two or 
three bags full of nails and fpikes, a great fcrew-jack, 
a dozen or two of hatchets, and above all, that moft 
ufeful thing called a grihdftone ; all thefe I fecured, 
together with feveral things belonging to the gun- 
ner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two 
barrels of mufquet-buUets, feven mufquets, and 
another fowling-piece, with fome fmall quantity of 
powder more j a large bag full of fmall fhot, and a 

great 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 6/ 

great roll of flieet lead : but this laft was fo heavy, I 
could not hoift it up to get it over the fhip*s fide. 

Befides thefe things, I took all the men*8 clothes 
that I could find, and a fpare fore-top-fail, hammock, 
and fome bedding ; and vdth this I loaded my fecond 
raft, and brought them all fafe on fhore, to my very 
great comfort. 

I was under fome apprehenfions during my abfence 
from the land, 'that at leafl: my provifions might be 
devoured on fhore ; but when I came back, I found 
no fign of any vifitor, only there fat a creature like a 
wild cat upon one of the chefts, which when I came 
towards it, ran away a little diftance, and then flood 
ftill : fhe fat very compofed, and unconcerned, and 
looked full in my face, as if fhe had a mind to be 
acquainted with me ; I prefented my gun at her, but 
as fhe did not undcrftand it, fhe was perfo£tly 
unconcerned at it, -nor did fhe offer to flir away ; 
upon which I toffed her a bit of bifcuit, though by the 
way I was not very free of it, for my flore was not 
great : however, I fpared her a bit, I fay, and fhe 
went to it, fmelled at it, ate it, and looked, as 
pkafed, for more ; but I thanked her, and could 
fpare no more ; fo fhe marched off. 

Having got my fecond cargo on fliore, though I 
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring 
them by parcels, (for they were too heavy, being 
large calks,) I went to work to make me a little tent 
with the fail and fome poles which I cut for that 
purpofe ; and into this tent I brought every thing that 
I knew would fpoil, either with rain or fun, and 
i piled all the empty chefls and cafks up in a circle 

F 2 round 



68 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

round the tent, to fortify it from any fudden attempt, 
either from man or beaft. 

When I had done this I blocked up the door of 
the tent with fome boards within, and an empty 
cheft fet up an-end without ; and fpreading one of 
the beds upon the ground, laying my two piftols 
juft at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went 
to bed for the firft time, and flept very quietly all 
night, for I was very weary and heavy ; for the night 
before I had flept little, and had laboured very hard 
all day, as well to fetch all thofe things from the fliip, 
a^ to get them on fliore. 

I had the biggeft magazine of all kinds now, that 
ever were laid up, I believe, for one man 5 but I was 
not fatisfied flill ; for while the fliip fat upright in 
that pofture, I thought I ought to get every thing out 
of her that I could : fo every day at low water I went 
on board, and brought away fomething or other; 
but particularly the third time I went, I brought 
away as much of the rigging as I could, as alfo all 
the fmall ropes and rope twine I could get, with a 
piece of fpare canvafs, which was to mend the fails 
upon occafion, and the barrel of wet gun-powder: in 
a word, I brought away all the fails firft and laft, only 
that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as 
much at a time as I could } for they were no more 
ufeful to be fails, but as mere canvafs only. 

But that which comforted me more ftill, was, that, 
laft of all, after I had made five or fix fuch voyages 
as thefe, and thought I had nothing more to exped 
from the fhip that was worth my meddling with ; I fay, 
after all this, I found a great hogfhead of bread, and 

three

three large runlets of rum or fpirits, and a box of 
fugar and a barrel of fine flour : this was furprifing 
to me, becaufe I had given over expefting any more 
provifions, except what was fpoiled by the water : I 
foon emptied the hogfhead of that bread, and wrapt 
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the fails, which 
I cut out : and, in a word, I got all this fafe on fhore 
alfo. 

The. next day I made another voyage ; and now, 
having plundered the fhip of what was portable and 
fit to hand out, I began with the cables ; and cutting 
the great cable into pieces, fuch as 1 could move, I 
got two cables and a hawfer on fhore, with all the 
iron-work I could get; and hawng cut down the 
fpritfail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing I 
could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all thofe 
heavy goods, and came away : but my good luck 
began now to leave me ; for this raft was fo unweildy 
and fo overladen, that after I was entered the little 
cave, where I had landed the reft of my goods, not 
being able to guide it fo handily as I did the other, it 
overfet, and threw me and all my cargo into the 
water. As for myfelf it was no great harm, for I was 
near the fhore ; but as to my cargo, it was great part 
of it loft, efpecially the iron, which I expefted would 
have been of great ufe to me : however, when the 
tide was out I got moft of the pieces of cable afhore ; 
and fome of the iron, though with infinite labour ; . 
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work 
which fatigued me very much. After this, I went 
every day on board, and brought away what I 
could get. 

F 3 I had 



70 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I had been now 1 3 days on fhore, and had been 
1 1 times on board the fhip ; in which time I had 
brought away all that one pair of hands could well be 
fuppofed capable to bring ; though I believe verily, 
had the calm weather held, I fhould have brought 
away the whole fhip, piece by piece : but preparing 
the 1 2th time to go on board, I found the wind 
began to rife ; however at low water I went on board, 
and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin fo 
effeftually, as that nothing more could be found, 
yet I difcovered a locker with drawers in it, in one 
of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of 
large fciffars, with fome ten or a dozen of good knives 
and forks ; in another I found about thirty-fix pounds 
value in money, fome European coin, fome Braftl^ 
fome pieces of eight, fome gold, fome filver. 

I fmiled to myfelf at the fight of this money. O 
Drug ! faid I, aloud, what art thou good for ? thou 
art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the 
ground : one of thofe knives is worth all this heap : I 
have no manner of ufe for thee, even remain where 
thou art and go to the bottom, as a creature whofe 
life is not worth favmg. However, upon fecond 
thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a 
piece of canvas, 1 began to think of making another 
raft ; but while I was preparing this, I found the Iky 
over-caft, and the wind began to rife, and in a 
quarter of an hour it blew a frefh gale from the fhore. 
It prefently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pre- 
tend to make a raft with the wind off fhore, and that 
it was my bufinefs to be gone before the tide of flood 
began, otherwife I might not be able to reach the 

fliore 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Jt 

fhore at all : accordingly I let myfelf down into the 
water, and fwam crofs the channel, which lay 
between the fliip and the fands, and even that with 
difficulty enough, partly with the weight of things I 
had about me^ and partly the roughnefs of the water; 
for the wind rofe very haftily, and before it was quite 
high water it blew a ftorm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I 
lay with all my wealth about me very fecure. It blew 
very hard all that night ; and in the morning when I 
looked out, behold no more fhip was to be feen : I was 
a little furprifed, but recovered myfelf with this 
fatisfaftory refleftion, 'viz. That I had loft no time* 
nor abated any diligence to get every thing out of her 
that could be ufeful to me ; and that indeed there was 
little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I 
had had more time, 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the fhip, 
or of any thing out of her, except what might drive 
on fliore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of 
her afterwards did ; but thofe things were of fmall 
ufe to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about 
fecuring myfelf againft either favages) if any fhould 
appear) or wild beafts, if any were in the ifland ; and 
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, 
and what kind of dwelling to make j whether I Ihould 
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the 
earth : and, in fhort, I refolved upon both, of the 
manner and defcription of which it may not be im- 
proper to give an account, 

I foon found the place I was in was not for my 
fettlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low 

F 4 mooriffi 



^2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

moorifli ground near the fea, and I believed would 
not be wholefome, and more particularly becaufe 
there was no frefh water near it ; fo I refolved to find 
a more healthy and more convenient fpot of ground. 

I coflfulted feveral things in my fituation which I 
found would be proper for me: ift. Health, and 
frefh water, I juft now mentioned, 2dly, Shelter 
from the heat of the fun. 3dly, Security from rave* 
nous creatures, whether man or beaft. 4thly, A view 
to the fea ; that if God fent any fliip in fight, I might 
not lofe any advantage for my deliverance, of which 
I was not willing to banifh all my expectation yet. 

In fearch of a place proper for this, I found a little 
plain on the fide of a rifing hill, whofe front towards 
this little plain was fteep as a houfe-fide, fo that 
nothing could come down upon me from the top ; on 
the fide of this rock there was a hollow place, worn a 
little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave ; but 
there was not really any cave or way into the rock 
at all. • 

On the flat of the green, juft before this hollow 
place, I refolved to pitch my tent : this plain was not 
above an hundred yards broad, and about twice as 
long, and lay like a green before my door, and at 
the end of it'defcended irregularly every way down 
into the low grounds by the fea-fide. It was on the' 
N.N. W. fide of the hill, fo that I was fheltered from 
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. fun, '' 
or thereabouts, which in thofe countries is near the 
fetting. 

Before I fet up my tent, I drew a half circle 
before the hollow place, which took in about ten 
yards in its femi-diameter from the rock, and 

twenty 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 73 

twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and 
ending. 

In this half circle I pitched two rows of ftrong 
flakes, driving them into the ground till they flood 
very firm, like piles, the biggeft end being out of the 
ground about five foot and a half, and fliarpened on 
the top ; the two rows did not ftand above fix inches 
from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in 
the fhip, and laid them in rows one upon another, 
within the circle between thefe two rows of flakes, up 
to the top, placing other flakes in the infide, leaning 
againft them, about two foot and a half high, like a 
fpur to a pofl ; and this fence was fo flrong, that 
neither man or beafl could get into it or over it : this 
cofl me a great deal of time and labour, efpecially to 
cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, 
and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a t 
door, but by a fliort ladder, to go over the top ( 
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me ; 
and fo I was compleatly fenced in, and fortified, as 
I thought, from all the world, and confequently flept 
fecure in the night, which otherwife I could not have 
done ; though, as it appeared afterward, there was no 
need of all this caution from the enemies that I appre- 
hended danger from. 

Into this fence or fortrefs, with infinite labour, 
I carried all my riches, all my provifions, ammu- 
nition and flores, of which you have the account 
above ; and I made me a large tent, which, to prefer ve 
me from the rains, that in one part of the year are 
very violent there, I made double, viz. one fmaller 

tent 



74 J^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

tent within, and one larger tent above it, and covered 
the uppermoft with a large tarpaulin which I had 
faved among the fails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which 
I had brought on fliore, but in a hammock, which 
was indeed a very good one, and belonged to the 
mate of the fhip. 

Into this tent I brought all my provifions, and 
every thing that would fpoil by the wet ; and having 
thus enclofed all my goods, I made up the entrance, 
which till now I had left open, and fo paffed and re- 
pafled, as I faid, by a fhort ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way 
into the rock ; and bringing all the earth and ftones 
that I dug down, out through my tent, I laid them 
up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, that fo 
it raifed the ground within about a foot and a half: 
and thus I made me a cave juft behind my tent, 
which ferved me like a cellar to my houfe. 

It coft me much labour, and many days, before 
all thefe things were brought to perfeflion, and 
therefore I muft go back to fome other things which 
took up fome of my thoughts. At the fame time it 
happened, after I had laidmy fcheme for the fetting up 
my tent, and making the cave, that a florm of rain 
falling from a thick dark cloud, a fuddcn flafh of 
lightning happened, and after that a great clap of 
thunder, as is naturally the efFea of it : I was not fo 
much furprized with the lightning, as I was with a 
a thought which darted into my mind as fvvift as the 
lightning itfelf: O my powder! my very heart funk 
within me, when I thought, that at one blaft all my 
powder might be deftroyed: on which, not my 

defence 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 75 

defence only, but the providing me food, as I 
thought, entirely depended ; I was nothing near fo 
anxious about my own danger; though had the 
powder took fire, I had never known who had 
hurt me. 

Such impreffion did this make upon me, that after 
the ftorm was over, I laid afide all my works, my 
building, and fortifying, and applied myfelf to make 
bags and boxes to feparate the powder, and to keep 
it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope, that what- 
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once ; 
and to keep it fo apart, that it fliould not be poffible 
to make one part fire another. I finifhed this work 
in about a fortnight ; and I think my powder, which in 
all was about 240 pounds weight, was divided in not 
lefs than a hundred parcels : as to the barrel that had 
been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, 
fo I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I 
called my kitchen ; and the reft I hid up and 
down in holes among the rocks, fo that no wet 
might come to it, marking very carefully where I 
laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I 
went out once at leaft every day with my gun, as 
well to divert myfelf, as to fee if I could kill any 
thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint 
myfelf with what the ifland produced. The firft 
time I went out I prefently difcovered that there 
were goats in the ifland, which was a great fatisfaftion 
to me J but then it^was attended with this misfortune 
to me, viz. that they were fo fhy, fo fubtle, and fo 
fwift of foot, that it was the moft difficult thing in the 
V^orld to come at them : but I was not difcouraged 

at 



y6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

at this, not doubting but I might now and then flioot 
one, as it foon happened ; for after I had found their 
haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them : 
I obferved, if they faw me in the valleys, though they 
were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a 
terrible fright ; but if they were feeding in the 
valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no 
notice of me : from whence I concluded, that by the 
pofition of their opticks, their fight was fo direded 
downward, that they did not readily fee objefts that 
were above them : fo afterward I took this method ; 
I always climbed the rocks firft, to get above them, 
and then had frequently a fair mark. The firft fhot 
I made among thefe creatures, I killed a fhe-goat, 
which had a little kid by her, which fhe gave fuck to, 
which grieved me heartily ; but when the old one 
fell, the kid ftood ftock ftill by her till I came and 
took her up ; and not only fo, but when I carried 
the old one with me upon my fhoulders, the kid 
followed me quite to my enclofure, upon which I 
laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, . : 
and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred "i" 
It up tame, but it would not eat, fo I was forced to . 
kill it and eat it myfelf : thefe two fupplied me with 
flefli a great while, for I eat fparingly ; and faved my 
provifions (my bread efpecially) as much as poffibly 
I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it 
abfolutely neceffary to provide a place to make a fire 
in, and fewel to burn ; and what I did for that, as 
alfo how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniencies 
I made, I fhall give a full account of in its place : 
but I Aauft firft give fome little account of myfelf, and 

of 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. *JJ 

of my thoughts about living, which it may well be 
fuppofed were not a few. 

I had a difmal profpeft of my condition ; for as 
I was not caft away upon that ifland without being 
driven, as is faid, by a violent ftoim quite out of the 
courfe of our intended voyage, and a great way, 'oi%. 
fome hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary courfe 
of the trade of mankind, I had great reafon to 
confider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this 
defolate place, and in this defolate manner, I fliould 
end my life. The tears would run plentifully down 
my face when I made thefe reflexions, and fometimes 
I would expoftulate with myfelf, why Providence 
fhould thus compleatly ruin his creatures, and render 
them fo abfolutely miferable, fo without help 
abandoned, fo entirely deprefled, that it could 
hardly be rational to be thankful for fuch a life. 

But fomething always returned fwift upon me to 
check thefe thoughts, and to reprove me; and 
particularly one day, walking with my gun in my 
hand by the fea-fide, I was very penfive upon the 
fubjeO: of my prefent condition, when reafon as 
it were expoflulating with me toother way, thus: 
Well, you are in a defolate condition, 'tis true ; but 
pray remember, where are the reft of you ? Did 
not you come eleven of you into the boat ? Where 
are the ten ? Why were they not faved and you loft ? 
Why were you fmgled out ? Is it better to be here or 
there ? and then I pointed to the fea. All evils are 
to be confidered with the good that is in them, and 
with what worfe attended them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was 
furniihed for my fubfiftence, and what would have 

been 



78 I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

been my cafe if it had not happened, lahich was an 
hundred thoufand to one^ that the fliip floated from 
the place where (he firft ftruck, and was driven fo 
near the fhore that I had time to get all thefe 
things out of her : what would have been my cafe 
if I had been to have lived in the condition in which 
I at firft came on fhore, without neceflfaries of life 
or neceflaries to fupply and procure them ? particularly 
faid I, aloiid, (though to myfelf) what fhould I have 
done without a gun, without ammunition, without 
any tools to make any thing, or to work with ; without 
clothes, bedding, a tent, or any manner of covering: 
and that now I had all thefe to a fufiicient quantity, 
and was in a fair way to provide myfelf in fuch a 
manner, as to live without my gun when my 
ammunition was fpent ; fo that I had a tolerable 
view of fubfifting, without any want, as long as I 
lived; for I confidered from the beginning how 
I fhould provide for the accidents that might happen 
and for the time that was to come, even not only 
after my ammunition fhould be fpent, but even after 
my health or ftrength fhould decay, 

I confefs I had not entertained' any notion of my 
ammunition being deftroyed at one blaft, I mean my 
powder being blown up by lightning ; and this made 
the thoughts of it fo furprifing to me when it 
lightened and thundered, as I obferved juft now. 

And now being about to enter into a melancholy 
relation of a fcene of filent life, fuch perhaps as was 
never heard of in the world before, I fhall take it from 
its beginning, and continue it inits order. ItwaSjbymy 
account, the 30th of September^ when, in the manner 
as abovefaid, I firft fet foot upon this horrid ifland, 
4 when 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 79 

'Vrhen the fun being, to us, in its autumnal equinox, 
was almoft juft over my head; for I reckoned myfelf, 
by obfervation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 
minutes north of the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, 
it came into my thoughts, that I Ihould lofe my 
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and 
ink, and fhould even forget the fabbath days from 
the working days ; but to prevent this, I cut it with 
my knife upon a large poft in capital letters, and 
making it into a great crofs, I fet it up on the fhore 
where I firft landed, viz. I came on Jhore here on the 
2,0th of Sept. 1659. Upon the fides of this fquare 
poft, I cut every day a notch with my knife, and 
every feventh notch was as long again as the reft, 
and every firft day of the month as long again 
as that long one; and thus I kept my calen- 
dar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of 
time. 

In the next place we are to obferve, that among 
the many things which I brought out of the fhip in 
the feveral voyages, which, as abovementioned, I 
made to it, I got feveral things of lefs value, but 
not all lefs ufeful to me, which I omitted fetting 
down before ; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper ; 
feveral parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, 
and carpenter's keeping ; three or four compaffes, 
fome mathematical inftruments, dials, perfpeftives, 
charts, and books of navigation, all which I huddled 
together, whether I might want them or no : alfo 
I found three very good bibles which came to me 
in my cargo from England^ and which I had 
packed up among my things ; fome Portugueze. books 

alfo. 



8o JLIFE AKD ADVENTURES 

alfo, and among them two or three popifh prayer- 
books, and feveral other books, all which I carefully 
fetured. And I muft not forget, that we had in the 
Ihip a dog and two cats, of whofe eminent hiftory 
1 may have occafion to fay fomething in its place ; 
for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the 
dog, he jumped out of the fhip of himfelf, and fwam 
on fhore to me the day after I went on fhore with 
my firft cargo, and was a trufty fervant to me many 
years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, 
nor any company that he could make up to me; 
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he 
could not do. As I obfery^sd before,! found pen, 
ink and paper, and I hufbarided them to the utmoft ; 
and I fhall ihew, that while my ink lafted, I kept 

] things very exaft ; but after that was gone, t could 

not ; for I could not make any ink, by any means 

,1 that I could devife. 

il. And this put me in mind that I wanted many 

things, notwithftanding all that I had amaffed 

j together; and of thefe this of ink was one, as alfo 

fpade, pick-axe and (hovel, to dig or remove the 

,! earth ; needles, pins, and thread ; as for linen 

I foon learned to want that without much diiEculty. 

I This vyant of tools made every work I did go on 

heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had 
entirely finiftied my little pale or furrouhded 
habitation: the piles or flakes, which were as 
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting 
and preparing in the woods, and more by far in 
bringing home ; fo that I fpent fometimes two days 
in cutting and bringing home one of thofe pofts, 
and a third day in driving it into the ground ; for 
I which 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 8 1 

which purpofe I got a heavy piece of wood at firft, 
but at laft bethought myfelf of one of the iron crows, 
which however, though I found it, yet it made driv- 
ing thofe pofts or piles very laborious and tedious work. 

But what need I have been concerned at the 
tedioufnefs of any thing I had to do, feeing I had 
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other 
employment if that had been over, at leaft, that I 
could forefee, except the ranging the ifland to feek 
for food, which I did more or lefs every day. 

I now began to confider ferioufly my condition, 
and the eircamftance I was reduced to, and I drew 
up the ftate of my affairs in writing, not fo much 
to leave them to any that were to come after me, for 
I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my 
thoughts froni daily poring upon them, and afflifting 
niy mind; and as my reafon began now to mafter 
my defpondency, I began to comfort myfelf as well 
as I could, and ito fet the good againft the evil, that 
J might have fomething to diftinguifh my cafe from

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted tefti- 
mony, that there was fcarce any condition in the 
world fo miferable, but there was fomething negative 
or fomething pofitive to be thankful for in it j and let 
this ftand as a diredlion from the experience of the 
moft miferable of all conditions in this world, that we 

may 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. S^ 

may always find in it fomething to comfort ourfelves 
from, and to fet in the defcription of good and evil, 
on the credit fide of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relifli 
my condition, and given over looking out to fea, 
to fee if I coiild fpy a fhip ; I fay, giving over thefe 
things, I began to apply myfelf to accommodate my 
way of living, and to make things as eafy to me as I 
could. 

I have already defcribed my habitation, which 
was a tent under the fide of a rock, /furrounded with 
a fl:rong pale of ports and cables, but I might now 
rather call it a wall, for I raifed a kind of wall up 
againft it of turfs, about two foot thick on the out* 
fide, and after fome time, I think it was a year and 
half, I raifed i afters from it, leaning to the rock, 
and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and 
fuch things as I could get to keep out the rain, 
which I found at fonie times of the year very 
violent. 

I have already obferved how I brought all my 
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I 
had made behind me : but I muft obferve too that 
at firft this was a confufed heap of goods, which as 
they lay in no order, fo they took up all my place, 
I had no room to turn myfelf j fo I fet myfelf to 
enlarge my cave and works farther into the earth ; 
for it was a loofe fandy rock, which yielded eafily to 
the labour I beftowed on it : and fo when I found I 
was pretty fafe as to hearts of prey, I worked fide- 
ways to the right hand into the rock ; and then, 
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and 

G 2 made 



§4 I-IFE AND ADVEN'KJRES 

made me a door to come out, on the outfide of my 
pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egrefs and regrefs, as it 
were a back-way to my tent and to my ftore-hbufe, 
but gave me room to ftow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myfelf to make fuch 
neCeflary things as I found I mofl: wanted, particularly 
a chair and a table ; for without thefe I was not able 
to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world ; I could 
not write or eat, or do feveral things with fo much 
pleafure without a table. 

So I went to work ; and here I muft needs obferve, 
that as reafon is the fubftance and original of the 
mathematicks, fo by ftating and*fquaring every 
thing by reafon, and by making the moft rational 
judgment of things, every man may be in time 
mafter of every mechanick art. I had never handled 
a tool in my life, and yet in time by labour, appli- 
cation and contrivance, I found at laft that I wanted 
i;iothing but I could have made it, efpecially if I had 
had tools ; however I made abundance of things, 
even without tools, and fome with no more tools 
than an adze' and a hatchet, which perhaps were 
never made that way before, and that with infinite 
labour : for example, if I wanted a board, I had no 
other way but to cut do\ATi a tree, fet it on an edge 
before me, and hew it flat on either fide with my 
axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, 
and then dub it fmooth with my adze. It is true, 
by this method I could make but one board out of 
a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but 
patience, any more than I had for the prodigious 

deal 




n.,.- >e ./ ■ ,■ ■ /U.{/,>, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

deal of time and labour which it took me up to make 
a plank or board: but my time or labour was 
little worth, and fo it was as w^ell employed one way 
as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I 
obferved above, in the firfl; place, and this I did out 
of the fliort pieces of boards which I brought on my 
raft from the fliip : but when I had wrought out 
fome boards, as above, I made large (helves, of the 
breadth of a foot and a half one over another, all 
along one fide of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, 
and iron-work, and, in a word, to feparate every 
thing at large in their places, that I might come 
eafily at them ; I knocked pieces into the wall of 
the rock to hang my guns and all things that would 
hang up. 

So that had my cave been to be feen, it looked 
like a general magazine of all neceffary things ; and 
I had every thing fo ready at my hand, that it was 
a great pleafure to me to fee all my goods in fuch 
order, and efpecially to find my ftock of all necef- 
faries fo great. 

And now it was that I began to keep a journal 
of every day's employment ; for indeed at firft I was 
in too much a hurry; and not only hurry as to 
labour, but in too much difcompofure of mind, and 
my journal would have been full of many dull things. 
For example, I muft have faid thus : Sept. the 30th, 
after I got to fliore, and had efcaped drowning, 
inftead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, 
having firft vomited with the great quantity of fait 
water which was gotten into' my ftomach, and 
recovering myfelf a little, I ran about the fhore, 

G 3 wringing 



86 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

wringing my hands, and beating my head and face, 
exclaiming at my mifery, and crying out, I was 
undone, undone ; till, tired and faint, I was forced to 
lie down on the ground to repofe, but durft not fleep 
for fear of being devoured. 

Some days after this, and after I had been on 
board the fhip, and got all that I could out of her, 
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a 
little mountain, and looking out to fea in hopes of 
feeing a fliip ; then fancy at a vaft diftance I fpied a 
fail ; pleafe myfelf with the hopes of it j and then, 
after looking fteadily till I was almoft blind, lofe it 
quite, and fit down and weep like a child, and thus 
increafe my mifery by my folly. 

But having gotten over thefe things In fome 
meafure, and having fettled my houfhold-ftufF and 
habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all 
as handfome about me as I could, I began to keep 
my journal, of which I Ihall here give you the copy 
(though in it will be told all thefe particulars over 
again) as long as it lafted ; for having no more ink, 
I was forced to leave it off. 

The journal. 

September 30, 1659/ 

I POOR miferable Robin/on Crufoe^ being fliip wreck- 
ed, during a dreadful ftorm, in the offing, came 
on ftiore on this difmal unfortunate ifland, which I 
called the JJland of Defpair^ all the reft of the ftiip's 
company being drowned, and myfelf almoft dead. 

All the reft of that day I fpent in affliding myfelf 
at the difmal circumftances I was brought to, viz^ I 

had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 87 

had neither food, houfe, clothes, weapon, or place 
to fly to, and in defpair of any relief, faw nothing 
but death before me, either that I fhould be devoured 
by wild beafts, murdered by favages, or ftarved to 
death for want of food. At the approach of night 
I flept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but flept 
foundly though it rained all night. 

06lober i. In the morning I faw, to my great 
furprife, the fliip had floated wilh the high tide, and 
was driven on fhore again much nearer the ifland, 
which as it was fome comfort on one hand, for feeing 
her fit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, 
if the wind abated, I might get on board, and get 
fome food and neceflaries out of her for my relief; 
fo on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the lofs 
of my comrades, who I imagined if we had all fl:aid 
on board might have faved the fliip, or at leaft that 
they would not have been all drowned, as they were ; 
and that, had the men been faved, we might perhaps 
have built us a boat out of the ruins of the fliip, to 
have carried us to fome other part of the world. I 
fpent great part of this day in perplexing myfelf on 
thefe things ; but at length, feeing the fliip almofl: dry, 
I went upon the fand as near as I could, and then 
fwam on board ; this day alfo it continued raining, 
though with no wind at all. 

From the ifl: of Odober to the 24th. All thefe 
days entirely fpent in making feveral voyages to 
get all I could out of the fliip, which I brought 
on fliore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much 
rain alfo in thefe days, though with fome intervals 
of fair weather : but, it feems, this was the rainy 
feafon. 

G 4 Oa. 20. 



88 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

OSl. 20. I overfet my raft, and all the goods I 
had got up upon it : but being in fhoal water, and 
the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of 
them when the tide was out. 

061. 25. It rained all night and all day, with 
fome gufts of wind, during which time the fhip 
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder 
than before, and was no more to be feen, except 
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I 
fpent this day in covering and fecuring the goods 
which I had faved, that rain might not fpoil 
them. 

Od. 26. I walked about the fhore almoft all day, 
to find out' a place to fix my habitation, greatly 
concerned to fecure myfelf from any attack in the 
night, either from wild beafts or men. Towards 
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and 
marked out a femi-circle for my encampment, which 
I refolved to ftrengthen with a work, wall, or forti- 
fication made of double piles, lined within with cable, 
and without with turf. 

From thq 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard 
in carrying all my goods to my new habitation, 
^though fome part of the time it rained exceeding 
^hard. 

The 31ft, in the morning, I went out into the 
iifland with my gun, to fee for fome food, and difcover 
the country ; when 1 killed a ftie-goat, and her kid 
followed me home ; which I afterwards killed alfo, 
becaufe it would not feed. 

November i. J fet up my tent under a rock, and lay 
there for the fifft night, making it as large as I could 
with flakes driven in to fwing my hammock upon. 

Nov^ 2 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

Not^. 2. I fet up all my chefts and boards, and 
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with 
them formed a fence round me, a little within the 
place I had marked out for my fortification. 
' Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed 
two fowls like ducks, which were very good 
food. In the afternoon went to work to make me 
a table. 

Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times 
of work, of going out with my gun, time of fleep, 
and time of diverfion*; viz. every morning I walked 
out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not 
rain, then employed myfelf to work till about eleven 
o^clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from 
twelve to two I lay down to fleep, the weather being 
exceffive hot, and then in the evening to work 
again : the working part of this day, and of the 
next, were wholly employed in making my table, 
for I was yet but a very forry workman, though 
time and neceffity made me a compleat natural 
mechanick foon after, as I believe it would do any 
one elfe. 

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and 
my dog, and killed a wild cat, her (kin pretty foft, 
but her flefh good for nothing ; every creature I 
killed I took off the Ikins and preferved them. 
Coming back by the fea-fliore I faw many forts of 
fea-fowls, which I did not underftand ; but was 
furprized and almoft frighted with two or three 
feals, which, while I was gazing at, not well 
knowing what they were, got into the fea, and 
efcaped me for that time* 

Nov. 6. 



90 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work 
with my table again, and finifhed it, though not to 
my liking J nor was it long before 1 learned to 
mend it. 

Nov* 7. Now it began to be fettled fair weather* 
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th, 
(for the I ith was Sunday) I took wholly up to make 
me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tole- 
rable fhape, but ijever to pleafe me ; and even in 
the making I pulled it in pieces feveral times. 
Nofte^ I foon neglefted my keeping Sundays^ for 
omittihg my mark for them on my poft, I forgot 
which was which. 

Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreflied me 
exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was accom- 
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which 
frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder : as 
foon ^ it was over I refolved to feparate my flock of 
powder into as many little parcels as poflible, that it 
might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. Thefe three days I fpent in 
making little fquare chefts or boxes, which might 
hold about a pound, or two pounds, at moft, of 
powder ; and fo putting the powder in, I flowed it 
in places as fecure and remote from one another as 
poflible. On one of thefe three days I killed a 
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent 
into the rock, to make room for my farther coave- 
niency. Note^ Three things I wanted exceedingly 
for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a fhovel, and a wheel* 

barrow 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 

barrow or bafket, fo I defifted from my work, and 
began to confider how to fupply that want, and make 
me fome tools : as for a pick-axe, I made ufe of the 
iron crows, which were proper enough, though 
heavy ; but the next thing was a fhovel or fpade ; 
this was fo abfolutely neceflary, that indeed I could 
do nothing effedlually without it j but what kind of 
one to make I knew not. 

Nov. 18. The next day in fearching the woods I 
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in 
the Brafih they call the Iron Tree^ for its exceeding 
hardnefs ; of this, with great labour and almoft 
fpoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it 
home too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding 
heavy. 

The exceffive hardnefs of the wood, and having 
no other way, made me a long while upon this 
machine ; for I v/orked it effeftually by little and 
little into the form of a fhovel or fpade, the handle 
exadly fhaped like ours in England^ only that the 
broad part having no iron fhod upon it at bottom, it 
would not lafl me fo long ; however it ferved well 
enough for the ufes which I had occafion to put it to ; 
but never was a fhovel, I believe, made after that 
fafhion, or fo long a making. 

I was ftill deficient, for 1 wanted a bafket or a 
wheel-barrow : a baflvet I could not make by any 
means, having no fuch things as twigs that would 
bend to make wicker ware, at leafl none yet found 
out ; and as to a wheel-barrow, 1 fancied I could 
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, 
neither did I know how to go about it ; befides, I 
had no poflible way to make the iron gudgeons for 

the 



92 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the fpindle or axis of the wheel to run. in, fo I gave 
it over ; and fo for carrying away the earth which I 
dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hodd 
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they 
fcrve the bricklayers. 

This was not fo difficult to me as the making the 
fhovel ; and yet this, and the (hovel, and the attempt 
which I made in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took 
me up no lefs than four days, I mean always except- 
ing my morning walk with my gun, which I feldom 
failed ; and very feldom failed alfo bringing home 
fomething to eat. 

Nov. 23. My other work having now flood ftill, 
becaufe of my making thefe tools, when they were 
finiflied I went on, and working every day, as my 
ftrength and time allowed, I fpent eighteen days 
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it 
might hold my goods commodioufly. 

Note^ During all this time, I worked to make this 
room or cave fpacious enough to accommodate me 
as a warehoufe or magazine, a kitchen, a dining, 
room, and a cellar ; as for my lodging, I kept to the 
tent, except that fometimes in the wet feafon of the 
year, it rained fo hard that I could not keep myfelf 
dry, which caufed me afterwards to cover all my 
place within my pale with long poles in the form of 
rafters, leaning againft the rock, and load them with 
flags and large leaves of trees like a thatch. 

December 10. I began now to think my cave or 
vault finiflied, when on a fudden (it feems I had 
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down 
from the top and one fide, fo much that in fliort it 
frighted me, and aot without reafon too ; for if I had 

been 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 93 

been under it I had never wanted a grave-digger : 
upon this difafter I had a great deal of work to do 
over again ; for I had the loofe earth to carry out, 
and, which was of more importance, I had the cieling 
to prop up, fo that I might be fure no more would 
come down, 

Dec. II. This day I went to work with it accord- 
ingly, and got two (hores or pofts pitched upright to 
the top, with two pieces of boards a-crofs over each 
poft ; this I finiflied the next day j and fetting more 
pofts up with boards, in about a week more I had 
the roof fecured ; and the pofts, ftanding in rows, 
ferved me for partitions to part off my houfe. 

Dec. 1 7. From this day to the twentieth I placed 
fhelves, and knocked up nails on the pofts to hang 
every thing up that could be hung up j and now I 
began to be in fome order within doors » 

Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave 
and began to furnifti my houfe, and fet up fome 
pieces of boards, like a dreffer, to order my victuals 
upon ; but boards began to be very fcarce with me : 
alfo I made me another table. 

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day ; no 
ftirring out. 

Dec. 25. Rain all day. 

Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than 
before, and pleafanter. 

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, 
fo that I caught it, and led it home in a ftring; when 
I had it home, I bound and fplintered up its leg, 
which was broke. N. B. I took fuch care of it, 
that it lived, and the leg grew well and as firong as 
ever J but by nurfing it fo long it grew tame, and

fed .upon the little green at my door, and would not 
go away : this was the firft time that I entertained a 
thought of breeding up fome tame creatures, that 
I might have food when my powder and fliot was 
all fpent, 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze; 
fo that there was no ftirring abroad, except in the 
evening for food : this time J fpent in putting all my 
things in order within doors. 

January i. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad early 
and late with my gun, and lay ftill in the middle of 
the day. This evening, going farther into the 
valleys, which lay towards the centre of the ifland, 
I found there was plenty of goats, though exceeding 
fliy and hard to come at ; however I refolved to try 
if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down. 

Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out 
with my dog, and fet him upon the goats ; but I was 
miftaken, for they all faced about upon the dog j and 
he knew his danger too well, for he would not come 
near them. 

Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall ; which, being 
ftill jealous of my being attacked by fomebody, I 
refolved to make very thick and ftrong. 

N. B. This wall being defcribed before^ I 
furpofely omit what was /aid in the journal ; 
it is fufficient to obferve^ that I was no lefs 
time than from the ^d ^January to the 14th 
of April, workings Jinijhing^ and perfeding 
this wally though it was no more than about 
24 yards in lengthy being a half circle from 
one place in the rock to another place about 
eight yards from ity the door of the cave being 

in the centre behind itn 

All 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

All this time I worked very hard, the rains 
hindering me many days, nay, fometimes weeks 
together j but 1 thought I fhould never be perfeftly 
fecure until this wall was finifhed ; and it is fcarce 
credible what inexpreflible labour every thing was 
done with, efpecially the bringing piles out of the 
woods, and driving them into the ground, for I 
made them much bigger than I need to have done. 

When this wall was finifhed, and the out-fide 
double fenced with a turf-wall raifed up clofe to it, 
I perfuaded myfelf that if any people were to come 
on fhore there, they would not perceive any thing 
like a habitation ; and it was very well I did fo, as may 
be obferved hereafter upon a very remarkable occafion. 

During this time I made my rounds in the woods 
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and 
made frequent difcoveries in thefe walks of fomething 
or other to my advantage ; particularly I found a 
kind of wild pigeons, who built not as wood 
pigeons, in a tree, but rather as houfe. pigeons, in 
the holes of the rocks ; and taking fome young ones, 
I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did fo ; 
but when they grew older they flew away, which 
perhaps was at firft for want of feeding them, for I 
had nothing to give them ; however I frequently 
foimd their nefls, and got their young ones, which 
were very good meat. 

And now, in the managing my houfliold affairs, I 
found myfelf wanting in many things, which I 
thought at firfl it was impoflible for me to make, as 
indeed as to fome of them it was ; for inflance, I 
could never make a cafk to be hooped: I had a fmall 
rxmlet or two, as I obferved before, but I could never 
2 arrive 



96 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though 
I fpent many weeks about it ; I could neither put in 
the heads, or joint the ftaves fo true to one another 
as to make them hold water; fo I gave that alfo over. 

In the next place, I was at a great lofs for candle ; 
fo that as foon as ever it was dark, which was gene- 
rally by feven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed : I 
remembered the lump of bees-wax with which I made 
candles in my African adventure, but I had none of, 
that now ; the only remedy J had, was, that when I 
had killed a goat I faved the tallow, and with a Uttle 
difli made of clay, which I baked in the fun, to which 
I added a wick of fome oakum, I nuade me a lamp ; 
and this gave me light, though not a clear fteady 
light like a candle. In the middle of all my labours 
it happened, that rummaging my things, I found a 
little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled 
with corn for the feeding of poultry — not for this 
voyage, but before, as I fuppofe, when the (hip 
came from Lijbon ; what little remainder of corn had 
been in the bag, was all devoured with the rats, and 
I faw nothing in the bag but hufks and duft ; and 
being willing to have the bag for fome other ufe, I 
think it was to put powder in, when I 4ivided it for 
fear of the lightning, or fome fuch ufe, I (hook the 
hufks of corn out of it on one fide of my fortification 
under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rains, juft now men- 
tioned, that I threw this ftuflf away, taking no notice 
of any thing, and not fo much as remembering that I 
had thrown any thing there ; when about a month 
after, or thereabout, I faw fome few ffalks of fome- 
thing green (hooting out of the ground, which I 

fancied 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

fancied might be fome plant I had not feen j but I 
was farprized and perfeOily aftonifhed, when after a 
little longer time I faw about ten or twelve ears 
come out, which were perfeft green barley of the 
fame kind as our European, nay, as our Englijh 
barley. 

It is impoffible to exprefs the aftonifliment and 
confufion of my thoughts on this occafion ; I had 
hitherto aflred upon no religious foundation at all j 
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my 
head, or had entertained any fenfe of any thing that 
had befallen me, otherwife than as a chance, or, asi 
we lightly fay, what pleafes God ; without fo much 
as enquiring into the end of Providence in thefe 
things, or his order in governing events in the world : 
but after I faw barley grow there, in a climate which 
I knew was not proper for corn, and efpecially that 
I knew not how it came there, it ftartled me 
ftrangely ; and I began to fuggeft, that God had mira- 
. culoufly caufed this grain to grow without any help 
of feed fown, and that it was fo directed purely for 
my fuftenance on that wild miferable place. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears 
out of my eyes, and I began to blefs myfelf, that 
fuch a prodigy of nature fliould happen upon my 
account ; and this was the more ftrange to me, 
becaufe I faw near it ftill, all along by the fide of the 
rock, fome other ftragling ftalks, which proved to 
be ftalks of rice, and which I knew, becaufe I had 
feen it grow in Africa^ when I was afliore there. 

I not only thought thefe the pure produflions of 
Providence for my fupport, but not doubting but 
that there was more in the place, I went all over 

Vol. I. H that 



98 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

that part of the ifland, where I had been before, peeping 
in every corner and under every rock to fee for more, 
of it, but I could not find any; at laft it occurred 
to my thought, that I had ftiook a bag of chickens meat 
out in that place, and then the wonder began to ceafe ; 
and I muft confefs,my religious thankfulnefs to God's 
providence began to abate too, upon difcovering 
that all this was nothing but what was common ; 
though I ought to have been as thankful for fb 
ftrange and unforefeen a providence as if it had been 
miraculous; for it was really the work of Providence 
as to me, that fhould order or appoint lo or 12; 
grains of corn to remain unfpoiled, when the rats 
had dellroyed all the reft, as if it had been dropt 
from heaven : as alfo, that I Ihould throw it out in 
that particular place, where, it being in the fhade of 
a high rock, it fpjran^ up immediately ; whereas if I 
had thrown it any where elfe at that time, it had been 
burnt up and deftroyed. 

I carefully faved the ears of corn, you may be 
fure, in their feafon, which was about the end of 
June^ and laying up every corn, I refolved to fow 
them all again, hoping in time to have fome quantity 
fufficient to fupply me with bread j but it was not till 
the fourth year that I could allow myfelf the leaft grain 
of this corn to eat, and even then but fparingly, as I 
fliall fay afterwards in its order ; for I loft all that I 
fowed the firft feafon, by not obferving the proper 
time ; for I fowed it juft before the dry feafon, fo 
that it never came up at all, at leaft not as it would 
have done : of which in its place. 

Befideg this barley, there were, as above, 20 or 2^0 
ftalks of rice, which I preferycd with the fame care, 

and 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 99 

and whofe ufe was of the fame kind or to the fame 
purpofe, viz. To make me bread, or rather food ; 
for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though 
I did that alfo after fome time. But to return to 
my journal. 

I worked exceffive hard thefe three or four months 
to get my wall done; and the 14th of -rf/r/7I clofed 
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but 
over the wall by a ladder, that there might be no 
fign in the outfide of my habitation. 

April 16. I finiihed the ladder, fo I went up with 
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, 
and let it down on the infide : this was a compleat 
enclofure to me ; for within I had room enough, and 
nothing could come at me from without, unlefs it 
could firft mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finiflied, I 
had almoft had all my labour overthrown at once, 
and myfelf killed j the cafe was thus : As I was bufy 
in the infide of it, behind my tent, juft in the 
entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a^ 
moft dreadful furprizing thing indeed ; for on a 
fudden I found the earth come crumbling down from 
the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, 
over my head, and two of the pofts I had fet up in 
the cave cracked in a frightful manner: I was 
heartily feared, but thought nothing of what was 
really the caufe, only thinking that the top of my 
cave was falling in, as fome of it had done before ; 
and for fear I fliould be buried in it, I ran forward 
to my ladder ; and not thinking myfelf fafe there 
neither, 1 got over my wall for fear of the pieces of 
the hill which I expefted might roll down upon me : 

H 2 I was 



lOO LIFE AND ADVENTURIIS 

I was no fooner ftept down upon the firm ground, 
but I plainly faw it was a terrible earthquake, for the 
ground I flood on fhook three times at about eight 
minutes diftance, with three fuch ihocks, as would 
have overturned the ftrongeft building that could be 
fuppofed to have flood on the earth ; and a great 
piece of the top of a rock, which flood about half a 
mile from me next the fea, fell down with fuch a 
terrible noife as I never heard in all my life: I per- 
ceived alfo the very fea was put into violent motion 
by it ; and I believe the fhocks were flronger under 
the water than on the ifland. 

I was fo amazed with the thing itfelf, having never 
felt the like, or difcourfed with any one that had, 
that I was like one dead or flupified ; and the motion 
of the earth made my flomach fick, like one that was 
tojQTed at fea ; but the noife of the falling of the rock 
awaked me, as it were, and roufing me from the 
flupified condition I was in, filled me with horror, 
and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling 
upon my tent, and all my houfhold goods, and 
burying all at once; and this funk my very foul 
within me a fecond time. 

After the third fhock was over, and I felt no more 
for fome time, I began to take courage, and yet I had 
not heart enough to get over my Wall again, for fear 
of being buried alive, but fat flill upon the ground, 
greatly cafl down and difconfolate, not knowing 
what to do : all this while I had not the leafl ferious 
religious thought, nothing but the common. Lord 
have merqy upon me ; and when it was over, that 
went away too. 

While 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. lOl 

While I fat thus, I found the air over-caft, and 
grow cloudy, as if it would rain ; foon after that 
the wind rofe by little and little, fo that in lefs than 
half an hour it blew a moft dreadful hurricane : the 
fea was all on a fudden covered over with foam and 
froth, the fliore was covered with the breach of 
the water, the trees were torn up by the roots, 
and a terrible ftorm it was j and this held about 
three hours, and then began to abate, and in two 
hours more it was ftark calm, and began to rain 
very hard. 

All this while I fat upon the ground, very much 
terrified and dejeded, when on a fudden it came 
into my thoughts, that thele winds and rain being 
the confequence of the earthquake, the earthquake 
itfelf was fper\t and over, and I might venture into 
my cave again : with this thought my fpirits began 
to revive, and the rain alfo helping to perfuade me, 
I went in and fat down in my tent, but the rain was 
fo violent, that my tent was ready^tn hp.beaten down 
with it ; and I waT^TForced to go into my cave, 
though very much afraid and uneafy, for fear it fliould '\ 
fall on my head. "^ - \ 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz^ 
to cut a hole through my new fortification like a fink, 
to let water go out, which would elfe have drowned 
my cave. After I had been in my cave fome time, and 
found ftill no more fhocks of the earthquake follow, 
I began to be more compofed ; and now, to fupport 
my fpirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I 
went to my little ftore, and took a fmall fup of rum 
which however I did then, and always, very fparingly^ 
knowing I could have no more when that was gone* 

H 3 It 



162 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

It continued raining all that night, and great part 
of the next day, fo that I could not ftir abroad ; but 
my mind being more compofed, I began to think of 
what I had beft do, concluding, that if the ifland 
was fubjefl: to thefe earthquakes, there would be no 
living for rae in a cave, but I muft confider of build- 
ing me fome little hut in an open place, which I 
might furround with a wall as I had done here, and 
fo make myfelf fecure from wild beafls or men : but 
concluded, if I ftaid where I was, I fliould certainly, 
one time or other, be buried alive. 

With thefe thoughts I refolved to remove my tent 
from the place where it flood, which was juft under 
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it 
fliould be fhaken again, would certainly fall upon my 
tent : and I fpent the two next days, being the 19th 
.and 20th oi Aprils in contriving where and how to 
remove my habitation. 

The fear of being fwallowed up alive, made me 
that I never flept in quiet ; and yet the apprehenfion 
of lying abroad, without any fence, was almoft equal 
to it } but ftill, when I looked about and faw how 
every thing was put in order, how pleafantly con- 
cealed I was, and how fafe from danger, it made 
rate very loth to remove. 

In the mean time it occurred to me that it would 
require a vaft deal of time for me to do this, and that 
I muft be contented to run the venture where I was, 
till I had formed a camp for myfelf, and had fecured 
it fo as to remove to it : fo with this refolution I 
compofed myfelf for a time, and refolved that I would 
go to work with all fpeed to build me a wall with piles 
and cables, l5fc. m a circle as before ; and fet my 

tent 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfi* ^lOJ 

tent Up in it when it was finiflied, but that I would 
venture to flay where I was till it was finifhed and fit 
to remove to* This was the 21ft. 

April 22. The next morning I began to confider 
of means to put this refolve in execution, but I was 
at a great lofs about my tools ; I had three large 
axes and abundance of hatchets, (for we carried the 
hatchets for traffick with the Indians) but with much 
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were 
all full of notches and dull, and though I had a grinds 
ftone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too : 
this coft me a$ much thought as a ftatefman would 
have beftowed upon a grand point of politicks, or 1 
judge upon the life and death of a man. At length 
I contrived a wheel with a ftring, to turn it with my 
foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty* 
Note J I had never feen any fuch thing in England^ or 
at leaft not to take notice how it was done, though 
lince I have obferved it is very common there; 
befides that, my grind-ftone was very large and 
heavy. This machine coft me a full week's work to 
bring it to perfeftion. 

April 28, 29. Thefe two whole days I took up 
in grinding my tools, my machine for turning my 
grind-ftone performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been 
low a great while, now I took a furvey of it, and 
reduced myfelf to one bifcuit ciake a day, which 
made my heart very heavy. 

May I. In the morning, looking towards the fea* 
fide, the tide being low, I faw fcmiething lie on the 
(hore bigger than ordinary ; and it looked like a ca(k. 
When I came to it, I found a fmall barrel, and two 

H 4 or 



I04 LII'E AND ADVENTURES 

or three pieces of the wreck of* the fliip, "which 
were driven on fhore by the late hurricane; 
and looking towards the wreck itfelf, I thought it 
feemed to lie higher out of the water than it ufed 
to do : I examined the barrel which was driven on 
Ihore, and foon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, 
but it had taken water, and the powder was caked 
as hard as a ftone; however I rolled it farther on fhore 
for the prefent, and went on upon the fands as near as 
I could to the wreck of the fliip, to look for more. 

When I came down to the fhip, I found it ftrangely 
removed; the fore-caftle, which lay before buried 
in fand, was heaved up at lead fix foot j and the 
ftern, which was broke to pieces, and parted from 
the reft by the force of the fea, foon after I had left 
rummaging her, was toffed, as it were, up, and caft 
on one fide, and the fand was thrown fo high on 
that fide next hen ftern, that whereas there was a 
great place of water before, fo that I could not come 
within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without 
fwimming, I could, now walk quite up to her when 
the tide was out. I was furprized with this at firft, 
but foon concluded it muft be done by the earth- 
quake: and as by this violence the fhip was more, 
broken open than formerly, fo many things came 
, daily on fhore, which the fea had loofened, and which 
the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the defign 
of removing my habitation ; and I bufied myfelf 
mightily that day efpecially, in fearching whether I 
could make any way into the fhipj but I found 
nothing was to be expedked of that kind, for that 
all the infide of the fhip was choked up with fand : 

however, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I05 

however, as I had learnt not to defpair of any thing, 
I refolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could 
of the fhip, concluding, that every thing I could get 
from her would be of fome ufe or other to me. 

May 3. I began with my faw, and cut a piece of a 
beam through, which I thought held feme of the 
upper part or quarter-deck together ; and when I had 
cut it through, I cleared away the fand as well as I 
could from the fide which lay higheft ; but the 
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for 
that time* 

May 4. I went a fifliing, but caught not one fifh 
that I durft eat of, till I was weary of my fport ; when 
juft going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I 
had made me a long line of fome rope yarn, but I had 
no hooks, yet I frequently caught fifli enough, as 
much as I cared to eat j all which I dried in the fun, 
and eat them dry. 

May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam 
afunder, and brought three great fir planks off from 
the decks, which I tied together, and made fwim 
on fhore when the tide of flood came on. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck, got feveral iron 
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work; 
worked very hard, and came home very much tired, 
and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an 
intent not to work, but found the weight of the 
wreck had broke itfelf down, the beams being cut, 
that feveral pieces of the fhip feemed to lie loofe j 
and the infide of the hold lay fo open, that I could 
fee into it, but almofl full of water and fand. 

May 8. 



IC6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron 
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now 
quite clear of the water or fand ; I wrenched open 
two planks, and brought them on fliore alfo with 
the tide: I left the iron croW in the wreck for 
next day. 

May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow 
#made way into the body of the wreck, and felt 
feveral calks, and loofened them with the crow, 
but could not break them up ; I felt alfo the roll of 
Englijh lead, and could ilir it, but it was too heavy 
to remove. 

May 10, II, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the 
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber, 
and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred 
weight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I 
could not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by 
placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it 
with the other ; but as it lay about a foot and a half 
in the water, I could not make any blow to drive 
the hatchet. 

May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and 
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the 
water; but I (laid fo long in the woods to get 
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going 
to the wreck that day. 

May 1 7. I faw fome pieces of th^ wreck blown 
on fhore, at a great diftance, near .two miles off 
me, but refolved to fee what they were, and found 
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to 
bring away. 

May 24. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I07 

May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the 
•wreck, and with hard labour I loofened fome things 
fo much with the crow, that the firft blowing tide 
feveral caflcs floated out, and two of the feamen's 
chefts; but the wind blowing from the fliore^ 
nothing came to land that day but pieces of 
timber, and a hogfliead, which had fome Brazil 
pork in it, but the falt-water and the fand had 
fpoiled it. 

I continued this work every day to the 15th of 
^une^ except the time neceflary to get food, which 
I always appointed, during this part of my employ- 
ment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be 
ready when it was ebbed out ; and by this time I 
had gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work enough 
to have built a good boat, if I had known how ; and 
alfo, I got at feveral times, and in feveral pieces, 
near 1 00 weight of the Iheet-lead^ 

"June 16. Going down to the feafide, I found a 
large tortoife or turtle ; this was the firft I had feen, 
which it feems was only my misfortune, not any 
defed of the place, or fcarcity ; for had I happened 
to be on the other fide of the ifland, I might have 
had hundreds of them every day; as I found 
afterwards ; but perhaps had paid dear enough for 
them. 

yune 1 7- I fpent in cooking the turtle ; I found 
in her threefcore eggs ; and her flefh was to me at 
that time the moft favoury and pleafant that ever 
I tafted in my life, having had no flefh, but of 
goats and fowls, fmce I landed in this horrid

when I was not, I was fo ignorant that I knew not

Lord pity me ; Lord have mercy upon me : I fuppofe 
I did nothing elfe for two or three hours, till the fit 
wearing off, I fell afleep, and did not wake till far in 
the night J when I waked, I found myfelf much 
refrefhed, but weak, and exceeding thirfty : how- 
ever, as I had no water in my whole habitation, 
I was forced to lie till morning, and went to 
fleep again : In this fecond fleep I had this terrible 
dream. 

I thought that I was fitting on the ground on 
the out-fide of my wall, where I fat when the ftorm 
blew after the earthquake, and that I faw a man 
defcend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame 
of fire, and light upon the ground : He was all over 
as bright as a flame, fo that I could but juft bear to 
look towards him j his countenance was mofl inex- 
preffibly dreadful, impoflible for words to defcribe ; 
when he flepped upon the ground with his feet 
I thought the earth trembled, jufl as it had done 
before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to 
my apprehenfion as if it had been filled with flalhes 
of fire. 

He was no fooner landed upon the earth, but he 
moved forward towards me, with a long fpear or 
weapon in his hand to kill me ; and when he cam6 
to a rifing ground, at fome diflance, he fpoke to 
me, or I heard a voice fo terrible, that it is impoflible 
to exprefs the terror of it ; all that I can fay I 
underfl:ood was this. Seeing all thefe things have not

which words I thought he lifted up the fpear that 
was in his hand to kill me. 

No one, that (hall ever read this account, will 
cxpeft that I fhould be able to defcribe the horrors 
of my foul at this terrible vifion ; I mean, that evett 
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of thofe 
horrors ; nor is it any more poffible to defcribe the 
impreffion that remained upon my mind, when I 
awaked, and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had 
received by the good inftruftion of my father was 
then worn out by an uninterrupted feries, for eight 
years, of fea-faring wickednefs, and a conftant 
converfation with nothing but fuch as were like 
myfelf, wicked and prophane to the laft degree: 
I do not remember that I had in all that time one 
thought that fo much as tended either to looking 
upwards toward God, or inwards toward a refleftion 
upon my own ways : but a certain ftupidity of foul, 
without defire of good, or confcience of evil, had 
entirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the moft 
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our 
common failors can be fuppofed to be, not having 
the lead fenfe, eitherof the fear of God in danger, or 
of thankfulnefs to God in deliverances. 

In the relating what is already paft of my ftoty, 
this will be the more eafdy believed, when I (hall 
add, that through all the variety of miferies that 
had to this day befallen me, I never had fo much 
as one thought of it being the hand of God, or 
that it was a juft puni(hmait for my fin, my 
rebellious behaviour againft my father, or my 
4 prefent 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ill 

prefent fins, which were great ; or fo much as a 
punifliment for the general courfe of my wicked 
life. When I was on the defperate expedition on 
the defart fhores of Africa^ I never had fo much as 
9ne thought of what would become of me ; or one 
wifh to God to direft me whither I fhould go, or 
to keep me from the danger which apparently 
fiirrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as 
cruel favages: but I was merely thoughtlefs of a 
God, or a Providence, a£):ed like a mere brute from 
the principles of nature, and by the diftates of com« 
mon fenfe only, and indeed hardly that. 

When I was delivered, and taken up at fea by the 
Portugal captain, well ufed, and dealt juftly and 
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the 
lead thankfulnefs on my thoughts: when again I 
was fhipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning 
on this ifland, I was as far from remorfe, or looking 
on it as a judgment ; I only faid to myfelf often, 
that I was an unfortunate dog^ and bom to be always 
miferable. 

It is true, when I got on Ihore firft here, and 
found all my fhip's crew drowned, and myfelf 
fpar^d, I was furprifed with a kind of extafy, and- 
fome tranfports of foul, \«4iich, had the grace of 
God affifted, might have come up to true thank- 
fulnefs ; but it ended where it begun, in a mere 
common flight of joy, or, as I may fay, being glad 
I was alive^ without the leaft refleflion upon the 
diflinguifhing goodnefs of the hand which had 
preferved me, and had fingled me out to be pre- 
ferved, when all the reft were deftroyed ; or an 
inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to

xne; even juft the fame common fort of joy which 
feamen generally have, after they have got fafe 
on fhore from a fliipwreck, which they drown all in 
the next bowl of punch, and forget almoft as 
foon as it is over j and all the reft of my life was 
like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due conlidera- 
tion, made fenfible of my condition ; how I was 
caft on this dreadful place, out of the reach of 
human kind, out of all hope of relief, or profpefl: of 
redemption ; as foon as I faw but a profpeft of living, 
and that I fliould not ftarve and perifli for hunger, 
all the fenfe of my afflidtion wore off, and I began 
to be very eafy, applied myfelf to the works proper 
for my prefervation and fupply, and was far enough 
from being afflifted at my condition, as a judgfnent 
from heaven, or as the hand of God againft me : 
thefe were thoughts which very feldom entered into 
my head. 

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my 
journal, had at firft fome little influence upon me, 
and began to affeft me with ferioufnefs, as long as I 
thought it had fomething miraculous in it ; but as 
foon as ever that part of thought was removed, all 
the impreflion which was raifed from it wore oflf 
alfo, as I have noted already. 

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be 
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately 
directing to the invifible power, which alone direfts 
fuch things ; yet ho fooner was the firft fright over, 
but the impreflion it had made went off alfo. I 
had no more fenfe of God, or his judgments, much 
lefs of the prefent afl[li6tion of my circumftances being 

from 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* It^ 

from his hand, than if I had been in the moft 
profperous condition of life. 

But now, when I began to be lick, and a leifurely 
view of the miferies of death came to place itfelf 
before me ; when my fpirits begun to fink under the 
burden of a ftrong diftemper, and nature was 
exhaufted with the violence of the fever ; confcience, 
that had flept fo long, began to awake, and I began 
to reproach myfelf with my paft life, in which I 
had fo evidently, by uncommon wickednefs, pro* 
yoked the juftice of God to lay me under 
uncommon ftrokes, and to deal with me in fo 
vindidive a manner. 

Thefe refledions oppreffed me from the fecond or 
third day of my diftemper, and in the violence, as 
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my 
confcience, extorted fome words from me, like 
praying to' God, though I cannot fay they were 
either a prayer attended with defires, or with hopes ; 
it was rather the voice of mere fright and diftrefs : 
my thoughts were confufed, the convidions great 
upon my mind, and the horror of dying in fuch a 
miferable condition, raifed vapours into my head 
with the mere apprehenfions ; and, in thefe hurries 
of my foul, I knew not what my tongue might 
exprefs : But it was rather exclamation ; fuch as. 
Lord ! what a miferable creature am I ! If I fhould 
be fick, I ihall certainly die for want of help, and 
what will become of me ? Then the tears burft 
out of my eyes, and I could fay no more for a 
good while. 

In this interval the good advice of my father 
came to my mind, and prefently his prediction. 

Vol; L I which 



114 LIF£ AND AbVEKTUREd 

which 1 mentioned in the beginning of this ftory j 
^iz. That if I did take this foolifli ftep, God would 
not blefs me, and I would have leifure hereafter to 
refleft upon having negkfted his counfelj when 
there might be none tb aflift in my . recovery. 
Now, faid I aloud, my dear father*s words arfe come 
to pafs : God's juftice has overtaken me, iand I have 
none to help or hear me ; I rejefted the voice of 
Providence, which had mercifully put me in a pofture 
or ftatioh of life whef ein I might have been happy 
and eafy; but I would neither fee it myfelf, ndr 
learn to know the bleffing of it from my parents ; 
I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am 
left to mourn under the confequenCes of it : I refufed 
their help and affiftance, who would have liftied me 
into the world, and would have made every thing 
eafy to me ; and now I have difficulties to ftruggle 
with, too great for even nature itfelf to fupport, 
and no affiftance, no help, no comfort, no advice. 
Then I cried out. Lord, be my help, for I am in 
great diftrefs ! 

This was the firfi: prayer, if I might call it fo^ 
tliat I had made for many years. But I return 16 
my journal. 

yu:2e 28. Having been fomewhat refrefhed with 
the fleep t had had, and the fit being entirely off, I 
got up: and though the fright and terror of my 
dream was very great, yet I confidered, that the fit 
of the ague would return again the next day, and 
now was my time to get foiriething to refrefh and 
fupport myfelf when I fliould be ill j and the firft 
thing I did, 1 filled a large fquare cafe bottle with 
water, and fet it upon my table, in reach of my bed ; 

and 



OF ItOBIKSOK CRUSOE* I15 

And to take off the chill or aguifh difpofition of the 
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, 
and mixed them together : then I got me a piece of 
the goat's flefh) and broiled it on the coals^ but 
could eat very little. I walked about, but was very 
weak, and, withal, very fad and heavy-hearted under 
a fenfe of my miferable condition, dreading th^ 
retul-n of my diftemper the next day : at night I 
made my fupper of three of the turtle's eggs, which 
I roafted in the afhes, and eat, as we call it, in the 
fhell ; and this was the firft bit of meat I had ever 
alked God's blefGng to, even, as 1 could remember^ 
in my whole life. 

After I had eaten 1 tried to walk; but found 
myfelf fo weak, that I could hardly carry the gun 
(for I never went out without that;) fo I went 
but a little way, and fat down upon the ground, 
looking out upon the fea, which was juft before mc, 
and very calm and fmooth. As 1 fat here, fome 
fuch thoughts as thefe occurred to me :— 

What is the earth and fea, of which I have feen fo 
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I, 
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human 
and brutal ; whence are we ? 

Sure we are all made by fome fecret power, who 
formed the earth and fea, the air and fky ; and who 
is that ? 

Then it followed, mofl: naturally : it is God that has 
made it all. Well, but then it came on ftrangely ; if 
God has made all thefe things, he guides and governs 
them all, and all things that concern them ; for the 
Being that could make all things, muft certainly 
have power to guide and direft them.

If foj' nothing can happen in the great circuit of

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, 
lie knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful 
condition; and if nothing happens without hi*

Nothing occurred to mj thoughts t6 contradiiS: 
any of thefe conclufions } and therefore it refted 
upon me with the greater force, that it muft needs 
"be, that God had appointed all this to befal me ; 
that I was brought to this miferable circufiiftance by 
his diredion, he having the fole power, not of me 
only, but of every thing that happened in the worlds 
Immediately it followed, 

Why has God done this to me ? Wl^athave I done to be 
thus ufed? 

My confcience prefently checked me in that 
inquiry, as if I had blafphemed ; and methought it 
fpoke to me, like a voice; Wretch! doft thou ajk 
what thou hajl done ? Look back upon a dreadful 
mif-pent life, and afk thyfelf vjhat thou hajl not done? 
Afk, why is it that thou weft not- lojig ago dejlroyed?

have I done ? 

I was ftruck with thefe reflexions as one 
aftonifhed, and h^d not a word' to fay, no, not to 
anfwer to myfelf; but rbfe up penfive and fad, 
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my 

wall* 



OF ROBINSON CJlUSOEf JI/ 

wall, as if I h^d been going to bed ; but my thoughts 
were fadly difturbed, and I had no inclination to . 
fleep; fo I fat down in my chair, and lighted my 
lamp, for it began to b^ dark. Now, as the 
apprehenfions of the return of my diftemper terrified 
me very much, it occurred tp jny thought, that the 
BrqftHans take no phyfic but their tpbacco, for 
almoft all diftempers ; and I had a piece of ^ roll 
of tobacco in one of the chefts, which was quite 
cured, and fome alfp that was green, and not quite 
cured. 

I went, direded by Heaven, no doubt ! for in this 
chefl: I found a cure both for foul and body ! I opened 
the cheft, and found what I looked for, viz. the 
tobacco ; and as the few books I had faved lay there 
too, I took out one of the bibles which I mentioned 
before, and which, to this time, I had not found 
leifure, or fo much as inclination, to look into ; I 
lay I took it oiit, and brought both that and the 
tobacco with me to the table. 

What ufe to ipake of the tobacco I knew not, 
as to my diftemper, or whether it was good for it or 
no ; but I tried feveral experiments with it, as if I 
refolved it fhould hit pne \vay pr other: I firft 
took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, 
which indeed at firft almoft ftupified my train, the 
tobacco being green and ftrong, and that I had not 
been much ufcd to it ; tl^en I took fome, and fteeped 
it an hour or two in fome rum, and refolved to take 
a dofe of it when I lay down ; and laftly, I burnt fpme 
upon a pan of coals, and held my nofe clofe over 
the fmoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well 
I 3 for 



Il8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ibr the heat as the virtue of it, and I held almoft 
to fuffocation. 

In the interval of this operation I took up the 
bible, and began to read ; but my head was too 
much difturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at 
leaft at that time ; only having opened the book 
cafually, the firft words that occurred to me were 
thefe. Call on me in the day of trouble^ and I will 
deliver ihee^ and thoujhalt glorify me. 

The words were very apt to . my cafe, and made 
fome impreflion upon my thoughts at the time of 
reading them, though not fo much as they did 
afterwards ; for as for being delivered, the word 
had no found, as I may fay ^ to me ; the thing was fo 
remote, fo impoffible in my apprehenfion of things, 
that 1 began to fay as the children of Ifrael did 
when they were promifed flefli to eat. Can Godfpread 
a table in the loildernefs ? fo I began to fay. Can God 
himfelf deliver me from this place i And as it was 
not for many years that any hope appeared, this 
prevailed very often upon my thoughts : but, how- 
ever, the words made a very great impreffipn upon 
me, and I mufed upon them very often, It grew now 
late, and the tobacco had, as I faid, dozed my head 
fo much, that I inclined to fleep ; fo that I left my 
lamp burnipg in the cave, left J fhould want any 
thing in the night, anc^ went to bed : but before I 
lay down, I did what I never had done in all my 
life ; I kneeled down and prayed to God to fulfil 
the promife to me, that if I called upon him iji the 
day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my 
broken and imperfeft prayer was over, I drank the 
rum in which I had fteeped the tobacco, which was 

fo 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE^ I tj 

fo ftrong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could 
fcarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went 
to bed, and I found prefently it flew up into my 
head violently j but I fell ijito a found fle^p, and 
waked no more, till by the f\in it muft neceflarily be 
near three o'clock in the afternoon the next day ; nay, 
to this hour I am partly of the opinion, that I flept 
all the next^ day and night, and till aln^pft three the 
day after ; for otherwife I ki^ew not how I fhould 
lofe a day out of my reckoning in the . days of the 
week, as it appeared fpme years after I had done ; . 
for if I had loft it by qrofling and re-croffing the 
line, I fhould have loft more thai^ z, day ; but in 
my account it was loft, and I never knew which way. 

Be that however one way or other, when I 
awaked, I found myfelf exceedingly refrelhed, and 
my. fpirits lively and chearful : When I got up, I 
was ftronger than I was the day before, and my 
ftomach better ; for I was hungry ; and, in fhort, 
I had no fit the next day, but continued much 
altered for the better. This was the 29th. 

The 30th was my well day, of courfe ; and I went 
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too 
far: I killed a fearfowl or two, fomething like a 
brand goofe, and brought them home, but was not 
very forward to eat them : fo I eat fome more of 
the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This 
evening I renewed the medicine which I had fup- 
pofed did me good the day before, vizp the tobacco 
fteeped in rum ; only I did not take fp much as 
before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my 
head, over the fmoke : however, I was not fo well 
the next day, which was the firft of July^ as I hoped 

I 4 I fhouljd 



120 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I ihouid have been ; for I had a little fpice of the 
cold fit, but it was not much. 

'July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three 
ways, and dozed myfelf with it at fir ft, and doubled 
the quantity which I drank, 

July 3. I miffed the fit for good and all, though I 
did not recover my full ftrength for fome weeks 
after. While I was thus gathering fti-^ength, my 
thoughts run exceedingly upon this fcripture, / will 
deliver thee / and the impoffibility of my deliverance 
lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever 
expefting it : but as I was difcouraging myfelf with 
fuch thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored 
fo much upon my deliverance from the main 
affliftion, that I difregarded the deliverance I had 
received ; and I was, as it were, made to aik myfelf 
fuchqueftions as thefej viz^ Have I not been delivered, 
and wonderfully too, from ficknefs ? from the moft 
diftreffed condition that could be, and that was fo 
frightful to me ? and what notice had I taken of it ? 
had I done my part ? God had delivered me : but / 
had not glorified him : that is to fay, I had not owned 
and been thankful for that a& a deliverance ; and how 
could I expe<^ greater deliverance ? 

This touched my heart very much, and imme* 
diately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud, 
for my recovery from my ficknefs, 

July 4. In the morning I took the bible ; and, be-» 
ginning at the New Teftament, I began feripufly to 
read it, and impofed upon myfelf. to read a while 
every morning and every night, not tying myfelf to 
the number of chapters, but as loitg as my thoughts 
ihouid engage me ; it was not long after I fet ferioufly 
to this work, but I found my heart more deeply and 

finccrely 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. lit 

fmcerely affefted with the wickednefs of my paft life j 
the impreffion of my dream revived, and the words. 
All tbefe things have not brought thee to repentance^ 
ran ferioufly in my thoughts : I was earneftly begging 
of Gop to give me repentance, when it happened 
providentially the very day, that, reading the fcrip- 
ture, I came to thefe words. He is exalted a Prince 
and a Saviour J t^ give repentance^ andtogiveremiffion: 
I threw down the book, and with my heart as well 
as my hand lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecftacy of 
joy, I cried out aloud, Jefus thou/on of D^Yidj Je/us^ 
thou exalted Prince and Saviour j give me repentance! 

This was the firft time that I could fay, in the true 
fenfe of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for 
now I prayed with a fenfe of my condition, and with 
a true fcripture view of hope, founded on the en- 
couragement of the word of God ; and from this 
time, I may fay, I began to have hope that God 
would hear me. 

Now I began to conftrue the words mentioned 
above. Call on me^ and I will deliver thee^ in a dif- 
ferent fenfe from what I had ever done before ; for 
then I had no notion of any thing being called de* 
iiverance, but my being delivered from the captivity 
I was in ; for though I was indeed at large in the 
place, yet the ifland was certainly a prifon to me, 
and thaf in the worft fenfe in the world ; but now 
I learned to take it in another fenfe. Now I looked 
back upon my paft life with fuch horror, and my fins 
appeared fo dreadful, that my foul fought nothing of 
God, but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore 
down all my comfort. As for my folitary life, it was 
nothing j I did not fo much as pray to be delivered 

from 



122 LIFE ANP APVENTURW 

from it, or think pf it ; it was all of no confidera-^ 
tion, in comparifon of this : and I sodded this part 
here, to hint to whoever fliall read it, that whenever 
they come to a true fenfe of things, they will find 
deliverance from fin a much greater blgffiiig thai]^ 
deliverance from afiUaion. 

But, leaving this part, I return to my journal. 

My condition began now to be, though not lefs 
miferable as to my way of living, yet much eafier to 
my mind ; and my thoughts being direded by a con^ 
ftant reading the fcripture, and praying to God, to 
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of com^ 
fort within, which till now I knew nothing of: alfo 
as my health and ftrength returned, I beftirred my- 
felf to furnifh myfelf with every thing that I wanted^ 
and make my way of living as regular as I could. 

From the 4th of ^uly to the 14th, I was chiefly 
employed in walking about with my gun in my hand, 
a little and a little at a time, as a man that was 
gathering up his ftrength after a fit of ficknefs ; for 
it is hardly to be imagined hpw low I was, and to 
what weaknefs I was^ reduced, The application 
which I made ufe of was perfedly new, and per- 
haps what had never cured an ague before j neither 
can I recommend it to any one to praftice by this 
experiment ; and though it djd 9arry off the fit, yet 
it rather contributed to weaken me ; for I had fre* 
quent convulfions in my nerves and limbs for fom^ 
time. 

I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that being 
^brosd in the rainy feafon was the moil perniciou§ 

thing 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOH. 1^3 

thing to my health that could be, efpecially in thofc 
rains which came attended with ftorms and hurm 
canes of wind ; for as the rain which came in a dry 
leafon was always mod accompanied with fuch ftorms^ 
fo I found this rain was much more dangerous than 
the rain which fell in September and Odober. 

I had been now in this imhappy ifland above ten 
months ; all poflibility of deliverance from this con- 
dition feemed to be entirely taken from me j and I 
firmly believed that no human fhape had ever fet 
foot upon that place. Having now fecured my 
habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a 
great defire to make a more perfefl: difcovery of the 
ifland, and to fee what other produftions I might 
find, which yet I knew nothing of. 

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more 
particular furvey of the ifland itfelf ; I went up the 
creek firfl:, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on 
fliore. I found, after I came about two miles up, 
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was 
no more than a little brook of running water, and 
very frefli and good ; but this being the dry feafon, 
there was hardly any water in fome parts of it, at 
leaft not enough to run into any fliream, fo as it 
could be perceived. 

On the bank of this brook I found many pleafant 
fevannas or meadows, plain, fmooth, and covered 
with grafs ; and on the rifing parts of them next to 
the higher grounds, where theVater, as it might be 
fuppofed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of 
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very 
ftrong ftalk : there were divers other plants which I 
had no notion of, or underftanding about; and 

might 



124 ^I^^ -^ND ADVENTUJUp:5 

might perhaps have virtues of their own, which I 
could not find out. 

I fearched for the caflfave root, which the Indians 
in all that climate make their bread of, but I could 
find none. I faw large plants of aloes, but did not 
then underjftand them; I faw feveral fugar canes, 
but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfed. I 
contented myfelf with thefe difcoveries for this time, 
and came back mufing with myfelf what courfe I 
might take to know the virtue and goodnefs of any of 
the fruits or plants which I fhould difcover, but could 
bring it to no conclufion : for, in fhort, J had made 
fo little obfervation while I was in th^ Braftls^ that I 
knew little of the plants of the field, at lead very 
little that might f^rve me tp any purpofe now in my 
diftrefs. 

The next day, the i6th, I went up the fame way 
again; and, after going fomething farther than I 
had done the day before, I found the brook and the 
favannas began to ceafe, and the country became 
more woody than before^ In this part I fouild dif- 
ferent fruit<^ and particularly I found melons upon 
the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the 
trees; the vines had fpread indeed over th^ treeSj^ 
and the clufters of grapes were juft now in their 
prime, very ripe and rich. , This was a furprifing 
difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of them, but \ 
was warned by my experience to eat fparingly of tbem, 
remembering, then when I was alhore in Barbary^ 
the eating of grapes killed feveral of our Englijh7nen 
who were flaves there, by throwing them into fluxes 
and fevers: but I found an excellent ufe for thefe 
grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the fun, 

w4 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOfi 12^ 

and keep them as dried grapes or raifins ate k^t, 
which I thought would be, as indeed they were, as 
whoiefome, and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes 
might be had. 

I fpent all that evening there, and went not badi 
to Iny habitation, which by the way was the firfl: 
night, as I might fay, I had lain from home. In the 
night I took my firft contrivance, and got up into a 
tree, where I flept well, and the next morning pro- 
ceeded upon my difcovery, travelling near four miles, 
as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping 
ftiil due north, with a ridge of hills on the fouth and 
north fide of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, 
where the country feemed to defcend to the weft ; 
and a little fpring of frefli water, which iflued out of 
the fide of the hill by me, ran the other way, that 
is, due eaft ; and the country appeared fo frefh, fo 
green, fo flourilhing, every thing being in a conftant 
verdure or flourilhing of fpring, that it looked like a 
planted garden. 

I defcended a little on the fide of that delicious 
valley, furveying it v^th a fecret kind of pleafure 
(though mixed with other aflSifting thoughts) to 
think that this was all my own, that I was king and 
lord of all this country indefeafibly, and had a right 
of poffeffion ; and if I could convey it, I might have 
it in inheritance, as completely as any lord of a 
manor in England* I faw here abundance of cocoa- 
trees, orange and lemon, and citron-trees, but all 
wild, and few bearing any fruit ; at leaft, not then : 
however, the green limes that I gathered were not 
only pleafant to eat, but very whoiefome j^ and I

mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made 
it very wholefome, and very cool and refrelhing. 

I found now I had bufmefs enough to gather and 
carry home ; and refolved to lay up a flore, as well 
of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnifh myfelf for 
the wet feafon, which I know was approaching. 

In order to do this I gathered a great heap of 
grapes in one place^ and a leffer heap in another 
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in 
another place j and taking a few of each with me, 
I travelled homeward, and refolved to come again, 
and bring a bag or fack, or what I could make, to 
carry the reft home. 

Accordingly, having fpent three days in this 
journey, I came home (fo I muft now call my tent, 
and my cave ;) but before I got thither, the grapes 
were fpoiled; the richnefs of the fruit, and the 
weight of the juice, having broken them, and bruifed 
them, they were good for little or nothing : as to the 
limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few. 

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, 
having made me two fmall bags to bring home 
my harveft : But I was furprifed, when Coming to 
my heap of grapes^ which were fo rich and fine when 
I gathered them, I found them all fpread abroad, 
trod to pieces, and dragged about, fome here, fome 
tliere, and abundance eaten and devoured : By this 
I concluded there were fome wild creatures there- 
abouts, which had done this ; but what they were I 
knew not. 

However, as I found there was no laying them up 
on heaps, and no carrying them away in a fack, but 
that one way they would be deftroyed, and the other 

way 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. t2J 

way they would be cruflied with their own weight, I 
took another courfe ; for I gathered a large quantity 
of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches 
of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the fun} 
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many 
back as I could well ftand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contem- 
plated with great pleafure on the fruitfulnefs of that 
valley, and the pleafantnefs of the lituation, the fe- 
curity from ftorms on that fide of the water, and the 
wood ; and concluded that I had pitched upon a place 
to fix my abode which was by far the worft part of 
the country. Upon the whole, I began to confider of 
rertioving my habitation, and to look out for a place 
equally fafe as where I now was fituated, if poffible, 
in that pleafant fruitful part of the ifland. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was 
exceeding fond of it for fome time, the pleafantneft 
of the place tempting me ; but when I came to a 
nearer view of it, and to confider that I was now by 
the fea fide, where it was at leaft poffible that fome- 
thing might happen to my advantage, and that the 
fame ill fi^te that brought me hither, might bring 
fome other unhappy wretches to the feme place ; and 
though it was fearer probable that any fuch thing 
fliould ever happen, yet to inciofe myfelf among the 
hills and woods, in the centre of the ifland, was 'to 
anticipate my bondage, and to render fuch an affair 
not only improbable, .but impoflible ; and that there- 
fore I ought not by any means to remove. 

However, I was fo enamoured with this place, thai 
I fpent much of my time there for the whole remain- 
ing part of the month of July; and though, upon

fei^ond thoughts I refolved as above, net to remote^ 
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and furrounded 
it at a diftance with a ftrong fence, being a double 
hedge, ias high as I could reach, well ftaked and 
filled betweeh with brufliwood ; and here I lay very 
fecure, fometimes two or three nights together, al- 
ways going Over it with a Jadder, as before ) fo that 
I fancied now I had my country houfe, and my fea- 
coaft houfe : and this work took me up the begin* 
ning of Auguji. 

I had but newly finifhed my fence, and began ta 
enjoy my labour, but the Ains came on, and mude 
me ftick clofe to my firft habitation ; forthouf' I had 
made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a fail, 
and fpread it very welU yet I had not the ihelter of a 
hill to keep me from ftorms, nor a cave behind me 
to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of Auguji^ as I faid, I had 
finifhed my bower, and began to enjoy myfelf. The 
third of Auguji I found the grapes I had hung up 
Were perfeftly dried, and indeed were exellent good 
raifms of the fun ; fo I began to take them down 
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did fo ; 
for the rains which followed would have fpoiled them, 
and I had loft the beft part of my winter food ; for I 
had above two hundred large bunches of them. No 
fooner had I taken them -all down, and carried moft 
of them home to my cave, but it began to rain j and 
from thence, which was the fourteenth oi ^n^Ji^ it 
rained more or lefs every day, till the middle of 
X)£loher i and fometimes fo violently, that I could 
not ftir out of my cave for feveral days.

of my family : I bad been concerned for the lofs of

btife of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as I 
thought^ had been dead ; and I heard no more tale 
or tidings of her, till, to my aftonifhment, fhe came 
home about the end of Attguji^ with three kittens. 
This was the more ftrange to me, becaufe though I 
had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun^ 
yet I thought it was a quite different kind from our 
European cats ; yet the young cats were the fame 
kind of houfe breed like the old oiie ; and both my 
cats being females, I thought it very ftrange : but 
from thefe three cats, I afterwards came to be fo 
pcAered with cats, that fewas forced to kill them like 
verm'yi, or wild hearts, and to drive them from my 
houfe as much as poffible. 

From the fourteenth of Auguji to the twenty-fixth, 
inceflant rain, fo that I could not ftir, and was now 
very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement 
1 began to be ftraitened for foodj but venturing 
out twice, I one day killed a goat : and the laft day, 
which was the twenty-fixth, found a very large tor-^ 
toife, >vhich was a treat to me ; and my food was 
regulated thus : I eat a bunch of raifms for my 
breakfaft, a piece of the goat's flefli, or of the turtle, 
for my dinner, broiled (for to my great misfortune 
1 had no veffel to boil or ftew any thing) ; and two 
or three of the turtle's eggs for fupper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, 
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my 
cave ; ^'^^ by degrees, worked it on towards one 
fide, till I came to the outfide of the hill, and made 
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or 
wall ; and fo I came in and out this way : but I was 
not perfe£cly eafy at laying fo open j for as I had

managed myfelf before, I was in a perfed Inclofure, 
whereas now I thought I lay expofed ; and yet I 
could not perceive that there was any living thing 
to fear, the biggeft creature that I had feen upon the 
ifland being a goat. 

September the thirtieth. I was now come to the 
unhappy anniverfary of my landing : I caft up the 
notches on my poft, and found I had been on fhore 
three hundred and fixty-five days. I kept this day 
as a folemn faft, fetting it apart to a religious exer- 
cife, proflrating myfelf to the ground with the mod 
ferious humiliation, confeffing myfelf to God, ac- 
knowledging his righteous judgment upon me, and 
praying to him to have mercy on me, through Jefus 
Chrift ; and having not tafted the leaft refrefliment 
for twelve hours, even to the going down of the fun, 
I then eat a bifcuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes, and 
went to bed, finifhing the day as 1 began it. 

I had all this time obferved no fabbath-day ; for as 
at firft I had no fenfe of religion upon my mind, I 
had after fome time omitted to diftinguifh the weeks, 
by making a longer notch than ordinary for the 
fabbath-day, arid fo did not really know what any of 
the days were ; but now, having caft up the days as 
5ibove, I found I had been there a year ; fo I divided 
it into weeks, and fet apart every feventh day for a 
fabbath ; though I found at the end of my account 
I had loft a day or two of my reckoning. 

A little after this my ink began to fail me, and 
fo I contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingly, and 
to write down only the moft remarkable events of 
my life, without continuing a daily memorandum of 
other things. 

The

^e rainy feafon, and the dry feafon, began now 
to appear regular to* me, and I learned to divide them 
fo as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought 
all my experience before I had it ; and this I am 
going to relate, was one of the mod difcouraging 
experiments that I made at ail. I have mentioned^ 
that I had faved the few ears of barley and rice which 
I had fo furprifmgly found ^ring up, as I thought, 
of themfelves, and believe there were about thirty 
ftalks of rice, and about twenty of barley ; and now I 
thought it a proper time to fow it after the rains, the 
fun being in its fouthern pofition«going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well 
as I could, with my wooden fpade, and dividing it 
into two parts, I fowed my grain ; but as I was fow- 
ing, it cafually occurred to my thought, that I would 
not fow it all at firft, becaufe I did not know when 
was the proper time for it ; fo I fowed about two 
thirds of the feeds, leaving about an handful of each. 
It was a gieat comfort to me afterwards that I did 
fo, for not one grain of that I fowed this time came 
to any thing; for the dry months following, the earth 
having had no rain after the feed Was fown, it had 
no moifture to aflift its growth, and never came up 
at all, till the wet feafon had come again, and then 
it grew as if it had been newly fown. 

Finding my firft feed did not grow, which I eafily 
imagined was by the drought, I fought for a moifter 
piece of ground to make another trial in ; and I dug 
up a piecfe of ground near my new bower, and fowed 
the reft of my feed in February^ a little before the 
vernal equinox ; and this, having the rainy months 
of March and Aj^ril \o water it, fprung up very plea*.

faatly, and yielded a very gocd crop; bm fenrf%

that I had y6t^ I had but a fmall quantity at laft, my

to^as ta fbw 'f and that I might expe& two feed timies^ 
and two harvefts every yeafr 

While thas corn was growing, I nade a little dif- 
coyery, which was of ufe to me afterwards : As foort 
zs the rains were over, and the weather began to 
fettle, which was about the month of November j I 
^ade a vifit up the country to my bower, where 
though I had not been fome months, yet I found all 
things juft as I feft them. The circle or double hedge 
that 1 had made", was not only firm and entire, but 
the flakes which I had cut off of fome trees that grew 
thereabouts, were all fhot out, and grown with long 
branches, as much as a willow tree itfuafiy Ihoots the 
firft year after lopping its head. I could not tell 
what tree to call it that thefe flakes were. Cut fromr 
I was furpfifed, and yet very well pleafed, to fee the 
young trees grow j and I pruned them, and led them? 
up to grow as much alike as I could ; and it is fcarce 
credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in> 
three years j fo that though the hedge made a circle 
of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees^ 
for fuch I might now call them, fooa covered it j 
and it was a complete fhade, fuffident to lodge under 
all the dry feafon. 

This made me refolve to cut fome more flakes^ 
and make me an hedge like this in a femicircle round

fny wall, I mean that of my firft dwelling, which i 
did ; and placing the trees or flakes in a double row, 
at above eight yards diftance ftom j^my firft fence, 
they grew prefently, and wene at firft a fine cover to 
my habitation, and afterwards ferved for a defence 
^1£6, as I fhall obierve in its order. 

I found now, that the feafons of the year might 
generally be divided, not into fummer and winter, 
jas in Europe^ but into the rainy feafons, and the dry 
^albns, whicl|i were generally thus :

beforehand, that J ipight no* be obliged to go out ;

and I fat within doors as much as poflible during the 
wet months. 

In this time I found much employment, (and very 
fuitable alfo to the time) for I found great occafion 
of many things which I had no way to furnifh myfelf 
with, but by hard labour and conftant application : 
particularly, I tried many ways to make myfelf a 
baflcet ; but all the twigs I could get for the purpofe 
proved fo brittle, that they would do nothing. It 
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when 
I was a boy, I ufed to take great delight in (landing 
at a bafket-maker's in the town where my father lived, 
to fee them make their wicker ware j and being, as 
boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a great 
obferver of the manner how they worked thofe things, 
and fometimes lent a hand, I had by this means fo 
full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted 
nothing but the materials ; when it came into my 
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut 
my flakes that grew, might poffibly be as tough as 
the fallows and willows, andofiers, in England; and 
I refolved to try. 

Accordingly the next day I went to my country- 
houfe, as I called it, and cutting fome of the fmaller 
twigs, I found them to tny purpofe as much as I 
could defire ; whereupon I came the next time pre- 
pared with an hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 
ifoon foimd, for there was a great plenty of them: 
'thefe I fet up to dry within my circle or hedges ; arid 
when they were fit for ufe, I carried them to my 
'(^ve ; and here during the next feafon I employed 
jnyfelf in making, (as well as I could) a great many 
'^'bafkets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up

any thing, as I had occafion ; and though I did not 
finifh them very handfomely, yet I made them fuffi- 
ciently ferviceable for my purpofe ; and thus after- 
wards I took care never to be without them : and as 
my wicker- ware decayed, I made more ; efpecially 
I made ftrong deep balkets to place my corn in, 
inftead of facks, when I fliould come to have any 
quantity of it. 

Having mattered this difficulty, and employed a 
world of time about it, I beftirred myfelf to fee, if 
poffible, how to fupply two wants. I had no veffels 
to hold any thing that was liquid, except two rund- 
lets, which were almoft full of rum, and fome glafs 
bottles, fome of the common (ize, and others which 
were cafe-bottles fquare, for the holding of waters, 
fpirits, &c. I had not fo much as a pot to boil any 
thing in, except a great kettle which I faved out of 
the fhip, and which was too big for fuch ufes as I 
defired it for, viz. to make broth, and ftew a bit of 
meat by itfelf. The fecond thing I would fain have 
had, was a tobacco pipe, but it was impoffible for 
me to make one ; however, I found a contrivance 
for that too at laft. 

I employed myfelf in planting my fecond rows of 
flakes of piles, and in this wicker work, all the 
fummer, or dry feafon; when another bufmefs took 
me up more t}me than it could be imagined I could 
fpare. 

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to fee 
the whole ifland, and that I had travelled up the brook, 
and fo on to where I built my bower, and where I 
had an opening quite to the fea, on the other fide of 
the ifland. I now refolved to travel quite acrofs to

the fea fliore on that fide : So taking my gun, and 
. hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of pow- 
der and ihot than ufual, with two bifcuit-cakes, and 
a great bunch of raifms in my pouch, for my ftore, 
I began my journey. When I had paffed the vale 
where my bower flood, as above, I came within 
view of the fea, to the weft ; and it being a very 
clear day, I fairly defcried land, whether an ifland 
or continent I could not tell ; but it lay very high, 
extending from the Weft, to the W. S. W. at a 
very great diftance ; by my guefs it could not be lefs 
than fifteen or twenty leagues off, 

I could not tell what part of the world this might 
be, otherwife than tl^at I knew it muft be part of 
America; and, as I concluded by all my obferva- 
tions, muft be near the SpaniJJo dominions, and per- 
haps was all inhabited by favages, where if I fhould 
have landed, I had been in a worfe condition than 
I was now ; and therefore I acqui^fced in the difpo- 
fitions of Providence, which I began now to own, 
and to believe, ordered every thing for the beft ; I 
fay, I quieted my mirid with this, and left afflifl:ing 
myfelf with fruitlefs wiflies of being there. 

Befides, after fome ps^ufe upon this affair, I con- 
fidered, that if this land was the Spanijh cpaft, I 
fhould certainly, one time or other, fee foipe velfels. 
pafs or repafs one way or other ; but if not, then it 
was the favage cpaft between the Spanijh country and 
BrafiU which were indeed the worft of favages ; for 
they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to 
murder and devour all the hu^lan bodies tha( fall 
into their hands, 

% With 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, I37 

With thefe confiderations I walked very leifurely 
forward. I found that fide of the ifland where I now 
was, much pleafanter than mine, the open or favanna 
fields fweet, adorned with flowers and grafs, and 
full of very fine woods. I faw abundance of parrots, 
and fain would I have caught one, if pofTible, to 
have kept it to be tame, and taught it to fpeak to 
me. I did, after fome pains taken, catch a young 
parrot; for I knocked it down with a (lick, and 
having recovered it, I brought it home, but it was 
fome years before I could make him fpeak. However, 
at laft I taught him to call me by my name, very 
familiarly ; but the accident that followed, though 
it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey : I 
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them 
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all 
the other kinds I had met with ; nor could I fatisfy 
myfelf to eat them, though I killed feveral : but I 
had no need to be ventrous ; for I had no want of 
food, and of that which was very good too : efpe- 
cially thefe three forts, viz. goats, pigeons, and 
turtle or tortoife j which, added to my grapes. 
Leaden-hall market could not have fumiflied a better 
table than I, in proportion to the company : and 
though my cafe was deplorable enough, yet I had 
great caufe for thankfulnefs, that I was not driven 
to any extremities for food j but rather plenty, even 
to dainties. 

, I never travelled in this journey above two miles 
putright in a day, or thereabouts ; but I took fo 
many turns and returns, to fee what difcoveries I could 
piake, that I came weary enough to the place where 

I refolved 



138 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I refolved to fit down for all night j and' then either 
repofed myfelf in a tree, or furrounded myfelf with 
a- row of flakes fet upright in the ground, either from 
one tree to another, or fo as no wild creature could 
come at me without waking me. 

As foon as I came to the fea-ftiore, I was furprifed 
to fee that I had taken up my lot on the worft fide of 
the ifland ; for here , indeed the fhore was covered 
with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other fide 
I had found but three in a year and an half. Here 
was alfo an infinite namber of fowls of many kinds, 
fome of which I had not feen before, and many of 
them very good meat ; but fuch as I knew not the 
names of, except thofe called penguins. 

I could' have fhot as many as I pleafed, but was 
very fparing of my powder and fhot : and therefore 
had more mind to kill a fhe-goat, if I could, which 
I could better feed on : and though there were many 
more goats here than on the other fide of the ifland, 
yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come 
near them : the country being flat and even, and 
they faw me much fooner than when I was on the 
hills. 

I confefs this fide of the country was much plea- 
fanter than mine, but yet I had not the leafl inclina- 
tion to remove ; for as i was fixed in my habitation, 
it became natural to me ; and I feemed all the while 
I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey, and 
from home : However, I travelled along the fhore 
of the fea towards the eaft, I fuppofe, about twelve 
miles ; and then fetting up a great pole upon the 
fhore for a mark, I concluded I would go home 
again ; and. the next journey I took fhould be on

the other fide of the ifland, eaft from my dwelling, 
and fo round, till I came to my poft again : of which 
in its place. ' 

I took another way to come back than that I went, 
thinking I could eafily keep all the ifland fo much 
in my view, that I could not mifs finding my firft 
dwelling by viewing the country ; but I found myfelf 
miftaken ; for being come about two or three miles, 
I found myfelf defcended into a very large valley ; 
but fo furrounded with hills, and thofe hills covered 
with woods, that I could not fee which was my way 
by any diredion but that of the fun ; nor even then, 
unlefs I knew very well the pofition of the fun at that 
time of the day. 

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the 
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I 
was in this valley ; and not being able to fee the fun, 
I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at laft 
was obliged to find out the fea-fide, look for my poft, 
and come back the fame way I went ; and then by 
eafy journies I turned homeward, the weather being 
exceeding hot ; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, 
and other things, very heavy. 

In this journey my dog furprifed a young kid, and 
feized upon it ; and I running in to take hold of it, 
caught it, and faved it alive from the dog : I had a 
great mind to bring it home, if I could ; for I Rad 
often been mufing whether it might not be poffible 
to get a kid or two, and fo raife a breed of tame 
goats, which might fupply me when my powder and 
ihot fhould be fpent. 

I made a collar for this little creature; and with a 
ftring which I made of feme rope yarn, which I

always carried about me, I led him along, though 
with fome difficulty, till I came to my bower, and 
there I enclofed him, and left him ; for I was very 
impatient to be at home,^ from whence I had been 
al^ent above a month, 

I cannot exprefs what a fatisfaftion it was to me 
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my 
hammock-bed : this little wandering journey, without 
a fettled place of abode, had been fo unpleafant to 
me, that my own houfe, as I called it to myfelf, 
was a perfe^ fcttlement to me, compared to that } 
^d it rendered every thing about mp fo comfortable, 
that I refolved I would never go a great way from 
it again, while it fhould be my lot to ftay on the 
ittand. 

I repofed myfelf here a week, to reft and regale 
myfelf after my long journey ; during which, moft 
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of 
making a cage for my Pollj who began now to be a 
mere domeflic, and to b^ mighty well acquainted 
^ith me. Then I began to think of the poor kid, 
which I had pent in within ray little circle, and 
refolved to go and fetch it home, and give it fome 
food : accordingly I went, jmd found it where I left 
it ; for indeed it could npt get out, but was almoft: 
ftarved for want of food. 1 went and cut boughs of 
trees and branches of fuph flirubs as I could find, 
and threw it over ; and having fed it, I tied it as I 
did before, to lead it away ; but it was fo tame with 
being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it ; 
for it followed me like a dog; ^d as I continually 
fed it, the creature became fo loving, fo gentle, 
^d fo fond, that it became from th^t time one

bf my domeftics alfo, and would never leave me 
afterwards. 

The rainy fcafon of the Autumnal Equinox was 
now come, and 1 kept the 30th of September in the 
fame folemn manner as before, being the anniverfary 
c^ my landing on the ijQand, having now been there 
two years, and no more profpeft of being delivered 
than the firft day I came there. I fpent the whole 
day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the 
many wonderful mercies which my folitary condition 
was attended with, and without which it might have 
been infinitely more miferable. I gave humble and 
hearty thanks^ that God had been plcafed to difc6ver 
to me, even that it was poffible I might be more 
happy in this folitary condition, than I fhould have 
been in a liberty of fociety, and in all the pleifures 
of the world : that he could fully make up to me the 
deficiencies of my folitary flate, and the want of' 
human fociety, by his prefence, and the communi- 
cation of his grace to my foul, fupporting, com- 
forting, and encouraging me to depend upon his 
providence here, and hope for his eternal prefence 
hereafter* 

It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how much 
more happy the life I now led was, with all its 
miferable circumflanees, than the wicked, curfed 
abominable life I led all the paft part of my days j 
and now, having changed both my forrows and my 
joy§, my very defires altered, my affeftions changed 
their gufl, and my delights were perfeftly new from 
what they were at firft coming, or indeed for the 
two years paft*

14^ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Before as I walked about, either on my huntin^^ 
or for viewing tiie country, the anguilh of my foul 
at my condition would break out upon me on a 
fudden, and my very heart would die within me, t6 
think of the woods, the mountains, the defarts I was 
in ; and how I was a prifoner, locked up with the 
eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited 
wildernefs,. without redemption* In the midft of 
the greateft compofures of my mind, this would 
break out upon me like a ftorm, and made me wring 
my hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it 
would take me in the middle of my work, and I 
would immediately lit down and figh, and ^look 
upon the ground for an hour or two together ; and 
this was ftill worfe to me ; for if I could burft out 
into tears, or vent myfelf by words, it would go 
off, and the grief, having exhaufted itfelf, would 
abate. 

But now I began to exercife myfelf with new 
thoughts ; I daily read the word of God, and applied 
all the comforts of it to my prefent ftate. One 
morning, being very fad, 1 opened the bible upon 
thefe words, / will never^ never leave thee^ not* 
forfake theet Immediately itr*<JHlWrcd, that thefe 
words were to me, why elfe fliould they be directed 
in fuch a manner, juft at the moment when I was 
mourning over my condition, as one forfaken of 
God and man ? Well then, faid I, if God does not 
forfake me, of what ill confequence can it be, or 
what matters it, though the world fhould all forfake 
me; feeing, on the other hand, if I had all the 
world, and Ihould lofe the favour and blefling of 
God, there would be no comparifon in the lofs ? 

From 



OP ROBINSON CRU80E. 143 

Prom this moment 1 began to conclude in my 
mind, that it was poffible for me to be more happy 
in this forfaken, folitary condition, than it was 
probable I fhould have ever been in any other par- 
ticular date in the world ; and with this thought I 
was going to give thanks to God for bringing me to 
this place* 

I know not what it was, but fomething fhocked 
my mind at that thought, and I durft not fpeak the 
words. How canft thou be fuch an hypocrite'(faid I, 
even audibly), to pretend to be thankful for a con- 
dition, which, however thou may eft endeavour to be 
contented with, thou wouldeft rather pray heartily to 
be delivered from ? So I flopped there ; but though 
I could not fay I thanked God for being there, yet 
I fmcerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, 
by whatever affliding providences, to fee the former 
condition of my life, and to mourn for my wicked- 
nefs, and repent. I never opened the bible, or fhut 
it, but my very foul within me bleffed God for di- 
redting my friend in England^ without .any order of 
mine, to pack it up among my goods ; and for aflift- 
ing me afterwards to fave it out of the wreck of the 

fl^ip- .'V . . 

Thus, and in this difpofition of mind, I began 

my third year ; and though I have not given the 

reader the trouble of fo particular an account of my 

works this year as at the firft, yet in general it may 

be obferved, that I was very feldom -idle ; having 

regularly divided my time, according to the feveral 

daily employments that were before me; fuch as, 

firft, my duty to God, and reading the fcriptures^ 

which I conftantly fet apart fome time for, thrice 

4 every 



144 ^l^B, AKJO AhVEUTUkM 

every day. Secondly, the going abroad with itiygtift 
for food, which generally tofok me up three hours 
every morning when it did not rain. Thirdly^ the 
the ordering^ curing, preferving, and cooking what 
I had killed or catched for my fupply. Thefe took 
np great part of the day. Alfo it is to be confidered, 
that in the middle of the day, when the fun was 
m the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great 
to ftir out ; fo that about four hours in the evening; 
was all the time I could be fuppofed to work in j 
with this exception, that fometiraes I changed my 
hours of hunting atid working, and went to work 
in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the 
afternoon. 

To this fhort time allowed for labour, I defire 
may be added the exceeding labourioufnefs of my 
work ; the many hours, which for want of tools, 
want of help, and want of ikill, every thing that I 
did, took up, dut of my time : for example, I was 
full two-and-forty days making me a board for a long 
Ihelf, which I wanted in my cave j whereas two faw- 
yers, with their tools and faw-pit, would have cut fix 
of them out of the fame tree in half a day. 

My cafe was this : It was to be a large tree which 
was to be cut down, becaufe my board was to be a 
broad one. The tree I was three days a cutting 
down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and 
reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With in- 
expreflible hacking and hewing^ I reduced both the 
fides of it into chips, till it began to be light enough 
to move ; then I turned it, and made one fide of it 
fmooth and flat, as a board, from end to end : then 
turning that fide dovmward, cut the other fide till I 

brought 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I45 

brought the plank to be about three inches thick, 
and fmooth on both fides. Any one may judge the 
labour of my hands in fuch a piece of work ; but 
labour and patience carried me through that and 
many other things ; I only obferve this in particular, 
to fhew the reafon why fo much of my time went 
away with fo little work, viz. That what might be 
a little to be done with help and tools, was a vaft 
labour, and required a prodigious time to do alone, 
and by hand. 

But notwithftanding this, with patience and la- 
bour I went through many things, and indeed every 
thing that my circumftances made neceffary for me 
to do, as will appear by what follows, 

I was now in the months of November and Decem- 
ber^ expefting my crop of barley and rice. The 
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not 
great ; for, as I obferved, my feed of each was not 
above the quantity of half a peck ; for I had loft one 
whole crop by fowing in the dry feafon^ but now 
my crop promifed very well, when on a fudden I 
found 1 was in danger of lofing it all again by 
enemies of feveral forts, which it was fcarce poffi- 
ble to keep from it; as firft, the goats, and wild 
creatures which I called hares, which, tafting the 
fweetnefs of the blade, lay in it night and day, as 
foon as it came up, and eat it fo clofe, that it could 
get no time to Ihoot up into ftalks. 

This I faw no remedy for, but by making an in- 
clofure about it with an hedge, which I did with a 
great deal of toil ; and the more, becaufe it required 
a great deal of fpeed j the creatures daily fpoiling 
my com. However, as my arable land was but 
Vol. I. L ftnall, 



146 LIFE AND ADVENTUHES 

fmall, fuited to my crop^ I got it totally well fenced 
in about three weeks time; and Ihooting fome of the 
creatures in the day-time, I fet my dog to guard it in 
the night, tying him up to a flake at the gate, where 
he would (land and bark all night long: fo in a 
little time the enemies forfook the place, and the 
corn grew very flrong and well, and began to ripen 
apace. 

But as the beads ruined mt before, while my corn 
was in the blade, fo the birds were as likely to ruin 
me now, when it was in the ear ; for going along 
by the place to fee how it throve, I faw my little 
crop furrounded with fowls of I know not how many 
forts, which flood as it were watching till I fhould be 
gone. I immediately let fly among them, (for I 
always had my gun with me.) I had no fopner 
dot, but there arofe up a little cloud of fowls, 
which I had not feen at all, from among the corn 
itfelf. 

This touched me fenfibly j for I forefaw, that in 
a few days they would devour all my hopes : that I 
(honld be flarved, and never be able to raife a crop 
at all J and what to do I could not tell ; however, I 
refolved, not to lofe my corn, if pofTible, though I 
fhould watch it night and day. In the firfl place, I 
went among it to fee what damage was already done, 
and found they had fpoiled a good deal of it ; but 
that, as it was yet too green for them, the lofs was 
not fo great, but the remainder was like to be a good 
crop, if it could be faved. 

I flaid by it to load my gun, and then coming 
away, I could eafily fee the thieves fitting upon all 
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was 

gone 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 14;^ 

j^drle away^ and the event proved it to be fo ; for as 
I walked off ias if I was gone, I was no fooner out 
of their fight, but they dropped down one by one 
into the corn again, I was fo pi'ovoked, that I 
could not have patience to flay till more came on, 
knowing that every grain that they eat now was, as 
it might be faid, a peck loaf to me in the confe- 
quence ; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, 
and killed three of them; This was what I wifhed 
for ; fo I took them up, and ferved them as we ferve 
notorious thieves in England;^ vizi hanged them in 
chains, for a terror to others* It is impoffible to 
imagine almoft, that this fhould have fuch an effedl 
as it had ; for the fowls would not only not come at 
the corn, but in Ihort they forfook all that part of the 
ifland, and I could never fee a bird near the place as 
long as my fcarecrows hung there. 

This I was very glad of j you may be fure ; and 
about the latter end of December^ which was our 
fecond harveft of the year, I reaped my corn. 

I was fadly put to it for a fcythe or a fickle to cut 
It down, and all I could do was to make one as weU 
as I could, out of one of the broad fwords, or cut* 
lalTes, which I faved among the arms out of the fliip. 
However, as my crop was but fmall, I had no great 
difficulty to cut it down : in fhort, I teaped it my 
way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, ,and carried 
it away in a great bafket which I had made^ and fo 
rubbed it out with my hands : and at the end of 
all my harvefting I found, that out of my half, 
peck of feed, I had near two bulhels of rice, and 
above two bufhels and a half of barley, that is 

L 2 tQ 



148 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to fey, by my guefs, for I had no meafure at that 
time. 

However, this was a great encouragement to me; 
and I forefaw that in time it would pleafe Gob to 
fupply me with bread : and yet here I was perplexed 
i again; for I neither knew how to grind or make 
meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it, and part 
it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of 
it ; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to 
bake it. Thefe things being added to my defire of 
having a good quantity for (lore, and to fecur.e a 
conftant fupply, I refolved not to tafte any of this 
crop, but to preferve it all for feed againft the next 
feafon, and in the mean time to employ all my ftudy 
aild hours of working to accomplifh this great work 
of providing myfelf with corn and bread/ 

It might be truly faid, that I now worked for my 
bread. It i« a little wonderful, and what I believe- 
few people have thought much upon ; viz^ the ft range 
multitude of little things neceflary in the providing, 
producing, curing, dreffing, making, and finifhing,, 
this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere ft ate of nature, 
found this to be my daily difcouragement, and was^ 
made more and more fenfible of it every hour, even 
after I got the firft handful of feed corn, which, as 
I have faid, came up unexpe£tedly, and indeed to a 
furprife. 

Firft, I had no plough to turn the earth, no fpade 
or (hovel to dig it. Well, thia I conquered by 
making ja Wooden fpade, as I obferved before ; but 
this did my work but in a wooden manner; and. 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I49 

though It coft me a great many days to make it, yet 
for want of iron, it not only wore put the fooner, 
but made my work the harder, and made it be per- 
formed much worfe. 

However, this I bore with too, and was content to 
work it out with patience, and bear with the badnefs 
of the performance. When the corn was fowed, I 
had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myfelf, 
and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to 
fcratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than 
rake or harrow it. 

When it v/as growing or grown, I have obferved 
already how many things I wanted, to fence it, 
fecure it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home, 
thrafh, part it from the chaff, and fave it. Then I 
wanted a mill to grind it, fieves to drefs it, yeaft 
and fait to make it into bread, and an oven to bake 
it in ; and all thefe things I did without, as (hall 
be obferved ; and yet the corn was an ineftimable 
comfort and advantage to me too : but all this, as 
I faid, made every thing labouflous and tedious to 
me, but that there was no help for ; neither was my 
time fo much lofs to me, becaufe I had divided it: 
A certain part of it was every day appointed to thefe 
works ; and as I refolved to ufe none of the corn for 
bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the 
next fix months to apply myfelf, wholly by labour 
and invention, to furnifh myfelf with utenfils pro- 
per for the performing all the operations necefiary 
for the making the corn, when I had it, fit for my 
ufe. 

But firft I was to prepare more land, for I had 
now feed ejiough to fow above an acre of ground. 

L 3 Before 




150 IJFE AND ADV£NTUR£S 

Before I did this, I had a week's work at leaft to 
make me a fpade, which, when it was done, was a 
very forry one indeed, and very heavy, and required 
double labour to work with it ; however, I went 
through that, and fowed my feeds in two large flat 
pieces of ground, as near my houfe as I could find 
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good 
hedge, the flakes of which were all cut off that wood 
which I had fet before, which I knew would grow ; 
fo that in one year's time I knew I ihould have a 
quick or living hedge, that would want but little 
repair. This work was not fo little as to take me 
up lefs than thre€ months ; becaufe great part of 
that time was in the wet feafon, when I could not 
go abroad. 

Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could 
not go out, r found employment on the following 
©ccafion, always obferving, that all the while I was 
at work, I diverted myfelf with talking to my 
parrot, and teaching him to fpeak ; and I quickly 
learnt him to know his own name ; at laft, to fpeak 
it out pretty loud. Poll ; which was the firft word 
I ever heard fpoken in the ifland by any mouth but 
my own. This therefore was not my work, but an 
afliftant to my work ; for now, as I faid, I had a 
great employment upon my hands, as follows : viz. 
I had long ftudied, by fome means or other, to make 
myfelf fome earthen veflels, which indeed I wanted 
forely, but knew not where to come at them : how- 
ever, confidering the heaf of the climate, I did not 
doubt but if I could find out any fuch clay, I 
might botch up fome fuch pot, as might, being 
dried by the fun, be hard enough, and fltrong 

enough. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, l^l 

enough, to bear handling, and to hold any thing 
that was dry, and required to be kept fo ; and as 
this was neceflary in preparing corn, meal, &c. 
which was the thing I was upon, I refolved to make 
fome as large as I could, and fit only to ftand like 
jars to hold what fliould be put into them. 

I would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh 
at me, to tell how many aukward ways I took to 
raife this pafte, what odd mif-(hapen ugly things I 
made, how many of them fell in, and how many 
fell out, the clay not being ftiff enough to bear its 
own weight ; how many cracked by the over-violent 
heat of the fun, being fet out too haftily ; and how 
many fell to pieces with only removing, as well 
before as after they were dried; and, in a word, 
how, after having laboured hard to find the clay, 
to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work 
it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly 
things, I cannot call them jars, in about two months 
labour. 

However, as the fun baked thefe two very dry and 
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fet them 
down again in two great wicker-bafkets, which I 
had made on purpofe for them, that they might not 
break ; and, as between the pot and the baiket there 
was a little room to fpare, I fluffed it full of the 
rice and barley ^ draw ; and thefe two pots being 
to ftand always dry, I thought would hold my dry 
corn, and perhaps the ijieal when the corn was. 
bruifed. 

Though I mifcarried fo much in my defign for 
large pots, yet I made feveral fmaller things with 
4)€tter fuccefs J fuch as little round pots, flat difhes, 

L 4 pitchers. 



152 ' LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand tunned 
to ; and the heat of the fun baked them ftiangely 
hard. 

But all this would not anfwer my end, which was 
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and 
bear the fire, whick none of thefe could do. It 
happened after fome time, making a pretty large fire 
for- cooking my meat, when I went to put it out 
after I had done with it, I found a broken piece of 
one of my earthen- ware veffels in the fire, burnt as 
hard as a ftone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably 
furprifed to fee it, and faid to myfelf, that certainly 
they might be made to burn whole, if they would 
burn broken. 

This fet me to ftudy how to order my fire, fo as 
to make it burn me fome pots. I had no notion of a 
kiln, fuch as the potters burn in, or of glazing them 
with lead, though I had fome lead to do it with ; but 
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots, 
in a pile one upon another, and placed my fire- wood 
all round it, with a great heap of embers under 
them: I plied the fire with frefh fuel round the 
outfide, and upon the top, till I faw the pots in the 
infide red-hot quite through, and obferved that they 
did not crack at all: when I faw them clear red, I 
let them ftand in that heat about five or fix hours, 
till I found one of them, though it did not crack, 
did melt or run; for the fand which was mixed 
with the clay, melted by the violence of the heat, 
and would have run into glafs, if I had gone on ; 
fo I flacked my fire gradually, till the pots began to 
abate of the red colour; and watching them all 
»ight, that I might not let the fire abate too faft, in 

the 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I53 

the mortimg I had three very good, I will not fay 
handfome pipkins, and two other earthen pots, 
as hard burnt as could be defired; and one of 
them perfedly glazed with the running of the 
fand. 

After this experiment I need not fay that I wanted 
no fort of earthen-ware for my ufe j but I muftneeda 
fay, as to the fhapes of them, they were very in- 
different, as any one may fuppofe, when I had no 
way of making them, but as the children make 
dirt-pics, or as a woman would make pies that 
never learnt to raife pafte. 

No joy at a thing of fo mean a nature was ever 
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen 
pot that would bear the fire ; and I had hardly 
patience to ftay till they were cold, before I fet one 
upon the fire again, with fome water in it, to boil 
me fome meat, which I did admirably wellj and 
with a piece of a kid I made fome very good broth, 
though I wanted oatmeal, and feveral other ingre-, 
dients requifite to make it fo good as I would have 
had it. 

My next concern was to get me a ftone mortar to 
{lamp or beat fome corn in ; for as to the mill, there 
was no thought of arriving to that perfeftion of art 
with one pair of hands. To fupply this want, I was 
at a great lofs ; for of all trades in the world I was 
as perfecUy unqualified for a ftone-cutter, as for any 
whatever ; neither had I any tools to go about it 
with. I fpent many a day to find out a great ftone 
big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, 
and could find none at all, except what was in the 
folid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; 

nor 



154 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

nor indeed were the rocks in the ifland of hardnefi 
fiifBcient, but were all of a fandy crumbling ftone, 
which would neither bear the weight of an heavy 
peftle, nor would break the corn without filling it 
with fand; fo, after a great deal of time loft in 
fearching for a ftone, I gave it over, and refolved 
to look out a great block of hard wood, which I 
found indeed much eafier; and getting one as big as 
I had ftrength to ftir, I rounded it, and formed it on 
the outfide with my axe and hatchet ; and then, with 
the help of fire and infinite labour, made an hollow 
place in it, as the Indians in Brajil make their canoes. 
After this, I made a great heavy peftle or beater, of 
the wood called the iron-wood ; and this I prepared 
and laid by againft I h^d my next crop of corn, when 
I propofed to myfelf to grind, or rather pound, my 
com or meal to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a fieve or fearce, to 
drefs my meal, and part it from the bran and the hulk, 
without which I did not fee it poffible I could have 
any bread. This was a moft difficult thing, fo much 
as but to think on ; for, to be fure, I had nothing like 
the ncceffary things to make it with ; I mean fine 
thin canvafs, or ftuff, to fearce the meal through. 
And here I was at a full ftop for many months ; nor 
did I really know what to do: linen I had none left but 
what was mere rags ; I had goat's hair, but neither 
knew I how to weave or fpin it ; and had I known 
how, here were no tools to work it with : All the 
remedy that I found for this, was, that at laft I did 
remember I had among the feamen's clothes, which 
were faved out of the fhip, fome neckcloths of calHco 
or mullin ; and with fome pieces of thefe I made 
2 three 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 155 

three fmall fieves, but proper enough for the work ; 
and thus I made fhift for fome years ; how I did af- 
terwards, I ihall fhew in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be €onfi- 
dered, and how I fhould make bread when I came 
to have corn ; for, firft, I had no yeaft : as to that 
part, there was no fupplying the want, fo I did not 
concern myfelf much about it. But for an oven, I 
was indeed in great pain. At length I found out an 
experiment for that alfo, which was this : I made 
fome earthen veffels very broad, but not deep ; that Is 
to fay, about two feet diameter, and not above nine 
inches deep ; thefe I burnt in the fire, as I had done 
the other, and laid them by ; and when I wanted to 
bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth, which I 
had paved with fome fquare tiles of my own making 
and burning alfo ; but I fhould not call them fquare. 

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into 
embers, or live coals, 1 drew them forward upon 
this hearth, fo as to cover it all over ; and there I 
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot : then fweep- 
ing away all the embers, I fet down my loaf, or 
loaves ; and whelming down the earthen pot upon 
them, drew the embers all round the outfide of the 
pot, to keep in, and add to the heat : and thus, as 
well as in the befl oven in the world, I baked my 
barley-loaves, and became in a little time a mere 
paftry-cook into the bargain ; for I made myfelf 
feveral cakes of the rice, and puddings ; indeed I 
made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into 
them, fuppofing I had, except the flefh either of 
fpwls or goats.

1^6 lIFE AND ADVENTURES 

It need not be wondered at, if all thcfe things took 
me up moll p^rt of the third year of my abode here » 
for it is to be obferved, that in the intervals of thefe 
things, I had my new harveft and hufbandry to ma- 
nage : for 1 reaped my corn in its feafon, and car- 
ried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the 
car, m my large bafkets, till I had time to rub it out ; 
for I had no floor to thrafli it on, or inftrument to 
thrafh it with. 

And now indeed, my ftock of com increafing, I 
really wanted to build my barns bigger : I wanted a 
place to lay it up in ; for the increafe of the corn now 
yielded me fo much, that I had of the barley about 
twenty bufliels, and of the rice as much, or more ; 
infomuch that I now refolved to begin to ufe it freely^ 
for my bread had been quite gone a great while ^ alfo 
I refolved to fee what quantity would be fufficient for 
me a whole year, and to fow but once a year,. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bufhels of 
barley and rice were ^jiuch more than I could con* 
fume in a year ; fo I refolved to fow juft the fame 
quantity every year that I fowed the laft, in hopes 
that fuch a quantity would fully provide me with 
bread, &c, 

• All the while thefe things were doing, you may be 
fiire my thoughts ran many times upon the profpeft 
of land which I had feen from the other fide of the 
ifland ; and I was not without fecret wifiies that I 
was -on ftiore there, fancying that feeing the main 
land, and an inhabited country, I might find fome 
way or other to convey myfelf farther, and perhaps 
at laft find fome means of efcape. 

But 



OF ROBINSOK CRUSOE. I57 

But all this while I made no allowance for the 
dangers of fuch a condition, and how I might fell 
into the hands of favages, and perhaps fuch as I 
might have reafon to think far worfe than the lions 
and tigers of Africa : that if I once came into their 
power, I fliould run an hazard more than a thoufand 
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten j 
for I had heard that the people of the Caribean coafts 
were cannibals, or men-eaters ; and I knew by the 
latitude that I could not be far off from that fliore : 
that, fuppofe they were not cannibals, yet they might 
kill me, as many Europeans who had fellen into their 
hands had been ferved, even when they had been ttn 
or twenty together ; much more I that was but one, 
and could make little or no defence. All thefe things, 
I fay, which I ought to have confidered well of, and 
I did caft up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took 
none of my apprehenfions at firft; and my head 
ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting over to 
that fhore. 

Now I wifhedfor myl3oy Xury^ and the long boat 
with the (houlder of mutton fail, with which I failed 
above a thoufand miles on the coaft of Africa ; but 
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and 
look on our fhip's boat, which, as I have faid, was- 
blown up upon the Ihore^ a great way in the ftorm, 
when we were firft caft away. She lay almoft where 
flie did at firft, but not quite ; and was turned by the 
force of the waves and the winds, almoft bottom 
upwards, againft the high ridge of a beachy rough 
fand, but no water about her as before. 

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have 
launched her into the water, the boat would have 

done 



158 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

done well enough, and I might have gone back into 
the Brafils with her eafy enough ; but I might have 
eafily forefeen, that I could no more turn her, and 
fet her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove 
the ifland. However I went to the wood, and cut 
leavers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, 
refolving to try what I could do ; (uggefling to my- 
felf, that if I could but turn her down, I might 
eafily repair the damage flie had received, and fhe 
would bd a very good boat, and I might go to fea in 
her very eafily. 

I fpared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitlefs toil, 
and fpent, I think, three or four weeks about it : at 
laft finding it impoflible to heave it up with my little 
ftrength, I fell to digging away the fand to under- 
mine it ; and fo to make it fall down, fetting pieces 
of wood to thruft and guide it right in the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it 
Up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move it 
forwards towards the water ; fo I was forced to give 
it over : and yet, though . 'I. gave over the hopes of 
the boat, my defire to venture over for the main 
increafed, rather than decteafed, as the means for it 
feemed impofTible. 

This at length fet me upon thinking whether it was 
not pofEble to make myfelf a canoe or pcriagua, fuch 
as the natives of thofe climates make, even without 
tools, or as I might fay, without hands, viz. of the 
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought 
poflible, but eafy ; and pleafed myfelf extremely with 
my thoughts of making it, and with my having 
much more convenience for it than any of the negroes 
or Indians; but not at all confidering the particular 

inconveniencics 



OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE. i ^^r 

incdnveniencies which I lay under more than the 
Indians did, viz. want of hands to move it into the 
water, when it was made ; a difficulty much harder 
for me to furmount than all the confequences of want 
of tools could be to them : for what was it to me, 
that when I had chofen a vaft tree in the woods, I 
might with great trouble cut it down, if, after I might 
be able with my tools to hew .and dub the out- 
fide into a proper Ihape of a boat, and burn or cut 
out the infide to make it hollow, fo to make a boat 
of it ; if, after all this, I mufl leave it juft there where 
I found it, and was not able to launch it into the 
water ? 

One would have thought, I could not have had 
the lead refledion upon my mind of my circumftances, 
while I was making my boat, but I fliould have 
immediately thought how I fhould get it into the fea j 
but my thoughts were fo intent upon my voyage 
over the fea in it, that I never once confidered how 
I fliould get it off the land j and it was really in its 
own nature more eafy for me to guide it over forty- 
five miles of fea, than about forty-five fathom of 
land, where it lay, to fet it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the mod like a fodl 
that ever man did, who had any of his fenfes awake. 
1 pleafed myfelf with the defign, without determining 
whether I was ever able to undertake it ; not but that 
the difficulty of launching my boat came often into 
my head ; but I put a ftop to my own inquiries into 
it by this foolifli anfwer, which I gave myfelf; Let 
me firft make it, FU warrant FU find fome way or 
other to get it along, when it is done* 

This 



t6o LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

This was a moft- prepofterous method ; but the 
eagernefs of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, 
;md felled a cedar-tree: I queftion much whether 
Solomon ever had fuch an ,one for the building the 
temple of yerufa/em. ; it was five feet ten inches dia- 
meter at the lower part next the flump, and four feet 
eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, 
after which it leffened for a while, and then parted 
into branches : It was not without infinite labour 
that I felled this tree : I was twenty days hacking 
and hewing at it at the bottom ; I was fourteen more 
getting the branches and limbs, and the vafl fpread- 
ing head of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed 
through with my axe and hatchet, with inexpreflible 
labour: after this it cofl me a month to Ihape it, 
and dub it to a proportion, and to fomething like the 
bottom of a boat, that it might fwim upright as it 
ought to do. It coft me near three months more to 
clear the infide, and work it out fo as to make an 
exa£t boat of it:' this I did indeed without fire, by 
mere mallet and chifTel, and by the dint of hard 
labour ; till I had brought it to be a very handfome 
periagita^ and big enough to have carried fix-and- 
twenty men, and confequently big enough to have 
carried me and all my cargo* 

When I had gone through this work, I was 
extremely delighted with it : the boat was really 
much bigger than I ever faw a canoe or periagua^ 
that was made of one tree, in my life ; many a weary 
ftroke it had coft, you may be fure, for there 
remained nothing but to get it into the water j and 
had I gotten it into the water, I make no queftion 
tut I fhould have begun the maddeft voyage, and the 
3 moft 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. . l6l 

moft unlikely to be performed, that ever was under- 
taken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed 
me, though they coft infinite labour too ; it lay 
about one hundred yards from the water, and not 
more; but the firft inconvenience was, it was up 
hill towards the creek: Well, to take away this 
difcouragement, I refolved to dig into the furface of 
the earth, and fo make a declivity ; this I began, 
and it coft me a prodigious deal of pains : but who 
grudge pains, that have their deliverance in view ? 
But when this was worked through, and this diffi- 
culty managed, it was ftill much at one; for I could 
no more ftir the canoe, than I could the other boat. 

Then I meafured the diftance of ground, and re- 
folved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water 
up to the canoe, feeing I could not bring the canoe 
down to the water : Well, I began this work, and 
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how 
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the ftuff to 
be thrown out, I found, that by the number of hands 
I had, being none but my own, it muft have been 
ten or twelve years before I fliould have gone through 
with it ; for the fhore lay high, fo that at the upper 
end it muft have been at leaft twenty feet deep ; fo 
at length, though with great reluftancy, I gave this 
attempt over alfo. 

This grieved me heartily; and now I faw, though 
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we 
count the coft, and before we judge rightly of our 
own ftrength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work I finiftied my fourth 
year in this place, and kept my anniverfary with the 

Vol. I. M fame 



tSd LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fame devotion, and with as much comfort, as ever 
before ; for by a conftant ftu&y, and ferious applica- 
tion of the word of God, and by the afSftance of his 
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I 
had before j I entertained different notions of things; 
I looked now upon the world as a thing remote; 
which I had nothing to do with, no expefkation 
from, and indeed no defires about: in a word, I 
had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like 
to have ; fo I thought it looked, as we may perhaps 
look upon it hereafter ; viz. as a place I had lived 
in, but was come out of it; and well I might fay, 
as father Abraham to Dives^ Between me and thee 
there is a great gulph fixed. 

In the firft place, I was removed from all the 
wickednefs of the world here: I had neither the 
luft of the flefh, the luft of the eye, or the pride of 
life : I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was now 
capable of enjoying : I was lord of the whole manor, 
or, if I pleafed, I might cajl myfelf king or emperor 
over the whole country which I had poffeflion of : 
there were no rivals : I had no competitor, none to 
difpute fovereignty or command with me ; I might 
have raifed fhip-loadings of 'corn, but I bad no ufe 
for it ; fo I let as little grow as I thought enough for 
my occafion : I had tortoifes, or turtles enough ; but 
now and then one was as much as I could put to 
any ufe : I had timber enough to have built a fleet 
of fhips ; I had grapes enough to have made wine, 
or to have cured into raifins, to have loaded that 
fleet when they had been built. 

But all I could make ufe of, was all that was valu- 
able : I had enough to eat, and to fupply my wants, 

and 



OF ROBIMSON CRUSOE. 163 

land what was all the reft to me? If I killed more 
flefli than I could eat, the dog muft eat it, or the 
vermin ; if I fowed more corn than I could eat, it 
muft be fpoiled : The trees that I cut down were 
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more 
ufe of them thaii for fuel ; and that I had no occafion 
for, but to drefs my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things 
dictated to me, upon juft reflexion, that all the good 
things of this world are no farther good to us, than as 
they are for our ufe : and that whatever we may heap 
up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much as we 
can ufe^ and no more. The moft covetous griping 
mifer in the world would have been cured of the vice 
of Govetoufnefs, if he had been in my cafe ; for I 
poffeffed infinitely more than I knew what to do with. 
I had no room for defire, except it was of things 
which I had not, and they were but trifles, though 
indeed of great ufe to me* I had, as I hinted before, 
a parcel of money, as well gold as filver, about thirty- 
fix pounds fterlihg ; alas! there the nafty, forry, ufe- 
lefs ftuff lay; I had no manner of bufinefs for it; and I 
often thought with myfelf, that I would have given 
an handful of it for a groce of tobacco-pipes, or for an 
nand-mill to grind my corn ; nay, I would have givoi 
it all for fix-penny worth bf turnip and carrot feed out 
oi England^ or for an handful of peas and beans, and 
a bottle of ink : a^ it was, I had not the leaft advan- 
tage by it, or benefit from it ; but there it lay in a 
drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, 
in the wet feafon ; and if I had had the drawer full of 
diamonds, it had been the fame cafe ; and they had 
been of no manner of value to me^ becaufe of no ufe. 

M ^ I had 



1^4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I had now brought my ftate of life to be much eafier 
in itfelf than it was at firft, and much eafier to my 
mind, as well as to my body. I frequently fat down 
to my meat with thankfulnefs, and admired the hand 
of GoD*s providence, which had thus fpread my table 
in the wildernefs : I learned to look more upon the 
bright fide of my condition, and lefs upon the dark 
fide; and to confider what I enjoyed, rather than 
what I wanted ; and this gave me fometimes fuch 
fecret comforts, that I cannot exprefs them; and 
which I take notice of here, to put thofe difcontented 
people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably 
what God hath given them, becaufe they fee and 
covet fomething that he has not given them : all our 
difcontents about what we want, appeared to me to 
fpring from the want of thankfulnefs for what we have. 

Another reflexion was of great ufe to me, and 
doubtlefs would be fo to any one that fhould fall into 
fuch diftrefs as mine was ; and this was, ta compare 
my prefent condition with what I at firft expefted it 
fhould be ; nay, with what it would certainly have 
been, if the good providence of God had not won- 
derfully ordered the fhip to be caft up near to the 
fhore, where I not only could come at her, but could 
bring what I got out of her to the fhore for my relief 
and comfort ; without which I had wanted tools to 
work, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and ihot 
for getting my food. 

I fpent whole hours, I may fay whole days, in re- 
prefenting to myfelf in the moft lively colours, how 
I muft have afted, if I had got nothing out of the 
fhip ; how I could not have fo much as got any food, 
except fifh and turtles j and that, as it was long before 

I found 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 65 

I found any of them, I mull have periflied firft : that 
I Ihould have lived, if I had not perilhed, like a mere 
favage : that if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any 
contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or 
part the flefli from the fkin and the bowels, or to cut 
it tip ; but muft gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it 
with my claws, like a beaft. 

Thefe refleftions made me very fenfible of the 
goodnefs of Providence to me, and very thankful 
for my prefent condition, with all its hardfhips and 
misfortunes : and this part alfo I cannot but recom- 
mend to the refleftion of thofe who are apt in their 
mifery to fay. Is any affliftion like mine ? Let them 
confider, how much worfe the cafes of fome people 
are, and what their cafe might have been, if Provi- 
dence had thought fit. 

I had another refledion which afllfted me alfo to 
comfort my mind with hopes ; and this was, com- 
paring my prefent condition with what I had de- 
ferved, and had therefore reafon to expedt from 
the hand of Providence ; I had lived a dreadful life, 
perfectly deftitute.of the knowledge and fear of God: 
I had been well inftru<^ed by my father and mother ; 
neither had they been wanting to me in their early 
endeavours, to infufe a religious awe of Goo into my 
mind, a fenfe of my duty, and of what the nature 
and end of my being required of me : But, alas ! 
falling early into the feafaring life, which of all the 
lives is the moft deftitute of the fear of God, though 
his terrors are always before them; I fay, falling 
early into the feafaring life, and into feafaring com-p 
pany, all that little fenfe of religion which I had en- 
tertained, was laughed out of me by my meffmates; 

M 3 by 



1 66 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

by an hardened defpifmg of dangers, and the views 
of death, which grew habitual to me ; 'by my long 
abfence from all manner of opportunities to converfc 
with any thing but what was like myfelf, or to hear 
any thing of what was good, or tended towards it. 

So void was I of every thing that was good, oj- of 
the lead fenfe of what I was, or was to be, that in 
the greateft deliverance I enjoyed, fuch as my efcape 
from SalleCy my being taken up by the Portuguefe 
mafter of the fhip, my being planted fo well in Bra^ 
Jtlj my receiving the cargo from England^ and the 
like, I never once had the words Thank God, fa 
much as on my mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the 
greateft diftrefs, had I fo much thought as to pray 
to him J nor fo much as to fay. Lord have mercy 
upon me ! No, not to mention the name of Gor^ 
unlefs it was to fwear by, and blafpheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many 
months, as I have already obferved, on the account 
of my wicked and hardened life paft ; and wfeen I 
looked about me, and confidered what particular 
Providences bad attended me, fince my coming into 
this place, and how God had dealt bountifully with 
me ; had not only puniftied me lefs than my iniquity 
deferved, but had fo plentifully provided for me; 
this gave me great hopes that my repentance ws^ 
accepted, and that Qqii had yet mercies in ftore fojr 
me. 

With thefe reflexions I worked my mind up, not 
only to refignation to the will of God in the prefent 
difpofition of my circumftances, but even to a fincere 
thankfulnefs of my condition ; and that I, who was 
yet a living man, ought not to compli^n, feeing I 
4 fea^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 167 

had not the due punifliment of my fins ; that I 
enjoyed fo many mercies, which I had no reafon to 
have expeOied in that place ; that I ought never more 
to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to give 
daily thanks, for that daily bread which nothing 
but a cloud of wonders could have brought : that 
I ought to confider I had been fed even by a miracle, 
even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens ; nay, 
by a long feries of miracles ; and that I could hardly 
have named a place in the uninhabited part of the 
world, where I could have been caft more to my 
advantage : a place, where as I had no fociety, which 
was my affliftion on one hand, fo I found no raven- 
ous beafts, no furious wolves or tygers, to threaten 
my life; no venomous creatures, or poifonous, which 
I might have fed on to my hurt; no favages to murder 
and devour me. 

In a word, as my life was a life of forrow one 
way, fo it was a life of mercy another : and I wanted 
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able 
to make my fenfe of God's goodnefs to me, and care 
over me in this condition, be my daily confolation ; 
and after I made a juft improvement of thefe things, 
I weiit away, and was no more fad. 

I had now been here fo long, that many things 
which I brought on fliore for my help, were either 
quite gone, or very much wafted, and near fpent. 

My ink, as I obferved, had been gone for fome 
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with wa* 
ter a little and a little, till it was fo pak it fcarce left 
any appearance of black upon the paper : as long as 
it lafted, I made ufe of it to minute down the days 
of the month on which any remarkable thing hap-»

pened to me; and fir ft, by cafting up times paft, I 
remember that there was a ftrange concurrence of 
days, in the various providences which befel me, 
and which, if I had been fuperfticioufly inclined to 
obferve days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had 
reafon to have looked upon with a great deal of 
curiofity. 

Firft, I had obferved, that the fame day that I 
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran 
away to Hull in order to go to fea, the fame day 
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and 
made a flave. 

The fame day of the year that I efcaped out of the 
wreck of that fliip in Yarmouth Roads ^ that fame day 
of the year afterwards I made my efcape from Sallee 
in the boat. 

The fame day of the year I was born on, viz. the 
2oth of September^ the fame day I had my life fo mi- 
raculoufly faved 26 years after, when I was caft on 
fliore in this ifland ; fo that my wicked life, and foli- 
tary life^ both began on a day. 

The next thing to my ink's being wafted, was that 
of my bread, I mean the bifcuit which I brought out 
of the fhip : This I had huftjanded to the laft degree, 
allowing myfelf but one cake of bread a day, for 
above a year : and yet I was quite without bread for 
a year before I got any corn of my own ; and great 
reafon I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the 
getting it being, as has been already obferved, next 
to miraculous. 

My clothes too began to decay mightily : as to 
linen, I had none a good while, except fome che- 
quered ftiirts which I found in the chefts of the other 

feamen. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 69 

feamen, and which I carefully preferved, becaufe 
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a 
fliirt; and it was a very great help to me, that I 
had among all the men's clothes of the fhip almoft 
three dozen of fhirts. There were alfo feveral thick 
watch-coats of the feamen, which were left behind, 
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is 
true, that the weather was fo violent hot, that these 
was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite 
naked ; no, though I had been inclined to it, which 
I was not; nor could I abide the thoughts of it, 
though I was all alone. 

One reafon why I could not go quite naked, was, 
I could not bear the heat of the fun fo well when 
quite naked, as with fome clothes on ; nay, the very 
heat frequently bliftered my (kin ; whereas, with a 
fhirt on, the air itfelf made fome motion, and whift- 
ling under the fhirt, was twofold cooler than without 
it : no more could I ever bring myfelf to go out in 
the heat of the fun without a cap or an hat ; the heat 
of the fun beating with fuch violence as it does in that 
place, would give me the head-ach prefently, by 
darting fo direftly on my head, without a cap or 
liat on, fo that I could not bear it ; whereas, if I 
put on my hat, it would prefently go away. 

Upon thefe views I began to conlider about putting 
the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into fome 
order ; I had worn out all the waiftcoats I had, and 
my bufinefs was now to try if I could not make 
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by 
me, and with fuch other materials as I had ; fo I fet 
to work a-tayloring, or rather indeed a-botching; 
for I made moft piteous work of it. However, I 

made 



170 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

made ftiift to make two or three waiftcoats, which I 
hoped would ferve me a great while ; as for breeches 
or drawers, I made but very forry fhift indeed, till 
afterwards. 

I have mentioned that I faved the Ikins of all the 
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones ; and 
I had hung them up ftretched out with fticks in the 
fun ; by which means fome of them were fo dry and 
hard, that they were fit for little ; but others, it 
feems, were very ufeful. The firft thing I made of 
thefe was a great cap for my head ; with the hair on 
the outfide to fhoot off the rain ; and this I performed 
fo well, that after this I made a fuit of clothes wholly 
of thofe Ikins ; that is to fay, a waiftcoat and breechea 
open at the knees, and both loofe ; for they were 
rather wanted to keep me cool, than to keep me 
warm. I muft not omit to acknowledge, that they 
were wretchedly made ; for if I was a bad carpenter^ 
I was a worfe taylor : however, they were fuch as I 
made a very good Ihift with ; and when I was abroad, 
if it happened to rain, the hair of the waiftcoat and 
cap being outmoft, I was kept very dry. 

After this I fpent a deal of time and pains to make 
me an umbrella : I was indeed in great want of 
one, and had a great mind to make one : I had feen 
them made in the Braftls^ where they are very ufeful 
in the great heats which are there ; and I felt the 
heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being 
nearer the equinox; befides, as I was obliged to be 
much abroad, it was a moft ufeful thing to me, as 
well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of 
pains at it, and was a great while before I could 
make any thing likely to hold ; nay, after I thought; 

I had 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I7I 

I had hit the way, I fpoiled two or three before I 
made one to my mind j but at lail I made one that 
anfwered indifferently well; the main difficulty I 
found was to make it to let down. I could make it 
to fpread ; but if it did not let down too, and draw 
in, it would not be portable for me any way, but juft 
over my head, which would not do : However, at 
laft, as I faid, I made one to anfwer ; I covered it 
with fkins, the hair upwards, fo that it caft off the 
rain like a pent-houfe, and kept off the fun fo effec- 
tually, that I could walk out in the hottefl of the 
weather, with greater advantage than I could before 
in the cooleft j and when I had no need of it, I could 
clofe it, and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being 
entirely compofed by refigning to the will of God, 
and throv/ing myfelf wholly upon the difpofal of his 
Providence : this made my life better than fociable ; 
for when I began to regret the want of converfation, 
I would afk myfelf, whether thus converfmg mutually 
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, I may fay, 
with even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions, 
was not better than the utmoft enjoyment of human 
fociety in the world ? 

I cannot fay, that after this, for five years, any 
extraordinary thing happened to me ; but I lived on 
in the fame courfe, in the fame pofture and place 
juft as before : the chief thing I was employed in, 
befides my yearly labour of planting my barley and 
rice, and curing my raifins, of both which J always 
Kept up juft enough to have fufiicient ftock of the 
year's provifions before-hand; I fay, befides this 
yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out 

with 



ly^ LIFE AND ADVENTURES , 

with my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe, 
which at laft I finiftied : fo that by digging a canal to 
it, fix feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into 
the creek, almofl half a mile. As for the firft, that 
was fo vaftly big, as I made it without confidering 
beforehand, as I ought to do, how I fhould be able 
to launch it ; fo never being able to bring it to the 
water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let ^ 
it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach me 
to be wifer next time. Indeed the next time, though 
I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a 
place where I could not get the water to it, at any 
lefs diftance than, as I have faid, of near half a mile ; 
yet as I faw it was prafticable at laft, I never gave it 
over ; and though I was near two years about it, yet 
I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having a 
boat to go off to fea at laft. 

However, though my little periagua was finifhed, 
yet the fize of it was not at all anfwerable to the 
defign which I had in view, when I made the firft.; 
I mean of venturing over to the terra jirma^ where 
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the 
fmallnefs of my boat affifted to put an end to that 
defign, and now I thought no more of it : But as I 
had a boat, my next defign was to make a tour round 
the ifland ; but as I had been on the other fide, in one 
place, croffmg, as I have already defcribed it, over 
the land, fo the difcoveries I made in that journey 
made me very eager to fee the other parts of the 
coaft ; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing 
but failing round the ifland. 

For this purpofe, and that I might do every thing 
with difcretion and confideration, I fitted up a little 

maft 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I73 

maft to my boat, and made a fail to it out of fome 
of the pieces of the Ihip's fails, which lay in ftore, 
and of which I had a great ftore by me. 

Having fitted my maft and fail, and tried the 
boat, I found fhe would fail very well: Then I 
made little lockers and boxes at each end of my 
boat, to put provifions, neceffaries, and ammunition^ 
&c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or the 
fpray of the fea; and a little long hollow place I 
cut in the infide of the boat, where I could lay my 
gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep it 
dry. 

I fixed my umbrella alfo in a ftep at the ftern, like 
a maft, to ftand over my head, and keep the heat 
of the fun oflf me, like an awning ; and thus I every 
now and then took a little voyage upon the fea, but 
never went far out, nor far from the little creek; 
but at laft, being eager to view the circumference of 
my little kingdom, I refolved upon my tour, and 
accordingly I 'viftualled my fhip for the voyage; 
putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes I ihould 
rather call them) of barley-bread ; an earthen pot 
full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal of j a 
little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder with 
Ihot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of 
thofe which, as I mentioned before, I had faved out 
of the feamen's chefts ; thefe I took, one to lie upon, 
and the other to cover me in the night. 

It was the fixth of November^ in the fixth year of 
my reign, or my captivity, which you pleafe, that I 
fet out on this voyage, and I found it much longer 
than I expefted : for though the ifland itfelf was not 
very large, yet when I came to the eaft fide of it, I 

found 



174 ^I^JS AND ADVENTURE^ 

fbuiid a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues 
into the fea, fotne above water^ fome under It ; and 
beyond this a fhoal of fand, lying dry half a league 
more ; fo that I was obliged to go a great way out 
to fea to double that point* 

When I firft difcovered them j I wks going to give 
over my enterprize, and come back again, not know- 
ing how far it might oblige me to go out to fea^ and 
above all, doubting how I ihould get back again ; fo 
I came to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an 
anchor with a piece of broken grappling which I got 
out of the fhip. 

Having fecured my boat, I took my gun, and 
went on fhore, climbing up an hill, which feemed 
to overlook that point, where I faw the full extent 
of it, and refolved to venture. 

In my viewing the fea from that hill where t (iood, 
I perceived a ftrong^ and indeed, a moft furious cur- 
rent, which ran to the eaft, even came clofe to the 
point ; and I took the more notice of it, becaufe I 
faw there might be fome danger, that when I came 
into it, I might be carried out to fea by the ftrength 
of it, and not be able to make the ifland again : And 
indeed, had I not gotten firft upon this hill, I believe 
it would have been fo ; for there was the fame cur- 
rent on the other fide of the ifland, only that it fet 
it off at a farther diftance ; and I faw there was a 
ftroiig eddy under the Ihore 5 fo I had nothing to do 
but to get out of the firft current, and I fhould pre- 
fently be in an eddyi 

I lay here, however, two days j becaufe the wind 
blowing pretty frefh (E. at S. E. and that being juft 
contrary to the faid current) made a great breach of 

the 



t>v ROBINSON CRUSOE* iys 

f 

tile fea upon the point ; fo that it was not fafe for 
me to keep too clofe to the Ihore for the breach, nor 
to go too far off becaufe of the ftream. 

The third day in the morning, the wind having 
abated over nigjit, the fea was calm, and I ventured ; 
but I am a warning-piece again to all rafli and ignorant 
pilots ; for no fooner was I come to the point, when 
I was not my boat's length from the Ihore, but 
I found myfelf in a great depth of water, and a 
current like the fluice of a mill : It carried my boat 
along with it with fuch violence, that all I could do 
could not keep her fo much as on the edge of it : but 
I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the 
eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no 
wind ftirring to help me, and all that I could do with 
my paddles fignified nothing ; and now I began to 
give myfelf over for loft ; for, as the current was on 
both fides the ifland, I knew in a few leagues diftance 
they muft join again, and then I was irrecoverably 
gone ; nor did I fee any poflibility of avoiding it : fo 
that I had no profpeft before me but of perifhing ; 
not by the fea, for that was calm enough, but of 
ftarving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoife 
on the fhore, as big almoft as I could lift, and had 
toffed it into the boat ; and I had a great jarr of frefli 
water, that is to fay, one of my earthen pots : but 
what was all this to being driven into the vaft ocean; 
where, to be fure, there was no fhore, no main land 
or ifland, for a thoufand leagues at leaft ! 

And now I faw how eafy it was for the Providence 
of God to make the moft miferable condition that 
mankind could be in, worfe. Now I looked back 
upon my defolate folitary ifland, as the moft 

pleafant 



176 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

pleafant place in the world, and all the happinefs my 
heart could wifh for, was to be there again : I ftretched 
out my hands to it with eager wifhes; O happy 
defart, faid I, I fhall never fee thee more; O 
miferable creature! faid I, whither am I going! 
Then I reproached myfelf with my unthankful temper, 
and how I had repined at my folitary condition ; and 
now what would I give to be on fhore there again ? 
Thus v/e never fee the true ftate of our condition, 
till it is illuftrated to us by its contraries ; nor know 
how to value what; we enjoy, but by the want of it : 
it is fcarce pofEble to imagine the confternation I was 
now in, being driven from my beloved ifland (for fa 
it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, 
alraoll two leagues, and in the utmoll defpair of ever 
recovering it again : however, I worked hard, till 
indeed my ftrength was almoft exhaufted; and kept 
my boat as much to the northward, tliat is,' towards 
the fide of the current which the eddy lay on, as 
poffibly I could ; when about noon, as the fun paffed 
the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind 
in my face, fpringing up from the S. S. E. This 
cheared my heart a little, and efpecially when in 
about half an hour more it blew a pretty fmall gentle 
gale. By this time I was gotten at a frightful diftance 
from the ifland ; and, had the leaft cloud or hazy 
weather intervened, I had been undone another way 
too; for I had no compafs on board, and fliould 
never have kiK)wn how to- have fleered towards the 
ifland, if I had but once loft fight of it; but the 
weather continuing clear, I applied myfelf to get up 
my maft again^ and fpread my fail, ftanding away 
to the north as much as poflible, to get out of the 
current. 



01^ ROBINSON CRUSOE. I77 

Juft as I had fet my mad and fail, and the boat 
began to ftretch away, I faw even by the clearnefs of 
the water, fome alteration of the current was near ; 
for where the current was fo ftrong, the water was 
foul J but perceiving the water clear, I found the 
current abate, and prefently I found to the eaft, at 
about half a mile, a breach of the fea upon fome 
rocks; thefe rocks I found caufed the current to 
part again; and as the main ftrefs of it ran away 
more foutherly, leaving the rocks to the north-eaft, 
fo the other returned by the repulfe of the rock, and 
made a ftrong eddy, which ran back again to the 
north-weft with a very fliarp ftream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve 
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be refcued 
from thieves juft going to murder them, or who 
have been in fuch like extremities, may guefs what 
my prefent furprife of joy was, and how gladly I put 
my boat into the ftream of this eddy ; and the wind 
alfo frefhening,,how gladly I fpread my fail to it, run- 
ning chearfuUy before the wind, and vdth a ftrong 
tide or eddy under foot. 

This eddy carried - me about a league in my way 
back again diredly towards the ifland, but about 
two leagues more towards the northward than the 
current lay, which carried me away at firft; fo that 
when I came near the ifland, I found myfelf open to 
the northern ftiore of it, that is to fay, the other end 
of the ifland, oppofite to that which I went out from. 

When I had made fomething more than a league 
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found 
it was fpent, and faved me no farther. However, I

lyS LITE AKD ADVENTURES 

found, that being between the two great currents, 
vh. that on the fouth fide which had hurried me 
away, and that on the north, which lay about two 
leagues on the other fide ; I fay, between thefc two, 
in the weft of the ifland, I found the water at leaft 
ftill, and running no way j and having ftill a breeze 
of wind fair for me, I kept on. fteering direftly for 
the ifland, though not making fuch frefli way as I 
did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then 
within about a league of the ifland, I found the 
point of the rocks which occafioned this diftance, 
ftretching out as is defcribed before, to the fouth- 
ward, and, cafting oflf the current more foutherly^ 
had of courfe made another eddy to the north ; and 
this I found very ftrong, but direftly fetting the way 
my courfe lay, which was due weft, but almoft full 
north. However, having a frefli gale, I ftretched 
acrofs this eddy, flanting north-weft, and in about aix 
hour came within about a mile of the fliore, where, 
it being fmooth water, I foon got to land. 

When I was on fliore, I fell on my knees, and 
gave God thanks for my deliverance, refolving to 
lay afide all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; 
and rcfrefliing myfelf with fuch things as I had, I 
brought my boat clofe to the fliore, in a little cove 
that I had efpied under fome trees, and laid me 
down to fleep, being quite fpent with the labour and 
fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great lofs which way to get home 
with my boat ; I had run fo much hazard, and knew 
too much the cafe to think of attempting it by the 

way 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1 79 

way I went out ; and what might be at the other fide 
(I mean the weft fide) I knew not, nor had I any 
mind to run any more ventures } fo I only refolved 
in the morning to make my way weftward along the 
fliore, and to fee if there was no creek where I might 
lay up my frigate in fafety, fo as to have her again if 
I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, 
coafting the fhore, I came to a very good inlet, or 
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came 
to a very little rivulet, or brook, where I found a 
convenient harbour for my boat, and where (he lay 
as if fhe had been in a little dock made on purpofe 
for her ; here I put in, and having flowed my boat 
very fafe, I went on fhore to look about me, and fee 
where I was. 

I foon found I had but a little paflTed by the place 
where I had been before when I travelled on foot to 
that fhore ; fo taking nothing out of my boat but my 
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I 
began my march : the way was comfortable enough 
after fuch a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached 
my old bower in the evening, where I found every 
thing ftanding as I left it ; for I always kept it in 
good order, being, as I faid before, my country- 
houfe. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the 
fhade to reft my limbs, for I *was very weary, and 
fell afleep : but judge you, if you can, that read my 
ftory, what a furprife I mufl be in, when I was 
awaked out of my fleep by a voice calling me by my 
name feveral times,/ Robin^ Robin, Robin Crufoej 
poor Robin Crufoe ! Where are you, Robin Crufoe? 
Where are you ? Where have you been ?

l8a LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

I was. fo dead afleep at firft, being fatigued with 
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the firft part of 
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did not 
awake thoroughly ; and dozing between fleeping and 
waking, thought I dreamed that fomebody fpoke to 
me: but as the voice continued to repeat Robin 
Crufoe^ Robin Crufoe^ at laft I began to awake 
more perfedly, and was at firft dreadfully frighted, 
and ftarted up in the utmoft confternation : but no 
fooner were my eyes open, but I faw my Roll fitting 
on the top of the hedge, and immediately knew that 
this was he that fpoke to me ; for juft in fuch be- 
moaning language I had ufed to talk to him, and 
teach him ; and he had learned It fo perfedly, that 
he would fit upon my finger, and lay his bill clofe 
to my face, and cry. Poor Robin CrufoCy Where 
are you ? Where have you been ? How: came you

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, 
and that indeed it could be nobody elfe, it was a good 
while before I could compofe myfelf. Firft, I was 
amazed how the creature got thither, and then how 
hefhouldjuft keep about the place, and no where' 
elfe : but as I was well fatisfied it could be nobody 
but honeft Poll^ I got it over ; and holding out my 
hand, and calling him by his name, Poll^ the focia-

as he ufed to do, and continued talking to me. Poor

Ihad 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. l8l 

I had now had enough of rambling to fca for fome 
time, and had enough to do for many days to fit.ftill, 
and refleO: upon the danger I had been in : I would 
have been very glad to have had my boat again on 
my fide of the ifland, but I knew not how it was 
pradicable to get it about : as to the eaft-fide of the 
ifland, which I had gone round, I knew well enough 
there was no venturing that way ; my very heart 
would fhrink, and my very blood run chill, but to 
think of it : and to the other fide of the ifland, I did 
not know how it might be there ; but fuppofing the 
current ran with the fame force againft the fliore at 
the eaft, as it paflfed by it on the other, 1 might run 
the fame rifque of being driven down the ftream, and 
carried by the ifland, as I had been before of being 
carried away from it : fo with thefe thoughts I con- 
tented myfelf to be without any boat, though it had 
been the produft of fo many months labour to make 
it, and of fo many more to get it into the fea. 

In this government of my temper I remained near 
a year, lived a very fedate retired life, as you may 
well fuppofe; and my thoughts being very much 
compofed, as to my condition, and fully comforted 
in refigning myfelf to the difpofitions of Providence, 
I thought I lived really very happily in all things, 
except that of fociety. 

I improved myfelf, in this time, in all the mechanic 
exercifes which my nieceflities put me upon applying 
myfelf to ; and I believe could, upon occafion, have 
made a very good carpenter, efpecially confidering 
how few tools I had, 

Befides this, I arrived at an unexpeded perfeftion 
in my earthen ware, and contrived well enough to 

N 3 make 



X82 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

make thfcm with a wheel, which I found infinitely 
cafier and better ; becaufe I made things round and 
Ihapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to 
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my 
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I 
found out, than for my being able to make a 
tobacco-pipe ; and though it was a very ugly clumfy 
thing when it was done, and only burnt red like other 
earthen-ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would 
draw the fmoke, I was exceedingly comforted with 
it ; for I had been always ufed to fmoke, and there 
were pipes in the fhip, but I forgot them at firft, not 
knowing there was tobacco in the ifland j and after- 
wards, when I fearched the fhip again, I could not 
come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker- ware I alfo improved much, and 
made abundance of neceffary bafkets, as well as my 
invention fhewed me, though not very handfome, 
yet convenient for my laying things up in, or fetcK-* 
ing things home in. For example, if I killed a goat 
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and 
drefs it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a 
bafket ; and the like by a turtle ; I could cut it up, 
take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flefli, 
which was enough for me, and bring them home in 
a ba{ket, and leave the reft behind me : alfo large 
deep balkets were my receivers for my corn, which I 
always rubbed out as foon as it was dry, and cured j 
and kept it in great balkets inftead of a granary. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated con- 
fiderably; and this was a want which it was im- 
poffible for me to fupply: then I began ferioufly to 
confider what I muft do wh^n I ftiould have no more 

powder i 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183. 

powder ; that is to fay, how I fliould do to kill any 
goats. I had, as I obferved, in the third year of my 
being here, kept a young kid, and bred her tame ; 
I was in hopes of getting an he kid, but I could not 
by any means bring it to pafs, till my kid grew an 
old goat ; and I could never find in my heart to kill 
her,^ till fhe died at laft of mere age* 

But being now in the eleventh year of my refidence, 
ami, as I have faid, my ammunition growing low, I 
fct myfelf to ftudy fome art to trap and fnare the goats, 
to fee whether I could not catch fome of them alive ; 
and particularly I wanted a fhe-goat great with young. 

To this purpofe I made fnares to hamper them ; 
and believe they were more than once taken in them; 
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and 
always found them broken, and my bate devoured. 

At length I refolved to try a pit-fall ; fo I dug 
feveral large pits in the earth, in places where I had 
obfen^ed the goats ufed to feed, and over thefe pits 
I placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great 
weight upon them ; and feveral times I put ears of 
barley, and dry rice, without fetting the trap ; and 
I could eafily perceive that the goats had gone in, 
and eaten up the corn, that I could fee the mark of 
their feet : at length, I fet three traps in one night, 
and going the next morning, I found them all ftand-« 
ing, and yet the bait eaten and gone : this was very 
difcouraging ; however, I altered my trap ; and, not 
to trouble you with particulars, going one morning 
^ to fee my traps, I found in one of them a large old 
he-goat ; and, in one of the other, three kids, a 
male and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with 
bifn J he was fo fierce I durft not go into the pit to 

N 4 him J 



ti8f4 l.r?E AND ADVENTURES 

him ; that is to fay, to go about to bring him away 
^live, which was what I wanted ; I could have killed 
him, but that was not my bufmefs, nor would it 
anfwer my end ; fo I e'en let him out, and he ran 
away as if he had been frightened out of his wits ; 
but I did not then know what I afterwards learned, 
that hunger would tame a lion : if I had let him flay 
there three or four days without food, and then have 
Carried him fome water to drink, and then a little 
corn, he would have been as tame as one of the 
kids ; for they are mighty fagacious, traftable crea* 
tures, where they are well ufed. 

However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing 
no better at that time; then I went to the three 
kids ; and taking them one by one, I tied them with 
ftrings together ; and with fome difficulty brought 
them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but 
throwing them fome fweet corn, it tempted them, 
and they began to be tame ; and now I found, that 
if I expefted to fupply myfelf with goats-flefh, when 
1 had no powder or fhot left, breeding fome up tame 
was my only way, when perhaps I might have then^ 
about my houfe like a flock of fh^ep, 

But then it prefently occurred to me, that I muft 
keep the tame from the wild, or elfe they would 
always run wild when they grew up ; and the only 
way for this was to have fome inclofed piece of 
ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, tQ 
keep them up fo efFeftually, that thofe within might 
|ipt break out, or thofe without break in. 
,^ This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands j 
yet as I faw there was an abfolute neceffity of doing 
it, xjiy firft piece of work was to find out a proper 

pi^cQ 



OF ROBIKSON CRUSO£. I&J 

piece of ground; viz. where there was likely to be 
herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink^ 
and cover to keep them from the fun. "^ 

Thofe who underftand fuch inclofures, will think 
I had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a 
place very proper for all thefe, being a plain open 
piece of meadow-land or favanna (as our people call 
it in the weftern colonies) which had two or three 
little drills of frefh water in it, and at one end was 
very woody ; I fay they will fmile at my forecaft, 
when I fliall tell them I began my inclofmg of this 
piece of ground in fuch a manner, that my hedge, or 
pale, muft have been at leaft two miles about ; nor 
was the madnefs of it fo great as to the compafs ; for 
if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time 
enough to do it in ; but I did not confider, that my 
goats would be as wild in fo much compafs, as if 
they had had the whole ifland ; and I Ihould have fo 
much room to chafe them in, that I fhould never 
catch them. 

My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, 
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to mej 
fo I prefently flopped fliort, and for the firft begin, 
ning 1 refolved to inclofe a piece of about 1 50 yards 
in length, and xoo yards in breadth, which as it 
would maintain as many as I Ihould have in any rea- 
fonable time, fo, as my flock increafed, I could add 
ynore ground to my inclofure. 

This was ading with fome prudence, and I went 
to work with courage : I was about three months 
hedging in the firft piece ; and, till I had done it, I 
tethered the three kids in the beft part of it, and ufed 
them to feed as near me as poflible, to make them 
iamiliar ; and very often I would go and carry them 

4 fome 



' i86 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fome ears of barley, or an handful of rice, and feed 
them out of my hand ; fo that after my inclofure was 

• finilhed, and I let them loofe, they would follow me 
up and down, bleating nfter me for an handful of corn. 

This anfwered my end, and in about a year and a 
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all ; 
and in two years more I had three-and-forty, befides 
feveral that I took and killed for my food ; and after 

• that I inclofed five feveral pieces of ground to feed 
" 'them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take 

them as I wanted them ; and gates out of one piece 
of ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's 
flefh to feed on when I pleafed, but milk too, a thing 
which indeed in my beginning I did not fo much as 
think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, 
was really an agreeable furprife ; for now 1 fet up 
my dairy, and had fometimes a gallon or two of milk 
in a day. And as Nature, who gives fupplies of food 
to every creature, diftates even naturally how to 
make ufe of it ; fo I, that never milked a cow, much 
lefs a goat, or faw butter or cheefe made, very 
readily and handily, though after a great many eflfays 
and mifcarriages, made me both butter and cheefe 
' at laft, and never wanted it afterwards. 

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his 

'creatures, even in thofe conditions in which they 

-feemed to be overwhelmed in tleftruftion ! How can 

he fweeten the bittereft providences, and give us 

caufe to praife him for dungeons and prifons ! What

I had the lives of all my fubjefts at abfolute com- 
mand J I could hang, draw, give life and liberty, and 
take it away, and no rebels among all my fubjefts ! 

Then to fee how like a king I dined too, all alone, 
attended by my fervants ! PoJy as if he had been my 
favourite, as the only perfon permitted to talk to me ; 
my dog, which was now grown veryoldand crazy, and 
found no fpecies to multiply his kind upon, fat always 
at my right-hand ; and two cats, one on one fide the 
table, and one on the other, expefting now and thea 
a bit from my hand, as a mark of fpecial favour. 

But thefe were not the two cats which I brought 
on ihore at firft j for they were both of them dead, 
and had been interred near my habitation by my own 
hands ; but one of them having multiplied by I know 
not what kind of creature, thefe were two which I 
preferved tame, whereas the reft ran wild into the 
woods, and became indeed troublefome to me at 
kft J for they would often come into my houfe, and 
plunder me too, till at laft I was obliged to (hoot 
them, and did kill a great many ; at length they left 
me with this attendance, and in this plentiful man- 
ner I lived ; neither could I be faid to want any 
thing but fociety, and of that, in fome time after 
this, I was like to have too much, 

I was fomething impatient, as I had obferved, to 
have the ufe of my boat, though very loth to run 
any more hazard ; and therefore fometimes I fat 
contriving ways to get her about the ifland, and at 
other times I fat myfelf down contented enough 
without her. But I had a ftrange uneafinefs in my 
mind to go 4own to the point of the ifland, where,

l88 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

^s I have faid in my lall ramble, I went up the hill 
to fee how the fliore lay, and how the current fet, 
ihat I might fee what I had to do : this inclination 
increafed upon me every day ; and at length I refolved 
jto travel thither by land, and following the edge of 
the fliore, I did fo : but had any one in England been 
to meet fuch a man as I was, it muft either have 
frighted them, or raifed a great deal of laughter ; 
gnd as I frequently flood ftill to look at myfelf, I 
could not but fmile at the notion of my travelling 
through Torkjhire with fuch an equipage, and in 
fuch a drefs. Be pleafed to take a iketch of my 
figure, as follows : 

I had a great high fliapelefs cap, made of goat's- 
ikin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to 
keep the fun from me, as to flioot the rain off from 
Tunning into my neck ; nothing being fo hurtful in 
thefe climates, as the rain upon the flefli under thq 
clothes. 

I had a fliort jacket of goat's-flvin, the flcirts coming 
dov/n to about the middle of my thighs j and a pair of 
open-kneed breeches of the fame : the breeches were 
made of a fliin of an old he-goat, whofe hair hung 
down fuch a length on either fide, that, like panta- 
loons, it reached to the middle of my legs* Stockings 
and ftioes I had none ; but I had made me a pair of 
fomething, I fcarce knew what to call them, like 
buflcins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either fide 
like fpatterdaflies ; but of a mod barbarous fliape, as 
indeed were all the reft of my clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's-flcin dried, which I 
drew together with two thongs of the fame, inftead 
i>f buckles J ^ and in ^ kind of a frog on either fide of 

y this, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 189 

this, Inftead of a fword and dagger, hung a little faw 
and a hatchet ; one on one fide, one on the other : I 
had another belt not fo broad, and fattened in the 
fame manner, which hung over my Ihoulder ; and 
at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two 
pouches, both made of goat's-fkin too ; in one of 
which hung my powder, in the other my fhot : at 
my back I carried my balket, on. my fhoulder my 
gun, and over my head a great clunJy ugly goat*s- 
Ikin umbrella, but which, after :all, was th^ moft 
neceflary thing I had about me, ncjxt to my gun : as 
for my face, the colour of it was really not fo Mulatto 
like, as one might expeO: from a man not at all 
careful of it, and living within niii e or ten degrees of 
the equinox. My beard I had on( :e fuffered to grow 
till it was about a quarter of a y: ird long ; but as I 
had both fciflars and razors fufficient, I had cut itf 
pretty fhort, except what grew on my upper lip, 
which I had trimmed into a larg e pair of Mahometan 
whilkers, fuch has I had feen \ vorn by fome Turks 
whom I faw at Bailee : for the 1 Vloors did not wear 
fuch, though the Turks did : of 1 hefe muftachios, or 
whilkers, I will not fay they w ere long enough to 
hang my hat upon them ; but t hey were of length 
and fhape monftrous enough, an< 1 fuch as in England 
would have paffed for frightfuL ^ 

But all this is by the bye ; foi • as to my figure, I 
had fo few to obferve me, that it was of no manner 
of confequence ; fo I fay no more t o that part : in this 
kind of figure I went my new joi irney, and w^s out 
five or fix days. I travelled firft : ilong the fea-fhore, 
diredly to the place where I firft I )rought my boat to 
an anchor, to get up upon the r< )cks ; and, having 

no 



ipo LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

no boat now to take care of, I went over the land 
a nearer way, to the fame height that I was upon 
before; when looking forward to the point of the 
rock which lay out, and which I was to double with 
my boat, as I faid above, I was furprifed to fee the 
fea all fmooth and quiet; no ripling, no motion, 
no current, any more there than in other places. 

I was at a ftrange lofs to underftand this, and re- 
folved to fpehd fome time in the obferving of it, to 
fee if nothing from the fets of the tide had occafioned 
it: but I was prefently convinced how it was ; viz. 
that the tide of ebb fetting from the weft, and join-i 
ing with the current of waters from fonle great river 
on the fhore, muft be the occafion of this current ; 
and that according as the wind blew more forcible 
from the weft, or from the north, this current came 
near, or went farther from the fhore ; for, waiting 
thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, 
and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly faw 
the current again as before, only that it ran farther 
oflF, being near half a league from the fhore ; whereas 
in my cafe, it fet clofe upon the fhore, and hurried 
me in my canoe along with it, which at another time 
it would not have done. 

This obfervation convinced me, that I had nothing 
to do but to obferve the ebbing and the flowing of the 
tide, and I might very eafily bring my boat about 
the ifland again: but when I began to think of put- 
ting it in praftice, I had fuch a terror upon my fpirits 
at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, 
that I could not think of it again with any patience ; 
but on the contrary, I took up another refolution, 

which 



OF HOBIKSOll CRUSOE. 191 

wHch was more (afe, though more laborious ; and 
this was, that I would build, or rather make me 
another periagua^ or canoe ; and fo have one for 
one fide of the ifland, and one for the other. 

You are to underftand^ that now I had, as I may 
call it, two plantations in the ifland ; one my little 
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under the 
rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time 
I had enlarged into feveral apartments or caves, one 
within another. One of thefe, which was the drieft 
and largefl:, and had a door out beyond my wall or 
fortification, that is to fay, beyond where my wall 
joined to the rock, was all filled up with large ear- 
then pots, of which I have given an accoimt, and 
with fourteen or fifteen great balkets, which woiJd 
hold five or fix bufliels each, where I laid up my 
ftores of provifion, efpecially my com, fome in the 
ear cut oflF fhort from the fl:raw, and the other rubbed 
out with my hands. 

As for my wall, made as before, with long ftakes 
or piles, thofe piles grew all like trees, and were by 
this time grown fo big, and fpread fo very much, 
that there was not the leaft appearance, to any one's 
view, of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther 
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my 
two pieces of corn ground ; which I kept duly cul- 
tivated and fowed, and which duly yielded me their 
harveft in its feafon : and whenever I had occafion for 
more com, I had more land adjoining as fit ais 
that. 

Befides this, I had my country-feat, and I had now 
a tolerable plantation there alfo ; for firft, I had my 

little 



lg2 LITE AND ADVENTURES 

little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair ; 
that is to fay, I kept the hedge which circled it hr, 
conftantly fitted up to its ufual height, the ladder 
ftanding always in the infide ; I kept the trees, which 
at firfl: were no more than my flakes, but were now 
grown very firm and tall ; I kept them always fo 
cut, that they might fpread and grow thick and wild, 
and make the more agreeable fhade, which they did 
effedually to my mind. In the middle of thi$ I had 
my tent always ftanding, being a piece of a fail 
fpread over poles fet up for that purpofe, and which 
never wanted any impair or renewing; and under 
this I had made me a fquab or couch, with the 
fkins of the creatures I had killed, and with other 
foft things, and a blanket laid on them, fuch as 
belonged to our fea-bedding, which I had faved, and 
a great watch-coat to cover me ; and here, whenever 
I had occafion to be abfent from my chief feat, I took 
up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my inclofures for my 
cattle, that is to fay, my goats : And as I had taken 
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and inclofe 
this ground, I was fo uneafy to fee it kept entire, 
left the goats ftiould break through, that I never left 
off, till with infinite labour I had ftuck the outfide of 
the hedge fo full'of fmall ftakes, and fo near to one 
another, that it was rather a pale than an hedge, and 
there was fcarce room to put an hand through 
between them, which afterwards, when thofe ftakes 
grew, as they all did in the next rainy feafon, made 
the inclofure ftrong, like a wall, indeed ftronger than 
any wall. 

This

*rhis "Will teftify for me that I was not idle, and 
ttat I fpared no pains to bring to pafs whatever ap- 
peared neceffary for my comfortable fupport ; for I 
confidered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures 
thus at my hand, would be a living magazine of flefh^ 
milk, butter and cheefe, for me, as long as I lived 
in the place, if it were to be forty years ; and that 
keeping them in my reach, depended entirely upon 
my perfecting my inclofures to fuch a degree, that I 
might be fure of keeping them together ; which by 
this method indeed I fo effeftually fecured, that when 
thefe little flakes began to grow, I had planted them 
fo very thick, I was forced to pull fome of them up 
again. 

In this place alfo I had my grapes growing, which 
I principally depended on for my winter (lore of rai- 
fins, and which I never failed to preferye very care* 
fully, as the beft and moft agreeable dainty of my 
whole diet; and indeed they were not only agreeable, 
but phyfical, wholefome, nourifhing and refrefhing 
to the laft degree. 

As this was alfo about half way between my 
other habitation and the place where I had laid up 
my boat, I generally ftaid and lay here in my way 
thither ; for I ufed frequently to vifit my boat, and 
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very 
good order : fometimes I went out in her to divert 
myfelf, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, 
nor fcarce ever above a ftone^s cad or two from the 
fhore, I was fo apprehenfive of being hurried out of 
my knowledge again by the currents, or winds, or 
any other accident : But now I come to a new fcene 
of my life. 

Vol. I. O It 



194 I-IFE AND ADVENTURES 

It happened one day about noon, going towards 
my boat, I was exceedingly furprifed with the print 
of a man's naked foot on the {hore, which was very 
plain to be feen in the fand : I ftood like one thunder- 
Itruck, or as if I had feen an apparition ; I liftened, 
I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor fee 
any thing ; I went up to a rifing jgrbund to look 
farther : I went up the fhore, and down the fhore, 
but it was all one, I could fee no other impreffion 
but that one: I went to it again to fee if there 
were any more, and to obferve if it might not be 
my fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there 
was exaftly the very print of a foot, . toes, . heel, and 
every part of a foot ; how it came thither I knew 
not, nor could in the leaft imagine* But after in- 
numerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly 
confufed, and out of myfelf, I came home to my 
fortification, not feeling, as we fay, the ground I. 
went on, but terrified to the laft degree, looking 
behind, me at every two or three fteps, miftaking 
every bufli and tree, and fancying every flump at a 
diftance to be a man; nor is it poffible to. defcribe 
how many various fhapes an affrighted imagination 
reprefented things to me in ; how 'many wild ideas, 
were formed every moment iri my fimCy, and what 
ftrange unaccountable whimfies came into my. 
thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my caftle, for fo I think I called 
it ever after this, 1 fled into it like one purfued; 
v/hether I went over by the ladder, as firfl: contrived, 
or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a 
door, I cannot remember j for never frighted hare

fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror o£ 
mind than I to this retreat. 

I had no fleep that night : the farther I was from 
the occafion of my fright, the greater my apprehen- 
fions were ; which is foitiething contrary to the 
nature of fuch things, and efpecially to the ufual 
praftice of all creatures in fear : But I was fo em- 
barraffed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, 
that I formed nothing but difmal imaginations to 
myfelf, even though I was now a great way oflF it. 
Sometimes I fancied it muft be the devil j and rea- 
fon joined in with me upon this fuppofition : For 
how fhould any other thing in human fhape come 
into the place ? Where was the veffel that brought 
them ? What marks were there of any other foot- 
fteps ? And how was it pofTible a man fhould come 
there ? But then to think that Satan fhould take hu- 
man fhape upon him in fuch a place, where there 
could be no manner of occafion for it, but to leave 
the print of his foot behind him, and that even fot 
no purpofe too (for he could not be fure I fhould fee 
it,) this was an amazement the other way : I confi- 
dered that the devil might have found out abundance 
of other ways to have terrified me, than this of the 
lingle print of a foot : That as I lived quite on the 
other fide of the ifland, he would never have been, 
fo fimple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten 
thoufand to one whether I fhould ever fee it or not j 
and in the fand too, which the firfl furge of the fea 
upon an high wind would have defaced entirely: 
All this feemed inconfiflent with the thing itfelf, and 
with all notions we ufually entertain of the fubtlety 
of the devil. 

O z Abundance 



tg6 LIPZ AND ADVEHtl^Ai^ 

Abundance of fuch things as thefc affilled to atgne 
me out of all apprehenfions of its being the devil : 
And I prefently concluded that it muft be fome more 
dangerous creature j vit. That it muft be fome of 
the favages of the main land over againft me, who 
had wandered out to fea in their canoes, and, either 
driven by the currents, or by contrary winds, had 
made the iiland ; and had been on fhore, but were 
gone away again to fea, being as loth, perhaps, to 
have ftaid in this defolate iiland, as I would have 
been to have had them. 

While thefe reflexions were rolling upon my 
mind, I was very thankful in my thought, that I 
was fo happy as not to be thereabouts at that time^ 
or that they did not fee my boat, by which they 
would have concluded, that fome inhabitants had 
been in the place, and perhaps have fearched farther 
for me : Then terrible thoughts racked my imagina- 
tions about their having found my boat, and that 
there were people h^re ; and that if fo, I Ihould cer- 
tainly have them come again in greater numbers, 
and devour me; that if it fhould happen fo that 
they Ihould not find me, yet they would find my 
inclofure, deftroy all my corn, carry away all my 
flock of tame goats, and I ihould periih at laft for 
mere want. 

Thus my fear baniihed all my religious hope : all 
that former confidence in God, which was founded- 
upon fuch wonderful experience as I had had of his- 
goodnefs, now vaniihed ; as, if he that had fed me 
by miracle hitherto, could not preferve by his power 
the provifion which he had made for me by his 
goodnefs. I reproached myfelf with my uncafinefs, 

that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. I97 

that I would not fow any more corn one year, than 
would juft ferve me till the next feafon, as if no 
accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the 
crop that was upon the ground : And this I thought 
To juft a reproof, that I refolved for the future to 
have two or three years com before-hand, fo that 
whatever might come, I might not perifh for want 
of bread. 

How ftrange a chequer-work of Providence is the 
life of man 1 And by what fecret differing fprings are 
the affeftions hurried about, as differing circumftances 
prefent ! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate ; 
to-day we feek what to-morrow we fhun ; to-day we 
defire what to-morrow we fear, nay, even tremble 
at the apprehenfions of. This was exemplified in me 
at this time, in the moft lively manner imaginable ; 
for I, whofe only affliftion was, that I feemed ba- 
niflied from human fociety, that I was alone, cir- 
cumfcribed by the boundlefs ocean, cut off from 
mankind, and condemned to what I call a filent 
life ; that I was as one whom Heaven thought not 
worthy to be numbered among the living, or to 
appear among the reft of his creatures ; that to have 
feen one of my own fpecies, would have feemed to 
me a raifing me from death to life, and the greateft 
blefling that Heaven itfelf, next to the fupreme blef- 
fing of falvation, could beftow ; I fay, that I fhould 
now tremble at the very apprehenfions of feeing a 
man^ and was ready to fink into the ground, at but 
the fhadow, or filent appearance of a man's having 
jfet his foot on the ifland ! 

Such is the uneven ftate of human life ; and it 
{afforded me a great many curious fpeculations after^ 

O 3 wards, 



198 tlPE AND ADVENTURES 

wards, when I had a little recovered my firft fur* 
prife : I confidered that this was the ftation of life 
the infinitely wife and good providence of God had 
determined for me ; that as I could not forefee what 
the ends of divine wifdom might be in all this, fo I 
was not to difpute his fovereignty, who, as I was his 
creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to 
govern and difpofe of me abfolutely as he thought 
fit ; and who, as I was a creature who had offended 
him, had likewife a judicial right to condemn me to 
what puniihment he thought fit j and that it was my 
part to fubmit to bear his indignation, becaufe I had 
finned againft him, 

I then refleded, that God, who was not only righ- 
teous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to 
punifli and affliO: me, fo he was able to deliver me ; 
that if he did not think fit to do it, it was my un^ 
queftioned duty to refign myfelf abfolutely and en^ 
tirely to his will : And, on the other hand, it was 
my duty alfo to hope in him, pray to him, and qui- 
etly to attend the diftates and direftions of his daily 
providence. 

Thefe thoughts took me up many hours, days, 
nay, I may fay, weeks and months ; and one particu- 
lar effeO: of my cogitations on this occafion I cannot 
omit ; viz. one morning early, lying in my bed, and 
filled with thoughts about my danger from the ap- 
pearance of favages, I found it difcompofed me very 
much ; upon which thofe words of the fcripture came 
into my thoughts, Ca/l upon me in the day of trouble^ 
and I will deliver thee^ and thoujhalt glorify me. 

Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my bed, my 
heart ws^s not only comforted, but I was guided and 

encouragecj 



6F ROBINSON CRUSOE. I99 

cncoul-aged to pray earneftly to God for deliverance : 
When I had done praying, I took up my bible, and 
opening it to read, the firft words that prefented to 
me, were, Wait on the Lordj and be of good cheer ^ and 
he Jhall Jirengthen thy heart : Wait, I fay , on the Lord. 
It is impoffible to exprefs the comfort this gave me ; 
and in return, I thankfully laid down the book, and 
was no more fad, at leaft, not on that occafiom 

In the middle of thefe cogitations, apprehenfions, 
and refleftions, it came into my thoughts one day, 
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own, 
and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, 
when I came on (liore from my boat : This cheared 
me up a little too, and I began perfuade myfelf it was 
all a delufion ; that it was nothing elfe but my own 
foot ; and why might not I come that way from the 
boat, as well as I was going that way to the boat ? 
Again, I confidered alfo, that I could by no means 
tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had 
not ; and that, if at lafl: this was only the print of my 
own foot, I had played the part of thofe fools, who 
ftrive to make ftories of fpeftres and apparitions, and 
then are themfelves frighted at them more than any 
body elfe. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad 
again ; for I had not ftirred out of my caftle for three 
days and nights, fo that I began to ftarve for provi- 
fion ; for I had little or nothing within doors, but 
fome barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that my 
goats wanted to be milked too, which ufually was 
my evening diverfion ; and the poor creatures were 
in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and 

O 4 indeed 



ftOO LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

indeed It almoft: fpoiled fome of them, and almoft 
dried up their milk. 

Heartening myfelf therefore with the beKef, that 
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feetj^ 
(and fo I might be truly faid to ftart at my own 
fcadow,) I began to go abroad again, and went ta 
my country-houfe to milk my flock ; but to fee with 
what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind 
me, how I was ready, every now-and-then, to lay 
down my bafket, and run for my life ; it would have 
made any one have thought I was haunted with an, 
evil confciencej or that I had been lately mofl terri^. 
bly frighted j and fo indeed I had. 

However, as I went down thus two or three days, 
and having feen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, 
and to think there was really nothing in it but my 
own imagination ; but I could not perfuade myfelf 
fully of this, till I fhould go down to the fliore again,, 
and fee this print of a foot, and meafure it by my 
own, and fee if there was any fimilitude or fitnefs, 
that I might* be aflured it was my own foot: But 
when I came to the place firft, it appeared evidently 
to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could not pof- 
fibly be on fhore any where thereabouts : Secondly, 
when I came to meafure the mark with my own foot, 
I found my foot not fo large by a great deal : Both 
thefe things filled my head with new imaginations, 
and gave me the vapours again to the highell degree j 
fo that I fhook with cold, like one in an ague, and I 
went home again, filled with the belief that fome 
man or men had been on fhore there j or, in fhort, 
that the ifland was inhabited, and I might be fur-^ 

prifed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 201 

f rifed before I was aware ; and what courfe to take 
for my fecurity, I knew not, 

O what ridiculous refolutions men take, when 
poffeffed with fear ! It deprives them of the ufe of thofe 
nieans which reafon offers for their relief. The 
firft thing I propofed to myfelf was, to throw down 
my inclofures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into 
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and 
then frequent the ifland in profpeft of the fame, or 
the like booty ; then to the fimple thing of digging 
np my two corn-fields, that they might not find fuch 
a grain there, and ftill to be prompted to frequent 
the ifland ; then to demolifh my bower and tent, that 
they might not fee any veftiges of my habitation, 
and be prompted to look farther, in order to find 
out the perfons inhabiting. 

Thefe were the fubjeds of the firft night's cogita- 
tion, after I was come home again, while the appre- 
henfions which had fo over-run my mind were frefh 
upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above. 
Thus fear of danger is ten thoufand times more terri- 
fying than danger itfelf, when apparent to the 
eyes ; and we find the burden of anxiety, greater by 
much than the evil which we are anxious about ; 
but, which was worfe than all this, I had not that 
relief in this trouble from the refignation I ufed to 
pracbife, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, 
like Sauly who complained not only that the Pbilif^ 
tines were upon him, but that God had forfaken 
him ; for I did not now take due ways to compofe 
my mind, by crying to God in my diftrefs, and reft- 
ing upon his providence, as I had done' before, for 
niy defence and deliverance j which if I had done, I 

had.

had, at leaft, been more chearfully fupported under 
this new furprife, and perhaps carried through k 
with more refolution. 

This confufion of my thoughts kept me waking all 
night ; but in the morning 1 fell afleep, and having 
, by the amufement of my mind been, as it were, tired, 
and my fpirits exhaufted, I fiept very foundly, and 
awaked much better compofed than I had ever been 
before : And now I began to think fedately ; and, 
upon the utmoft debate with myfelf, I concluded, 
that this ifland, which was fo exceeding pleafant, 
fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as I 
had feen, was not fo entirely abandoned as I might 
imagine: That although there were no ftated in- 
habitants who lived on the fpot ; yet that there might 
fometimes come boats off from the fliore, who either 
with defign, or perhaps never but when they were 
driven by crofs winds, might come to this place. 

That I had lived here 15 years now, and had not 
met with the leaft fhadow or figure of any people be- 
fore ; and that if at any time they fhould be driven 
here, it was probable they went away again as foon 
as ever they could, feeing they had never thought fit 
to fix there upon any occafion, to this time. 

That the moft I could fugged any danger from, 
was, from any fuch cafual accidental landing qf 
ftraggling people fiom the main, who, as it w^as 
likely, if they were driven hither, 'Were here againft 
their wills ; fo they made no (lay here, but went off 
again with all pofTible fpeed, feldom flaying one night 
on fiiore, left they fliould not have the help of the 
tides and day-li^ht back again j and that therefore I 

ba4 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOI. a03 

had nofhing to do but to confider of fome fafe retreat, 
in cafe I fliould fee any favages land upon the fpot. 

Now I begun forely to repent that I had dug 
my cave fo large, as to bring a door through again, 
which door, as I faid, came out beyond where my 
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely 
confidering this, therefore, I refolved to draw me 
a fecond fortification, in the manner of a femi- 
circle, at a diftance from my wall, juft where I had 
planted a double row of trees about twelve years be. 
fore, of which I made mention : thefe trees having 
been planted fo thick before, there wanted but a 
few piles to be driven between them, that they 
fliould be thicker and ftronger, and my wall would 
be foon finifhed. 

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer 
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, 
and every thing I could think of to make it ftrong j 
having in it feven little holes, about as big as I might 
put my arm out at. In the infide of this I thickened 
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bring- 
ing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of 
the wall, and walking upon it ; and through the 
feven holes I contrived to plant the mufquets, of 
which I took notice that I got feven on fhore out of 
the fliip; thefe, I fay, I planted like my cannon, 
and fitted them into frames that held them like a car- 
riage, that fo I could fire all the feven guns in two 
minutes time ? this wall I was many a weary month 
in finifhing, and yet never thought myfelf fafe till it 
was done. 

When this was done, I ftuck all the ground with- 
out my wall, for a great way every way, as full with 

flakes 



204 l-IFJS AND ADVENTURES 

flakes or ftlcks of the ofier-like wood, which I found 
fo apt to grow, as they could well (land ; infomuch 
that I believe I might fet in near twenty thoufand 
of them, leaving a pretty large fpace between them 
5ind my wall, that I might have room to fee an 
enemy, and they might have no fhelter from the 
young trees, if they attempted to approach my 
outer wall. 

Thus in two years time I had a thick grove ; and 
In five or fix years time I had a wood before my 
dwelling, grown fo monftrous thick and ftrong, 
that it was indeed perfedly impaffable ; and no maa 
of what kind foever would ever imagine that there 
was any thing beyond it, much lefs an habitation: 
as for the way I propofed myfelf to go in and out (for 
I left no avenue) it was by fetting two ladders ; one 
to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke 
in, and left room to place another ladder upon that j 
fo when the t^vo ladders were taken down, no man 
living could come down to me without mifchiefing 
himfelf ; and if they had come down, they were ftill 
on the outfide of my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the meafures human prudence 
could fuggeft for my own prefervation ; and it will 
be feen at length, that they were not altogether with- 
out juft reafon ; though I forefaw nothing at that 
time more than my mere fear fuggefted. 

While this was dojng, I was not altogether care* 
lefs of my other affairs ; for I had a great concern 
upon me for my little herd of goats ; they were not 
only a prefent fupply to me upon every occafion, and 
began to be fuflicient for me, without the expence of 
powder and fhof;^ but alfo abated the fatigue of my 

bunting 



OF ROBINSON CRUS02« ^05 

hunting after the wild ones ; and I was loth to lofe 
ths advantage of them, and to have them all to nurfe 
up over again. 

To this purpofe, after long confideration, I could 
think but of two ways to preferv^e them : one was 
to find another convenient place to dig a cave under 
ground, and to drive them into it every night ; and* 
the other was to inclofe two or three little bits of 
land, remote from one another, and as much con* 
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half 
a dozen young goats in each place ; fo that if any 
difafter happened to the flock in general, I might be 
able to raile them again with little trouble and time : 
and this, though it would require a great deal of 
time and labour, I thought was the mofl rational 
defign* 

Accordingly I fpent feme time to find out the 
mofl retired parts of the ifland ; and I pitched upon 
one, which was as private indeed as my heart could 
wifh ; for it was a little damp piece of ground in the 
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is 
obferved, I almofl loft myfclf once before, endea- 
vouring to come back that v/ay from the eaftern part 
of the ifland : here I found a clear piece of land, 
near three acres, fo furrounded with woods that it 
was almoft an inclofure by nature ; at leaft it did not 
want near fo much labour to make it fo, as the other 
pieces of ground I had worked fo hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of 
ground, and in Icfs than a month's time I had fo 
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which 
you pleafe, which were not fo wild now as at firft 
they might be fuppofed to be, were well enough 

4 fecured 



206 LITE AND ADVENTURES 

feciircd in it* So without any farther delay, I re- 
moved ten fhe-goats and two he-goats to this piece j 
and when there, I continued to perfefl: the fence, 
till I had made it as fecure as the other, which, how- 
ever, I did at more leifurCj and it took me up more 
time by a great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expcnce of, purely 
from my apprehenfions on the account of the print 
of a man's foot which I had feen ; for as yet, I never 
faw any human creature come near the ifland, and I 
had now lived two years under thefe uneafinefles, 
which indeed made my life much lefs comfortable 
than it was before ; as may well be imagined, by any 
who know what it is to live in the conftant fnare of 
the fear of man : and this I muft obferve with grief 
too, that the difcompofure of my mind had too great 
imprefHons alfo upon the religious part- of my 
thoughts : for the dread ai?d terror of falling into 
the hands of favages and cinnibals lay fo upon my 
fpirits, that I feldom found myfelf in a due temper 
for application to my Maker ; at leaft, not with the 
fedate calmnefs and refignation of foul which I was 
wont to do. I rather prayed to God as under great 
afflidion and preffure of mind, furrounded with 
danger, and in expeftation every night of being 
murdered and devoured before the morning ; and I 
muft teftify from my experience, that a temper of 
peace, thankfulnefs, love and affeftion, is much 
more the proper frame for prayer than that of terror 
and difcompofure ; and that under the dread of mif- 
chief impending, a man is no more fit for a comfort- 
ing performance of the duty of praying to God, than 
he is for repentance on a fick-bed j for thefe dif- 

.compofures 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 20J 

compofures affe£t the mind as the others do the body ; 
and the difcompofure of the mind muft neceffarily 
be as great a difability as that of the body, and much 
greater ; praying to God being properly an aft of 
the mind, not of the body. 

But to go on : After I had thus fecured one part 
of my little living flock, I went about the whole 
ifland, fearching for another private place, to make 
fuch another depofit ; when wandering more to the 
weft point of the ifland than I had ever done yet, and 
looldng out to fea, 1 thought I faw a boat upon 
the fea at a great diftance: I had found a 
perfpeftive glafs or two in one of the feamen's 
chefts, which I faved out of our fhip ; but I had it 
not about me ; and this was fo remote, that I could 
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till 
my eyes were not able to look any longer : whether 
it was a boat, or not, I do not know ; but as I de- 
fcended from the hill, I could fee no more of it, fo 
I gave it over ; only I refolved to go no more with- 
out a perfpeftive glafs in my pocket. 

When I was come down the hill, to the end of 
the ifland, where indeed I had never been before, I 
was prefently convinced, that the feeing the print of 
a man's foot, was not fuch a ftrange thing in the 
ifland as I imagined ; and, but that it was a fpecial 
Providence that I was caft upon the fide of th^ ifland 
where the favages never came, I fhould eafily have 
known, that nothing was more frequent than for 
the canoes from the main, when they happened to 
be a little too far out at fea, to (hoot over to that fide 
of the ifland for harbour ; likewife, as they often met 
and fought in their canoes, the vidors, having takei\ 

any 



4o8 lIFfi Ai^b ADVENtURfiS 

imy prifoners, would bring them over to this 'ifhorCj 
where, according to their dreadful cuftoms, being all 
cannibals, they would kill and eat them : of which 
hereafter* 

When I was comie down the hill to the fhore, as I 
faid above, being the S. W. point of the ifland, I was 
perfedly confounded and amazed ; nor is it poffible 
for me to exprefs the horror of my mind, at feeing 
the fhore fpread with fkuUs, hands, feet, and other 
bones of human bodies ; and particularly I obferved a 
place where there had been a fire made, and a circle 
dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is fuppofed 
the favage wretches had fat down to their inhuman 
feaftings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was fo aflonifhed with the fight of thefe things, 
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myfelf 
from It, for a long while j all my apprehenfions 
were buried in the thoughts of fuch a pitch of inhu- 
man, hellifh brutality, and the horror of the degene- 
ricy of human nature ; which, though I had heard 
of often, yet I never had fo near a view of .before : 
in fhort, I turned away my face from the horrid fpec- 
tacle, my flomach grew fick, and I was jufl at the 
point of fainting, when nature difcharged the diforder 
from my flomach, and, having vomited with an un- 
common violence, I was a little relieved, but could 
not bear to flay in the place a moment ; fo I got me 
up the hill again with all the fpeed I could, and 
walked on towards my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the ifland, 
I flood ftill awhile as amazed ; and then recovering 
myfelf, I looked up with the utmofl affeftion of my 
foul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave

two years after this : when I fay my own circle, I 
mean by it my three plantations, viz. my caftle, my 
country-feat, which I called my bower, and my in- 
clofure in the woods.; nor did I look after .this for 
pny other ufe than as an inclofure for my goats ; for 
the averfion which nature gave me to thefe hcUifh 
wretches was fuch, that I was as fearful of feeing 
them as of feeing the devil himfelf j nor did I fo 
much as go to look after my boat in all this time, 
but began rather to think of making me another ; for 
I could not think of ever making any more attempts 
to bring the other boat round the ifland to me, left I 
fhould meet with fome of thofe creatures at fea, in 
which, if I had happened to have fallen into their 
hands, I knew what would have been my lot. 

Time, however, and the fatisfadion I had, that I 
was in no danger of being difcovered by thefe people, 
began to wear off my uneafinefs about them j and I 
began to live juft in the fame compofed manner as 
before; only with this difference, that I ufed more 
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I 
did before, left 1 ftiould happen to be feen by any of 
them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing 
my gun, left any of them on the ifland fliould happen 
to hear it ; and it was therefore a very pood provi- 
dence to me, that I had furniflied myfelf with a tame 
breed of goats, that I had no ne^d to hunt any more 
about the woods, or Ihoot at them ; and if I did catch 
any more of them after this, it was by traps and fnares 
as I had done before : fo that for two years after 
this, I believe I never fired my gun once off, though 
I never went out withoutjt; and, which was more, 
as I had faved three piftols out of the fliip, I always 

carried 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOEi fill 

tarried them out with mcj or at leaft two of them, 
fticking them in my goat-lkin belt : I likewife fur- 
bifhed up oile of the great cutlaffes that I had out of 
the Ihip, and made me a belt to put it in alfo ; fo that 
I was now a moft formidable fellow to look at when 
I went abroad, if you add to the former defcription 
of myfelf, the particular of two piftols, and a great 
broad-fword hanging at my fide in a belt, but with- 
out a fsabbard. 

Things going oil thus, as I have faid, for fom^ 
time, I feemed, excepting thefe cautions, to be re* 
duced to my former calm fedate way of living ; all 
thefe things tended to fliew me more and more how 
far my condition was from being miferable, com- 
pared to fome others ; nay, to many other particu- 
lars of life, which it might have pleafed God to have 
made my lot. It piit me upon reflefting, how little 
repining there would be among mankind, at any 
condition of life, if people would rather compare 
their condition with thofe that are worfe, in order 
to be thankful, than be always comparing them with 
thofe which are better, to affill their murmurings and 
complainings^ 

As in my prefent condition there Were not really 
many things which I wanted, fo indeed I thought 
that thfe frights I had been in about thefe favage 
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own 
prefervation, had taken off the edge of my invention 
for my own conveniencies, and I had dropt a good 
defign, which I had once bent my thoughts upon j 
and that was, to try if I could not make fome of 
my barley into malt, and then try to brew myfelf 
fome beer : this was really a whimfical thought, and 

P a Ire- ' 



415 IIFE AND ADV£TiTURES 

I reproved myfelf often for the fimplicity of it ; for 
I prefently faw there would be the want of feveral 
things neceffary to the making my beer, that it would 
be impoffibk for me to fupply j aSj» firft, cafks to 
|>referve it in, which was a thing that, as I have ob- 
ferved already, I could never compafs j no, though 
I fpent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in 
attempting it, but to no purpofc. In the next place, 
I had no hops to make it keep, no yeaft to make it 
work, no copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet, 
had not all thefe things intervened, I mean thefrightsJ 
and terrors I was in about the favages, I had under- 
taken it,* and perhaps brought it to pafs too ; for I 
feldom gave any thing over without accomplifliing 
it, when I once had it in my head enough to be* 
gm it. 

But my invention now ran quite another way ; for 
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I 
might deftroy fome of thefe monfters in their cruel 
bloody entertainment, and, if poffible, fave the 
vidim they fhould bring hither to deftroy. It v/ould 
take up a larger volume than this whole work is 
intended to be, to fet down all the contrivances I 
hatched, or rather brooded upon in my thoughts, 
for the deftroying thefe creatures, or at leaft frighten- 
ing them, fo as to prevent their coming hither any 
more j but all was abortive ; nothing could be pof- 
fible to take effedl, unlefs I was to be there to do it 
myfelf; and what could one man do among them, 
when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of 
them together, with their darts, or their bows and 
arrows, with which they could flioot as true to a 
mark as I could with my gun ? 

Sometimes 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 213 

Bometimes I contrived to dig an hole under the 
place where they made their fire, and put in five or fix 
pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled their 
fire, would coijfequently take fire, and blow up all 
that was near it j but, as in the firft place I fhoul4 
be very loth to wafte fo much powder upon them, 
my ftore being now within the quantity of a barrel, 
fo neither could I be fure of its going off at any cer- 
tain time, when it might furprife them; and, at 
beft, that it would do little more than juft blow the 
fire about their ears, and fright them, but not fuffi- 
cient to make them forfake the place ; fo I laid it 
afide, and then propofed, that I would place myfelf 
in ambufti, in fome convenient place, with my three 
guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their 
bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I fhouldbefure 
to kiU'or wound perhaps two or three at every fhot j 
and then falling in upon them with my three piftols 
and my fword, I made no doubt but that, if there 
were twenty, I fliould kill them all : this fancy pleafed 
my thoughts for fome weeks, and I was fo full of it 
that I often dreamt of it ; and fometimes^ that I was 
juft going to let fly at them in my fleep. 

I went fo far with it in my indignation, that I em- 
ployed myfelf feveral days to find out proper places to 
put myfelf in ambufcade, as I faid, to watch for them ; 
and I went frequently to the place itfelf, which was 
now grown more familiar to me ; and efpecially 
while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of re- 
renge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of 
them to the fword, as I ma:y call it ; but the horror 
I had at the place, and at the fignals of the barb*. 

P 3 rous 



^14 ^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

rous wretches devouring one another, abated my 
malice. 

Well, at length I found a place in the fide of the 
hill, where I was fatisfied I might fecurely wait till I 
faw any of the boats coming, and might then, even 
before they would be ready to come on fhore, convey 
myfelf unfeen into thickets of trees, in one of which 
there was an hollow large enough to conceal me en- 
tirely ; and where I might fit, and obferve all their 
bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, 
when they were fo clofe together, as that it would 
be next to impoffible that I fhould mifs my fhoot, or 
that I could fail wounding thre^ or four of th^m at 
the firft flioot. 

In this p?ace then I refolved to fix my defign ; andl 
accordingly I prepared two mufkets and my ordi- 
nary fowling-piece. The two muflkets I loaded with a 
brace of flugs each, and four or five fmaller bullets, 
about the fize of piftol-bullets, and the fowling-piece 
I loaded with near an handful of fwan-ihot, of the 
largefl fize ; I alfo loaded my piftols with about four 
bullets each : and in thi$ pofture, well provided with 
ammunition for a fecond and third charge, I prepared 
myfelf for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the fcheme for my defign, and 
in my imagination put it in praftice, I continually 
made my tour every morning up to the top of the hill, 
which was from my caftle, as I called it, about three 
miles or more, to fee if I could obferve any boats 
upon the fe^, coming near the ifland, or (landing 
over towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard 
duty, after I had for two or three months conftantly 
kept my watch j but came always back without any

difcovery, there having not in all that time been the' 
leaft appearance, not only on or near the fhore^ but 
not on the whole ocean, fo far as my eyes or glaffes 
could reach every way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to 
look out, fo longalfo I kept up the vigour of my de- 
fign, and my fpirits feemed to be all the while in a 
fuitable frame ifor fo outrageous an execution, as 
the killing twenty or thirty naked favages, for an 
offence, which I had not at all entered into a difcuf- ' 
fion of in my thoughts, any further than my paffions 
were at firfl fired by the horror I conceived at the 
unnatural cuflom of the people of that country, who, 
it feenis, had been fuffered by Providence, in hifr 
wife difpofition of the world, to have no other guide 
than that of their own abominable and vitiated paf- 
fions J and confequently were left, and perhaps had 
been for fome ages, to adl fuch horrid things, aiid 
receive fuch dreadful cufloms, as nothing but nature, 
entirely abandoned of Heaven, and aftuated by fome 
hellifh degeneracy, could have run them into ; but 
now, when, as I have faid, I began to be weary of 
the fruitlefs excurfion which I had made fo long, and 
fo far, every morning in vain j fo my opinion of the 
aftionitfelf began to alter, and I began, with cooler 
and calmer thoughts, to cor^fider what it was I Uraai 
going to engage in; what authority or call I had 
to pretend to be judge and executioner upon thefe 
men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for 
fo many ages to fuffer, unpunifhed, to go on, and 
to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments 
upon one another ; alfo, how far thefe people were 
offenders againfl me, and what right I had to en?

gage ifl th,e. quarrel of that bipod, which they fixed 
pjrpmifcupufly one upon another. I debated thij very

When I bad confidered this 9. little, it followed. 
ueceiTarily, that I was. certainly in the wrong in it ; 
that thefe people vjrere not murderers in the fenfe that 
I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any 
mare than thofe Chriftians were murderers, wh^ 
often put to death the prifoners taken in battle, or* 
inore frequently, upon mwy occafipns, put whole 
ttopps of men to the fword, without giving quarter,^ 
though they threw down their arms and fubmitted. 

In the next plage, it Pccurred to me, that albeit 
the ufage they giivp on^ another was. thus brutifh and 
inhuman, y^t it was really nothing to me ; thefe peo- 
ple had done me no injury ; that if they attempted

of thefe people, who, however they were idolaters 
and barbarians, and had feveral bloody and barba- 
rous rites in thefe cuftoms, fuch as facrificing human 
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards j 
very innocent people ; and that the rooting them out 
of the country is fpoken of with the utmoft abhor- 
rence and deteftation, even by the Spaniards them- 
felves, at this time, and by all other Chriftian nations 
ci Europe 'i as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatu- 
ral piece of cruelty, unjuftifiable either to God or 
jnan ; and fuch, as for which the very name of a 
Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to 
all people of humanity, or of Chriftian compaflion ; 
a$ if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent 
for th^ produ£l of a race of men, who were without 
j^inciples of tendernefs, or the common bowels of 
pity to the miferable, which is reckoned to be a mark 
of a generous temper in the mind. 

Thefe confiderations really put me to a paufe, anc} 
to a kind of a full ftop ; and I began by little and 
little to be off of my defign, and to conclude I had 
taken a wrong meafure in my refolutions to attack the 
fevages ; that it was not my bufmefs to meddle with 
them, unlefs they firft attacked me, and this it was 
iny bufinefs, if poffible, to prevent ; but that, if I 
were difcovered and attacked, then I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with myfelf, that 
this really was the way, not to deliver myfelf, but en» 
tirely to ruin and deftroy myfelf; for unlefs I wa3 
fure to kill every one that not only fliould be on fhore 
»t that time, but that fhould ever come on fhora 
afterwards, if but one of them efcaped to tell their 
cpi^ntrjr- people what had happened, they would 

coma 



2l8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

come over again by thoufands to revenge the death 
of their fellows ; and I fhould only bring upon myfelf 
a certain deftrudion, which at prefent I had no man- 
ner of occafion for. 

Upon the whole^ I concluded, that neither in 
principles nor in policy, I ought one way or other to 
concern myfelf in this affair : that my bufmefs was 
by all poflible means to conceal myfelf from them, 
and not to leave the lead fignal to them to guefs by, 
that there were any living creatures upon the ifland, 
I mean of human fhape. 

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was 
convinced now many ways that I was perfedtly out 
of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody fchemes 
for the deftruftion of innocent creatures, I mean in- 
nocent as to me ; as to the crimes they were guilty of 
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them ; 
they were national punifhments to make a juft retri- 
bution for national offences; and to bring public 
judgments upon thofe who offend in a public manner, 
by fuch ways as beft pleafe God. 

This appeared fo clear to me now, that nothing 
was a greater fatisfaftion to me, than that I had not 
been fuffered to do a thing which I now faw fo much 
re^on to believe would have been 1:10 lefs a (in than 
that of wilful murder, if I had committed it } and I 
gave moft humble thanks on my knees to God, that 
had thus delivered me from blood-guiltinefs ; be- 
feeching him to grant me the proteftion of his Provi- 
dence, that I might not fall into the hands of barba-. 
rians ; or that I might not lay my hands upon them, 
unlefs I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, 
in defence of my own life, 

In 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2x9 

f h this difpolition I continued for near a year after 
this : and fo far was I from defiring an occafion for 
falling upon thefe wretches, that in all that time I 
never once went up the hill to fee whether there were 
any of them in fight, or to know whether any of 
them had been on fhore there, or not ; that I might 
not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances 
againft them, or be provoked, by any advantage 
which might prefent itfelf, to fall upon them ; only 
this I did, I went and removed my boat, which I 
had on the other fide of the ifland, and carried it 
down to the eaft end of the whole ifland, where I ran 
it into a little cove which I found under fome high 
rocks, and where I knew, by reafon of the currents, 
the favages durft not, at leaft would not, come with 
their boats, upon any account whatfoever. 

With my boat I carried away every thing that I 
had left there belonging to her, though not neceffary 
for the bare going thither j viz. a mart and fail, which 
I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but 
indeed, which could not be called either anchor or 
grappling ; however, it was the beft I could make of 
its kind. All thefe I removed, that there might not 
be the leaft fliadow of any difcovery, or any ap- 
pearance of any boiat, or of any habitation upon the 
ifland. 

Befides this, I kept myfelf, as I faid, more retired 
than ever, and feldom went from my cell, other than 
upon my conftant employment, viz. to milk my fiie- 
goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, 
as it was quite on the other part of the ifland, was 
quite out of danger : for certain it is, that thefe favage 
jpeoplfi, who fometimes haunted this ifland, never 



220 LIKE AND ADVENTURES 

came with any thoughts of finding any thing feire, 
and confequently never wandered ofi^ from the cbift^^ 
and I doubt not but they might have been feveral 
times on Ihore, after my apprehenfions of them had 
made me cautious, as well as before ; and indeed I 
looked back with fome horror upon the thoughts of 
what my condition would have been, if I had chopped 
upon them, and been difcovered before that, when 
naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that 
loaded often only with fmall fliot. I walked every 
wh^re, peeping and peering about the ifland, to fee 
what I could get : what a furprife Ihould I have been 
in, if, when I difcovered the print of a man's foot, 
I had inftead of that feen fifteen or twenty favages 
and found them purfuing me, and, by the fwiftnefs 
of their running, no polTibility of my efcaping 
them ! 

The thoughts of this fometimes funk my very foul 
within me, and diftreffed my mind fo much, that I 
could not foon recover it } to think what I fhould 
have done, and how I not only fliould not; have been 
able to refift them, but even fhould not have had 
prefence of mind enough to do what I might have 
done ; much lefs what now, after fo niuch confidera- 
tion and preparation, I might be able to do. IndeecJ, 
after ferious thinking of thefe things, I would be very 
melancholy, and fometimes it would laft a great 
while ; but I refolved it at laft all into thankfulnefsi 
to that Providence which had delivered me from fa 
many unfeen dangers, and had kept me from thofq 
mifchiefs, which I could no way have been the agent' 
in delivering myfelf from '. becaufe I jbad not the leaft

notion of any fuch thing depending, or the leaft 
fuppofition of its being poffible. 

This renewed a contemplation, which often had 
come to my thoughts in former time, when firft I 
began to fee the merciful difpofitions of Heaven, in 
the dangers we run through in this life j how wonder-* 
fully we are delivered when we know nothing of it l 
how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it) a doubt 
or hefitation, whether to go this way or that way^ 
a fecret hint Ihall dire£t us this way, when we in* 
tended to go another way ; nay, when fenfe, our 
own inclination, and perhaps bufmefs, has called to 
go the other way, yet a ftrange impreffion upqn the 
mind, from we know not what fprings, and by we 
know not what power, ihall over-rule us to go this 
way; and it fhall afterwards appear, that had we gone 
that way which we would have gone, and even to our 
imagination ought to have gone, we fhould have been 
ruined and loft : upon thefe, and many like reflec- 
tions, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, 
that whenever I found thofe fecret hints, or preffings 
of my mind, to doing or not doing any thing that 
prefented, or to going this way or that way, I never 
failed to obey the fecret diftate ; though I knew no 
other reafon for it, than that fuch a preflure, or fudi 
an hint, hung upon my mind : I could give many 
examples of the fuccefs of this conduft in the courfe 
of my life J but more efpecially in the latter part of 
my inhabiting this unhappy ifland ; befides many 
occafions which it is very likely I might have taken 
notice of, if I had feen with the fame eyes then that 
I faw with now : But ^tis never too late to be wife ; 
and I cannot but advife all coafidering men, whofe

Kves are attended with fuch extraordiriaiy inddeittt*

I flball not difcufs, arid perhaps canrtot account for j 
but certainly they are a proof of the converfe of

as can never be withftood : bf which I fliall have oe-« 
cafion to give fome very remarkable inftances, in 
the remainder of my foKtary refidence inthiiB difmal 
placew 

' I believe the reader of this will not think it ftrange, 
if I confefs that thefe anxieties, thefe conftant daft-* 
gers I lived in, and the concern that was now upori 
me, put an end to all invention, and to all the con* 
trivances that I had laid for my future accommoda- 
tions and conveniencies- I had the care of my fafety 
more now upon my hands than that of my food. 1 
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a fttck of wood 
now, for fear the noife I Ihould make fliould be 
heard ; much lefs would I fire a gun, for the fame 
reafon ; and above all, I was very uneafy at making 
any fire, left the ftnoke, which is vifible at a great 
diftance in the day, fhould betray me : and for this 
reafon I removed that part of my bufinefs, which 
required fire, fuch as burning of pots and pipes, &c. 
into my new apartment in the wood ; where, after I 
had been fome time, I found, to my unfpeakable con- 
folation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went 
in a vaft way, and where, I dare fay, no favage, had 
he been at the mouth of it, would ^ fo hardy as to 
venture in, nor indeed would any man elfe, but one 

who. 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2 25 

"^h^^ like me, wanted nothing fo much as a fafe 
retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of ai 
great rock, where, by mere accident (I would fay, if 
I did not fee an abundant reafon to afcribe all fuch 
things now to Providence), I was cutting down fome 
thick branches of trees to make charcoal j and before 
I go on, I muft obferve the reafon of my making this 
charcoal, which was thus : 

I was afraid of making a fmoke about my habita- 
tion, as I faid before ; and yet I could not live there 
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. fo I 
contrived to burn fome wood here, as I had feen done 
iai England under turf, till it became chark, or dry 
coal ; and then putting the fire out, I preferved the 
coal to carry home, and perform the other fervices, 
which fire was wanting for at home, without danger 
or fmoke. 

But this by the bye : While I was cutting down fome 
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick 
branch of low brufhwood, or underwood, there was a 
kind of hollow place : I was curious to look into it, 
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found 
it was pretty large, that is to fay, fufficient for me to 
ftand upright in it, and perhaps another with me ; 
but I muft confefs to you, I made more hafte out than 
I did in; when looking further into the place, which 
was perfectly dark, I faw two broad fhining eyes of 
fome creature, whether devil or man I knew not, 
which twinkled like two ftars, the dim light froip. 
the cave's mouth fhining direftly in, and making 
the reflexion. 

However, 




224 l^I^E A*ID ADVENTURla 

However, after fome paufe, I recovered tayfelf^ 
ind began to call myfelf a thoufand fools, and tell 
myfelf, that he that was afraid to fee the devil, was 
Hot fit to live twenty years in an ifland all alone, and 
that I durft to believe there was nothing in this cave 
that was more frightful than myfelf: upon this^ 
plucking up my courage, I took up a large firebrand^ 
and in 1 rufhed again, with the flick flaming in iny 
liand : I had not gone three fteps in, but I was aU 
moft as much frightened as I was before ; for I 
heard a very loud figh, like that of a man in fome 
pain ; and it was followed by a broken ncfife, as if of 
words half-expreffed, sind then a deep figh again : 
I flepped back, and was indeed ftruck with fucM^a 
furprize, that it put me into a Cold fweat j and if I 
had had an hat ofi my head, I will not anfwer foi^ it 
that my hair might not have lifted it oiR But ftill, 
plucking up my fpirits as well as I could, and eh-» 
couraging myfelf a little, with confidering that the 
power and prefence of God was every- where, and 
was able to protefl: me ; upon this I flepped forward 
aigain, and by the light of the firebraild, holding if 
up a little over my head, I faw lying on the ^otltid 
a mofl monftrous frightful old he-goat, juft making 
his will, a^ we fay, gafping for life, and dying in-- 
deed of mere old age. 

I flirred him a little to fee if I could g6t hJm o^t, 
arid he effayed to get up, but was ribt able to 
raife himfelf j and I thought with niiyfetf, he might 
even lie there ; for if he had frightened me fo'y ht 
would certainly fright any of th^ favages, if any 6f 
them fhould be fo hardy as to come in therd, while Ke 
had any life in him-

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^2$ 

1 was now recov^ed from my furprize, and began 
to look round me, when I found the cave was but 
Very fmall j that is to fay, it might be about twelve 
feet over, but in no manner of fhape, either round or 
fquare, no hands having ever been epplpyed in 
making it but thofe of mere nature t I obferved alfo, 
that there was a place at the farther fide of it that went 
in farther, but fo low, that it« required me to creep 
upon my' hands and knees to get into it, and whither 
it went, I knew not ; fo having no candle, I gave 
it over for fome time, but refolved to come again the 
next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, 
NvhichI had made of the lock of one of the mufquets, 
with fome wild-fire in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day, I caitie provided with 
fix large candles of my own making (for I made very 
good caudles now of goats tallow) ; and going into 
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, 
as I have faid, almoft ten yards ; which, by the way, 
I thought was a venture bold enough, confidering 
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was 
beyond it. When I was got through the ftreight, 
I found the roof rofe higher up, I believe near twenty 
feet ; but never was fuch a glorious fight feen in the 
ifland, I dare fay, as it was, to look round the fides 
and roof of this vault or cave. The walk reflefted 
an hundred thoufand lights to me from my two 
candies : what it was in the rock, whether diamonds, 
or any other precious ftones, or gold, which I rather 
fuppofe it to be, I knew not. 

The place I was in was a moft delightful cavity, 
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expefted, though 
perfedly dark j the floor was dry and level, and had 

Vol-. I. . C^ a fort 



226 'LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

a fort of fmall loofe gravel upon it ; fo that there was 
no naufeous creature to be feen ; neither was there 
atiy damp or wet on thefidesof the roof ; the only 
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as 
it was a place of fecurity, and fuch a retreat as I 
wanted, I thought that was a convenience ; fo that 
1 was really rejoiced at the difcovery, and refolved, 
without any delay, to bring fome of thofe things 
which I was moft anxious about, to this place ; par- 
ticularly, I refolved to bring hither my magazine of 
powder, and all my fpare arms, viz. two fowling- 
pieces (for I had three in all) and three mufquets (for 
of them I had eight in all) ; fo I kept at my caftFe 
only five, which flood ready mounted, like pieces 
of cannon, on my outmofl: fence, and were ready 
alfp to take out upon any expedition. 
V Upon this occafion of removing my ammunition, I 
was obliged to opeii the barrel of powder which I 
took up out of the fea, and which had been wet ; and 
I found, that the water had penetrated about three or 
four inches into the powder on every fide, which, 
caking and growing hard, had preferved the infide 
like ,a kernel in a fhell; fo that I had near fixty 
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the 
cafk y and this was an agreeable difcovery to me at 
that time; fo I carried all away thither, never keep- 
ing above two or three pounds of powder with me in 
my caftle, for fear of a: furprife of any kind : I alfo 
carried thither aH the lead I had left for bullets. 

I fancied myfelf now like one of the ancient giants, 
which were faid to live in caves and holes in the rock, 
where none could come at them ; for I perfuaded my^ 
felf while I was here, if five hundred favages were to 

hunt 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE; ±2% 

hunt ine, they could never find me out ; or if they 
did, they would not venture to attack me here. 

The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the 
mouth of the cave the next day after I made this 
difcovery ; and I found it much eafier to dig a great 
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with 
earth, than to drag him out; fo I interred him 
there, to prevent offence to my nofe* 

I was now in my twenty-third year of refidence in 
this ifland, and was fo naturalized to the place, and 
to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed 
the certainty that no favages would come to the 
place to difturb me, I could have been content to 
have capitulated for fpending the reft of my time 
there, even to the laft moment, till I had laid me 
down and died, like the old goat in the cave : I had 
alfo arrived to fome little diverfions and amufements, 
which made the time pafs more pleafantly with me a 
great deal than it did before ; as, firft, I had taught 
my Pollj as I noted before, to fpeak ; and he did it fo 
familiarly, and talked fo articulately and plain, that 
it was very pleafant to me ; and he lived with me no 
iefs than fix-and-twenty years : how long he might 
live afterwards I knew not ; though I know they 
have a notion in the Bra/ils, that they live an hun- 
dred years j perhaps fome of my Polls may be alive 
there ftill, calling after Poor Robin Crufoe to this 
day ; I wifh no Efiglijhman the ill luck to come there 
and hear them j but if he did, he would certainly 
believe it was the devil. My dog was a very pleafant 
and loving companion to me for no Iefs than fixteen 
years of my time, and then died of mere old age ; 
as for my cats, they multiplied, as I have obfervedj

to that degree, that I was obliged to fhoot feveral 
of them at fitft, to keep them from devom-ing mef 
and all I had ; but at length, when the two old ones 
I brought with me were gone, and after fome time 
continually driving them from me, and letting them 
have no provifion with me, they all ran wild into 
the woods, except two or three favourites, which I 
kept tame, and whofe young, when they had any, I 
always drowned, and thefe were part of my family i 
Befides thefe, I always kept two or three houfliold 
kids about me, which I taught to feed out of my 
Jiand ; and I had alfo more parrots which talked 
pretty well, and would all call Robin CrufcCj but none 
Jike my fitft ; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with 
toy of them that I had done with him* I had alfo 
feveral tame fea-fowls, whofe names I know not, 
which I caught upon the (hore, and cut their wings ; 
and the little ftakes, which I had planted before my 
caftle wall, being now grown up to a good thick 
grove, thefe fowls all lived among thefe low trees^ 
and bred there, which was very agreeable to me ; for 
that, as I faid above, I began to be very well con- 
tented with the life I led, if it might but hay^ 
been fecured from the dread of favages. 

But it was otherwife dire€ked j and it might not be 
amifs for all people who ffiall meet with my ftory to 
makeithis juft obfervation from itj vizr. How fre- 
quently, in the courfe of our lives, the evil which 
in itfelf we feek mofl: to fhun, and which, when We 
are fallen into, is the moH dreadful to us, is often- 
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by 
which alone we can be raifed again from the afflic- 
tion we are fallen into : I could give many examples 
« of 



OF ROBINSOM CRUSOE. 229 

of this in the courfe of my unaccountable life ; but 
in nothing was it more particularly remarkable, 
than in the circumftances of my laft years of folitary 
refidence in this ifland. 

It was now the month of December^ as I faid above, 
in my twenty-third year ; and this being the fouthem 
folftice, for winter I cannot call it, was the particular 
time of my harveft, and required my being pretty 
much abroad in the fields ; when going out pretty 
early in the morning, even before it was thorough 
day-light, I was furprized with feeing a light of fome 
fire upon the (hore, at a diftance from me of about 
two miles, towards the end of the ifland, where I had 
obferved fome favages had been, as before ; but not 
on the other fide : but, to my great affliction, it 
was on my fide of the ifland. 

I was indeed terribly furprized at the fight, and 
flopped ftiort within my grove, not daring to go out, 
lefl: I might be furprized ; and yet I had no more peace 
within, from the apprehenfions I had, that if thefe 
favages, in rambling over the ifland, fhould find my 
corn fl:anding, or cut, or any of my works and im- 
provements, they would immediately conclude that 
there were people in the place, and would then never 
give over till they found me out : In this extremity 
J went back direftly to my caftle, pulled up the ladder 
after me, having made all things without look as 
wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared my felf within, putting myfelf in a 
pofture of defence: I loaded all my cannon, as I 
called them, that is to fay, my mufquets, which were 
mounted upon my rew fortification, and all my pifl:ols, 
md refolved to defend myfelf to the laft gafp ; not 
(^3 forgetting 



^3® ^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

forgetting ferioufly to recommend myfelf to the divine 
protedion, and earneftly to pray to God to disliver 
me out of the hands of the barbarians ; and in this; 
pofture I continued about two hours, but began to 
be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for I 
had no fpies to fend out. 

After fitting a while longer, and mufing what I 
ihould do in this cafe, I v/as not able to bear fitting 
in ignorance longer j fo fetting up my ladder to the 
fide of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I 
obferved bjefore, and then pulling the ladder up after 
me, I fet it up again, and mounted to the top of the 
hill ; and pulling out my perfpedlive glafs, which I 
had taken on purpofe, I laid me down flat on my 
belly on the ground, and began to look for the 
place : I prefently found there were no lefs than 
nine naked favages fitting round a fmall fire they had 
made ; not to warm them, for they had no need of 
that, the weather being extreme hot ; but, as I fup-» 
pofed, to drefs fome of their barbarous diet of human 
flefli which they had brought with them, whether 
alive or dead I could not know. x 

They had two canoes with them, which they had 
hauled up upon the ftiore ; and as it was then tide of 
ebb, they feemed to me to wait the return of the 
flood to go away again. It is not eafy to imagine 
what confufion this fight put me into, efpecially feeing 
them come on my fide the ifland, and fo near me, 
too ; but when I obferved their coming muft be al- 
ways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards 
to be more fedate in my mind, being fatisfied that I 
might go abroad with fafety all the time of tide of 
flood, if they were not on ihore before j and having 

made 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 2^ 

made this obfervation, I went abroad about my har- 
veil work with the more compofure. 

As I expefted, fo it proved ; for as foon as the tid^ 
made to the weftward, I faw them all take boat, and 
row (or paddle, as we call it) all away : I fhould have 
•obferved, that for an hour and more before they went 
oft, they went to dancing, and I could ealily difcern 
their poftures and geftures by my glaffes : I could 
only perceive, by my niceft obfervation, that they 
were ftark naked, and had not the lead covering 
upon them ; but whether they were men or women, 
that I could not diftinguifh. 

As foon as I faw them fhipped and gone, I took two 
guns upon my fhoulders, and two piftols at my girdle, 
and my great fword by my fide, without a fcabbard ; 
and with all the fpeed I was able to make, I went 
away to the hill, where I had difcovered the firft ap- 
pearance of all. As foon as I got thither, which was 
not lefs than two hours (for I could not go apace, be- 
ing fo lo2^ded with arms as I was), I perceived there had 
been three canoes more of favages on that place ; and 
looking out further, I faw they were all at fea to- 
gether, making over for the main. 

This was a dreadful fight to me, efpecially, when 
going down to the fhore, I could fee the marks of 
horror which the difmal work they had been about 
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and 
part of the flefh of human bodies, eaten and devoured 
by thofe wretches with merriment and fport, I 
was fo filled with indignation at the fight, that I be- 
gan now to premeditate the deftruftion of the next 
that I faw there, let them be who or how many foever.

It feemed evident to me, that the vilits which they 
thus made to this ifland were not very frequent ^ 
for it was above fifteen months before any more of 
them came on fhore there again ; that is to fay, I 
never faw them, or any footfteps or fignals of them, 
in all that time ; for as to the rainy feafons, then they 
are fure not to come abroad, at leaft not fo far : yet 
all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reafon of the 
conftant apprehenfions I w^s in of their coming upon 
me by furprize; from whence lobferve, that the 
expectation of evil is nxore bitter than the fufFering, 
efpecially if there is no room to Ihake off that expec*. 
tation or thofe apprehenfions. 

During all this time, I was in the murdering hu- 
mour ; and took up mod of my hours, which fhould 
have been better employed, in contriving how to, 
circumvent and fall upon them the very next time I 
fhould fee them; efpecially if they fhould be di- 
vided, as they were the laft time, intp two parties j 
nor did I confider at all, that if I killed one party 3, 
fuppofe ten or a dozen, I was fl:ill the next day, or 
week, or month, to kill another, and fo another^ 
even ad infinitum^ till I fhpuld be at length no lefs a 
murderer than they were in being men-eaters, and 
perhaps much more fo. 

I fpent my days now in great perplexity an4 
anxiety of mind, expefting that I fhould one day 01^ 
other fall into the hands of thofe mercilefs creatures : 
if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not with- 
out looking round me with the greatefl care and 
caution imaginable ; and now I found, to my great 
comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame 

flock

flock or herd of goats ; for I durft not, upon any 
account, fire my gun, erpecially near that fide of the 
ifland where they ufaally came, left I fhould alarm 
the favages ; and if they had fled from me now, I was 
fure to have them come back again, with perhaps two 
or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, and 
then I knew what to expeft. 

However, I wore out a year and three months 
niote before I ever faw any more of the favages, and 
then I found them again, as I fhall foon obferve. It 
is true, they might have been there once or twice, 
t)ut either they made no ftay, or, at leaft, I did not 
hear them ; but in the month of May^ as near as I 
could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, 
I had a very ftrange encounter with them, of which 
in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen 
or fixteen months interval, was very great ; I flept 
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often 
ftarted out of my fleep in the night : in the day great 
troubles overwhelmed my mind ; in the night I 
dreamed often of killing the favages, and the reafons 
why I might juftify the cooing of it: But to wave all 
this for a while, it was in the middle of May^ on the 
fixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden 
calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the 
poft ftill ; I fay, it was on the fixteenth of May^ that 
it blew a great ftorm of wind all day, with a great 
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night 
was after it : I know not what was the particular 
pccafion of it ; but as I was reading in the bible, and 
taken up with ferious thoughts abput my prefent con- 
dition,^ 



234 ^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

dition, I was furprized with the noife of a gun, as I 
thought, fired at fea. 

This was, to be fure, a furprize of a quite different 
nature from any I had met with before ; for the no- 
tions this put into my thoughts were quite of another 
kind : I ftarted up in the greateft hafte imaginable ; 
and in a trice clapped up my ladder to the middle 
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mount- 
ing it the fecond time, got to the top of the hill; that 
very moment a flafh of fire bade me liften for a fecond 
gun, which accordingly in about half a moment I 
heard, and by the found knew that it was from that 
part of the fea where I was driven out with the cur- 
rent in my boat. 

I immediately confidered that this muft be fome 
fhip in diftrefs, and that they had fome comrade, or 
fome other fliip in company, and fired thefe guns for 
fignals of diftrefs, and to obtain help : I had this 
prefence of mind at that minute as to think, that 
though I could not help them, it may be they might 
help me : fo I brought together all the dry wood I 
could get at hand, and making a good handfome 
j[)ile, I fet it on fire upon the hill ; the wood was 
dry, and blazed freely, and though the wind blew 
very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, fo that I was cer- 
tain, if there was any fuch thing as a fhip, they muft 
needs fee it, and no doubt they did ; for as foon as 
ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gjm, and 
after that feveral others, all from the fame quarter. 
I plied my fire all night long, till day broke ; and 
when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I fa w 
fomething at a great diftance at fea, full eaft of the 

ifland j 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^^35 

ifland ; whether a fail or an hull I could not diftin* 
guifli, no, not with my glaffes, the diftance was fo 
great, and the weather ftill fomething hazy alfo ; at 
leaftit was fo out at fea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and foon per- 
ceived that it did not move ; fo I prefently concluded 
that it was a fhip at anchor ; and being eager, you 
may be fure, to be fatisfied, I took my gun in my 
hand, and ran towards the fouth-eaft fide of the 
ifland, to the rocks, vvhere I had been formerly carried 
away with the current; and getting up there, the 
weather by this time being perfedly clear, I could 
plainly fee, to my great forrow, the wreck of a fhip 
xraft away in the night upon thofe concealed rocks 
which I found when I was out in my boat ; and which 
rocks, as they checked the violence of the ftream, 
and made a kind of counter-ftream, or eddy, were 
the occafion of my recovering then from the moft 
defperate, hopelefs condition, that ever I had been in 
all my life. 

Thus, what is one man^s fafety is another man's 
-deftrudlion ; for it feems thefe men, whoever they 
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rock$ 
being wholly under water, had been driven upon 
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and 
E. N. E. Had they feen the ifland, as I mufl necef- 
farily fuppofe they did not, they mufl:, as I thought, 
have endeavoured to have favcd themfelves on fliore 
by the help of their boat j but the firing of their 
guns for help, efpecially when they faw, as I ima- 
gined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts : firft, 
I imagined, that, upon feeing my light, they might 
HaVe put themfelves into their boat, and have endea- 
voured 



^^6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

voured to make the fhore ; but that the fea going 
very high, they might have been caft away : other 
times I imagined, that they might have loft their 
boat before, as might be the cafe many ways ; as 
particularly, by the breaking of the fea upon their 
Ihip, which many times obliges men to ftave, or take 
in pieces their boat ; and fometimes to throw it over^ 
board with their awn hands ; other times I imagined, 
they had fome other (hip or fhips in company, who, 
upon the fignals of diftrefs they had made, had taken 
them up, and carried them off ; otherwhiles I fan- 
cied they were all gone off to fea in their boat, and 
being hurried away by the current that I had been, 
formerly in, v/ere carried out into the great ocean^ 
where there was nothing but mifery and perifliing ; 
and that perhaps they might by this time think of 
ftarving, and of being in a condition to eat one: 
another. 

As all thefe were but conjeftures at beft, fo, in. 
the condition I was in, I could do no more than look 
upon the mifery of the poor men, and pity them j 
which hifd ftill this good effeft on my fide, that it 
gave me more and more caufe to give thanks to God, 
who had fo happily and comfortably provided for me 
in my defolate condition ; and that of two fliips com- 
panies, who were now caft away upon this part of the 
world, not one life fhould be fpared but mine, I 
learnt here again to obferve, that it is very rare that 
the providence of God cafts us into any condition of 
life fo low, or any mifery fo great, but we may fee 
fomething or other to be thankful for, and may fee 
oth^r§ in worfe circumftances than our own. 

SugU

Such certainly was the cafe of thefe men, of 
whom I could not fo much as fee room to fuppofe any 
of them were faved ; nothing could make it rational^ 
fo much as to with or expefl: that they did not all 
perifli there, except the poffibility only of their being 
taken up by another fhip in company : and this was 
but mere poffibility indeed ; for I faw not the leaft 
fignal or appearance of any fuch thing, 

I cannot explain, by any poflible energy of words^ 
what a ftl-ange longing, or hankering of defire, t felt 
in my foul upon this fight ; breaking out fometimes 
thus : O that there had been but one or two, nayi 
but one foul faved out of the fliip^ to have efcaped 
to me, that I might but have had one companion^ 
one fellow-creature to have fpoken to. me, and to 
have converfed with ! In all the time of my folitary 
life, I never felt fo earneft, fo ftrong a defire after 
the fociety of my fellow-creatures, or fo deep a re* 
gret at the want of it. 

There are fome fecret moving fpiings in the afFec* 
tions, which, when they are fet a going by fome 
objea in view, or be it fome objefl: though not in view^ 
yet rendered prefent to the mind by the power of 
imagination, that motion carries out the foul by its 
impetuofity to fuch violent eager embracings of the 
objed, that the abfence of it is infupportable. 

Such were thefe earned wifliings. That but one 
man had been faved ! O thatit had been but one ! I 
believe I repeated the words, O that it had beeii but 
one ! a thoufand times ; and my defires were fo moved 
by it, that when I fpoke the words, my hands would 
clinch together, and my fingers prefs the palms of my 
hands, that if I had had any foft thing in my hand, 

it 



^38 LI^E AND ADVENTURES 

it would have cruflied it involuntarily ; and my teeth 
in my head would ftrike together, and fet againft one 
another fo ftrong, that for fome time I could not part 
them again. 

Let the naturalifts explain thefe things, and the 
reafon and manner of them : all I can fay of them 
is, to defcribe the fafl:, which was ever furprifing to 
me when I found it, though I knew not from what 
it fhould proceed ; it was doubtlefs the effeft of ar- 
dent wiflies, and of ftrong ideas formed in my mind, 
realizing the comfort which the converfation of one 
of my fellow-chriftians would have been to me. 

But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine, 
or both, forbad it ; for till the laft year of my being 
on this ifland, I never knew whether any were faved 
out of that fhip, or no ; and had only the afHiftion 
fome days after to fee the corpfe of a drowned boy 
come on Ihore, at the end of the ifland which was 
next the fhipwreck: he had on no clothes but a 
feaman^s waiftcoat, a pair of open kneed linen 
drawers, and a blue linen fiiirt j but nothing to diredt 
me fo much as to guefs what nation he was of: he 
had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, 
and a tobacco-pipe ; the laft was to me of ten times 
more value than the firft. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven- 
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I 
might find fomething on board that might be ufeful 
to me ; but that did not altogether prefs me fo much, 
as the pofllbility that there might be yet fome living 
creature on board, whofe life I might not only fave, 
but might, by faving that life, comfort my own to 
the laft degree: and this thought clung fo to my 

heart. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^39 

heart, that I could not be quiet night nor day, but I 
muft venture out in my boat on board this wreck ; 
and committing the reft to God's providence, I 
thought the impreffion was fo ftrong upon my mind, 
that it could not be refifted, that it muft come from 
fome invifible diredion, and that I fhould be want- 
ing to myfelf if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impreffion, I haftened 
back to my caftle, prepared every thing for my 
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for 
frefti water, a compafs to fteer by, a bottle of rum 
(for I had ftill a great deal of that left,) a bafket-full 
ofraifms: and thus loading myfelf with every thing 
neceffary, I went down to my boat, got the water 
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo 
in her, and then went home again for more : my 
fecond cargo was a great bag-full of rice, the um- 
brella to fet up over my head for fhade, another 
large pot full of frefh water, and about two dozen of 
my fmall loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, 
with a bottle of goat*s milk, and a cheefe ; all which, 
with great labour and fweat, I brought to my boafr; 
and praying to God to direfl: my voyage, I put out, 
and rowing or paddling the canoe along the fhore, I 
cam'e at laft to the utmoft point of the ifland, on that 
fide, viz. N. E. And now I was to launch out 
into the ocean, and either to venture, or not to ven- t 
ture ; I looked on the rapid currents which ran con- 
ftantly on both fides of the ifland, at a diftance, and 
which were very terrible to me, from the remem* 
brance of the hazard I had been in before, and my 
heart began to fail me ; for I forefaw, that if I was , 
driven into either of thofe currents, I fliould be car-

riied a vaft way out to fea, and perhaps out of mf 
reach or fight of the ifland again j and that then, ad 
hiy boat was but fmall, if any little gale of wind 
Ihould rife, I fhould be inevitably loft. 

Thefe thoughts fo opprefled iny mindj that I began 
to give over my enterprife ; and having haled my boat 
into a little creek on the ftiore, I ftepped out, and fat 
me down upon a little fpot of rifmg ground, very 
peufive and anxious, between fear and defire, about 
any voyage ; when, as I was mufing, I could perceive 
that the tide was turned, and the flood came on, 
upon which my goiiig was for fo many hours imprac- 
ticable : upon this it prefently occurred to me, that 
I fiiould go up to the higheft piece of ground I could 
find, and obferve, if I could, how the fets of the tide 
bT currents lay, when the flood came in, that I might 
Judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might 
hot expeft to be driven another way home, with the 
fame rapidnefs of the currents : this thought was no 
fooner in my head, but I caft my eye upon a little 
hill which fufliciently overlooked the fea both ways^ 
and from whence I had a clear view of the curreoits^ 
or fets of the tide, and which way I was to guide 
myfelf in my return : here I foimd, that as the cur- 
rent of the ebb fet out elofe by the fouth point of the 
ifland, fo the current of the flood fet in clofe by the 
fliore of the north-fide ; and that I had nothing, to do 
but to keep to the north of the ifland in my return, 
and I fliould do well enough. 

Encouraged with this obfervation, I tefolved the 
next morning to fet out with the firft of the tide ; and 
repofing myfelf for that night in the canoe, under 
the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out : 

I made

1 made firfl: a little out to fea, full north, till I began 
to feel the benefit of the current, which fet eaftward, 
and which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not 
fo hurry me as the fouthern-fide current had done 
before, and fo as to take from me all government of 
the boat ; but having a ftrong fteerage with my pad- 
dle, I went, I fay, at a great rate, direftly for the 
Wreck, and in lefs than two hours I came up to it. 

It was a difmai fight to look at : the fliip, which 
by its building was Spanijhj ftuck fail, jambed in 
between two rocks ; all the ftern and quarter of her 
was beaten to pieces with the fea ; and as her fore- 
caftle, which ftuck in the rocks, had run on with 
great violence, her main-maft and fore*maft were 
brought by the board, that is to fay, broken fhort 
off, but her bowfprit was found, and the head and 
bow appeared firm : When I came clofe to her, a 
dog appeared upon her, which, feeing me coming, 
yelped and cried, and as foon as I called him, jumped 
into the fea to come to me ; and I took him into the 
boat, but found him almoft dead for hunger and 
thirft : I gave him a cake of my bread, and he ate 
like a ravenous wolf that had been ftarving a fort- 
night in the fnow : I then gave the poor creature 
fome frefh water, with which, if I would have let 
him, he would have burft himfelf. 

After this I went on board : the firft fight I met 
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or 
forecaftle of the fhip, with their arms faft about one 
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that 
when the fhip ftruck, it being in a ftorm, the fea 
broke fo high, and fo continually over her, that the 
men were not able to bear it, and were ftrangled with 

Vol. I. R the

the conftant rufhing in of the water, as much as if 
they had been under water j befides the dog, there 
was nothing left in the fhip that had life, nor any 
•goods that I could fee, but what were fpoiled by the 
water : there were fome cafks of liquor, whether 
wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the 
hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could 
fee ; but they were two big to meddle with : I faw 
feveral chefts, which I believed belonged to fome of 
the feamen, and I got two of them into the boat with- 
out examining what was in them. 

Had the ftern of the fhip been fixed, and the fore- 
part broken off, I am perfuaded I might have made 
a good voyage ; for by what I found in thefe two 
chefts, I had room to fuppofe the fhip had a great 
deal of wealth on board ; and if I may guefs by the 
courfe fhe fleered, fhe miift have been bound from 
the Buenas Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata^ m the 
fouth part of America^ beyond the Brafils^ to the 
Havannaj in the gulph of Mexico^ and fo perhaps 
to Spain : She had, no doubt, a great treafure in her, 
but of no ufe at that time to any body ; and what 
became of the reft of her people I then knew not. 

I found, befides thefe chefts, a little cafk full of 
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my. 
boat with much difficulty : there were feveral muf- 
quets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with 
about four pounds of powder in it ; as for the muf- 
quets, I had no occafion for them, fo I left them, 
but took the powder-horn ; I took a fire-fhovel and 
tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as alfo two little 
brafs kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a 
grid-iron j and with this cargo, and the dog, I came 

away. 



OF ROBli^SON CRUSOE. 243 

away, the tide beginning to make home again ; and 
the fame evening, about an hour within night, I 
reached the ifland again, weary and fatigued to the 
laft degree. 

I repofed that night in the boat, and in the morn- 
ing I refolved to harbour what I had gotten in my 
tiew cave, not to carry it home to my caftle : after 
refrefliing myfelf, I got all my cargo on fhore, and 
began to examine the particulars : the cafk of liquor 
I found to be a kind of rum, but not fuch as v/e had 
lat the Brafils ; and, in a word, not at all good j but 
when I came to open the chefts, I ifound fevcral 
things which I wanted : for example, I found in one 
a fine cafe of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and 
filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good ; the 
bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped 
with filver : 1 found two pots of very good fuccades, 
or fweet-meats, fo faftened alfo on the top, that the 
fait water had not hurt them ; and two more of the 
fame, which the water had fpoiled : I found fome 
Very good fhirts, which were very welcome to me, 
and about a dozen and a half of white linen hand- 
kerchiefs, and coloured neck-cloths ; the former were 
alfo very welcome, being exceeding refrefliing to 
wipe my face in an hot day : befides this, when I 
came to the till in the chefts, I found there three great 
bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven 
hundred pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapt 
up in a paper, fix doubloons of gold, and fome fmall 
bars or wedges of gold j I fuppofe they might all 
weigh near a pound. 

The other cheft I found had fome clothes in it, but 
of little value j but by the circumftances, it muft have 

R 2 belonged 



244 LI^E AND ADVENTURES 

belonged to the gunner's mate, as there was no pow- 
der in it, but about two pounds of glazed powder 
in thp three flalks, kept, I fuppofe, for charging 
their fowling-pieces on occafion : Upon the whole, 
I got very little by this voyage that was of much ufe 
to me } for as to the money, I had no manner of 
occafion for it ; it was to me as the dirt under my 
feet } and I would have given it all for three or four 
pair of Englijh Ihoes and (lockings, which were things 
I greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet now 
for many years : I had, indeed, got two pair of 
Ihoes now, which I took oflf the feet of the two 
drowned men whom I faw in the wreck ; and I 
found two pair more in one of the chefts, which 
were very welcome to me j but they were not like our 
Englijh flioes, either for eafe or fervice, being rather 
what we call pumps than fhoes : I found in the fea- 
man's cheft about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but 
no gold } I fuppofe this belonged to a poorer man 
than the other, which feemed to belong to fome 
officer. 

Well, however, I lugged the mojiey home to my 
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before 
which I brought from our ou^n fliip ; but it was great 
pity, as I faid, that the other part of the fliip had not 
come to my fliare, for I am fatisfied I might have 
loaded my canoe feveral times over with money^ 
which, if I had ever cfcaped to England^ would have 
lain here fafe enough till I might have come again 
and fetched it. 

Having now brought all my things on fhore, and 
fecured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or 
paddled her along the fhore to her old harbour, where 

I laid 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 245 

I laid her up, and made the beft of my way to my old 
habitation, where I found every thing fafe and quiet ; 
fo I began to repofe myfelf, live after my old fafhion, 
and take care of my family affairs ; and for a while I 
lived eafy enough ; only that I was more vigilant 
than I ufed to be, looked out oftener, and did not go 
abroad fo much ; and if at any time I did ftir with 
any freedom, it was always to the eaft part of the 
ifland, where I was pretty well fatisfied the favages 
never came, and where I could go without fo many 
precautions, and fuch a load of arms and ammuni- 
tion as I always carried with me, if I went the other 
way. 

I lived in this condition near two years more j but 
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it 
was born to make my body miferable, was all thefe 
two years filled with projeds and defigns, how, if it 
were poffible, I mi^ht get away from this ifland ; for 
fometimes I was for making another voyage to the 
wreck, though my reafon told me, that there was 
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage : 
fometimes for a ramble one way, fometimes another ; 
and I believe verily, if I had the boat that I went 
from Sallee in, I fhould have ventured to fea, bound 
any where, I knew not whither. 

I have befen, in all my circumftanees, a momento 
to thofe who are touched with that general plague of 
mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of 
their miferies flow ; I mean, that of not being fatis- 
fied with the fl:ation wherein God and nature hath 
placed them ; for, not to look back upon my primi- 
tive condition, and the excellent advice of my father 
the opppfition to which was, as I may call it, my 

R 3 original 



24^ tIFE AND ADVENTURES 

original fin, my fubfequent miftakes of the fame kind 
have been the means of my coming into this mife- 
rable condition ; for had that Providence, which fo 
happily had feated me at the Bra/ils as a planter, 
bleffed me with confined defires, and could I hav€t 
been contented to have gone on gradually, I might 
have been by this time, I mean, in the time of my 
being, on this ifland, one of the mod confiderable 
planters in the Brafils ; nay, I am perfuaded, that 
by the improvements I had made in that Uttle time I 
lived there, and the increafe I fhould probably have 
made if I had ftaid, I might have been worth an 
hundred thoufand moidores ; and what bufmefs had 
I to leave a fettled fortune, well-ftocked plantation, 
improving and increafmg, to turn fuper-cargo to 
Guinea^ to fetch Negroes, when patience and time 
would fo have increafed our flock at home, that v/e 
Gould have bought them at our own doors, from, 
thofe whofe bufmefs it was to fetch them ? And 
though it had cofl us fomething more, yet the differ- 
ence of that price was by no means worth faving at 
fo great a hazard. 

BiUt as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, fa. 
refieflion upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the 
exercife of more years, or of the dear-bought ex-, 
perience of time ; and fo it was with me now ; and. 
yet, fo deep had the miflake taken root in my temper,^ 
that I could not fatisfy myfelf in my flation, but was 
continually poring upon the means and poflibility of 
my efcape from this place : and that I may, with the 
greater pleafure to the reader, bring on the remain^ 
ing part of my ftory, it may not be improper to give

this foolifli fclieme for my efcape ; and how, and 
upon what foundation, I afted. 

I am now to be fuppofed to be retired into my 
callle, after my late voyage to the vvreck, my frigate 
laid up, and fecured under water as ufual, and my 
condition reftored to what it was before : I had more 
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at 
all the richer ; for I had no more ufe for it than 
the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came 
thither. 

It was one of the nights, in the rainy feafon in 
March ^ the four-and-twentieth year of my firft fetting 
foot in this ifland of folitarinefs, I was lying in my 
bed or hammock, awake, and very well in health, 
had no pain, no diftemper, no uneafinefs of body, 
no. nor any uneafinefs of mind more than ordinary, 
but could by no means clofe my eyes, that is, fo as 
to fleep ; no, not a wink all night long, otherwife 
than as follows : 

It is as impoffible as needlefs, to fet down the innu- 
merable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that 
great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this 
night^s time : I ran over the whole hiftory of my life 
in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to 
my coming to this ifland ; and alfo of that part of 
my life fmce I came to this ifland. In my reflec- 
tions upon the ftate of my cafe, fince I came on 
fhore on this ifland, I was comparing the happy 
pofliure of my aflfairs in the firft years of my habita- 
tion here, to that courfe of anxiety, fear, and care, 
which I had lived in ever fince I had feen the print of 
a foot in the fand ; not that I did not believe the fa- 
vages had frequented the ifland even all the while, and 
might have been feveral hundreds of them at times

on the fhore there ; but as I had never known it, 
and was incapable of any apprehenfions about it, my 
fatisfadion was perfeft, though my danger was the 
fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing my dan- 
ger, as if I had never really been expofed to it ; this 
furniflied my thoughts with many very profitable 
refleftions, and particularly this one : How infinitely 
good that Providence is, which has fettled in its 
government of mankind fuch narrow bounds to his 
fight and knowledge of things ; and though he walks 
in the midft of fo many thoufand dangers, the fight 
of which, if difcovered to him, would diftraO: his 
mind, and fink his fpirits, he is kept ferene and 
calm, by having the events of things hid from his 
eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which fur- 
round him. 

After thefe thoughts had for fonie timg entertained 
xne, I came to refledk ferioufly upon the real danger 
I had been in for fo many years in this very ifland ; 
and how I had walked about in the greateftfecurity, 
and with all poflible tranquillity, even perhaps when 
nothing but a brow on a hill, a great tree, or the 
cafual approach of night, had been betwreen me and 
the worft kind of deftrudipn, ''viz. that of falling 
into the hands of cannibals' and favages, who would 
have feized on me with the fame view as I did on a 
goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime 
to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a 
curlieu ; I fhould unjufty flander myfelf, if I fhould 
fay I was not fincerely thankful to my great Prefervef, 
to whofe fingular proteftion I acknowledged, with 
great humility, that all thefe unknown deliverances 
were due, and without which I fhould inevitably 
have fallen into their, mqrcilefs hands. 

When 



OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE^ 249 

When thefe thoughts were over, my head was for 
fome time taken up in confidering the nature of thefe 
wretched creatures, I mean, the favages ; and how 
it came to pafs in the world, that the wife Governor 
of all things fliould give up any of his creatures to 
fuch inhumanity, nay, to fomething fo much below, 
even brutality itfelf, as to devour Its own kind : but 
as this ended in fome (at that time fruitlefs) fpecula- 
jions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the 
world thefe wretches lived in ; how far off the coafl: 
was from whence they came ; what they ventured fo 
far from home for ; what kind of boats they had ; 
and why I might not order myfelf, and my bufinefs 
fo, that I might be as able, to go over thither as they 
were to come to me. 

I never fo much as troubled myfelf to confider, 
what I fhould do with myfelf when I came thither ; 
what fhould become of me if I fell into the hands of 
the favages ; or how I fhould efcape from them, if 
they attempted me ; no, nor fo much as how it was 
poffible for me to reach the coafl, and not be attacked 
by fome or other of them, without any poffibility of 
delivering myfelf ; and if I fhould not fall into their 
hands, what I fhould do for provifion, or whither I 
fliould bend my courfe; none of thefe thoughts, I 
fay, fo much as came in my way ; but my mind was 
wholly bent upon the notion of my paffingoverin 
my boat to the main land : I looked back upon my 
prefent condition as the mofl miferable that could 
poffibly be ; that I was not able to throw myfelf into 
any thing but death, that could be called worfe ; that 
if I reached the fhore of the mains I might, perhaps, 
jneet with relief} or I might cqaft along, as I did ou 

the 



250 l^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

the fhore of Africa^ till I came to fome inhabited 
country, and where I might find fome relief; and 
after all, perhaps, I might fall in with fome Chriftian 
ihip that might take me in ; and if the worft came 
to the worft, I could but die, which would put an end 
to all thefe miferies at once. Pray, note, all this 
was the fruit of a difturbed mind, an impatient tem- 
per, made, as it were, defperate by the long con* 
tinuance of my troubles, and the difappointments I 
had met in the wreck I had been on board of, and 
where I had been fo near the obtaining of what I fo 
earneftly longed for, i^/z, fomebody to fpeak to, and 
to learn fome knowledge from of the place where I 
was, and of the probable means of my deliverance : 
I fay, I was agitated wholly by thefe thoughts. All 
my calm of mind in my refignation to Providence, 
and waiting the iffue of the difpofitions of Heaven, 
feemed to be fufpended ; and I had, as it were, no 
power to turn my thoughts to any thing but the pro- 
jeft of a voyage to the main ; which came upon me 
with fuch force, and fuch an impetuofity of defire^ 
that it was not to be refifted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours 
or more, with fuch violence that it fet my very blood 
into a ferment, and my pulfe beat as high as if I had 
been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fer- 
vour of my mind about it ; nature, as if I had been 
fatigued and exhaufted with the very thought of it, 
threw me into a found fleep ; one would have thought 
I fhould have dreamed of it ; but I did not, nor of 
any thing relating to it ; but I dreamed that as 1 was 
going out in the morning, as ufual from my caftle, 
I faw upon the fliore.two canoes, and eleven favages 

coming 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 951 

coming to land, and that they brought with them 
another iavage, whom they were going to kill, in or- 
der to eat him ; when, on a fudden, the favage that 
they were going to kill, jumped away, and ran for 
his life 2 then 1 thought in my fleep, that he came 
running into my little thick grove, before my fortifica- 
tion, to hide himfelf ; and that I feeing him alone, and 
not perceiving that the others fought him that way, 
Ihewed myfelf to him, and fmiling upon him, encou- 
raged him, that he kneeled down to me, feeming to 
pray me to allift him ; upon which I fhewed my lad- 
der, made him go up it, and carried him into my 
cave, and he became my fervant ; and that ^as foon 
as I had got this man, I faid to myfelf. Now I may 
certainly venture to the main land ; for this fellow 
will ferve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and 
whither to go for provifions, and whither not to go 
for fear of being devoured ; what places to venture 
into, and what to efcape, I waked with this 
thought, and was under fuch inexpreffible impreffions 
of joy at the profpcdt of my efcape in my dream, that 
the difappointments which I felt upon coming to my- 
felf, and finding it was no more than a dream, were , 
equally extravagant the other way, and threw me 
into a very great dejeftion of fpirit. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclufion, that 
my only way to go about an attempt for an efcape, 
was, if poffible, to get a favage in my pofleffion ; and, 
if poffible, it fhould be' one of their prifoners whom 
they had condemned to be eaten, and fhould bring 
hither to kill ; but thefe thoughts ftill were attended 
with this difficulty, that it was impoffible to effisdt 
this, without attacking a whole caravan of them, and 

killing 



«52 I-IFE AKD ADVENTURES 

killing them all; and this was not only a very 
defperate attempt, and might mifcarry ; but, on the 
other hand, I had greatly fcrupled the lawfulnefs of 
it to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of 
Ihedding fo much blood, though it was for my deli- 

.verance: I need not repeat the arguments which 
occurred to me againft this, they .being the fame 
mentioned before: but though I had other reafons to 

^ oflfer now, viz. that thofe men were enemies to my 
life, and would devour me, if they could ; that it was 
felf-prefervation, in the higheft degree, to deliver my- 
felf from this death of life, and was afling in my 
own defence, as much as if they were adually af- 
faulting me, and the like ; I fay, though thefe things 
argued for it, yet the thoughts of ihedding human 
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, 
and fuch as I could by no means reconcile myfelf to 
a great while. 

However, at laft, after many fecret difputes with 
myfelf, and after great perplexities about it (for all 
thefe arguments, one way and another, ftruggled in 
my head a long time), the eager prevailing delire of 
deliverance at length maftered all the reft, and I re^ 
folved, if poflible to get one of thefe favages into my 
hands, coft what it would t the next thing then was 
to contrive how to do it ; and this indeed was very 
difficult to refolve on : but as I could pitch upon no 
probable means fqr it, fo I refolved to put myfelf 
upon the watch to fee them when they came on fhore, 
and leave the reft to the event, taking fuch meafures 
as the opportunity fhould prefent, let it be what it 
would. 

With 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE» ±$^ 

With thefe refolutions in my thoughts, I fet myfelf 
upon the fcout as often as poffible, and indeed fo of- 
ten, till I was heartily tired of it ; for it was above a 
year and an half that I waited^ and for a great part 
of that time went out to the weft end, and to the 
fouth^weft corner of the ifland, almoft every day, to 
fee the canoes, but none appeared: this was very dif- 
couraging, and began to trouble me much ; though 
I, can't fay that it did in this cafe, as it had done fome 
time before that, viz. wear off the edge of my delire 
to the thing ; but the longer it feemed to be delayed, 
the more eager I was for it : in a word, I Mas not at 
firft more careful to Ihun the fight of thefe favages, 
and avoid being feen by them, than I was now eager 
to be upon them. 

Befides, I fancied myfelf able to manage one, nay, 
two or three favages, if I had them, fo as to make 
them entirely flaves to me, to do whatever I fhould 
direO: them, and to prevent their being able, at any 
time, to do me any hurt : it was a great while that I 
pleafed myfelf with this affair, but nothing ftill pre- 
fented ; all my fancies and fchemes came to nothing, 
for no favages came near me for a great while. 

About a year and an half after I had entertained 
thefe notions, and, by long mufing, had, as it were, 
tefolved them all into nothing, for want of an occa- 
fion to put them in execution, I was furprifed one 
morning early, with feeing no lefs than five canoes 
all on Ihore together, on my fide the ifland, and the 
people who belonged to them all landed, and out of 
my fight : the number of them broke all my mea- 
fures ; for feeing fo many, and knowing that they 
always came four, or fix, or fometimes more, in a 

boat.

boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how td 
. take my meafures to attack twenty or thirty men 
fmgle-handed } fo I lay ftill in my caftle, perplexed 
and difcomforted ; howeverj I put myfelf into all 
the fame poftures for an attack that I had formerly 
provided, and was juft ready for aftion^ if any 
thing had prefented: having waited a good whlle^ 
liftening to hear if they made any noife ; at length 
being very impatient, 1 fet my guns at the: foot of 
my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill 
by my two ftages, as ufual ; (landing fo, however ^ 
that my head did not appear above the hill, fo that 
they could not perceive me by any means : here I 
obferved by the help of my perfpeftive glafs, that 
they were no lefs than thirty in number ; that they 
had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dreffed ; 
how they cooked it, that I knew not, or what it 
Avas ; but they were all dancing in I know not how 
Inany barbarous geftures and figures, their own way, 
tound the fire. 

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived by 
my perfpeftive two miferable wretches dragged from 
the boats, where, it feems, they were laid by, and 
were now brought out for the flaughter : I perceived 
one of them immediately fall, being knocked down, 
I fuppofe, with a club or wooden fword, for that was 
their way ; and two or three others were at work im- 
mediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while 
the other viftim was left ftanding by himfelf, till they 
ihould be ready for him : in that very moment this 
poor wretch, feeing himfelf a little at liberty, fiature 
infpired him with hopes of life, and he ftarted away 
from them, and ran with incredible fwiftnefs along

the fands, direcHy towards me, I mean, towards that 
part of the coaft where my habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I muft acknowledge) 
when I perceived him to run my way ; and efpecially 
when, as I thought, I faw him purfued by the whole 
body ; and now I expeded that part of my dream 
was coming to pafs, and that he would certainly 
take Ihelter in my grove ; but I could not depend^ 
by any means, upon my dream for the reft of it, 
'uiz. that the other favages would not purfue him 
thither, and find him there. However, I kept my 
ftation, and my fpirits began to recover, when I 
found that there were not above three men that 
followed him; and ftill more was I encouraged, 
when I found that he outftript them exceedingly in 
running, and gained ground of them, fo that if he 
could but hold it for half an hour, I faw eafily 
he would fairly get away from them all. 

There was between them and my caftle the creek, 
which I mentioned often at the firft part of my ftory, 
when I landed my cargoes out of the fhip ; and this 
I knew, he muft neceffarily fwim over, or the poor 
wretch would be taken there :' but when the favage 
efcaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though 
the tide was then up ; but plunging in, fwam through 
in about thirty ftrokes, or thereabouts, landed, and 
ran on with exceeding ftrength and fwiftnefs : when 
the three purfuers came to the creek, I found that 
two of them could fwim, but the third could not, 
and that he, ftanding on the other fide, looked at 
the other, but went no farther ; and foon after went 
foftly back again, which, as it happened, was very 
well for him in the main. 

I obferved, 



256 JLIfE At^D At)VENtUli£$ 

I obferved, that the two who fwam were yet mbref 
than twice as long fwimming over the creek than the! 
fellow was that fled from them : it came now very 
warmly, upon my thoughts, and indeed irrefiftibly, 
that now was my time to get a fervant, and perhaps 
a companion, or affiftant, and that I was called 
. plainly by Providence to fave this poor creature's lifei 
. I. immediately got down the ladders with all polEble 
expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both 
-at the foot of the, ladder, as I obferved above ; and 
gettiiig up again ynth the fame hafte to the top of 
the hill, I croffed towards the fea; and having a 
very fhort cut, and all down hill, clapped myfelf 
in the way between the purfuers and the purfued, 
hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking b^ck, 
was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me as at 
them ; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come 
back; and in the mean. time, I flowly advanced to- 
wards the two that followed ; then rufliing at once 
upon the foremoft, I knocked him down with the 
(lock of my piece ; I was loth to fire, becaufe I would 
not have the reft hear, though at that diftance it 
would not have been eafily heard ; and being out of 
light of the fmoke too, they would not have eafily 
known what to make of it. Having knocked this 
fellow down, the other who purfued him ftopped, 
as if he had been frightened, and I advanced apace 
towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived 
prefently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it 
to flioot at me ; fo I was then neceflitated to flioot at 
him firft ; which I did, and killed him at the firft 
fliot. The poor favage who fled, but had ftopped, 
though he faw both his enemies fallen, and killed

(as he thought) yet was fo frighted with the fire and 
noife of my piece, that he flood ftock-flill, and 
neither came forward nor went backward, though 
he feemed rather inclined to fly flill, than to come 
on. I hallooed again to him, and made figiis to 
come forward, which he eafily underflood, and came 
a little way, then flopped again, and then a little 
farther, and flopped again ; and I could then perceive 
that he flood trembling, as if he had been taken pri- 
foner, and had jufl been to be killed, as his two 
enemies were. I beckoned him again to come to me, 
and gave him all the figns of encouragement that I 
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, 
kneeling down every ten or twelve fleps, in token of 
acknowledgment for faving his life. I fmiled at him 
and looked pleafantly, and beckoned to him to come 
ftill nearer. At length he came clofe to me, and 
then he kneeled down again, kiffed the ground, and 
laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the 
foot, fet my foot upon his head : This, it fcems, was 
In token of fwearing to be my flave for ever. I took 
him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him 
all I could. But there was more work to do yet; 
for I perceived the favage, whom I knocked down, 
was not killed, but flunned with the blow, and began 
to come to himfelf : fo I pointed to him, and fhewed 
him the favage, that he was not dead : upon this he 
fpoke fome words to me ; and though I could not 
underfland them, yet I thought, they were pleafant to 
hear, for they were the firfl found of a man's voice 
that I had heard, my own excepted, for above five- 
and-twenty years : but there was no time for fuch 
refledlions now : the favage, who was knocked down. 
Vol. I. S recovered

recovered himfelf fo far as to fit up upon the ground ; 
and I perceived that my favage began to be afraid ;j 
but when I faw that, I prefented my other piece at the 
man, as if I would fhoot him : upon this my favage> 
for fo I call him now, made a motion to me to len4 
him my fword, which hung naked in a belt by my 
fide J fo I did : he no fooner had it, but he runs tp 
his enemy, ' and at one blow cut off his head fo cle* 
verly, no executioner in Germany could have done^ 
It fooner or better ; which I thought it very ftrange 
for one, who, I had reafon to believe, never faw a 
fword in his life before, except their own wooden 
fwords: however it feems, as I learned afterwards, 
they make their wooden fwords fo Iharp, fo heavy^ 
and the wood is fo hard, that they will cut off heads 
even with them, nay, and arms, and that at one blow 
too. When he had done this, he comes laughing 
to me in fign of triumph, and brought me the fword 
again, and, with abundance of geftures, which I did 
not underftandj laid it down, with the head of the 
favage that he had killed, juft before me. 

But that which aftoniflied him moft was, to know 
how I had killed the other Indian fo far off; fo point- 
ing to him, he made figns to jne to let him go to him; 
fo I bade him go, as well as I could: When he came 
to him, he ftood like one amazed, looking at him } 
turned him firft on one fide, then on t'other ; looked 
at the wound the bullet had made, which it feems 
was juft in his breaft, where it had made an hole, 
and no great quantity of blood had followed j but he 
had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead : then h^ 
took up his bow and arrows, and came back ; fo I 
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow

tiie, making figns to him that more might come 
after them. 

Upon this he figned to me, that he fliould bury 
them with fand, that they might not be feen by the 
reft, if they followed ; and fo I made figns again to 
him to do fo : he fell to work, and in an inftant he 
had fcraped an hole in the fand with his hands, big 
enough to bury the firft in, and then dragged him 
into it, and covered him, and did fo alfo by the 
other : I believe he had buried them both in a quar- 
ter of an hour: then calling him away, I carried 
him not to my caftle, but quite away to my cave, on 
the farther part -of the ifland ; fo I did not let my 
dream come to pafs in that part ; viz. that he came 
into my grove for Ihelter* 

Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raifins to 
eat, and a draught 6f water, which I found he was 
indeed in great diftrefs for, by his running ; and 
having refrefhed him, I made figns for him to go lie 
down and fleep, pointing to a place where. I had laid 
a great parcel of rice-ftraw, and a blanket upon it, 
which I ufed to fleep upon myfelf fometimes : fo the 
poor creature lay down, and went to fleep. 

He was a comely handfome fellow, perfectly wel 
made, with ftraight long limbs, not too large, tall 
and well-fliaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-fix 
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not 
a fierce and furly afpefl:, but feemed to have fome- 
thing very manly in his face, and yet he had all the 
fweetnefs and foftnefs of an European in his coun- 
tenance too, efpecially when he fmiled : his hair was 
long and black, not curled like wool ; his forehead 
very high and large, and a great vivacity and 

S 2 ^fparkling 



i6<J ll^B A^D ADV£NtURS9 

^arkling fharpnefs in his eyes. The colouf of liis 
fkin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet 
Bot of an ugly yellow naufeous tawny, as the Bra* 
Jtlians and Virginians^ and other natives of America 
are ; but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that 
had in it fomething very agreeable, though not very 
eafy to defcribe. His face was round and plump^ 
his nofe fmall, not flat like the negroes, a very good 
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-fet, and 
ivhite as ivory. After he had flumbered, rather than 
flept, about half an hour, he waked again, and come* 
out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my 
goats^ which I had in the inclofure juft by : when 
he efpied me, he came running to me, laying himfelf 
down again upon the ground, with all the pofSble 
figns of an humble thankful difpofition, making many 
atitlc geilutes to fliew if. At laft he lays his head 
flat upon the gfoutid^ clofe to my foot, and fets my 
other foot upon his head, as he had done before ; and 
after this, made all the figns to me of fubjeftion, 
fervitude, and fubmiflion imaginable, to let me know 
how much he would ferve me as long as he lived : 
* I underflood him in many things, and let him know 
1 was very well pleafed with him* In a little time I 
began to fpeak to him, and teach him to fpeak to 
me : and firft, I made him know his name fliould be 
Friday y yihidi was the day I faved his life; and I 
called him fo for the memory of the time : I likewife 
taught him to fay Majier^ and then let him know that 
was to be my name ; I likewife taught him to fay 
Tes and No^ and to know the meaning of them: I 
gave him fome milk in an earthen pot, and let him 
fee me drink it before him, and fop my bread in it j

and I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, ^vhich 
he quickly complied with, and made figns that it 
was very good for him. 

I kept there with him all that night ; but as foon as 
it was day, I beckoned him to come with me, and 
let him know I would give him fome clothes ; at which 
he feemed very glad, for he was ftark-naked. As 
we went by the place where he had buried the two 
men, he pointed exaftly to the fpot, and fhewed me 
the marks that he had made to find them again, mak- 
ing figns to me that we flibuld dig them up again, 
and eat them ; at this I appeared very angry, ^xpreffed 
my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the 
thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him 
to come away, which he did immediately, with great 
fubmiffion : I then led him up to the top of the hill, 
to fee if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my 
glafs, I looked, and faw plainly the place where they 
had been, but no appearance of them, or of their 
canoes ; fo that it was plain that they were gone, and 
had left their two comrades behind them, without any 
fearch after them. 

But I was not content with this difcovery ;' but 
having now more courage, and confequently 'more 
curiofity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him 
the fword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at 
his back, which I found he could ufe very dexte* 
roufly, making him carry one gun for me, and I two 
for myfelf, and away we marched to the place where 
thefe creatures had been ; for I had a mind now to 
get fome fuller intelligence of them. When I came to

indeed It was a dreadful fight, at leaft it was fo to me^ 
though Friday made nothing of it ; the place was 
covered with human bones, the ground dyed with 
the blood, great pieces of flejfh left here and there, 
half-eaten, mangled, and .fcorched ; and, in fhort, 
all the tokens of tjie triumphant feaft they had been 
making there, after a viftory over their enemies : I 
faw three IkuUs, five hands, and the bones of three 
or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts 
of the bodies j and Friday^ by his figns made me 
underftand that they brought over four prifoners tq 
feaft upon ; that three of them were eaten up, and 
that he, pointing to himfelf, was the fourth : that 
there had been a great battle between them and their 
next king, whofe fubjefts, it feems, he had been one 
of; and that they had taken a great number of pri- 
foners^ air which were carried to feveral places by 
thofe that had taken them in the flight, in order to 
leaft upon them, as was done here by thefe wretches 
upon thofe they brought hither. 

1 caufed Friday to gather all the ikulls, bones, flefli, 
and whatever remained, and lay them together ou 
an heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn 
them all to alhes : I found Friday had ftill an hanker- 
ing ftomach after fpme of the flefh, and was ftill a 
cannibal in his nature ; but I difcovered fo much ab- 
horrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the leaft 
appearance of it, that he durft not difcover it ; for I 
had, by fome means, let him know, that I would 
kill him if he offered it. 

When he had done this, we cam^ back to our 
caftle, and there I fell to work with n^y man Friday : 
iind firft of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawerj^ 

whieb

ip^hich I had out of the poor gunner's cheft I men- 
tioned, and which I found in the wreck; and 
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very 
well : then I made him a jerkin of goat's-lkin as 
well as my ikill would allow, and I was now grown 
a tolerable good taylor: and I gave him a cap, which 
I had made of an hare-fkin, very convenient, and 
faftuonable enough : and thus he was dreffed, for 
the prefent, tolerably well, and mighty well was he 
p!eafed to fee himfelf almoft as well clothed as his maf- 
ter : it is true, he went awkwardly in thefe things at 
firft ; wearing the drawers was very awkward to him, 
and the fleeves of the waiftcoat galled his fhoulder$ 
and the infide of his arms ; but a little eafing them, 
where he complained they hurt him, and ufing him^ 
felf to them, at length he took to them very well. 

The next day after I came home to my hutch with . 
him, I began to confider where I (hould lodge him j 
and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfeftly 
eafy myfelf, I m^de a little tent for him in the vacant 
place between my two fortifications, in the infide of 
the laft, and in the outfide of the firft : and as there 
was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a 
formal framed door-cafe, and a door to it of boards, 
and fet it up in the paffage, a little within the entrance ; 
and caufing the door to open on the infide, I barred 
it up in the night, taking in my ladders too ; -fo that 
Friday could no way come at me in the infide of my 
innermoft wall, without making fo much noife in 
getting over, that it muft needs awaken me ; for my 
firft wall had now a complete roof over it of longj 
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the 
fide of the hill, which was again laid crofs with fmaH

(licks inftead of laths, and then thatched over a great 
thicknefs with the rice-ftraw, which was ftrong like 
reeds ; and at the hole or place which was left to ga 
in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap- 
door, which if it had been attempted on the out* 
fide, would not have opened at all, but would have 
fallen down, and made a great noife ; and as to wea- 
pons, I took them all into my fide every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution j for never 
man had a more faithful, loving, fincere fervant than 
Friday was to me ; without paffions, fuUennefs, or 
defigns ; perfectly obliging and engaging ; his very 
affedions were tied to me, like thofe of a child to a 
father ; and I dare fay, he would have facrificed his 
life for the faving mine, upon any occafion whatfo- 
eyer : the many teftimonies he gave me of this, put 
it out of doubt ; and foon convinced me, that I 
needed to ufe no precautions as to my fafety on his 
account. 

This frequently gave me occafion to obferve, and 
that with wonder, that, however it had pleafed God^ 
in his providence, and in the government of the 
works of his hands, to take from fo great a part of 
the world, of his creatures, the beft ufes to which 
their faculties and the powers of their fouls are 
adapted ; yet that he has beflowed upon them the 
fame powers, the fame reafon, the fame affedions, 
the fame fentiments of kindnefs and obligation, the 
fame paffions and refentments of wrongs, the fame 
fenfe of gratitude, fincerity, fidelity, and all the 
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that 
he has given to us j and that when he pleafes to offer 
them occafions of exerting thefe, they are as ready, 

i^ay. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^6$ 

nay, more ready to apply them to the right ufes for 
which they were bellowed, than we are. And this 
made me very melancholy fometimes, in refleding, 
as the feveral pccafions prefented, how mean a ufe 
we make of all thefe, even though we have thefe 
powers enlightened by the great lamp of inftruQiiofl, 
the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word, 
added to our underftanding ; and why it has pleafed 
God to hide the like faving knowledge from fo many 
millions of fouls, who, if one might judge by this 
poor favage, would make a much better ufe of it thau 
we did. 

From hence I fometimes was led too far to invade 
the fovereignty of Providence; and, as it were, 
arraign the juftice of fo arbitrary a difpofition of 
things, that Ihould hide that light from fome, and 
teveal it to others, and yet expeft a like duty from 
both: but I fliut it up, and checked my thoughts 
with this conclufion: Firft, that we do not know 
by what light and law thefe fliould be condemned ; 
but that as God was neceffarily, and by the nature 
of his being, infinitely holy and juft, fo it could not 
be, but that if thefe creatures were all fentenced to 
abfence from himfelf, it was on account of finning 
againft that light, which, as the fcripture fays, was 
a law to themfelves, and by fuch rules as their con- 
fciences v^ould acknowledge to be juft, though the 
foundation was not difcovered to us : and, fecondly, 
that ftill, as we are all clay in the hand of the potter, 
no veffel could fay to him, why haft thou formed me 
thus ?

him every thing that was proper to make him ufefo^ 
handy, and helpful; but efpecially to make him 
fpeak, and underftand me when I fpake: and he 
was the apteft fcholar that ever was ; and particularly 
wap fp merry, fo conftantly diligent, and fo pleafed 
when he eould but underftand me, or make me uiv- 
(^erftand him, that it was very pleafant to me to talk 
to him : And now my life began to be fo eafy,- that 
J began to fay to myfelf, that could I but have been 
fafe from more favages, I cared not if I was never 
tp remove from the place while I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my 
caftle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday off 
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relifh 
of a cannibal's ftomach, I ought to let him tafte other 
ilefli ; fo I took him out with me one morning to the 
woods : I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out 
of my own flock, and bring it home and drefs it : 
but as I was going, I faw a fhe-goat lying down in 
the fhade, and two young kids fitting by her: I 
catched hold of Friday ^ Hold, faid I, ftand ftill ; and 
made figns to him not to ftir ; immediately I pre- 
fented my piece, fliot and killed one of the kids. The 
poor creature, who had, at a diftance indeed, feen 
me kill the favage his enemy, but did not know or 
could imagine how it was done, was fenfibly fur- 
prifed, trembled and (hook, and looked fo amazed, 
that I thought he would have funk down : he did not 
fee the kief I had (hot at, or perceive I had killed it, 
but ripped up his waiftcoat to feel if he was not 
wounded ; and, as I found, prefently thought I was 
refolved to kill him ; for he came and kneeled down 
to me, and, embracing my knees, fj^id a great many 

things 



OF ROBmSON CRtJSbE, 2S7 

^ings I did not underftand; but I could eafily fcb 
that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him. 

libon found a way to convince him, that I would 
do him no harm; and taking him up by the hand, 
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had 
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which 
he did ; and while he was wondering and looking 
to fee how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun 
again, and by and by I faw a great fowl, like an 
hawk, fit upon a tree within Ihot : fo, to let Friday 
sunderftand a little what I would do, I called him to 
pie again, pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a 
parrot, though I thought it had been an hawk ; I 
fay, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to 
the ground under the parrot, to let him fee I would 
ynake him fall, I made him underftand that I wpuld 
flioot and kill that bird ; accordingly I fired, and bid 
him look, and immediately he faw the parrot fall. 
He flood like one frighted again, notwithftanding all 
that I had faid to him ; and I found he was the more 
amazed, becaufe he did not fee me put any thing 
into the gun ; but thought there muft be fome won- 
derful fund of death and deftrudion in that thihg, 
^ble to kill man, bcaft, bird, or any thing near or 
far off: for the aftoniihment this created in him 
was fuch, as could not wear off for a long time ; and 
J believe, if I would have let him, he would have 
worfhipped me and my gun : as for the gun itfelf, he 
would not fo much as touch it for feveral days after; 
but would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had 
anfwered him, when he was by himfelf ; which, as 
I afterwards learned of him, was to defire it not to 
kill him. 

WeU: 



26S LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Well : after his aftonifhment was a little over at 
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I 
had fhot, which he did, but (laid fome time ; for the 
parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a good 
way off from the place where fhe fell ; however he 
found her, took her up, and brought her to mej 
and, as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun 
before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, 
and not let him fee me do it, that I might be ready 
for any other mark that might prefent ; but nothing 
more offered at that time : fo I brought home the 
kid ; and the fame evening I took the fltin off, and 
cut it out as well as I could j and having a pot for 
that purpofe, I boiled or ftewed fome of the flefli, 
and made fome very good broth : after I had began 
to eat fome, I gave fome to my man, who feemed 
very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but that 
which was ftrangeft to him, was, to fee me eat fait 
with it. He made a fign to me that the fait wa& 
not good to eat ; and putting a little into his own 
mouth, he feemed to naufeate it, and would fpit and 
fputter at it, wafliing his mouth with frefli water 
siter it ; on the other hand, I took fome meat in 
my mouth without fait, and I pretended to fpit and 
fputter for want of fait, as faft as he had done at the 
fait ; but it would not do, he would never care for 
fait with meat, or in his broth ; at leaft, not a great 
while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, 
I was refolved to feaft him the next day with roafting 
a piece of the kid : this I did by hanging it before 
the fire in a firing, as I had fecn many people do in 
Englandy fetting two poles up, one on each fide the 
- fire^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 269 

fire, and on6 acrofs on the top, and tying the firing 
to the crofs ftick, letting the meat turn continually : 
this Friday admired very much ; but when he came to 
tafte the flefti, he took fo many ways to tell me how 
well he liked it, that I could not but underftand him; 
and at laft he told me he would never eat man's, fieih 
any more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I fet him to work to beating fomc 
corn out, and fifting it in the manner I ufed to do, 
as I obferved before ; and he foon underftood how 
to do it as well as I, efpecially after he had feen what 
the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread 
of; for after that I let him fee me make my bread, 
and bake it too ; and in a little time Friday was able 
to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it 
myfelf. 

I began now to confider, that having two moutl^s 
to feed inftead of one, I mufl provide more ground 
for my harveft, and plant a larger quantity of corn 
than I ufed to do ; fo I marked out a larger piece of 
land, and began the fence in the fame manner as 
before, in which Friday not only worked very wil- 
lingly, and very hard, but did it very cheerfully;^ 
and I told him what it was for, that it was for com 
to make more bread, becaufe he was now with me, 
and that I might have enough for him and myfelf 
too : he appeared very fenfible of that part, and let 
me know, that he thought I had much more labour 
upon me on his account, than I had for myfelf, and 
that he would work the harder for me, if I would 
tell him what to do. 

This was the pleafanteft year of all the life I led 
in this place : Friday began to talk pretty well, and 

underftand 



^7^ tlFE Ai^D ADVENTCRB^ 

tinderftand the names of almofl every thing I bad 
occafion ta call for, and of every place I had to fend 
him to, and talk a great deal to me ; fo that, in fliort^ 
I began now to have fome ufe for my tongue again^ 
which indeed J had very little occafion for before; 
that is to fay, about fpeech* Befides the pleafure of 
talking to him, I had a Angular fatisfaftion in the fel-» 
low himfelf ; his fimple unfeigned honefty, appeared 
to me more and more every day, and I began really 
to love the creature ; and on his fide, I believe he 
loved me more than it was poffible for him ever ta 
love any thing before. 

I had a mind once to try If he had any hankering 
inclination to his own country again ; and having 
taught him Englijh fo well, that he cdtild anfwer 
me almoft any queftions, I aflced him, whether the 
nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle? 
At which he fmiled, and faid, Yes, yes, we always 
fight the better ; that is, he meant, always get the 
better in fight ; and fo we began the following diC. 
courfe. You always fight the better ! faid I : How 
come you to be taken prifoner then, Friday ? 

Friday. My nation beat much for all that. 

Majter. How beat ? if your nation beat them, 
how came you to be taken ? 

Friday. They more than my nation in the place 
where me was ; they take one, two, three, and me : 
My nation over beat them in the yonder place, where 
me no was j there my nation take one, two, great 
thoufand. 

Majkr. But why did not your fide recover you 
from the hands of your enemies then ? 

Friday^ 



OP ROBINSON CRUSOE* 27 X 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and 
make go in the canoe ; my nation have no canoe 
that time. 

Mq/len Well, Friday^ and what does your nation 
do with the men they take? Do they carry them 
away, and eat them as thefe did ? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up* 

Mq/ier. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other place where they think. 

Majien Do they come hither ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other 
clfe place. 

Majier. Have you been here with them ? 

Friday* Yes, I been here [points to the N. W. fide 
of the ifland, which, it feems, was their fide]. 

By this I underftood, that my man Friday had for- 
merly been among the favages, who ufed to come on 
ihore on the farther part of the ifland, on the faid 
man-eating occafions that he was now brought for ; 
and fome time after, ^when I took the courage to carry 
him to that fide, being the fame I formerly mentioned, 
he prefently knew the place, and told me, he was 
there once when they eat up twenty men, two women, 
and one child : he could not tell twenty in Englijhj 
but he numbered them by laying fo many ftones ia 
a row, and pointed to me to tell them over. 

I have told this paffage, becaufe it introduces 
what follows; — ^that after I had' had this difcourfe 
with him, I aflced him. How far it was from our 
ifland to the fliore, and whether the canoes were not 
often lofl:? He told me there was no danger, no 
canoes ever lofl ; but that after a little way out to 

fea> 



ty2 LtTZ AND ADVENTURES 

fea, there was a current, and a wind always one way 
in the morning, the other in the afternoon* 

This I underftand to be no more than the fets of 
the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after- 
wards underftood it was occafioned by the great 
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroomque ; 
in the mouth of which river, as I thought after- 
wards, our ifland lay ; and that this land, which I 
perceived to the W. and N. W. was the great Ifland 
Trinidady on the north point of the mouth of the 
river : I aflced Friday a thoufand quefl:ions about the 
country, the inhabitants, the fea, the coafl:, and what 
nations were near : he told me all he knew, with the 
greatefl: opennefs imaginable : I aflted him the nanies 
of the feveral nations of his fort of people, but could 
get no other name than Caribs ; from whence I eafily 
^uiderfl:ood, that thefe were the Caribees^ which our 
maps place on that part oi America vf\i\ch reaches 
fi'om the mouth of the river Oroomque to Guinea^ and 
onwards to §/• Martha : he told me, that up a great 
way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the fetting 
of the moon, which mufl: be W. from their country, 
there dwelt white-bearded men, like me, and pointed 
to my great whiflcers, which I mentioned before; and 
that they had killed much mans, that was his word : 
by which I underfl:ood he meant the Spaniards^ whofe 
cruelties in America had b^en fpread over the whole 
countries, and were remembered by all the nations 
from father to fon. 

I enquired if he could tell me how I might come 
from this ifland, and get among thofe white men: 
he tolcf me. Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe j I 

could 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 2f$ 

could not underftand what he meant by two canoe ; 
till at laft, with great difficulty, I found he meant, 
that it muft be in a large great boat as big as two 
canoes. 

This part of Friday^s difcourfe began to relilh with 
me very well ; and from this time I entertained fome 
hopes, that one time or other I might find an opportu- 
nity to make my efcape from this place, and that this 
poor favage might be a means to help me to do it. 

During the long time that Friday had now been 
with me, and that he began to fpeak to me, and un- 
derftand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation 
of religioiis knowledge in his mind ; particularly,* I 
afked him one time. Who made him ? The poor crea- 
ture did not underftand me at all, but thought I had 
afked who was his father : but I took it by another 
handle, and afked him, Who made the fea, the ground 
he walked on, and the hills and woods ? He told 
me, it was one old Benamuckee that lived beyond all : 
he could defcribe nothing of this great perfon, but 
that he was very old j much older, he faid, than the 
fea or the land, than the moon or the ftars. I afked 
him then. If this old perfon had made all things, why 
did not all things worfhip him I He looked very grave, 
and with a perfefl: look of innocence, faid, all things 
faid O! to him. I afked him if the people who die 
in his country, went away any-where ? He faid, yes, 
they all went to Benamuckee. Then I afked him, whe- 
ther thofe they eat up went thither too ? he faid, Yes. 

From thefe things I began to inftrufl: him in the 
knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the 
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up to- 
wards heaven : that he governs the world by the fame 

Vol. I. T power 



2^4 ^^^^ ^N^ At)VENTtJRES 

power and providence by v/l^ich he made It j that he 
"Was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give 
every thing to us, take every thing from us 5 and 
thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He liftened 
with great attention, and received with pleafure the 
notion of Jesus Christ being fent to redeem us, and 
of the manner of maldng our prayers to God, and 
his being able to hear us, even into heaven* He told 
me one day, that if our God could hear us up be- 
yond the fun, he muft needs be a greater God than, 
their Benamuckee^ who lived but a little way off, and 
yet could not hear, till they went up to the great 
mountains, where he dwelt, to fpeak to him. I 
afked him, if ever he went thither to fpeak to him ? 
He faid. No, they never went that were young men ; 
none went thither but the old men ; whom he called 
their Oowookakee^ that is, as I made him explain it 
to me, their religious, or clergy ; and that they went 
to fay 1 (fo he called faying prayers) and then came 
back, and told them what Benamuckee faid. By this 
I obferved that there i» prieftcraft even amongft the 
moft blinded ignorant Pagans in the world ; and the 
policy of making a fecret religion, in order to pre- 
ferve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not 
only to be found in the Rmian^ but perhaps among 
all religions in the worlds even among the moft bru- 
tiih and barbarous favages. 

I endeavoured to dear np this fraud to my man 
Friday ; and told him, that the pretence of their old 
men going up to the mountains to fay O ! to their god 
Benamuckee^ was a cheat ; and their bringing word 
from thence what he faid, was much more fo ; that 
if they met with any anfwer, or fpoke with any one 
a there. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^J $ 

there, it muft be with an e\dl fpirit : and then I en- 
tered into a long difcourfe wlthi him about the devil, 
the original of him, his rebellion againft God, his 
enmity to m^n, the reafon of it, his fetting himfelf 
up in the dark parts of the world to be worfhipped 
inftead of God, and as God, and the many ftrata- 
gems he made ufe of to delude mankind to their 
ruin ; how he had a fecret accefs to our paffions and 
to our afFedions, to adapt his fnares fo to our inclina- 
tions, as to caufe us even to be our own tempters, and 
to run upon our own deftruotions by our own choice. 

' I found it was not fo eafy to imprint right notions 
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being 
of a God : nature affifted all my arguments to evi- 
dence to him even the neceffity of a great firft caufe, 
and over-ruling governing power, a fecret direfting 
Providence, and of the equity and juftice of paying 
homage to him that made us, and the like : but there 
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil 
fpirit ; of his original, his being, his nature, and 
above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw 
us In to do fo too : and the poor creature puzzled me 
once in fuch a manner, by a queftion merely natural 
and innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to him. 
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of 
God, his omnipotence, his dreadful averfion to fm, 
his being a confuming fire to the workers of iniquity; 
how, as he had made us all, he could deftroy us, 
and all the world, in a moment j and he liftened 
with great ferioufnefs to me all the while. 

After this, I had been telling him how the devil 

was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and ufed all 

his malice and (kill to defeat the good defigns of Pro- 

T 2 vidence.

H^ faida great many good things to them both, 
and then recommended them, in a few words, to 
God's goodpefs ; gave them the benedidion again, 
I reputing every thing to them in Englijh : And thus 
ended the ceremony. \ think it was the moft plea- 
fant, agreeable day to me, that ever I paffed in my 
whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts 
hung continually upon the converfion of the 37 fa- 
vages ? and fain he would have flaid upon the iflan^ 
to have undertaken it: but I. convinced him, Firft, 
that his undertaking was impracticable in itfelf ; and 
fecoi^dly, that, perhaps, I could put it into a way of 
being done, in his abfence, to his fatisfaftion ; qf 
which by and by. ^ 

Having thus brought the affair of the ifland to a 
narrow compaf^, I was preparing to go on board the 
ihip, when the young man, whom I had taken out 
of the famiflied fliip's company, came to me, and 
told me, he underftood I had a clergyman with me, 
and that I had caufed the Englijhmen to be married to 
the fayages, whom they called wives ; that he had a 
match too, which hq defired might be finifhed before 
J went, between two Chriftians ; which he hoped 
would not be difagreeable to me. 

I knew this muft be the young woman who was 
his mother's fervant, for there was no other Chriflian 
woman on the ifland ; fq I began to perfuade him 
not to do any thing of that kind rafhly, or becaufe

being twenty-fix or twenty-feven years old, and he 
not above feventeen or eighteen; that he might very 
probably, with my affiftance, make a remove from 
this wildernefs, and come into his own country again; 
and that then it would be a thoufand to one but he 
would repent his choice ; and the diflike of that cir- 
cumftance might be difadvantageous to both. I was 
going to fay more, but he interrupted me, fmiling ; 
and told me, with a great deal of modefty, that I 
miftpok in my gueffes ; that he had nothing of 
that kind in his thoughts, his prefent circum- 
ftances being melancholy and difconfolate enough ; 
and he was very glad to hear, that I had fome 
thoughts of putting them in a way to fee their 
own country again ; and that nothing fhould have 
fet him upon flaying there, but that the voyage I 
was going was fo exceeding long and hazardous, and 
would carry him quite out of the reach of all his 
friends ; that he had nothing to defire of me, but 
that I would fettle him in fome little property in the 
ifland where he was ; give him a fervant or two, and 
fome few neceffaries, and he \you,ld fettle himfelf 
here like a planter, waiting the good time when, if 
ever I returned to England^ I would redeem him, 
jind hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I 
came to England ; that he would give me fome letters 
to his friends in London^ to let them know how good 
I had been to him, and what part of the world, and 
what cirqumftances I had left him in ; and he pro- 
piifed me, that whenever I redeemed him, the plan- 
tation.

explained to him, as well aa.I could, why our bleffed 
Redeemer topk not on hiraLthe nature of angels, but 
the feed oi Abraham^ and. how, forJ:hat reafon, the 
fallen angels had no fhare in the redemption ; that he 
came only to the loft fheep of the houfe of Ifrael^ and 
the like. 

I had, God knows, mcTre fmcerity than knowledge, 
in all the methods I took for this poor creature's in-*^ 
ftruftion ; and muft acknowledge, what f believe all 
that aft upon the fame principle will find, that in lay- 
ing things open to him, I really informed and in- 
ftrufted myfelf in many things, that either I did not 
know, or had not fully confidered before ; but which 
occurred naturally to my mind, upon my fearching 
into them for the information of this poor favage ; 
and I had more affeclion in my enquiry after things 
upon this occafion, than ever I felt before : fo that 
whether this ^ poor wild wretch was the better for me 
or no, I had great reafon to be thankful that ever he 
came to me : my grief fat lighter upon me, my ha- 
bitation grew comfortable to me beyond meafure; 
and when I reflefted, that In this folitary life, which I 
had been confined to, I had not only beeln moved my- 
felf to look up to Heaven,^ and' to feek to the hand 
that brought me thither, but was now to be made an 
inftrument, under Providence, to fave the life, and, 
for aught I know, the foul of a poor favage, and 
bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of 
the Chriftian doftrine, that he might know Christ' 
Jesus, to know whom is life eternal ; I fay, when I 
reflefted upon all thefe things, a fecret joy ran through 
evety part of my foul, and I frequently rejoiced 

that 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 279 

that ever I was brought to this place, which I had 
often thought the moft dreadful of all afflidions that 
could poffibly h^ve befallen me. 

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder 
of my time; and the converfation which employed the 
hours between Friday and me was fuch, as made the 
three years which we lived there together perfeftly 
and completely happy, if any fuch thing as complete 
happinefs can be found in a fublunary ftate : the fa- 
vage was now a good Chriftian, a much better than 
I ; though I have reafon to hope, and blefs God for 
It, that we were equally penitent, and comforted re* 
ftored penitents : we had here the word of God to 
read, and no farther off from his Spirit to inftruft 
than if we had been in England. 

I always applied myfelf to reading the Scripture, and 
to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of 
what I read ; and he again, by his ferious enquiries 
and queftions, made me, as I faid before, a much 
betterfcholarin the Scripture knowledge, than 1 fhould 
ever have been by my own private reading : another 
thing I cannot refrain from obferving here alfo, from 
experience, in this retired part of my life ; njiz. how 
infinite and inexpreffible i blefling it is, that the 
knowledge of God, and of the dodtrine of falvatfou 
by Christ Jesus, is fo plainly laid down in the 
word of God, fo eafy to be received and underflood, 
that as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable 
of underftanding enough of my duty to carry me di- 
redly on to the great work of fincere repentance for 
my fiiis, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and 
falvation, to a ftated reformation in praftice, and 
obedience to all God's commands, and this without

plain inftruftion fufficiently ferved to the enlightening 
this favage creature, and bringing him to be fuch 
^ Chriftian, as I have known few equal to him in 
my life. 

As to the difputes, wranglings, ftrife and conten- 
tion, which has happened in the v/orld about religion, 
whether niceties in dodrines, or fchemes of , church 
government, they were all perfeftly ufelefs to us, as, 
for 'aught I can yet fee, they have been to all the reft 
in the world: we had the fure guide to heaven, viz. 
the 'word of God ; and we had, bleffed be God ! 
comfortable views of the Spirit of God, teaching and 
lAftrufliing us by his word, leading us into all truth, 
and making us both willing and obedient to the in- 
ftruftion of his word : and I cannot fee the leaft ufe 
that the greateft knowledge of the difputed points in, 
religion, which have made fuch confufions in the 
world,' would have been to us, if we could have ob- 
tained it-T-But I muft go on with the hiftorical part 
of things, and take every part in its order. 

After Friday and I became more intimately ac- 
quainted, and that he could underftand almoft all I 
faid to him, and fpeak fluently, though in broken 
Englijhy to me, I acquainted him with my own ftory, 
or at leaft fo much of it as related to my coming into 
the place ; how I had lived there, and how long : I 
let him into the myftery (for fuch it was to him) of 
gunpowder and bullets, and taught him how to flioot : 
I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully de- 
lighted with ; and I made him a belt with a frog 
hanging to it, fuch as in England we wear hangers in ; 
and in the frog, inftead of an hanger, I gave him 

. an 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, a8l 

;4n hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon 
in fome cafes, but much more ufeful upon many 
occafions. 

I defcribed to him the countries of Europe^ and 
particularly England^ which I came from ; how we 
lived, how we worfliipped God, how we behaved to 
one another, and how we traded in fliips to all the 
parts of the world : I gave him an account of the 
wreck which I had been on board of, and fliewed 
him, as near as I could, the place where Ihe lay ; but 
flie was all beaten in pieces long before, and quite 
gone, 

I fhewed him the ruins of our boat, which we loft 
when we efcaped, and which I could not ftir with my 
whole ftrength then, but was now fallen almoft all to 
pieces. Upon feeing this boat, Friday flood mufing a 
great while, and faid nothing ; I afked him what it 
was he ftudied upon ? At laft, fays he. Me fee fiich 
boat like come to place at my nation. 

I did not underftand him a good while ; but at laft, 
when I had examined further into it, I underftood by 
him, that a boat, fuch as that had been, came on 
fliore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as 
he explained it, was driven thither by ftrefs of wea- 
ther. I presently imagined, that feme European fliip 
muft have been caft away upon their coaft, and the 
boat might get loofe, and drive afliore ; but was fo 
dull, that I never once thought of men making 
efcape from a wreck thither, much lefs whence they 
might come ; fo I only enquired after a defcription of 
the boat. 

Friday defcribed the boat to me well enough ; but 

brought me better to underftand him, when he added,, 

I with 



a82 MFE AND ADV£NTURl!S 

with fome warmth. We fave the white mans from 
drown : then I prefently alked him, if there were any 
white mans, as he called them, in the boat ? Yes, he 
faid, the boat full of white mans : I afked him, how 
many? he told upon his fingers feventeen: I afked 
him then, what became of them ? he told me. They 
live, they dwell at my nation. 

This put new thoughts into my head again ; for I 
prefeiltly imagined, that thefe might be the men be- 
longing to the fhip that was caft away in fight of my 
ifland, as I now call it ; and who, after the fhip was 
ftruck on the rock, and they faw her inevitably 
lofl, had faved themfelves in their boat, and 
were landed upon that wild fhore among the fa* 
vages. 

Upon this I enquired of him more critically, what 
was become of them? He afTured me they lived ftill 
there, that they had been there about four years, that 
the favages let them alone, and gave them victuals to 
eat. I afked him, how it came to pafs they did not 
kill them, and eat them ? he faid. No, they make 
brother with them : that is, as I underflood him, a 
truce : and then he added. They eat no mans but 
when make the war fight : that is to fay, they never 
eat any men, but fuch as come to fight with them, 
and are taken in battle. 

It was after this fome confiderable time, that being 
on the top of the hill, at the eafl fide of the ifland, 
from whence, as I have faid, I had in a clear day 
difcovered the main or continent of America ; Friday ^ 
the weather being very ferine, looks very earneflly 
towards the mainland, and in a. Kind of furprife falls 
a jumping and dancing, and call^ out to me, for I was 

at 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. oRj 

at fome diftance from him : I aflced him what was the 
matter? O joy! fays he, O glad! there fee my. 
country, there my nation 1 

I obferved an extraordinary fenfe of pleafure ap- 
peared in his face, and his eyes fparkled, and his 
countenance difcovered a ftrange eagernefs, as if he 
had a mind to be in his own country again ; and thi« 
abfcrvation of mine put a great many thoughts into 
me ; which made me at firft not fo eafy about my 
new man Friday as I was before ; and I made no 
doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his own 
nation again, he would not only forget all his reli- 
gion, but all his obligations to me ; and would be 
forward enough to give his countrymen an account 
of me, and come back perhaps with an hundred or 
tvvo of them, and make a feaft upon me, at which he 
knight be as merry as he ufed to be with thofe of his 
enemies, when they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honeft creature very much, 
for which I was very forry afterwards : however, as 
my jealoufy increafed, and held me fome weeks, I was 
a little more circumfpefl:, and not fo familiar ^nd 
kind to him as before ; in which I was certainly in 
the wrong too, the honeft grateful creature having 
no thought about it, but what confifted of the beft 
principles, both as a religious Chriftian, and as a 
grateful friend ; as appeared afterwards, to my full 
fatisfaftion. 

Whilft my jealoufy of him lafted, you may be fure 
I was every day pumping him, to fee if he would dit 
cover any of the new thoughts which I fufpefted 
were in Jiim ; but I found every thing he faid was fo 
honeft, and fo innocent, that I could find nothing to 

nourilh" 



284 tIFE AND ADVENTURES 

nourifh my fufpiclon; and, in fpite of all my 
uneafinefs, he made me at laft entirely his own 
again; nor did he in the leaft perceive that I 
was uneafy ; and therefore I could not fufpeft him 
of deceit. 

One day, walking up the fame hill, but the wea- 
ther being- hazy at fea, fo that we could not fee the 
continent, I called to him, and faid, Friday^ do not 
you wifh yourfelf in your own country, your own 
nation ? Yes, he faid, I be much O glad to be at my 
own nation. What would you do there ? faid I : 
would you turn wild again, eat men's flefli again, and 
be a favage as you were before? He looked full of • 
concern, and (haking his head, faid. No, no, Friday 
tell them to live good, tell them to pray God, tell 
them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flefli, milk, no eat man 
again. Why then, faid I to him, they will kill you, ' 
He looked grave at that, and then faid. No, they no 
kill me, they willing love learn : he meant by this, 
they would be willing to learn. He added, they 
learned much of the bearded mans that came in the 
boat. Then I afked him, if he would go back to them ? 
He fmiled at that, and told me he could not fwim fo 
far. I told him I would make a canoe for him. He 
told me he would go, if I would go with him. I go ! 
faid I, why they will eat me if I come there. No, no, 
fays he. Me make them no eat you, me make them 
much love you : he meant he would tell them how I 
had killed his enemies and faved his life, and fo he 
would make them love me. Then he told me, as well 
as he could, how kind they were to feventeen white 
men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came 
on fhore in diftrefs. 

From 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Ct,S$ 

From this time, I confefs, I had a mind to ven- 
ture over, and fee if I could. poffibly join with thefe 
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards 
or Portnguefe; not doubting but, if I could, we might 
find fome method to efcape from thence, being upon 
the continent, and a good company together, better 
than I could from an ifland forty miles oflf the fliore, 
and alone without help. So, after fome days, I 
took Friday to work again, by way of difcourfe; 
and told him, I would give him a. boat to go back 
to his own nation ; and accordingly I carried him to 
my frigate, which lay on the other fide of the ifland; 
and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it 
funk in the water), I brought it out, fhewed it him, 
and we both went into it. 

I found he was a moft dexterous fellow at ma- 
naging it, he would make it go ajmofl: as fwift and 
fafl again as I could ; fo when he was in, I faid to 
him. Well, now Friday j fhall we go to your nation? 
He looked very dull at my faying fo, which, it feems, 
was becaufe he thought the boat too fmall to go fo 
far. I told him then I had a bigger : fo the next day 
I went to the place where the firfl: boat lay which I 
had made, but which I could not get into the water ; 
he faid that was big enough ; but then, as I had 
taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and- 
twenty years there, the fun had fplit and dried it, 
that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me, fuch 
a boat would do very well, and would carry * much 
* enough vittle, drink, bread : ' that was his way of 
talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time fo fixed upon 
my defign of going over with him to the continent, 

that

that I told him we would go and make one as big zs 
that, and he fhould go home in it. He anfwered 
not one word, but looked very grave and fad. I 
a(ked him, what was the matter with him ? He alked 
me again thus. Why you angry mad with Friday ? 
what me done ? I afked him what he meant ? I told 
him I was not angry with him at all : No angry ! no 
angry ! fays he, repeating the words feveral times. 
Why fend Friday home away to my nation ? Why, 
faid I, Friday^ did you not fay you wilhed you were 
there? Yes, yes, fays he, wifli be both there; no 
wifh Friday there, no mafter there. In a word, he 
would not think of going there without me. I go 
there, Friday ! faid I, what fliould I do there ? He 
turned very quick upon me at this : You do great 
deal much good, fays he, you teach wild mans be 
good, fober, tame mans ; you tell them know God, 
pray God, and live new life. Alas, Friday^ faid I, 
thou knoweft not what thou fayeft ; I am but an 
ignorant man myfelf. Yes, yes, fays he, you teechee 
me good, you teechee them good. No, no, Friday^ 
faid I, you fhall go without me ; leave me here to 
live by myfelf, as I did before. He looked confufed 
again at that word, and running to one of the hat- 
chets which he ufed to wear, he takes it up haftily, 
and gives it me. What muft I do with this ? faid I 
to him : You take kill Friday y fays he. What muft I 
kill you for ? faid I again. He returns very quick. 
What you fend Friday away for ? Take kill Friday y 
no fend Friday away. This he fpoke fo earneftly, 
that I faw tears ftand in his eyes. In a word, I fo 
plainly difcovered the utmoft affedion in him to me, 
and a firm refolution in him, that I told him then,

and often after, that I would never fend him away 
from me, if he was willing to flay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his difcourfe a 
fettled affeaion to me, and that nothing fliould part 
him from me, fo I found all the foundation of his de- 
fire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent 
aflfeftion to the people, and his hopes of my doing 
" them good ; a thing, which as I had no notion of 
myfelf, fo I had not the lead thought, or intention, 
or defire of undertaking it : but ftill I found a ftrong 
inclination to my attempting an efcape, as above, 
founded on the fuppofition gathered from the former 
difcourfe; viz. that there were feventeen bearded 
men there : and therefore, without any delay, I went 
to work with Friday^ to find out a great tree proper 
to fell, and make a large periapia or canoe, to un- 
dertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the 
ifland to have built a little fleet, not oi periaguas and 
canoes only, but even of good large veflils : but the 
main thing I looked at, was to get one fo near the 
water, that we might launch it when it was made, 
to avoid the miflake I committed at firfl. 

At lafl Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found he 
knew much better than I what kind of wood was 
fittefl for it ; nor can I tell to this day what wood to 
call the tree we cut down, except that it was very 
like the tree we call fuflick, or between that and the 
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the fame colour 
and fmell. Friday was for burning the hollow or 
cavity of this tree out, to make it into a boat : but I 
fhewed him hvow rather to cut it out with tools, which 
after I fliewed him how to ufe, he did very handily; 
and in about a month's hard labour we finifhed it, 

and 



285 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and made it very handfome, efpecially when, with 
our axes, which I fhewed him how to handle, we cut 
and hewed the outfide into the true fliape of a boat. 
After this, however, it coft us near a fortnight's time 
to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great 
rollers into the water: but when (he was in, (he would 
have carried twenty men with great eafe. 

When fhe was in the water, and though (he was 
fo big, it amazed me to fee with what dexterity and 
how fwift my man Friday could manage her, turn 
her, and paddle her along ; fo I aflved him if he 
would go, and if we might venture over in her ? Yes, 
he faid, he venture over in her very well, though 
great blow wind : however, I had* a farther defign 
that he knew nothing of, . and that was to make a 
mail and fail, and to fit her with an anchor and ca- 
ble. As to a maft, that was eafy enough to get ; fo I 
pitched upon a ftraightyoungcedar-tree, which I found 
near the place, and which there was a great plenty of 
in the ifland ; and I fet Friday to work to cut it down, 
and gave him directions how to fhape and order it: 
but as to the fail, that was my particular carej I knew 
I had old fails, or rather pieces of old fails enough ; 
but as I had them now twenty-fix years by me, and 
had not been very careful to preferve them, not 
imagining that I fhould ever have this kind of ufe 
for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten ; 
and indeed moft of them were fo : however, I found 
two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with thefe 
I went to work, and with a great deal of pains, and 
awkward tedious flltching (you may be fure) for 
want of needles, I at length made a three-cornered 
ugly thing, like what we call in England a fhoulder*

of-mutton fail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a 
little fhort fprit at the top, fuch as ufually our fhips 
long-boats fail with, and fuch as I beft knew how to 
manage ; becaufe it was fuch an one as I ufed in the 
boat in which I made my efcape from Barbary^ as re- 
lated in the firft part of my ftory. 

I was near two months performing this laft work ; 
viz. rigging and fitting my maft and fails j for I 
finiflied them very complete, making a fmall ftay, 
and a fail or forefail to it, to aflift, if we fhould turn 
to windward j and, which was more than all, I fixed 
a rudder to the ftern of her, to fteer with ; and 
though I was but a bungling fhipwright, yet as I 
knew the ufefulnefs, and even neceflityof fuch a thing, 
I applied myfelf with fo much pains to do it, that at 
laft I brought it to pafs, tho% confidering the many 
dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it 
coft me almoft as much labour as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to 
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my 
boat ; for tho* he knew very well how to paddle the 
canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a fail and 
a rudder, and was the more amazed when he faw me 
work the boat to-and-again in the fea by the rudder, 
and how the fail gybed, and filled this way or that 
way, as the courfe we failed changed ; I fay, when 
he faw this, heftood like one aftonifhed and amazed: 
however, with a little ufe, I made all thefe things fa- 
miliar to him, and he became an expert failor, except 
that as to the compafs I could make hjjii underftand 
rery little of that: on the other hand, as there was very 
little cloudy weather, and feldom or never any fogs 
in thofe parts, there was the lefs occafion for a com-

pafs, feeing the ftars v/ere always to be feen by night 
and the fhore by day, except in the rainy feafons ; 
and then nobody cared to ftir abroad, either by land 
or fea. 

I was now entered on the feven-and-twentieth year 
of my captivity in this place ; though the three laft 
years that I had this creature with me, ought rather 
to be left out of the account, my habitation being 
quite of another kind than in all the reft of my time. 
I kept the anniverfary of my landing here with the 
fame thankfulnefs to God for his mercies as at firft ; 
and if I had fuch caufe of acknowledgment at firft, I 
had much more fo now, having fuch additional tef- 
timonies of the care of Providence 6ver me, and the 
great hopes I had of being efiFedlually and fpeedily 
delivered ; for I had an invincible impreflion upon 
my thoughts, that my deliverance was at hand, and 
that I fhould not be another year in this place : how- 
ever, I went on with my huft>andry, digging, plant- 
ing, and fencing, as ufual ; I gathered and cured 
my grapes, and did every neceffary thing, as before* 

The rainy feafon was in the mean time upon me, 
when I kept more within doors than at other times ; 
fo I had ftowed our new veflel as fecure as we could, 
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I faid in 
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the fhip ; and 
haling her up to the fliore, at high-water mark, I 
made my man Friday dig a little dock, juft big 
enough for her to float in ; and then, when the tide 
was out, we made a ftrong dam crofs the end of it, 
to keep the water out ; and fo Ihe lay dry, as to the 
tide, from the fea ; and to keep the rain ofl', we laid 
-a great many boughs of trees fo thick, that fhe was

as well thatched as an houfe ; and thus we waited for 
the months of November and December^ in which I 
defigned to make my adventure. 

When the fettled feafon began to come in, as the 
thought of my defign returned with the fair weather, 
I was preparing daily for the voyage ; and the firft 
thing I did was to lay up a certain quantity of provi- 
fion, being the ftore for the voyage ; and intended, in 
a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and 
launch out our boat : I was bufy one morning upon 
fomething of this kind, when I called to Friday^ and 
bid him go to the fea-fhore, and fee if he could find 
a turtle or tortoife, a thing which we generally got 
once a week, for the fake of the eggs, as well as the 
flefli. Friday had not been long gone, when he came 
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or 
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the fteps 
he fet his feet on ; and before I had time to fpeak to 
him, he cried out to me, O mafter ! O mafter ! O 
for row ! O bad ! What's the matter, Friday^ faid I ? 
O yonder there, fays he, one, two, three, canoe! 
one, two, three! By this way of fpeaking I con- 
cluded there were fix ; but on enquiry I found there 
were but three. Well Friday^ faid I, do not be 
frighted ; fo I heartened him up as well as I could. 
However, I faw the poor fellow moft terribly feared } 
for nothing ran in his head but that they were come 
to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and 
eat him ; the poor fellow trembled fo, that I fcarce 
knew what to do with him : I comforted him as well 
as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as 
he, and that they would eat me as well as him : But, 
faid I, Friday^ we muft refolve to fight them ; Can 

U 2 vou

you fight, Friday? Me fhoot, fays he, but there 
come many great number. No matter for that, faid 
I again, our guns will fright them that we do not kill. 
So I afked him, whether, if I refolved to defend him, 
he would defend me, and ftand by me, and do juft 
as I bade him ? He faid. Me die, when you bid die, 
mafter ; fo I went and fetched a good dram of rum, 
and gave him ; for I had been fo good an hufband of 
my rum, fhat I had a great deal left : when he had 
drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces 
which we always carried, and load them with large 
fwan fhot as big as fmall piftol-bullets ; then I took 
four mufquets, and loaded them with two flugs, and 
five fmall bullets each ; and my two piftols I loaded 
with a brace of bullets each : I hung my great fword, 
as ufual, naked by my fide, and gave Friday his 
hatchet. 

' When I had thus prepared myfelf^ I took my per- 
fpeftive-glafs, and went up to the fide of the hill,, to 
fee what I could difcoverj and I found quickly, by 
my glafs, that there were one-and-twenty favages, 
three prifoners, and three canoes ; and that their 
whole bufinefs feemed to be the triumphant banquet 
upon thefe three human bodies ; a barbarous feaft 
indeed, but nothing more than as I had obferved waa 
ufual with them. 

I obferved alfo, that they were landed, not where 
they had done when Friday made his efcape, bul 
nearer to my creek, where the fliore was low, and 
where a thick wood came clofe almoft down to the fea: 
this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand 
thefe wretches came about, fo filled me with indig- 
nation, that I came down again to Friday^ and told 

him^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 293 

him, I was refolved to go down to them, and kill 
them all ; and alked him if he would ftand by me. He 
was now gotten over his fright, and his fpirits being 
a little raifed with the dram I had given him, he was 
very cheerful ; and told me, as before, he would 
die when I bid die. 

In this fit of fury, I took firft and divided the 
arms which I had charged, as before, between us : 
I gave Friday one piftol to flick in his girdle, and 
three guns upon his fhoulder ; and I took one piftol, 
and the other three, myfelf ; and in this pofture we 
marched out ; I took a fmall bottle of rum in my 
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more pow- 
der and bullet ; and as to orders, I charged him to 
keep clofe behind me, and not to ftir, fhoot, or do 
any thing till I bid him ; and in the mean time, not 
to fpeak a word : in this pofture I fetched a compafs 
to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over 
the creek as to get into the wood ; fo that I might 
come within fhot of them before I could be difcovered, 
which I had feen by my glafs it was eafy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former 
thoughts returning, I began to abate my refolution ; 
I do not mean, that I entertained any fear of their 
number ; for as they were naked, unarmed wretches, 
^tis certain I was fuperior to them ; nay, though I had 
been alone : but it occurred to my thoughts, what 
call, what occafion, much lefs what neceflity, I was 
in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people 
who had neither done or intended me any wrong, who, 
as to me, were innocent, and whofe barbarous cuf- 
toms were their own difafter, being in them a token 
indeed of God's having left them, with the other 

U 3 nations 



294 ^^FE AND ADVENTURES 

nations of that part of the world, to fuch ftupidity 
and to fuch inhuman courfes ; but did not call me to 
take upon me to be a judge of their aftions, much 
lefs an executioner of his juftice ; that whenever he 
thought fit, he would take the caufe into his own 
hands, and by national vengeance punifh them for 
national crimes ; but that in the mean time, it was 
none of my bufmefs : that it was true, Friday might 
juftify it, becaufe he was a declared enemy, and in a 
ftate of war with thofe very particular people, and it 
was lawful for him to attack them ; but I could not 
fay the fame with refped to me, Thefe things were 
fo warmly prefTed upon my thoughts all the way as I 
went, that I refolvc d I would only go place myfelf 
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous feaft, 
and that I would act then as God Ihould direO: ; but 
that unlefs fomething offered that was more a call to 
me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with 
them. 

With this refolution I entered the wood, ,and with 
all poffible warinefs and filence (Friday following 
clofe at my heels) I marched till I came to the fkirt 
of the wood, on the fide which was next to them ; 
only that one corner of the wood lay between me 
and them : here I called foftly to Friday^ and (hew- 
ing him a great tree, which was juft at the corner of 
the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me 
word if he could fee there plainly what they were 
doing : he did fo, and came immediately back to me, 
and told me they might be plainly viewed there ; that 
they were all about the fire, eating the flefh of one of 
their prifoners ; and that another lay bound upon 
the fand, a little from them, whom he laid they would 

kill 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 295 

kill next, and which fired the very foul within me. 
He told me, it was not one of their nation, but one 
of the bearded men whom he had told me of, who 
came to their country in the boat. I was filled with 
horror at the very naming the white-bearded man, 
and, going to the tree, I faw plainly, by my glafs, 
a white man, who lay -lipon the beach of the fea, 
with his hands and his fe<&t tied with flags, or things 
like rufhes ; and that he was an European^ and had 
clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket be- 
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the 
place where I was, which, by going a little way 
about, I faw I might come at undifcovered, and that 
then I fhould be within half fhot of them ; fo I with- 
held my paflSon, though I was indeed enraged to the 
highefl degree j and going back about twenty paces, 
I got behind fome buflies, which held all the way till 
I came to the other tree, and then I came to a little 
rifing ground, which gave me a full view of them, at 
the diftance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lofe ; for nineteen of 
the dreadful wretches fat upon the ground all clofe 
huddled together, and had juft fent the other two to 
butcher the poor Chriftian, and bring him, perhaps 
limb by limb, to their fire ; and they were ftooped 
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri- 
day ; Now, Friday^ faid I, do as I bid thee. Friday 
faid, he would. Then, Friday^ faid I, do exaftly 
as you fee me do; fail in nothing. So I fet down 
one of the mufquets and the fowling-piece upon the 
ground, and Friday did the like by his ; and with 
the other raufquet I took my aim at the favages, bid- 

U 4 ding 



2g6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ding him do the likq. Then afking him if he was 
ready, he faid. Yes. Then fire at them, faid I j and 
the fame moment I fired alfo. 

Friday took his aim fo much better than I, that on 
the fide that he fhot, he killed two of them, and 
wounded three more ; and on my fide, I killed one, 
and wounded two. They were, you may be fure, in 
a dreadful confternation ; and all of them, who were 
not hurt, jumped up upon their feet immediately, 
but did not know which way to run, or which way 
to look ; for they knew not from whence their de- 
ftruftion came. Friday kept his eyes clofe upon me^ 
that as I had bid him, he might obferve what 1 did ; fo 
as foon as the firft fhot was made, I threw down the 
piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did 
the like; he fees me cock, andprefent; he did the 
fame again. Are you ready, Friday ? faid I. Yes, 
fays he. Let fly then, faid I, in the name of God ; 
and with that I firedagain among the amazed wretches, 
and fo did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden 
with what I called fwan-fliot, or fmall piftol bullets, 
we found only two drop ; but fo many were wounded, 
that they ran about yelling and fcreaming like mad 
creatures, all bloody, and miferably wounded moft 
of them; whereof three more fell quickly after, 
though not quite dead. 

Now, Friday^ faid I, laying down the difcharged 
pieces, and taking up the mufquet, which was yet 
loaden, follow me, faid I ; which he did, with a 
deal of courage ; upon which I rufhed out of the 
v/ood, and fhewed myfelf, and Friday clofe at my foot : 
as foon as I perceived they faw me, I fhouted as loud 
as I could, and bade Friday do fo too; and running 

as 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 297 

as faftas I could, which by the way was not veryfaft, 
being loaded with arms as I was, I made direfUy to- 
wards the poor viftim, who was, as I faid, lying 
upon the beach, or fhore, between the place where 
they fat and the fea ; the two butchers, who were 
juft going to work with him, had left him, at the 
furprife of our firft fire, and fled in a terrible fright 
to the fea-fide, and had jumped into a canoe, and 
three more of the reft made the fame way : I turned 
to Friday^ and bade him ftep forwards, and fire at 
them ; he underftood me immediatefy, and running 
about forty yards to be near them, he Ihot at them, 
and I thought he had killed them all ; for I faw 
them all fall on an heap into the boat ; though I faw 
two of them up again quickly : however, he killed 
two of them, and wounded the third, fo that he lay 
down in the bottom of the boat, as if he had been 
dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out 
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor 
vidim ; and loofing his hands and feet I lifted him 
up, and alked him in the Portugucfe tongue, what 
he was ? He anfwered in Latin, Chrijiianus ; but 
was fo weak and faint, that he could fcarce ftand, or 
fpcak ; I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave 
it him, making figns that he fhould drink, which he 
did ; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat ; 
then I alked him, what countryman he was ? and he 
faid, Effagnole ; and, being a little recovered, let 
me know, by all the figns he could poflibly make, 
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance : 
Seignior, faid I, with as much Spanijh as I could 
make up, we will talk afterwards, but we muft fight 
now : if you have any ftrength left, take this piftol 

and 



2gB LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and fword, and lay about you : he took them very 
thankfully, and no fooner had he the arms in his 
hands, but as if they had put new vigour into him, 
he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had cut 
two of them, in pieces in an inftant ; for the truth is, 
as the whole was a furprife to them, fo the poor crea- 
tures were fo much frighted with the noife of our 
pieces, that they fell down for mere amazement and 
fear, and had no more power to attempt their own 
efcape, than their flefli had to refift our (hot ; and 
that was the cafe of thofe five that Friday fhot in the 
boat ; for as three of them fell with the hurt they re- 
ceived, fo the other two fell with the fright. 

I kept my piece in my hand ftill, without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, becaufe I had 
given the Spaniard my piftol and fword ; fo I called 
to Friday^ and bade him run up to the tree from 
whence we firft fired, and fetch the arms which lay 
there, that had been difcharged, which he did with 
great fwiftnefs ; and then giving him my mufquet, I 
fat down myfelf to load all the reft again, and bade 
them come to me when they wanted : while I was 
loading thefe pieces, there happened a fierce engage- 
ment between the Spaniard and one of the favages, 
who made at him with one of their great wooden 
fwords, the fame weapon that was to have killed him 
before, if I had not prevented it : the Spaniard^ who 
was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, tho* 
weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had 
cut him two great wounds on his headj but the 
favage, being a ftout lufty fellow, clofing in with 
him, had thrown him down (being faint), and was 
wringing my fword out of his hand, when the Spa^ 
niardy though undermoft, wifely quitting his fword, 

drew 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 299 

drew the piftol from his girdle, fliot the favage 
through the body, and killed him upon the fpot, be- 
fore I, who was running to help, could come near 
him. 

Friday^ being now left at his liberty, purfued the 
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his 
hatchet ; and with that he difpatched thofe three, 
who, as I faid before, were wounded at firft, and 
fallen, and all the reft he could come up with j and 
th e Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one 
of the fowling pieces, with which he purfued two of 
thefavages, and wounded them both ; but as he was 
not able to run, they both got from him into the 
wood, where Friday purfued them, and killed one of 
them ^ but the other was too nimble for him ; and 
though he was wounded, yet he plunged into thefea, 
and fwam with all his might off to thofe who were 
left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one 
wounded, who we know not whether he died or no, 
were all that efcaped our hands of one-and-twenty. 
The account of the reft is as follows : 

3 Killed at our Ihot from the tree. 

2 Killed at the next fhot.' 

2 Killed by Friday in the boat. 

2 Killed by ditto, of thofe at firft wounded. 
I Killed by ditto, in the wood. 

3 Killed by the Spaniard. 

4 Killed, being found dropt here and there of their 
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chace of them. 

4 Efcaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if 
not dead. 

21 in all. 

Thofe 



300 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Thofe that were in the canoe, worked hard to 
get out of gun-lhot ; and though Friday made two 
or three fhot at them, I did not find that he hit any 
of them : Friday would fain have had me take one 
of their canoes, and purfue them ; and indeed I was 
very anxious about their efcape, left carrying the 
news home to their people, they ftiould come back, 
perhaps, with two or three hundred of their canoes, 
and devour us by mere multitudes ; fo I confented 
to purfue them by fea ; and running to one of their 
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me ; 
but when I was in the canoe, I was furprif^fd to find 
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand and 
foot, as the Spaniard was, for the flaughter, and 
almoft dead with fear, not knowing what the mat- 
ter was ; for he had not been able to look up over 
the fide of the boat, he was tied fo hard, neck and 
heels, and had been tied fo long, that he had really 
little life in him. 

I immedately cut the twifted flags, or ruflies, 
which they had bound him with, and would have 
helped him up ; but he could not ftand, or fpeak, 
but groaned moft piteoufly, believing, it feems 
ftill, that he was only unbound in order to be 
killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him fpeak to 
him, and tell him of his deliverance ; and pulling 
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a 
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered, 
revived him, and he fat up in the boat ; but when 
Friday came to hear him fpeak, and looked in his 
face, it would have moved any one to tears, to have 
feen how Friday kiffed him, embraced him, hugged 
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, 

fung, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 30I 

fung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his 
own face and head, and then fung and jumped about 
again like a diftrafted creature. It was a good 
while before I could make him fpeak to me, or tell 
me what was the matter ; but when he came a little to, 
himfelf, he told me that it was his father. 

It was not eafy for me to exprefs how it moved me, 
to fee what extafy and filial affeftion had worked in 
this poor favage, at the fight of his father, and of his 
being delivered from death ; nor indeed can I defcribe 
half the extravagances of his affeftion after this j for 
he went into the boat and out of the boat • a great 
many times : when he went in to him, he would fit 
down by him, open his breaft, and hold his father's 
head clofe to his bofom, half an hour together, to 
nourifh it : then he took his arms and ankles, which 
were numbed and ftifF with the binding, and chafed 
and rubbed them with his hands ; and, I perceiving 
what the cafe was, gave him fome rum out of my 
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal 
of good. 

This adlion put an end to our purfuit of the canoe 
with the other favages, who were now gotten almoft 
out of fight ; and it was happy for us that we did 
not ; for it blew fo hard within two hours after, and 
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way, 
and continued blowing fo hard all night, and that from 
the north- weft, which was againft them, that I could 
not fuppofe their boat could live, or that they ever 
reached to their own coaft. 

But to return to Friday; he t^ras fo bufy about his 
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him 
off for fome time: but after I thought he could leave 
him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping 

and 



302 JLIFE AND ADVENTURES 

and laughing, and pleafed to the highefl: extreme. 
Then I a(ked him, if he had given his father any 
bread? He (hook his head, and faid. None: ugly 
dog eat all up felf. So I gave him a cake of bread 
out of a little pouch I carried on purpofe j I alfo gave 
him a dram for himfelf, but he would not tafte it, but 
carried it to his father: I had in my pocket alfo two 
or three bunches of my raifins, fo I gave him a hand- 
ful of them for his father. He had no fooner given 
his father thefe raifins, but I faw him come out of the 
boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched. He 
ran at fuch a rate, (for he was the fwifteft fellow 
of his feet that ever I faw) I fay, he ran at 
fuch a rate, that he was out of fight, as it were, 
in a inftantj and though I called and hallooed too 
after him, it was all one; away he went, and in a 
quarter of an hour I faw him come back again, though 
not fo faft as he went ; and as he came nearer, I 
found his pace was flacker, becaufe he had fomething 
in his hand- 
When he came up to me, I found he had been 
quite home for an ^rthen jug, or pot, to bring his 
father fome frefh water; and that he had got two 
more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave 
me, but the water he carried to his father: however, 
ais I was very thirfty too, I took a little fup of it : 
this water revived his father more than all the rum or 
fpirits I had given him ; for he was juft fainting with 
thirft. 

When his father had drank, I called him, to know 
if there was any water left? he faid. Yes; and I bade 
him give it to the poor Spaniard^ who was in as much 
want of it as his father; and I fent one of the cakes, 
that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was 

indeed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 303 

indeed very weak, and was repofing himfelf upon a 
green place, under the (hade of a tree, and whofe 
limbs were alfo very ftifF, and very much fwelled 
with the rude bandage he had been tied with: when I 
faw that upon Friday*s coming to him with the water^ 
he fat up and drank, and took the bread, and began 
to eat, I went to him, and gave him an handful of 
raifins; he looked up in my face with all the tokens 
of gratitude and thankfulnefs that could appear in any 
countenance ; but was fo weak, nptwithftanding he 
had fo exerted himfelf in the fight, that he could not 
ftand upon his feet; he tried to do it two or three, 
times, but was really not able, his ankles were fo 
fwelled and fo painful to him; fo I bade him fit ftillj 
and caufed Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them 
with rum, as he had done his father's. 

I obferved the poor affedionate creature every two 
minutes, or perhaps lefs, all the while ,he was here, 
turned his head about, to fee if his father was in thq 
fame place and pofture as he left him fitting; and at 
laft he found he was not to be feen; at which he 
ftarted up, and, without fpeaking a word, flew with 
that fwiftnefs to him, that one could fcarce perceive 
his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he 
came, he only found he had laid himfelf down to eafe 
his limbs: fo Friday came back to me prefently, and 
I then fpoke to the Spafiiard to let Friday help him up, 
if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he 
Ihould carry him to our dwelling, where I would take 
care of him: but Friday^ a lufty young fellow, took 
the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him 
away to the boat, and fet him down foftly upon the 
fide or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the in- 

fidc 



304 I'lFE AND ADVENTURES 

fide of it, and then lifted them quite in, and fet him 
clofe to his father, and prefently flepping out again, 
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the fhore 
fader than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty- 
hard too; fo he brought them both fafe into our 
creek; and leaving them in the boat, runs away to 
fetch the other canoe. As he paffed me, I fpoke to 
him, and alked him, whither he went? He told me. 
Go fetch more boat; fo away he went, like the 
wind; for fure never man or horferan like him^ and 
he had the other canoe in the creek almoft a$ ibon 
as I got to it by land; fo he wafted me over, and theU 
went to help our new guefts out of the boat, 
which he did ; but they were neither of them 
able to walk; fo that poor Friday knew not wliat 
to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, 
and calling to Friday to bid them fit down on the 
bank while he came to me, I foon made a kiiid of 
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried 
them up both together upon it between us ; but when 
we got them to the outfide of our wall or fortification^ 
we were at a worfe lofs than before ; for it was im- 
poflible to get them over; and I was refolved not to 
break it down: fo I fet to work again; and Friday 
and I, in about two hours time, made a very hand- 
fome tent, covered with old fails, and above that 
with boughs of trees, being in the fpace without our 
outward fence^ and between that and the grove of 
young wood which I had planted : and here we made 
two beds of fuch things as I had; viz. of good rice- 
fl:raw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another 
to cover them on each bed.

' OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 305 

My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought myfelf 
very rich in fubjeds ; and it was a merry refleftion 
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked : 
firft of all the whole country was my own mere pro- 
perty; fo that I had an undoubted right of dominion: 
2dly, My people were perfeftly fubjefted: I was ab- 
folute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to 
me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there 
had been occafion for it, for me : it was remarkable 
too, I had but three fubjeds, and they were of three 
different religions. My man Friday was a proteftant, 
his father a pagan and a canibal; and the Spaniard 
was a papift: however, I allowed liberty of con- 
fcience throughout my dominions: but this by the 
way. 

As foon as I had fecured my two weak refcued pri- 
foners, and given them fhelter, and a place to reft 
them upon, I began to think of making fome pro- 
vifionfor them; and the firft thing I did, I ordered 
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a 
goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed: then I 
cut off the hind quarter, and, chopping it into fmali 
pieces, I fet Friday to work to boiling and ftewing, 
and made them a very good difh, I affure you, of fiefh 
and broth; having put fome barley and rice alfo into 
the broth, and as I cooked it without doors (for I 
made no fire within my inner wall) fo I carried it all 
into the new tent ; and having fet a table there for 
them, I fat down and eat my dinner alfo with them; 
and, as well as I could, cheered them and en- 
couraged them, Friday being my interpreter, efpe- 
cially to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too ^ 

Vol. I. X for 



3o6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

for the Spaniard fpoke the language of the favages 
pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather fupped, I ordered 
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch 
our mufquets and other fire-arms, which, for want of 
time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the 
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the favages, which lay open to the fun, and 
would prefently be offenfive ; and I alfo ordered him 
to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feaft, 
which I knew were pretty much, and which I could 
not think of doing myfelf; nay, I could not bear to 
fee them, if I went that way : all which hepundually 
performed, and defaced the very appearance of the 
favages being there; fo that when I went again, I 
could fcarce know where it was, otherwife than by 
the corner of the wood pointing to the place, 

I then began to enter into a little converfation with 
my two new fubjefts ; and firft I fet Friday to enquire 
of his father, what he thought of the efcape of the 
favages in that canoe ? and whether be might expeft 
a return of them with a power too great for u& to re- 
fift? His firft opinion was, that the favages in the 
boat never could live out the ftorm which blew that 
night they went off, but muft of neceffity be drowned 
or driven fouth to thofe other fliores, where they were 
as fure to be devoured, as they were to be drowned if 
they were caft away ; but as to what they would do 
if they came fafe on fhore, hefaid, he knew not; but 
it was his opinion, that they were fo dreadfully frighted 
with the manner of being attacked, the noife, and 
the fire, that he believed they would tell their people 

they 



\ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 307 

they were all killed by thunder and lightning, and 
not by the hand of man; and that the two which ap- 
peared (viz, Friday and I) were two heavenly fpirits 
or furies come down to deftroy them, and not men 
with weapons. This, he faidj he knew, becaufe he 
heard them all cry out fo in their language to one 
another ; for it was impoffible for them to conceive 
that a man fliould dart fire, and fpeak thunder, and 
kill at a diftance, without lifting up the hand, as 
was done now. And this old favage was in the 
right, for, as I underftood fince by other hands, the 
favages of that part never attempted to go over to the 
ifland afterwards. They were fo terrified with the 
accounts given by thefe four men (for it feems they 
did efcape the fea), that they believed, whoever went 
to that inchanted ifland, would be deftroyed with 
fire from the gods. 

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was 
under continual apprehenfions for a good while, and 
kept always upon my guard, I and all my army j 
for as there were now four of us, I would have ven- 
tured upon an hundred of them fairly in the open 
field at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes ap- 
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I 
began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to 
the main into confideration, being likewife af- 
fured by Friday^ father, that I might depend upon 
good ufage from their nation on his account, if I 
would go. 

But my thoughts were a little fufpended, when I 

had a ferious difcourfe with the Spaniard^ and when 

I underftood, that there were fixteen more of his 

X 2 countrymen 



\ 



208 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

countrymen and Portuguefe^ who having been caft 
away, and made their efcape to that fide, lived there 
at peace indeed with the favages, but were very fore 
put to it for neceffaries, and indeed for life: I afked 
him all the particulars of their voyage ; and found 
they were a Spanijh fhip, bound from the Rio de la 
Plata to the Havanna\ being direfted to leave 
their loading there, which was chiefly hides and fil- 
ver, and to bring back what European goods they 
could meet with there ; that they had five Portuguefe 
feamen on board, whom they took out of another 
wreck; that five of their own men were drowned 
when firft the fliip was loft; and that thefe efcaped 
through infinite dangers arid hazards, and arrived 
almoft ftarved on the Canibal coaft, where they ex- 
pefted to have been devoured every moment. 

He told me, they had fome arms with them, but 
they were perfedlly ufelefs, for that they had neither 
powder or ball, the wafliing of the fea having 
fpoiled all their powder, but a little which they 
ufed at their firft landing to provide themfelves fome 
food. 

I alked him what he thought v. ould become of them 
there; and if they had formed no defign of making 
any efcape? He faid, they had many confultations 
about it; but that having neither veffel, nor tools to 
build one, or provifions of any kind, their counfels 
always ended in tears and defpair. 

I afked him, how he thought they would receive a 
propofal from me, which might tend towards an 
efcape; and whether, if they were all here, it might 
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared 
moftly their treachery and ill ufage of me, if I put 

my 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 309 

my life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no in- 
herent Virtue in the nature of man; nor did men 
always fquare their dealings by the obligations they 
had received, fo much as they did by the advantages 
they expeded: I told him, it would be very hard, 
that I fhould be the inftrument of their deliverance, 
and that they fhould afterwards make me their pri- 
foner in New Spain^ where an Englifhman was certain 
to be made a facrifice, what neceflity, or what ac- 
cident foever, brought him thither; and that I had 
rather be delivered up to the favages, and be devoured 
alive, than fall into the mercilefs claws of the priefts, 
and be carried into the inquifition. I added, that 
otherwife I was perfuaded, if they were all here, we 
might, with fo many hands, build a bark large 
enough to carry us all away either to the Braftls fouth- 
ward, or to the iflands or Spanijh coaft northward: 
but that if in requital they fhould, when I had put 
weapons into their hands, carry me by force among 
their own people, I might be ill ufed for my kind- 
nefs to them, and make mv cafe worfe than it was 
before.* 

He anfwered, with a great deal of candour and in-- 
genuity, that their condition was fo miferable, and 
they were fo fenlible of it, that he believed they would 
abhor the thought of ufmg any man unkindly that 
fhould contribute to their deliverance; and that, if 
I pleafed, he would go to them with the old man, 
and difcourfe with them about it, and return again, 
and bring me their anfwer: that he would make con- 
ditions with them upon their folemn oath, that they 
would be abfolutely under my leading, as their com- 
mander and captain; and that they fhould fwear 

X 3 upon 



N 



310 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

upon the holy facraments and gofpel, to be true to 
me, and go to fuch chriftian country as I ftiould 
agree to, and no other; and to be direfted wholly 
and abfolutely by my orders, till they were landed 
fafely in fuch country as I intended; and that he would 
bring a contraft from them under their hands for that 
purpofe. 

Then he told me, he would firft fwear to me him- 
felf, that he would never ftir from me as long as he 
lived, till I gave him order; and that he would take 
my fide to the laft drop of blood, if there ftiould 
happen the leaft breach of faith among his country- 
men. 

He told me, they were all of them very civil honefl 
men, and they were under the greateft diftrefs imagi- 
nable,having neither weapons orclothes, nor any food, 
but at the mercy and difcretion of the favages; out 
of all hopes of ever returning to their own country ; 
and that he was fure, if I would undertake their re- 
lief, they would live and die by me. 

Upon thefe affurances, I refolved to venture to re- 
lieve them, if poflible, and to fend the old favage and 
this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when he had 
gotten all things in readinefs to go, the Spaniard him-^ 
felf ftarted an objeftion, which had fo much prudence 
in it on one hand, and fo much fincerity on the other 
hand, that I could not but be very well fatisfied in 
it ; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of 
his comrades for at leaft half a year. The cafe was 
thus: 

He had been with us now about a month; during 
which time I had let him fee in what manner I had 
provided, with the afliftance of Providence, for. my 

fupport J 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3IJ 

fupport ; and he faw evidently what (lock of corn and 
rice I had Iain up ; which, as it was more than fuf- 
ficient for myfelf, fo it was not fufEcient, at leafl: 
without good hulbandry, for my family, now it was 
increafed to number four: but much lefs would it be 
fufEcient, if his countrymen, who were, as he faid, 
fourteen ftill alive, fhould come over; and leaft of all 
would it be fufficient to vi6lual our vefTel, if we fhould 
build one, for a voyage to any of the chriflian co- 
lonies of America. So he told me, he thought it 
would be more advifeable, to let him and the other 
two dig and cultivate fome more land, as much as I 
could fpare feed to fow ; and that we fhould wait 
another harvefl, that we might have a fupply of corn 
for his countrymen when they fhould come ; for want 
might be a temptation to them to difagree, or not to 
think themfelves delivered, otherwife than out of one 
difficulty into another : you know, fays he, the chil- 
dren of Ifrael^ though they rejoiced at firfl at their 
being delivered out of Egypt^ yet rebelled even againfl 
God himfelf, that delivered them, when they came 
to want bread in the wildernefs. 

His caution was fo feafonable, and his advice fo 
good, that I could not but be very well pleafed with 
his propofal, as well as I was fatisfied with his fidelity : 
fo we fell to digging, all four of us, sfs well as the 
wooden tools we were furnifhed with permitted; and 
in about a month's time, by the end of which it was 
feed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and 
trimmed up as we fowed twenty-two bufhels of barley 
on, and fixteen jars of rice, which was, in fhort, all 
the feed we had to fpare; nor indeed did we leave 
ourfelves barley fufficient for our own food for the 

X 4 fix 



312 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fix months that we had to exped our crop, that is 
to fay, reckoning from the time we fet our feed afide 
for fowing; for it is not to be fuppofed it is fix months 
in the ground in that country. 

Having now fociety enough, and our number being 
fufEcient to put us out of fear of the favages, if they 
had come, unlefs their number had been very great, 
we went freely all over the ifland, wherever we 
found occafion; and as here we had our efcape or 
deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impoffible, at 
leaft for me, to have the means of it out of mine ; to 
this purpofe, 1 marked out feveral trees, which I 
thought fit for our work, and I fet Friday and his 
father to cutting them down; and then I caufed the 
Spaniard^ to whom I imparted my thoughts on that 
affair, to overfee and direft their work: I fhewed 
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a 
large tree into fingle planks, and I caufed them to da 
the like, till they had made about a dozen large 
planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty -five 
feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick: 
what prodigious labour it took up, any one may 
imagine. 

At the fame time I contrived to increafe my little 
flock of tame goats as much as I could ; and to this 
jpurpofe I made Friday and the Spaniard to go out one 
day, and myfelf, with Friday, the next day, for wq 
took our turns: and by this means we got about 
twenty young kids to breed up with the reft ; for 
whenever we fhot the dam, we faved the kids, and 
added them to our flock: but above all, the feafon 
for curing the grapes coming on, I caufed fuch a 
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the fun, that I 

believe, 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3T3 

believe, had we been at Alicant^ where the raifins of 
the fun are cured, we (hould have filled fixty or 
eighty barrels; and thefe, with our bread, was a great 
part of our food, and very good living too, I afTure 
you ; for. it is an exceeding nourilhing food. 

It was now harveft, and our crop in good order; 

it was not the moft plentiful increafe I had feen in the 

ifland, but, however, it was enough to anfwer our 

end; for from twenty-two bufliels of barley, we 

brought in and threflied out above two hundred and 

-twenty bufhels, and the like in proportion of the rice, 

which was (lore enough for our food to the next 

harveft, though all the fixteen Spaniards had been 

on Ihore with me ; or, if we had been ready for a 

voyage, it would very plentifully have vidualled 

our (hip^ to have carried us to any part of the world, 

that is to fay, of America* When we had thus houfed 

and fecured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to 

make more wicker-work ; viz. great bafkets, in which 

we kept it ; and the Spaniard was very handy and 

dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that I 

did not make fome things for defence of this kind of 

work; but I faw no need of it: and now having a 

full fupply of food for all the guefts expefted, I gave 

the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to fee what 

he could do with thofe he left behind him there : I 

gave him a ftrict charge in writing not to bring any 

man with him, v/ho would not firft fwear, in the pre- 

fence of himfelf and of the old favage, that he would 

no way injure, fight with, or attack the perfon he 

Ihould find in the ifland, who was fo kind to fend for 

them in order to their deliverance ; but that they 

would ftand by and defend him againft all fuch at- 

tempts J 



314 ^I^E AND ADVENTURES 

tempts ; and wherever they went, would be en- 
tirely under, and fubjefted to his command; and that 
this fhould be put in writing, and figned with their 
hands ; how we were to have this done, when I knew 
they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was a quef- 
tion which we never afked. 

Under thefe inftruftions, the Spaniard^ and the 
old favage (the father of Friday) went away in one of 
the canoes, which they might be faid to come in, or 
rather were brought in, v;hen they came as prifoners 
to be devoured by the favages. 

I gave each of them a mufquet with a firelock on 
it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, 
charging them to be very good hufbands of both, 
and not to ufe either of them but upon urgent oc- 
cafions. 

This was a cheerful work, being, the firft meafures 
ufed by me in view of my deliverance for now 27 
years and fome days; I gave them provifions of 
bread, and of dried grapes, fufficient for themfelves 
for many days, and fufficient for their countrymen 
for about eight days time; and wifhing them a good 
voyage, I let them go, agreeing with them about a 
fignal they fhould hang out at their return, by which 
I fhould know them again, when they came back, at 
a diflance, before they came on fhore. 

They went away with a fair gale on the day that 
the moon was at the full ; by my account in the 
month of Odober; but as for the exaft reckoning of 
days, after I had once lofl it, I could never recover 
it again; nor had I kept even the number of years 
fo punftually, as to be fure that I was right, 
though, as it proved when I afterwards examined 

my 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3I5 

my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of 
years. 

It was no lefs than eight days I waited for them, 
when a ftrange and unforefeen accident intervened, 
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in 
hiftory. I was faft afleep in my hutch one morning, 
when my man Friday came running in to me, and 
called aloud, " Mafter, mafter, they are come, they 



are come.** 



I jumped up, and, regardlefs of danger, I went 
out as foon as I could get my clothes on, through my 
little grove, which (by the way) was by this time 
grown to be a very thick wood ; I fay, regardlefs of 
danger, I went without my arms, which was not my 
cuftom to do ; but I was furprifed, when turning my 
eyes to the fea, I prefently faw a boat at about a 
league and an halPs diftance. Handing in for the 
fhore, with a fhoulder of mutton fail, as they call it, 
and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: 
alfo I obferved prefently, that they did not come from 
that fide which the fhore lay on, but from the 
fouthermoft end of the ifland : upon this I called 
Friday in, and bid him lie clofe, for thefe were 
not the people we looked for, and that we 
did not know yet whether they were friends or 
enemies. 

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perfpec- 
tive-glafs, to fee what I could make of them ; and 
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top 
of the hill, as I ufed to do when I was apprehenfive 
of any thing, and to take my view the plainer without 
being difcovered. 

I had 



3l6 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

/ 

I had fcarce fet my foot on the hill, when my eye 
plainly difcovered a fhip lying at an anchor, at about 
two leagues and a half's diftance from me, S. S. E. 
but not above a league and an half from the fhore. 
By my obfervation it appeared plainly to be an 
Englijh fhip, and the boat appeared to be an Englijh 
long-boat. 

I cannot exprefs the confufion I was in, though the 
joy of feeing a fhip, and one whom I had reafon to 
believe was manned by my own countrymen, and 
confequently friends, was fuch as I cannot defcribe ; 
but yet I had fome fecret doubts hung about me, I 
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep 
upon my guard. In the firfl place, it occurred to 
me to confider what bufinefs an Englijh fhip could 
have in that part of the world; fmce it was not the 
way to or from .any part of the world where the En- 
glijld had any traffick ; and I knew there had been no 
ftorms to drive them in t;here, as in diflrefs ; and 
that if they were Englijh really, it was mofl prbba-. 
ble that they were here upon no good defign; and 
that I had better continue as I was, than fall into th^ 
hands of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man defpife the fecret hints and notices of 
danger, which fometimes are given him when he 
may think there is no pofTibility of its being jeal. 
That fuch hints and notices are given us, I believe 
few that have made any obfervations of things can 
deny ; that they are certain difcoveries of an invifible 
world, and a converfe of fpirits, we cannot doubt ; 
and if the tendency of them feems to be to warn us of 
danger, why fliould we not fuppofe they are from 




OF ROBINSON CRUSOE.# 317 

fome friendly agent (whetha* fupreme, or inferor and 
fubordinate, is not the queftion), and that they are 
given for our good ? 

The prefent queftion abundantly confirms me in the 
juftice of this reafoning ; for had I not been made cau- 
tious by this fecret admonition, come from whence it 
will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far 
worfe condition than before, as you will fee prefently. 

I had not kept myfelf long in this pofture, but I 
faw the boat draw near the Ihore, as if they looked 
for a creek to thru ft in at for the convenience of 
landing ; however, as they did not come quite far 
enough, they did not fee the little inlet where I for- 
merly landed my rafts, but run their boat on fhore 
upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which 
was very happy for me; for otherwife they would 
have landed juft, as I may fay, at my door, and 
would have foon beaten me out of my caftle, and, 
perhaps, have plundered me of all I had. 

When they were on Ihore, I was fully fatisfied they 
were Englijhmen^ at leaft moft of them ; one or two I 
thought were Dutch^ but it did not prove fo : there 
were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I 
found were unarmed, and (as I thought) bound ; and 
when the firft four or five of them were jumped on 
fliore, they took thofe three out of the boat as prifon- 
ers : one of the three I could perceive ufing the moft 
paflionate geftures of intreaty, affliftion, and defpair, 
even to a kind of extravagance ; the other two, I 
could perceive, lifted up their hands fometimes, and 
appeared concerned indeed, but not to fuch a degree 
as the firft. 

I was- 




3l8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I was perfedlly confounded at the fight, and knew 
not what the meaning of it ihould be ; Friday called 
out to me in Englijh^ as well as he could, O mafter ! 
you fee Englijh mans eat prifoners as well as favage 
mans. Why, faid I, Friday^ do you think they are 
going to eat them then ? Yes, fays Friday^ they will 
eat them. No, no, faid I, Friday ; I am afraid they 
will murder them indeed ; but you may be fure they 
will not eat them. 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter 
really was, but flood trembling with the horror of 
the fight, expeding every moment when the three 
prifoners ftiould be killed ; nay, once I faw one of 
the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlace (as 
the feamen call it) or fword, to ftrike one of the poor 
men ; and I expefted to fee him fall every moment, 
at which all the blood in my body feemed to run chili 
in my veins. 

I wifhed heartily now for our Spaniard^ and the 
favage that was gone with him ; or that I had any 
way to have come undifcovered within fhot of them, 
that I might have refcued the three men ; for I faw 
no fire-arms they had among them ; but it fell out to 
my mind another way. 

After I had obferved the outrageous ufage of the 
three men by the infolent feamen, I obferved the 
fellows ran fcattering about the land, as if they 
wanted to fee the country : I obferved alfo, that the 
three other men had liberty to go where they pleafed ; 
but they fat down all three upon the groimd very 
penfive, and looked like men in defpair. 

This put me in mind of the firft time when I came 
on Ihore, and began to look about nte j how I gave 

myfelf 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 319 

myfelf over for loft, how wildly I looked round me, 
what dreadful apprehenfions I had, and how I lodged 
in the tree all night for fear of being devoured by 
wild beafts. 

As I knew nothing that night of the fupply I was 
to receive by the providential driving of the fhip 
nearer the land, by the ftorms and tides, by which 
I have fince been fo long nourifhed and fupported ; 
fo thefe three poor defolate men knew nothing how 
certain of deliverance and fupply they were, how 
near it was to them, and how efFeftually and really 
they were in a condition of fafety, at the fame time 
they thought themfelves loft, and their cafe defpe- 
rate. 

So little do we fee before us in the world, and fo 
much reafon have we to depend cheerfully upon the 
^ great Maker of the world, that he does not leave his 
creatures fo abfolutely deftitute, but that in the worft 
circumftances they have always fomething to be 
thankful for, and fometimes are nearer their deliver- 
ance than they imagine ; nay, are even brought to 
their deliverance by the means by which they feem to 
be brought to their deftruftion. 

It was juft at the top of high-water when thefc 
people came on Ihore, and while partly they ftood 
parlying with the prlfoners they brought, and partly 
while they rambled about to fee what kind of place 
they were in, they had carelefsly ftaid till the tide 
was fpent, and the water was ebbed confiderably 
away, leaving their boat aground. 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I 
found afterwards, having drank a little too much 
brandy, fell afleep ; however, one of them waking 

fooner 



320 ..LIVE AND ADVENTURES 

fooner than the other, and finding the boat too faft 
aground for him to ftir it, hallooed for the reft who 
were ftraggling about, upon which they all foon 
came to the boat ; but it was paft all their ftrength 
to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the 
fhore on that fide being a foft oufy fand, almoft like a 
quickfand* 

In this condition, like true feamen, who are, per- 
haps, the leaft of all mankind given to forethought, 
they gave it over, and away they ftrolled about the 
country again ; and I heard one of them fay aloud to 
another (calling them off from the boat), Why, let 
her alone, Jack^ can't ye ? (he'll float next tide ; by 
which I was fully confirmed in the main enquiry, of 
what countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept myfelf clofe, not once daring 
to ftir out of my caftle, any farther than to my place 
of obfervation, near the top of the hill ; and very 
glad I was, to think how well it was fortified : I 
knew it was no lefs than ten hours before the boat 
could be on float again, and by that time it would be 
dark, and I might be more at liberty to fee their mo- 
tions, and to hear their difcourfe, if they had any. 

In the mean time I fitted myfelf up for a battle, as 
before, though with more caution, knowing I had to 
do with another kind of enemy than I had at firft : I 
ordered Friday alfo, whom I had made an excellent 
markfman with his gun, to load himfelf with arms : 
I took myfelf two fowling-pieces, and I gave him 
three mufquets : my figure, indeed, was very fierce ; 
I had my formidable goat flcin coat on, with the 
great cap I mentioned, a naked fword, two piftols 
in my belt, and a gun upon each flioulder. 

It 



bP HOBlNSbN CRUSOEi , 3^1 

It was my delign, as I faid above, not to have 
made any attempt till it was dark ; but about two 
o'clock, being the heat of the day, 1 found that in 
fhort they were all gone ftraggling into the woods, 
and, as I thought, were all laid down to fleep : the 
three poor diftreffed men, too anxious for their con- 
dition to get any fleep, were however fet down under 
the flielter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a 
mile from me, and, as I thought, out of fight of any 
of the reft. 

Upon this I refolved to difcover myfelf to them, 
and learn fomething of their condition : immediately 
I marched in the figure above, my man Friday at a 
good diftance behind me, as formidable for his arms 
as I, but not making quite fo ftaring a fpe£lre-like 
figure as I did* 

1 came as near them undifcovered as I could, and 
then, before any of them faw me, I called aloud to 
them in Spanijh^ What are ye. Gentlemen ? 

They ftarted up at the noife ; but were ten times 
more confounded when they faw me, and the un- 
couth figure that I made : they made no anfwer at 
all, but I thought I perceived them juft going to fly 
from me, when I fpoke to them in Englijh : Gen- 
tlemen, faid I, do not be furprifed at me ; perhaps; 
you may have a friend near you, when you did not 
exped it : He muft be fent direftly from Heaven then,

hat at the fame time, for our condition is paft the

trembles for fear they have feen us, and heard yoa 
fpeak; if they have, they will certainly murder 
us all. 

Have they any fire-arms? faid I : he anfwered, they 
had only two pieces, and one which they left in the 
boat. Well then, faid I, leave the reft to me ; I fee 
they are all afleep j it is an eafy thing to kill them all ; 
but ihall we rather take them prifoners ? He told me 

there 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 323 

there were two defperate villains among them, that it 
Was fcarce fafe to (hew any mercy to ; but if they 
were fecured, he believed all the reft would return 
to their duty, I alked him, Which they were ? He 
told me, he could not at that diftance defcribe them ; 
but he would obey my orders in any thing I would 
direft. Well, faid I, let us retreat out of their view 
or hearing, left they awake, and we will refolve far- 
ther J fo they willingly went back with me, till the 
woods covered us from them. 

Look you. Sir, faid I, if I venture upon your de- 
liverance, iare you veiling to make two conditions 
with me ? He anticipated my propofals, by telling me, 
that both he and the fliip, if recovered, Ihould be 
wholly directed and commanded by me in every 
thing ; and if the fliip was not recovered, he would 
live and die with nie in what part of the world foever 
I would fend him ; and the two other men faid the 
fame. 

Well, faid I, my conditions are but two : i. That 
while you ftay on this ifland with me, you will not 
pretend to any authority here ; and if I put arms into 
your hands, you will upon all occafions give them up 
to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon this 
ifland, and in the mean time to be governed by my 
orders. 

2. That if the fliip is, or may be recovered, you 
will carry me and my man to England^ paflage free. 

He gave me all the aflurance that the invention 
and faith of a man could devife, that he would com- . 
ply vdth thefe moft reafonable demands ; and befides, 
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon 
all occafions as long as he lived. 

Y a Well 



3^4 I^IFE A^fD ADVENTURES 

Well then, faid I, here are three mufquets for you, 
with powder and ball ; tell me next what you think is 
proper to be done : he fliewed all the teftimony of 
his gratitude that he was able ; but offered to be 
wholly guided by me : I told him, I thought it was 
hard venturing any thing; but the beft method I 
could think of, was to fire upon them at once, as 
they lay ; and if any were not killed at the firft volley, 
and. offered to fubmit, we might fave them, and fa 
put it wholly upoji God's providence to dired the 
Ihot. 

He faid, very modeftly, that he was loth to kill 
them, if he could help it ; but that thofe two were 
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all 
the mutiny in the fhip; and if they efcaped, we 
fhould be undone flill ; for they would go on board, 
and bring the whole fhip's company, and deflroy us 
all. Well then, faid I, neceffity legitimates my ad- 
vice ; for it is the only way to fave our lives. How- 
ever, feeing him ftill cautious of fhedding blood, I 
told him, they fhould go themfelves, and manage as 
they found convenient. 

In the middle of this difcourfe we heard fome of 
them awake, and foon after we faw two of them on 
their feet : I afked him. If either of them were the 
men who he had faid were the heads of the mutiny ? 
He faid. No. Well then, faid I, you may let them 
efcape, and Providence feems to have wakene4 them 
on purpofe to fave themfelves : Now, faid I, if the 
refl efcape you, it is your fault. 

Animated with this, he took the mufquet I had 
given him in his hand, and piflol in his belt, and 
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece 

ia 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

in his hand : the two men, who were with him, go- 
ing firft, made fome noife, at which one of the Tea- 
men, who was awake, turned about, and feeing 
them coming, cried out to the reft ; but it was too 
late then ; for the moment he cried out, they fired, 
I mean the two men, the captain wifely referving his 
own piece : they had fo well* aimed their fhot at the 
men they knew, that one of them was killed on the 
fpot, and the other very much wounded ; but not 
being dead, he ftarted up on his feet, and called 
eagerly for help to the other ; but the captain, ftep- 
ping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help ; 
he fliould call upon God to forgive his villainy ; and 
with that word knocked him down with the ftock of 
his mufquet, fo that he never fpoke more: there 
were three more in the company, and one of them 
was alfo flightly wounded : by this time I was come ; 
and when they faw their danger, and that it was in 
vain to refift, they begged for mercy. The captain 
told them, he would fpare their lives, if they would 
give him any aflurance of their abhorrence of the trea- 
chery they had been guilty of, and would fwear to 
be faithful to him in recovering the fhip, and after- 
wards in carrying her back to yumaica^ from whence 
they came. They gave him all the proteftations of 
their fincerity that could be defired j and he was will- 
ing to believe them, and fpare their lives, which I 
was not againft ; only I obliged him to keep them 
bound hand and foot while they were upon the 
ifland. 

While this was doing, I fent Friday with the 
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to fecure 
her, and bring away the oars and fail, which they 

Y 3 didi 



326 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

did; and by and bye, three draggling men, that 
were (happily for them) parted from the reft, came 
back upon hearing the guns fired ; and feeing their 
captain, who before was their prifoner, now their 
conqueror ; they fubmitted to be bound alfo, and fa 
our viftory was complete. 

It now remained, that the captain and I fliould 
enquire into one another's circumftances : I began 
firft, and told him my whole hiftory, which he heard 
with an attention even to amazement, and particu- 
larly at the wonderful manner of my being furniflied 
with provifions and ammunition ; and indeed, as my 
ftory is a whole coUedion of wonders, it affeded. 
him deeply ; but when he reflefted from thence upon 
himfelf, and how I feemed to have been preferved 
there on purpofe to fave his life, the tears ran down 
his face, and he could not fpeak a word more. 

After this communication was at an end, I carried 
him and his two men into my apartments, leading 
them in juft where I came out, viz. at the top of the 
houfe ; where I refrefhed them with fuch provifions 
as I had, and (hewed them all the contrivances I had 
made during my long, long inhabiting that place. 

All I (hewed them, all I faid to them, was perfeftly 
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my 
fortification ; and how perfedly I had concealed my 
retreat with a grove of the trees, which, having now 
been planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-. 
Ing much fa^fter thaii in England^ was become a little 
wood, and fo thick, that it was unpaflable in any 
part of it, but at that one fide where I had referved 
my little winding paflTage into it : this I told him was 
my caftle, and my refidence } but that I had a feat 

in 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 327 

in the country, as mofl princes have, whither I 
could retreat upon occafion, and I would fhew him 
that too another time ; but at prefent our bufinefs 
was to confider how to recover the fhip. He agreed 
with me as to that ; but told me, he was perfeftly at 
a lofs what meafure to take ; for that there were ftill 
fix-and-twenty hands on board, who having entered 
into a curfed confpiracy, by which they had all for- 
feited their lives to the law, would be hardened in 
it now by defperation ; and would carry it on, know« 
ing that if they were reduced, they fhould be brought 
to the gallows as foon as they came to England^ or to 
any of the Englijh colonies ; and that therefore there 
would be no attacking them with fo fmall a number 
as we were. 

I mufed for fome time upon what he had faid, and 
found it was a very rational conclufion, and that 
therefore fomething was to be refolved on very 
fpeedily, as well to draw the men on board into fome 
fnare for their furprife, as to prevent their landing 
upon us, and deftroying us : upon this it prefently 
occurred to me, that in a little while, the fhip^s crew, 
wondering what was become of their comrades, and 
of the boat, would certainly come on fhore in their 
other boat to fee for them ; and that then perhaps 
they might come armed, and be too ftrong for us : 
this, he allowed, was rational. 

Upon this I told him, the firft thing we had to do, 
was to ftave the boat, which lay upon the beach, fo 
that they might not carry her off; and taking every 
thing out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs as not to be 
fit to fwim ; accordingly we went on board, took the 
arms which were left on board out of her, and what- 

Y 4 ever 



328 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

everelfe we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, 
and another of rum, a few bifcult cakes, an horn of 
powder, and a great lump of fugar in a piece of can^ 
vas ; the fugar was five or fix pounds ; all which was 
very welcome to me, efpecially the brandy and fugar, 
of which I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all thefe things on fliore (the 
oars, maft, fail, and rudder of the boat, were carried 
before, as above), we knocked a great hole in her 
bottom, that if they had come ftrong enough to mailer 
us, yet they could not carry off the boat. 

Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we 
could be capable to recover the flap ; but my view 
was, that if they went away without the boat, 1 did 
not much queftion to make her fit again to carry us 
away to the Leeward Iflands, and call upon our 
friends the Spa7iiards in my way; for I had them ftiH 
in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our defigns, and 
hadfirft, by main ftrength, heaved the boat up upon 
the beach, fo high that the tide would not float her 
off at high-water mark; and, befides, had broken 
an hole in her bottom, too big to be quickly flopped, 
^nd were fat down mufing what we fhould do ; we 
heard the fhip fire a gun, and faw her make a waft 
with her ancient, as a fignal for the boat to come on 
board ; but no boat flirred ; and they fired feveral 
times, making other fignals for the boat. 

At laft, when all their fignals and firings proved 
fruitlefs, and they found the boat did not ftir, we 
faw them (by the help of our glaffes) hoift another 
boat out, and row towards the Ihore ; and we found. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 329 

as they approached, that there were no lefs than ten 
men in her, and that they had fire arms with them. 

As the ftiip lay almoft two leagues from the fliore, 
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain 
fight of the men, even of their faces ; becaufe the 
tide having fet them a little to the eaft of the other 
boat, they rowed up under fhore, to come to the 
fanie place where the other had landed, and where 
the boat lay. 

By this means, I fay, we had a full view of them, 
and the captain knew theperfons and charaders of all 
the men in the boat ; of whom he faid that there 
\vere three very honeft fellows, who, he was fure, 
were led into this confpiracy by the reft, being over- 
powered and frighted. 

But that for the boatfwain, who, it feems, was 
the cjiief officer among them, and all the reft, they 
were as outrageous as any of the fiiip's crew ; and 
were, no doubt, made defperate in their new enter- 
prize ; and terribly apprehenfive he was, that they 
would be too powerful for us. 

I fmilcd at him, and told him, that men in our cir- 
cumftances were paft the operations of fear : that 
feeing almoft every condition that could be was better 
than that we were fuppofed to be in, we ought to ex- 
pert that the confequence, whether death or life? 
would be fure to be a deliverance ; I afkedhim, what 
he thought of the circumftances of my life, and 
whether a deliverance was not worth venturing for ? 
And where. Sir, faid I, is your belief of my being pre- 
ferved here on purpofe to fave your life, which ele- 
vated you a little while ago ? For my part, faid I, 
there feems tq be but one thing amifs in all the pro- 

fpea 



33^ LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fpea of it. What's that ? fays he. Why, faid I, 
'tis that, • as you fay, there are three or four honeft 
fellows among them, which fhould be fpared; 
had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, 
I fhould have thought God's providence had fmgled 
them out to deliver them into your hands ; for, de- 
pend upon it, every man »of them that comes afhore 
are our own, and fhall die or live, as they behave 
to us. 

As I fpoke this with a raifed voice, and cheerful 
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him ; fo 
we fet vigoroufly to our bufmefs : we had, upon the 
firft appearance of the boat's coming from the fhip, 
confidered of feparating our prifoners, and had in- 
deed fecured them effeftually. 

Two of them, of whom the captain was lefs af- 
fured than ordinary, I fent with Friday^ and one of 
the three (delivered men) to my cave, where they 
were remote enough, and out of danger of being 
heard or difcovered, or of finding their way out of 
the woods, if they could have delivered themfelves : 
here they left them bound, but gave them provifions, 
and promifed them, if they continued there quietly, to 
give them their liberty in a day or two ; but that \i 
they attempted their efcape, they fhould be put to 
death without mercy. They promifed faithfully to 
bear their confinement with patience, and were very 
thankful that they had fuch good ufage as to have 
provifions, and a light left them ; for Friday gave 
them candles (fuch as we made ourfelves) for their 
comfort ; and they did not know but that he flood 
centinel over them at the entrance. 

The 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 331 

The Other prifoners had better ufage ; two of them 
were kept pinioned indeed, becaufe the captain was 
not free to truft them ; but the other two were taken 
into my fervice upon their captain's recommendation, 
and upon their folemnly engaging to live and die 
with us ; fo, with them and the three honeft men, 
we were feven men well armed ; and I made no 
doubt we Ihould be able to deal well enough with the 
ten that were coming, confidering that the captain 
had faid, there were three or four honeft men among 
them alfo. 

As foon as they got to the place where their other 
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and 
came all on Ihore, hauling the boat up after them, 
which I was glad to fee ; for I was afraid they would 
rather have left the boat at an anchor, fome diftance 
from the (hore, with fome hands in her to guard her j 
^nd fo we fhould not be able to feize the boat. 

Being on fhore, the firft thing they did, they ran 
all to the other boat ; and it was eafy to fee they were 
under a great furprife to find her ftripped, as above, 
cf all that was in her, and a great hole in her bot- 
tom. 

After they had mufed awhile upon this, they fet 
up two or three great Ihouts, hallooing with all their 
might, to try if they could make their companions 
hear ; but all was to no purpofe ; then they came 
all clofe in a ring, and fired a volley of their fmall 
arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made 
the woods ring ; but it was all one ; thofe in the 
cave, we were fur«, could not hear ; and thofe in 
our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet 
durft give no anfwer to them. ' 

They 



332 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

They were fo aftonifhed at the furprife of this, that, 
as they told us afterwards, they refolved to go all on 
board again to their fhip, and let them know there, 
that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat 
ftaved ; accordingly, they immediately launched the 
boat again, and got all of them on board. 

The captain was* terribly amazed, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board 
the fhip again, and fet fail, giving their comrades up 
for loft, and fo he fhould ftill lofe the fhip, which 
he was in hopes we fhould have recovered ; but he 
was quickly as much frighted the other way.. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but 
we perceived them all coming on fhore again ; but 
with this new meafure in their conduft, which, it 
feems, they confulted together upon ; viz. to leave 
three men in the boat, and the reft to go on fhore, 
and go up into the country to look for their fellows. 

This was a great difappointment to us ; for now 
we were at a lofs what to do; for our feizing thofe 
feven men on fhore would be no advantage to us if we 
let the boat efcape, becaufe they would then row 
away to the fhip ; and then the reft of them would 
be fure to weigh, and fet fail, and fo our recovering 
the fliip would be loft. 

However, we had no remedy but to wait and fee 
what the iffue of things might prefent : the feven men 
came on fhore, and the three who remained in the 
boat put her off to a good diftance from the fhore, 
and came to an anchor to wait for them ; fo that 
it was impoflible for us to come at them in the 
boat, 

Thofa 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 333 

Thofe that came on fhore kept clofe together, 
marching towards the top of the little hill, under 
which my habitation lay ; and we could fee them 
plainly, though they could not perceive us : we 
could have been very glad they would have come 
nearer to us, fo that we might have fired at them j 
or that they would have gone farther off, that wc 
might have come abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the hill, 
where they could fee a great way in the valley and 
woods, which lay towards the north-eaft part, and 
where the ifland lay loweft, they fhouted and hallooed 
till they were weary ; and not caring, it feems, to 
venture far from the fhore, nor far from one ano- 
ther, they fat down together under a tree, to con- 
fider of it : had they thought fit to have gone to fleep 
there, as the other party of them had done, they had 
done the job for us ; but they were too full of ap- 
prehenfions of danger, to venture to go to fleep, 
though they could not tell what the danger was they 
had to fear neither. 

The captain made a very juft propofal to me upon 
this confultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps they 
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make 
their fellows hear, and that we fhould all fally upon 
them, juft at the junfture when their pieces were all 
difcharged, and they would certainly yield, and we 
fhould have them without bloodfhed. I liked the 
propofal, provided it was done while we w^re near 
enough to come up to them, before they could load 
their pieces again. 



But 



334 ^I^^ AND ADVENTURES? 

But this event did not happen, and we lay ftiil si 
long time, very irrefolute what courfe to take ; at 
length I told them, there would be nothing to be 
done in my opinion till night ; and then, if they did 
not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way 
to get between them and the fhore, and fo might ufe 
fome ftratagem with them in the boat, to get them 
on fhore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient 
for their removing, and were very uneafy: when, 
after long confultations, we law them Hart all up, 
and march down toward the fea : it feems, they had 
fuch dreadful apprehenfions upon them of the dan- 
ger of the place, that they refolved to go on board 
the fhip again, give their companions over for loft, 
and fo go on with their intended voyage with the 
fliip. 

As foon as I perceived them go towards the fhore> 
I imagined it to be as it really was ; that they had 
given over their fearch, and were for going back 
again ; and the captain, as foon as I told him my 
thoughts, was ready to fink at the apprehenfions of 
it ; but I prefently thought of a ftratagem to fetch 
them back again, and which anfwered my end to 
a tittle. 

I ordered Friday^ and the captain's mate, to go 
over the little creek weftward, towards the place 
where the favages came on fhore when Friday wa^ 
refcued ; and as foon as they came to a little rifing 
ground, at about half a mile's diftance, I bade them 
halloo as loud as they could, and v/ait till they found 
the feamen heard them; that as foon as ever they 

heard 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 335 

heard the feaman anfwer them, they fhould return it 
again, and then, keeping out of fight, take a round, 
always anfwering when the others hallooed, to draw 
them as far into the ifland, and among the woods, as 
poflible, and then wheel about again to me, by fuch 
ways as I direfted. 

They were juft going into the boat, when Friday 
and the mate hallooed, and they prefently heard them? 
and anfwering run along the fhore weftward, to- 
wards the voice they heard, when they were pre- 
fently flopped by the creek, where, the water being 
up, they could not get over, and called for the 
boat to come up, and fet them over, as indeed I 
expefted. 

When they had fet themfelves over, I obferved 
that the boat being gone up a good way into the 
creek, and as it were in an harbour within the land, 
they took one of the three men out of her to go along 
with them, and left only two in the boat, having 
fattened her to the (lump of a little tree on the 
Ihore. 

This was what I wiflied for, and immediately 
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their bufi- 
nefs, I took the reft with me, and, croffmg the 
creek out of their fight, we furprifed the two men, 
before they were aware, one of them lying on Ihore, 
and the other being in the boat; the fellow on 
fhore was between fleepirig and waking, and going 
to ftart up, the captain, who was foremoft, ran 
in upon him, and knocked him down, and then 
called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a 
dead man. 

There 



336 ^1^£ AND ADVENTURES 

There needed very few arguments to perfuade a 
lingle man to yield, when he faw five men upon him, 
and his comrade knocked down; befides, this was, 
it feems, one of the three who were not fo hearty in 
the mutiny as the reft of the crew, and therefore was 
eafily perfuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to 
join very fincerely with us» 

In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate fo 
well managed their bufinefs with the reft, that they 
drew them, by hallooing and anfwering, from one 
hill to another, and from one wood to another, till 
they not only heartily tired them, but left them where 
they were very fure they could not reach back to the 
boat before it was dark ; and indeed they were 
heartily tired themfelves alfo by the time they came 
back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them 
in the dark, and to fall upon them, fo as to make 
fure work with them. 

It was feveral hours after Friday came back to me 
before they came back to their boat ; and we could 
hear the foremoft of them, long before they came 
quite up, calling to thofe behind to come along ; and ^ 
could alfo hear them anfwer, and complain how lame 
and tired they were, and not being able to come any 
fafter, which was very welcome news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat j but it is im- 
poflible to exprefs their confufion, when they found 
the boat faft a-ground in the creek. The tide ebbed 
out, and their two men gone ; we could hear them 
call to one another in a moft lamentable manner, 
telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted 
ifland j that either there were inhabitants in it, and 

they 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 337 

ihey fhould all be murdered; or elfe there were 
devils or fpirits in it, and they fhould be all carried 
away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades 
by their names a great many times, but no anfwer : 
after fome time, we could fee them, by the little light 
there was, run about wringing their hands, like men 
in defpair; and that fometimes they would go and 
lit down in the boat to reft themfelves, then come- 
alhore, and walk about again, and fo the fame thing 
over again. 

My men would fain have had me given them leave 
to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was 
willing to take them at fome advantage, fo to fpare 
them, and kill as few of them as I could; and 
efpecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any 
pf our men, knowing the other men were very well 
armed: I refolved to wait to fee if they did not fe- 
parate; and therefore, to make fure of them, I drew 
my ambufcade nearer ; and ordered Friday and the 
captain to creep upon their hands and feet as clofe to 
the ground as they could, that they might not be 
difcovered, and get as near them as they could pof. 
fibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that pofture, till 
the boatfwain, who was the principal ringleader of 
the mutiny, and had now fhewn himfelf the moft 
dejedted and difpirited of all the reft, came v\^alking 
towards them with two more of the crew; the captain 
was fo eager, at having the principal rogue fo much 
in his power, that he could hardly have patience to 
let him come fo near as to be fure of him ; for they 
only heard his tongue before : but when they came 

Vol. I. Z nearer, 



338 JLIFE AND ADVENTUR^ES 

nearer, the captain and Friday^ ftarting up on their 
feet, let fly at them. 

The boatfwain was killed upon the fpot ; the next 
man was (hot in the body, and fell juft by him, though 
he did not die till an hour or two after ; and the third 
run for it. 

At the noife of the fire, I immediately advanced 
with my whole army, which was now eight men;' 
viz. myfelf generaliflimo ; Friday my lieutenant- 
general ; the captain and his two men, and the 
three prifoners of war, whom he had trufted with arms.- 

We came upon them indeed in the dark, fo that 
they could not fee our number ; and I made the man 
they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to 
call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a 
parley, and fo might perhaps reduce them to terms ; 
which fell out jufl as we dcfired : for indeed it was- 
eafy to think, as their condition then was, they would 
be very willing to capitulate ; fo he calls ouc, as loud 
as he could, to one of them, Tom Smith y To?n Sfnitb^ 
Tom Stnith anfwered immediately. Who's that ! Ro^ 
bin/on ! For it feems he knew his voice. The other 
anfwered. Ay, ay ; for God's fake, Tom Smithy throw 
down your arms, and yield, or you are all dead men 
this moment. 

Who mufl we yield to ? Where are they ? fays 
Smith again. Here they are, fays he ; here is our 
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting, 
you this two hours ; the boatfwain is killed ; Will 
Frye is wounded, and I am a prifoner ; and if you 
do not yield, you are all loft. 

Will they give us quarter then ? fays Tom Smithy 
and we will yield. Til go and afk, if youpromife to 

yieldy 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 339 

yield, fays Robinfom So he a&ed the captain, and 
the captain himfelf then calls out ; You, Smithy you 
know my voice, if you lay down your arms imme* 
diately, and fubmit, you fhall have your lives, all but 
Will Atkim. 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For God's fake* 
captain, give me quarter : what have I done ? they 
have been all as bad as I: (which by the way was not 
true, either; for it feems this Will Atkins was the 
firft man that laid hold of the captain when they firft 
mutined, and ufed him barbaroufly, in tying his 
hands, and giving him injurious language :) how- 
ever, the captain told him he muft lay down his 
arms at difcretion, and truft to the governor's mer- 
cy, by which he meant me j for they all called me 
governor. 

-In a word, they all laid down their arms, and 
begged their lives ; and I fent the man that had 
parlied with them, and two more, who bound them 
all ; and then my great army of fifty men, which, 
particularly with thofe three, were all but eight, 
came up and feized upon them all, and upon their 
boat, only that I kept myfelf and one more out of 
fight, for reafons of (late. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think 
of feizing the fhip ; and as for the captain, now he 
had leifure to parley with them, he expoftulated with 
them upon the villainy of their praftices with him, 
and at length, upon the farther wickednefs of their 
defign ; and how certainly it muft bring them to 
mifery and diftrefs in the end, and perhaps to the 
gallows. 

Z 2 They 



34<I> LIF£ AND AbVENtUBLEd 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard 
for their lives : as for that, he told them they were 
none of his prifoners, but the commander's of the 
ifland; that they thought they had fet him on fliore 
in a barren uninhabited ifland ; but it had pleafed 
God fo to direfl: them, that the ifland was inhabited, 
and that the governor was an Englijhman ; that he 
might hang them all there, if he pleafed ; but as he had 
given them all quarter, he fuppofed he would fend 
them to England^ to be dealt with there as juflice 
required, except Atkins^ whom he was commanded 
by the governor to advife to prepare for death j for 
that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all a fidion of his own> yet it 
had its delired effeO; : Atkins fell upon his knees to 
beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his 
life ; and all the refl begged of him for God's fake, 
that they might not be fent to England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver- 
ance was come, and that it would be a mofl: eafy 
thing to bring thefe fellows in to be hearty in getting 
pofTeflTion of the fliip; fo I retired in the dark from 
them, that they might not fee what kind of a gover- 
nor they had, and called the captain to me; when I 
called, as at a good diftance, one of the men was 
ordered to fpeak again, and fay to the captain, Cap- 
tain, the commander calls for you ; and prefently the 
captain replied. Tell his excellency I am jufl: a com- 
ing. This more perfeftly amufed them; and they 
all believed, that the commander was jufl: by with 
his fifty men. 

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my. 
projeft for feizing the fliip, which he liked won- 
derfully 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 341 

derfully well, and refolved to put it in execution the 
next morning. 

But, in order to execute it with more art, and to 
be fecure of fuccefs, I told him we muft divide the 
prifoners, and that he fhould go and take Atkins^ and 
two more of the word of them, and fend them 
pinioned to the cave where the others lay : this was 
committed to Friday^ and the two men who came on 
fliore with the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prilon ; 
and it was indeed a difmal place, efpecially to men in 
their condition. 

The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, 
of which I have given a full defcriptioji ; and as it 
was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was 
fecure enough, confidering they were upon their be- 
haviour. 

To thefe in the morning I fent the captain, who 
was to enter into a parley with them ; in a word, to 
try them, and tell me, whether he thought they 
might be trufted or no, to go on board, and furprife 
the fhip : he talked to them of the injury done him, 
of the condition they were brought to ; and that 
though the governor had given them quarter for their 
lives, as to the prefent aftion, yet that if they were 
fent to England^ they would all be hanged in chains, 
to be fure ; but that if they would join in fuch an 
attempt, as to recover the fhip, he would have the 
governor's engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guefs how readily fuch a propofal 
would be accepted by mennn their condition; they 
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro- 

Z 3 * mifed 



342 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

mifed with the deepeft imprecations, that they wouI4 
be faithful to him to the laft drop, and that they 
fliould owe their lives to him, and would go with him 
all over the world ; that they would own him for si 
father to them as long as they lived. 

Well, fays the captain, I muft go and tell the go- 
vernor what you fay, and fee what I can do to bring 
him to confent to it ; fo he brought me an account 
of the temper he found them in ; and that he verily 
believed they would be faithful. 

However, that we might be very fecure, I told hin\ 
he fliould go back again, and choofe out five of them, 
and tell them, that they Ihould fee that they did not 
want men ; but he would take out thofe five to be hia • 
affiftants, and that the governor would keep the other 
two, and the three that were fent prifoners to the 
caftle, (my cave) as hoftages, for the fidelity of thofe 
five ; and that if they proved unfaithful in the exe- 
cution, the five hoftages fhould be hanged in chains 
alive upon the fhore. 

This looked fevere, and convinced them that the 
governor was in earneft ; however, they had no way 
left them but to accept it ; and it was now the bufindk 
of the prifoners, as much as of the captain, to per-* 
fuade the other five to do their duty. 

Our ftrength was now thus ordered for the expedi- 
tion: I. The captain, his mate, and paffenger. a* 
Then the two prifoners of the firft gang, to whom,, 
having their charafters from the captain, I had given 
their liberty, and trufted them with arms. 3. The 
other two whom I kept till now in my bower 
pinioned ; but, upon the captain's motion, had now 

releafed. , 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 343 

feleafed. 4. Thefe five releafed at laft ; fo that they 
were twelve in all, befides five we kept prifoners in 
the cave for hoftages. 

I aflced the captain if he was willing to venture with 
thefe hands on board the fliip : for, as for me, and 
my man Friday^ I did not think it was proper for us to. 
ftir, having feven men left behind ; and it was em- 
ployment enough for us to keep them afunder, and 
fupply them with viduals. 

As to the five in the cave, I refolved to keep them 
faft ; but Friday went twice a day to them, to fupply 
them with neceflfaries ; and I made the other two 
carry provifions to a certain diftance, where Friday 
was to take it. 

When I fliewed myfelf to the two hoftages, it was 
with the captain, who told them, I was the perfon 
the governor had ordered to look after them, and 
that it was the governor's pleafure that they Ihould 
not ftir any where but by my direftion ; that if they 
did, they fliould be fetched into the caftle, and be 
laid in irons ; fo that as we never fufFered them to fee 
me as governor, fo I now appeared as another perfon, 
and fpoke of the governor, the garrifon, the caftle# 
and the like, upon all occafions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but 
to furnifh his two boats, ftop the breach of one, and 
man them : he made his pafTenger captain of one, 
with four other men ; and himfelf, and his mate, 
and five more, went in the other : and they con- 
trived their bufinefs very well ; for they came up to 
the fhip about midnight : as foon as they came within 
call of the (hip, he made Robin/on hail them, and 
Z 4 tell 



344 ^IFE AND ADVENTURIS 

tell them he had brought oflFthe men and the boat, but 
that it was a long time before they had found them, 
and the like ; holding them in a chat, till they came 
to the fliip's fide ; when the captain and the mate, 
entering firft with their arms, immediately knocked 
down the fecond mate and carpenter with the but end 
of their mufquets, being very faithfully feconded by 
their men ; they fecured all the reft that were upon 
the main and quarter-decks, and began to faften the 
hatches to keep them down who were below, when 
the other boat, and their men, entering at the fore- 
chains, fecured the forecaftle of the Ihip, and the 
fkuttle which went down into the cook-room, making 
three men they found there prifoners. 

When this was done, and all fafe upon the deck, 
the captain ordered the mate with three men to break 
into the round houfe, where the new rebel captain 
lay, and, having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and 
AVith two men and a boy had gotten fire arms in their 
hands ; and when the mate with a crow fplit open the 
door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among 
them, and wounded the mate with a mufquet ball, 
which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the 
men, but killed nobody. 

The mate, calling for help, rufhed, however, into 
the round-houfe, wounded as he was, and with his 
piftol Ihot the new captain through the head, the 
bullets entering at his mouth, and came out again 
behind one of his ears ; fo that he never fpoke a 
word ; upon which the reft yielded, and the fhip' 
was taken efFeftually, without any more lives being • 
loft. 

As 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 345 

As foon as the fhip was thus fecured, the captain 
ordered feven guns to be fired, which was the fignal 
agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his fuc- 
cefs ; which you may be fure I was very gtad to hear, 
having fat watching upon the fliore for it, till near 
two of the clock in the morning. 

Having thus heard the fignal plainly, I laid me 
down ; and it having been a day of great fatigue to 
me, I flept very found, till I was fomething furprifcd 
with the noife of a gun ; and prefently ftarting up, I 
heard a man call me by the name of Governor, go- 
vernor ; and prefently I knew the captain's voice, 
when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he 
flood, and pointing to the fhip, he embraced me in 
his arms : My dear friend ^and deliverer, fays he, 
there's your fhip, for fhe is all your's, and fo are we, 
and all that belong to her. I cafl my eyes to the 
fhip, and there fhe rode within a little more than 
half a mile of the fhore ; for they had weighed her 
anchor as foon as they were maflers of her ; and the 
weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor jufl 
againfl the mouth of a little creek j and the tide being 
up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the 
place where I firft landed my rafts, and fo landed jufl 
at my door. 

I was, at firfl, ready to fink down with the fur- 
prife : for I faw my deliverance indeed vifibly put 
into my hands, all things eafy, and a large fhip 
jufl ready to carry me away whither I pleafed to 
go : at firfl, for fome time, I was not able to anfwer 
one word ; but as he had taken me in his arms, 
I held fafl by him, or I fhould have fallen to the 
ground, 

He 



34^ I^IFE AND ADVENTURES 

He perceived the furprife, and immediately pulled 
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of 
cordial, which he had brought on purpofe for me • 
after I drank it, I fat down upon the ground, and 
though it brought me to myfelf, yet it was a good 
while before I could fpeak a word to him. 

All this while the poor man was in as great an ec-^ 
ftafy as I, only not under any furprife, as I was ; 
and he faid a thoufand kind tender things to me, to 
compofe and bring me to myfelf ; but fuch was the 
flood of joy in my breaft, that it put all my fpirits 
into confufion ; at laft it broke into tears, and in a 
little while after I recovered my fpeech. 

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my 
deliverer ; and we rejoiced together : I told him, 1 
looked upon him as a man fent from Heaven to de- 
liver me, and that the whole tranfadtion feemed to 
be a chain of wonders ; that fuch things as thefc 
were the teftimonies we had of a fecret hand of Pro^ 
vidence governing the world, and an evidence, that 
the eyes of an infinite power could fearch into the 
remoteft corner of the world, and fend help to the 
miferable whenever he pleafed. 

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulnefs to 
Heaven ; and what heart could forbear to blefs him, 
wh6 had not only in a miraculous manner provided 
for one in fuch a wildernefs, and in fuch a defolate 
condition, but from whom every deliverance muft 
always be acknowledged to pr6ceed ! 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me, 
he had brpught me fome little refrefliments, fuch as 
the fhip afforded, and fuch as the wretches, who had 
been fo long his mafters, had not plundered him of: 

upon 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 347 

upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bids his 
men bring the things afliore that were for the gover^ 
nor ; and indeed it was a prefent, as if I had been 
one, not that I was to be carried along with them, 
but as if I had been to dwell upon the ifland ftill, 
and they were to go without me. 

Firft, he had brought me a cafe of bottles full of 
excellent cordial waters, fix large bottles of Ma- 
deira wine ; the bottles held two quarts a piece ; two 
pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces 
of the Ihip's beef, and fix pieces of pork, with a bag 
of peas, and about an hundred weight of bifcuit. 

He brought me alfo a box of fugar, a box of flour, 
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, 
and abundance of other things : but befides thefe, 
and what was a thoufand times more ufeful to me, 
he brought me fix clean new Ihirts, fix very good 
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pairof fhoes, an 
hat, and one pair of ftockings, and a very good fuit 
of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very 
Jittle : in a word, he clothed me from head to foot. 

It was a very kind and agreeable prefent, as any 
one may imagine, to one in my circumftances ; but 
never was any thing in the world of that kind fo un- 
pleafant, aukward, and uneafy, as it was to me to 
wear fuch clothes at their firft putting on. 

After thefe ceremonies paffed, and after all his good 
things were brought into my little apartment, we be- 
gan to confult what was to be done with the prifoners 
we had ; for it was worth confidering whether we 
might venture to take them away with us or no, ef- 
pecially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigi- 
ble and refractory to the laft degree i and the captain 

faid. 



348 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

faid, he knew they were fuch rogues, that there was 
no obliging them ; and if he did carry them away, 
it muft be in irons, as malefaftors, to be delivered 
over to juftice at the firft Englijh colony he could 
come at ; and I found that the captain himfelf was 
very anxious about it. 

Upon this, I told him, that if he defired it, I durft 
undertake to bring the two men he fpoke of, to make 
it their X)wn requeft that he fliould leave them upon 
the ifland : I fhould be very glad of that, fays the 
captain, with all my heart. 

Well, faid I, I will fend for them, and talk with 
them for you : fo I caufed Friday and the two hof- 
tages, for they were now difcharged, their com- 
rades having performed their promife; I fay, I caufed 
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, 
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep thera 
there till I came. 

After fome time, I came thither dreffed in my new 
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being 
all met, and the captain with me, I caufed the men 
to be brought before me, and I told them, I had had 
a full account of their villainous behaviour to the 
captain, and how they had run away with the fhip, 
and were preparing to commit farther robberies ; but 
that Providence had enfnared them in their own ways, 
and that they were fallen into the pit which they had 
digged for others. 

I let them know, that by my direftion the fhip had 
been fcized, that fhe lay now in the road, and they 
might fee by and by, that their new captain had re- 
ceived the reward of his villainy j for that they might 
fee him hanging eit the yard-arm. 

That 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 349 

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had 
to fay, why I Ihould not execute them as pirates ta- 
ken in the fad, as by my commiffion they could not 
doubt I had authority to do. 

One of them anfwered in the name of the reft, 
that they had nothing to fay but this, That when 
they were taken, the captain promifed them their 
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy : but I 
told them I knew not what mercy to fhew them ; 
for, as for myfelf, I had refolved to quit the ifland 
with all my men, and had taken paffage with the 
captain to go for England : and as for the captain, he 
could not carry them to England^ other than as pri- 
foners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and running 
away with the fhip ; the confequence of which, they 
muft needs know, would be the gallows ; fo that I 
could not tell which was beft for them, unlefs they 
had a mind to take their fate in the ifland ; if they de- 
fired that, I did not care^ as I had liberty to leave 
it J I had fome inclination to give them their lives, 
if they thought they could fhift on fhore. They feem- 
ed very thankful for it ; faid they would much rather 
venture to ftay there, than to be carried to England 
to be hanged j fo I left it on that iflue. 

However, the captain feemed to make fome difficul- 
ty of it, as if he durft not leave them there : upon this 
I feemed to be a little angry with the captaiil, and 
told him, that they were my prifoners, not his j and 
that feeing I had offisred them fo much favour, I 
would be as good as my word ; and that if he did 
not think fit to confent to it, I would fet them at 
liberty as I found them ; and if he did not like that, 
he might take them again, if he could catch them. 

Upon 



^^O lI^E AND AbVEKTURESI 

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and 1 ZC-* 
tordingly fet them at liberty, and bade them retire 
into the woods, to the place whence they canxe, and 
I would leave them fome fire arms, fome ammunition, 
and fome direftions how they fhould live very well, 
if they thought fit. 

Upon this, I prepared to go on board the fhip j 
but told the captain, that I would ftay that night to 
prepare my things ; and defired him to go on board 
in the mean time, and keep all right in the ihip, and 
fend the boat on fliore the next day for me ; order- 
ing him in the mean time, to caufe the new captain 
who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that 
thefe men might fee him. 

When the captain was gone, I fent for the meit 
up to me to my apartment, and entered ferioufly 
into difcourfe with them of their circumftances : I 
told them,* I thought they had made a right choice j 
that if the captain carried them away, they would cer- 
tainly be hanged : I fliewed them their captain hang- 
ing at the yard-arm of the (hip, and told them they 
had nothing lefs to expeft. 

When they had all declared their willingnefs to 
ftay, I then told them, I would let them into the 
ftory of my living there, and put them into the way 
of making it eafy to them : accordingly I gave them 
the whole hiftory of the place, and of my coming to 
it ; fhewed them my fortifications, the way I made 
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes ; and, 
in a word, all that was neceffary to make them eafy. 
I told them the ftory of the fixteen Spaniards that 
were to be expefted j for whom I left a letter, and 

made 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 1 

made them promife to treat them in common with 
themfelves. 

I left them my fire-arms; viz. five mufquets, 
three fowling-pieces,. and three fwords: I had about 
a barrel of powder left ; for after the firft year or two 
I ufed but little, and wafted none : I gave them a. 
defcription of the way I managed the goats, and di- 
reftions to milk and fatten them, to make both but- 
ter and cheefe. 

In a word, I gave them every part of my own ftory ; 
and I told them, I would prevail with the captain to 
leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and 
fome garden-feed, which I told them I would have 
been very glad of; alfo I gave them the bag of peas 
which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade 
them be fure to fow and increafe them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, 
and went on board the fliip : we prepared immediate- 
ly to fail, but did not weigh that night : the next 
morning early, two of the five men came fwimming 
to the fhip's fide, and making a moft lamentable com- 
plaint of the other three, begged to be taken into 
the fiiip, for God's fake, for they fhould be murder- 
ed ; and begged the captain to take them on board 
though he hanged them immediately. 

Upon this the captain pretended to have no power 
without me ; but after fome difficulty, and after their 
folemn promifes of amendment, they were taken on 
board, and were fome time after foundly whipped 
and pickled ; after which they proved very honeft and 
quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, I went with the boat on 
fliore, the tide being up, with the things promifed to 

the 



35^ JLI^E akd adve^ttur^s . 

the men^ to which the captain, at my interceflion^. 
caufed their chefts and clothes to be added, which 
they took, and were very thankful for : I alfo en- 
couraged them, by telling them, that if it lay in my 
way to fend a veffel to take them in, I would not 
forget them. 

When I took leave of this ifland, I carried on 
board for reliques the great goat's Ikin cap I had 
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots ; alfo I 
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, 
which had lain by me fo long ufelefs that it was 
grown rufty, or tarnifhed, and could hardly pafs for 
filver, till it had been a little rubbed and handled ; 
and alfo the money I found in the wreck of the Spa^ 
nijh fhip. 

And thus I left the ifland the nineteenth of Decem- 
ber, as I found by the fhip's account, in the year 
1686, after I had been upon it eight and twenty 
years, two months, and nineteen days ; being deli- 
vered from the fecond captivity the fame day of the 
month that I firft made my efcape in the Barco4ong0y 
from among the Moors of Sallee. 

In this veflel, after a long voyage, I arrived in 
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687, 
having been thirty and five years abfent. 

When I came to England^ I was a perfeQ: ftranger 
to all the world, as if I had never been known there : 
my benefaftor, and faithful fteward, whom I had 
left in truft with my money, was alive, but had had 
great misfortunes in the world, was become a widow 
the fecond time, and very low in the world : I made 
her eafy as to what Ihe owed me, afluring her, I 
w^ould give her no trouble ; but on the contrary, in 
gratitude to her former care and faithfulnefs to me, 

I relieved 



6F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 353 

1 relieved her as my little flock would afford, which 
at that time would indeed allow me to do but little 
for her : but I affured her, I would never forget her 
former kindnefs to me ; nor did I forget her, when 
I had fufHcient to help her ; as fhall be obferved in 
Its place. 

I went down afterwards into Torkjhire ; but my 
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family 
extind ; except that I found two fiflers, and two 
of the children of one of my brothers : and as I 
had been long ago given over for dead, there had 
been no provifion made for me, fo that, in a word, 
I found nothing to relieve or affifl me ; and that 
little money I had, would not do fo much for me as 
to fettling in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which 
I did not expeO: ; and this was, that the mafler of 
the fhip, whom I had fo happily delivered, and by 
the fame means faved the fhip and cargo, having 
given a very handfome account to the owners, of the 
manner how I had faved the lives of the men, and 
the fhip, they invited me to meet them, and fome 
other merchants concerned, and all together made 
me a very handfome compliment upon that fubjeft, 
and a prefent of almofl two hundred pounds fler- 
liog. 

But after making feveral refleftions upon the cir- 
cumflances of my life, and how little way this would 
go towards fettling me in the world, I refolved to go 
to Lijbon^ and fee if I might not come by fome in- 
formation of the ftate of my plantation in the Bra* 
ftls^ and what was become of my partner, who, I 

Vol. L a a had 



354 ^IJPE AND ADVENTURES 

had reafon to fuppofe, had fome years now given 
me over for' dead. 

With this view I took (hipping for Lijbon^ where 
I arrived in April following ; my man Friday ac- 
companying me very honeftly in all thefe ramblings, 
and proving a moft faithful fervant upon all occa- 
fions. 

When I came to Lijbon^ I found out, by enquiry, 
and to my particular fatisfaftion, my old friend, the 
captain of the fliip, who firft took me up at fea, ofF 
the fhore of Africa : he was now grown old, and 
had left off the fea, having put his fon, who was far 
from a young man, into his fhip ; and who ftill ufed 
the Brafil trade. The old man did not know me, 
and, indeed, I hardly knew him ; but I foon brought 
myfelf to his remembrance, when I told him who I 
was. 

After fome paffionate expreflions of our old ac- 
quaintance, I enquired, you may be fure, after my 
plantation, and my partner : the old man told me, 
he had not been in the Brajils for about nine years ; 
but that he could affure me, that when he came 
away, my partner was living ; but the truftees, who.m 
I had joined with him, to take cognizance of my 
part, were both dead ; that, however, he believed 
that I would have a very good account of the im- 
provement of the plantation ; for that, upon the 
general belief of my being caft away and drowned, 
my truftees had given in the account of the produce 
of my part of the plantation, to the procurator 
Fi/cal ; who had appropriated it, in cafe I never 
came to claim it, one third to the King, and two- 
thirds to the monaftery of St. Atigu/iine^ to be ex- 
pended 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 35 j; 

pended for the benefit of the poor, and for the con- 
verfion of the Indians to the Catholic faith ; but that 
if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the in- 
heritance, it would be reftored ; only that the im- 
provement, or annual produQiion, being diftributed 
to charitable ufes, could not be reftored ; but he 
affured me, that the fteward of the king's revenue 
(from lands) and the provedore, or fteward of the 
monaftery, had taken great care all along, that the 
incumbent, that is to fay, my partner, gave every 
year a faithful account of the produce, of which 
they received duly my moiety. 

I afked him, if he knew to what height of im- 
provement he had brought the plantation : and whe- 
ther he thought it might be worth looking after ; or 
whether, on my going thither, I fhould meet with 
no obftrudlion to my poffeffing my juft right in the 
moiety. 

He told me, he could not tell exaflrly to what de- 
gree the plantation was improved ; but this he knew, 
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon 
the enjoying but one half of it ; and that, to the 
beft of his remembrance, he had heard, that the king's 
third of my part, which was, it feems, granted away 
to fome other monaftry, or religious houfe, amounted 
to above two hundred moidores a year ; that, as to 
my being reftored to a quiet poffeffion of it, there 
was no queftion to be made of that, my partner be- 
ing alive to witnefs my title, and my name being alfo 
inrolled in the regifter of the country. Alfo he told 
me, that the furvivors of my two truftees were very 
fair, honeft people, and very wealthy, and he be- 
lieved I would not only have their affiftance for put- 

A a 2 ting 



35^ LI^E AND ADVENTURES 

ting mie in poffeffion, but would find a very confide* 
rable fum of money in their hands for my account, 
being the produce of the farm, while their fathets 
held the truft, and before it was given up, as above, 
which, as he remembered^ was about twelve years* 

I fhewed myfelf a little concerned and uneafy at 
this account, and enquired of the old captain, how 
it came to pafs, that the truftees fliould thus difpofe 
of my effefts, when he knew that I had made my 
will, and had made him, the Portuguefe captain, 
my univerfal heir, &c. 

He told me, that was true ; but that, as there was 
no proof of my being dead, he could not afl: as exe- 
cutor, until fome certain account fliould come of my 
death ; and that, befides he was not willing to inter- 
meddle with a thing fo remote : that it was true, he 
had regiftered my will, and put in his claim ; ixidi 
could he have given any account of my being dead 
or alive, he would have afl:ed by procuration, and 
taken pofleflion of the Ingenio (fo they called the 
fugar-houfe) and had given his fon, who was now 
at the Braftls^ order to do it. 

But j (fays the old man) I have one piece of news 
to tell you, which perhaps may not be fo acceptable 
to you as the refl: ; and that is, that believing you 
were loft, and all the world believing fo alfo, your 
partner and truftees did offer to account to me in 
your name, for fix or eight of the firft years of pro- 
fit, which I received ; but there being at that time^ 
fays he, great dift)urfements for increafing the works^ 
building an ingenio^ and buying flaves, it did not 
amount to near fo much as* afterwards it produced: 
however, fays the old man, I fliall give you a true 

account 



ii^ 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 357 

account of what I have received in all, and how I 
have difpofed of it. 

After a few days farther conference with this an- 
tient friend, he brought me an account of the fix 
firft years income of my plantation, figned by ray 
partner, and the merchant's truftees, being always 
delivered in goods ; viz. tobacco in roll, and fugar 
in chefts, befides rum, molafles, &c. which is the 
confequence of a fugar-work j and I found by this 
account, that every year the income confiderably 
increafed : but, as above, the difburfement being 
large, the fum at firft was fmall : however, the old 
man let me fee, that he was debtor to me 470 moi- 
dores of gold, befides 60 chefts of fugar, and 15 
double rolls of tobacco, which were loft in his Ihip, 
he having been fhipwrecked coming home to Li/bony 
about eleven years after my leaving the place. 

The good man then began to complain of his 
misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make 
ufe of my money to recover his loffes,'and buy him 
a Ihare in a new fhip ; however, my old friend, fays 
he, you (hall not want a fupply in your neceflity ; 
and as foon as my fon returns, you fhall be fully 
fatisfied. 

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives 
me two hundred Portugal moidores in gold ; and 
giving me the writings of his title to the fhip which 
his fon was gone to the Brqfils in, of which he was 
a quarter part owner, and his fon another^ he puts 
them both in my hands for fecurity of the reft. 

I was too much moved with the honefty and kind- 
nefs of the poor man, to be able to bear this ; and 
remembering what he had done forme, how he had 

A a 3 taken 



358 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

taken me up at fea, and how gcneroufly he had nfed 
me on all occafions, and particularly how fincere a 
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain 
weeping at what he faid to me : Therefore, firft I 
afked him if his circumftances admitted him to fpare 
fo much money at that time, and if it would not 
ftraiten him ? He told me he could not fay but it 
might ftraiten him a little ; but, however, it was my 
money, and I might want it more than he. 

Every thing the good man faid was full of affec- 
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he 
fpoke. In fliort, I took one hundred of the moi- 
dores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a 
receipt for them ; then I returned him the reft, and 
told him, if ever I had poifeffion of the plantation^ 
I would return the other to him alfo, as indeed I 
afterwards did ; and that, as to the bill of fale of his 
part in his fon's fliip, I would not take it by any 
means ; but that if I wanted the money, I found he 
was honeft enough to pay me ; and if I did not, 
but came to receive what he gave me reafon to ex- 
peft, I would never have a penny more from him. 

"When this was paffed, the old man began to afk 
me if he fhould put me in a method to make my 
claim to my plantation, I told him, I thought to 
go over to it myfelf. He faid, I might do fo if I 
pleafed ; but that if I did not, there were ways 
enough to fecure my right, and immediately to ap- 
propriate the profits to my ufe ; and as there were 
fhips in the river of Lifbon^ juft ready to go away 
to Braftl^ he made me enter my name in a public 
regifter, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that 
I was alive, and that I was the fame perfon who 

took; 



' OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 359 

took up the land for the planting the fald plantation 
at firft. 

This being regularly attefted by a notary, and a 
procuration affixed, he direded me to fend it with a 
letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaint- 
ance at the place ; and then propofed my flaying 
with him till an account came of the return. 

Never any thing was more honourable than the 
proceedings upon this procuration ; for in lefs than 
feven months I received a large packet from the fur- 
vivors of my truftees, the merchants, on whofe ac- 
count I went to fea, in which were the following par- 
ticular letters and papers inclofed. 

Firft, There was the account current of the pro- 
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when 
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal cap- 
tain, being for fix years ; the balance appeared to 
be 1 174 moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, There was the account of four years 
more while they kept the effefts in their hands, be- 
fore the government claimed the adminiftration, as 
being the effefts of a perfon not to be found, which 
they call Civil Death ; and the balance of this, the 
value of the plantation increafing, amounted to crui- 
fadoes, which made 3241 moidores. 

Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augtijiines 
account, who had received the profits for above four- ^ 
teen years ; but not being able to account for what 
was difpofed to the hofpital, very honeftly declared 
he had 872 moidores not diftributed, which he ac- 
knowledged to my account. As to the Idng's part, 
that refunded nothing. 

A a 4 There 



360 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

There was alfo a letter of my partner's, congra-* 
tulating me very afFedtionately upon my being alive ; 
giving me an account how the eftate was improved, 
and what it produced a year, with a particular of 
the number of fquares, or acres, that it contained ; 
how planted, how many flaves there were upon it ; 
and, making two and twenty crofles for bleiEngs^ 
told me he had faid fo many Av^ Maria's to thapk 
the Blejfed Virgin that I was alive ; inviting me very 
paffionately to come over ai:id take ppffeffion of my 
own, and in the mean time to give him orders to 
whom he Ihourd deliver my efFe£l:s, if I did not come 
myfelf; concluding with an hearty tender of his 
friendfhip, and that of his family ; and fent me, asi 
a prefent, feven fine leopards Ikins, which he had, it 
feems, received from Africa by fome other fhip which 
he had fent thither, and who, it feems, had made 2^ 
better voyage than I. He fent me alfo five chefts of 
excellent fweetmeats, and an hundred pieces of gold 
uncoined, not quite fo large as moidores. 

By the fame fleet my merchant-truftees fhipped 
me 1200 chefts of fugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and 
the reft of the whole account in gold. 

I might well fay now, indeed, that the latter end 
of ^ob was better than the beginning : It is impoffi- 
ble to exprefs the flutterings of my very heart, when 
I looked over thefe letters, and efpecially when I 
found all my wealth about me ; for as the Braftl 
Ihips come all in fleets, the fame fliips which brought 
my letters brought my goodis ; and the effeAs were 
fafe in the Tagus before the letter came to my hand i 
In a word, I turned pale, and grew fick j and had

not the old man ran and fetched me a cordial, I be- 
lieve the fudden furprife of joy had overfet nature, 
and I had died upon thfe fpot. 

Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was fo 
fome hours, till a phyfician being fent for, and fome* 
thing of the real caufe of my illnefs being known, 
he ordered me to be let blood, after which I had re- 
lief, and grew well ; but I verily believe, if it had 
not been eafed by the vent given in that manner to 
the fpirits, I fhould have died. 

I was now mafter all on a fudden, of above 50,000!. 
fterling in money, and had an eftate, as I might 
well call it, in the Brajils^ of above a thoufand 
pounds a year, as fure as an eftate of lands in Eng^ 
land ; and, in a word, I was in a condition which* 
J fcarce knew how to underftand, or how to compofe 
piyfelf for the enjoyment of. 

The firft thing I did was to recompenfe my ori- 
ginal benefaftor, my good old captain, who had. 
been firft charitable to me in my diftrefs, kind to me 
in the beginning, and honeft to me at the end : I 
fliewed him all that was fent me ; I told him that, 
next to the providence of heaven, which difpofes 
all things, it was owing to him ; and that it now lay 
on me to rew;ard him, which I would do aii hundred 
fold : So I firft returned to him the hundred moi- 
dores I had received of him ; then I fent for a notary, 
and caufed him to draw up a general releafe or dif- 
charge for the 470 moidores, which he had acknow- 
ledged he owed me, in the fulleft and firmeft manner 
poflible ; after which I caufed a procuration to be 
drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the 
annual profits of my plantation, and appointing my 

partner 



2,62 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

partner to account to him, and make the returns by 
the ufual fleets to him ininiy name ; and a claufe in 
the end, being a grant of i oo moldores a year to 
him during his life, out of the effeds ; and 50 mol- 
dores a year to his fon after him, for his life : And 
thus I requited my old man. 

I was now to confider which way to fteer my 
courfe next, and what to do with the eftate that 
Providence had thus put into my hands ; and, in- 
deed, I had more care upon my head now than I 
had in my filent ftate of life in the ifland, where I 
wanted nothiflg but what I had, and had nothing 
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great 
charge upon me, and my bufmefs was how to fecure 
it : I had never a cave to hide my money in, or a place 
where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew 
mouldy and tarniflied before any body would med- 
dle with it : On the contrary, I knew not where to put 
it, or whom to truft with it ; my old patron, the cap- 
tain, indeed, was honeft, and that was the only re- 
fuge I had. 

In the next place, my intereft in the Braftls feemed 
to fummon me thither ; but now I could not tell 
how to think of going thither till I had fettled my 
affairs, and left my effefts in fome fafe hands behind 
me. At firft I thought of my old friend the widow, 
who, I knew, was honeft, and would be juft to me ; 
but then ii\e was in years, and but poor, and, for 
aught I knew, might be in debt ; fo that, in a word, 
I had no way but to go back to England myfelf, and 
take my effefts with me. 

Iwas fome months, however, before I refolved 
upon this J and therefore as I had rewarded the old 

captain 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, , 363 

captain fully» and to fatisfaftion, who had been my 
former benefaflior, fo I bfgan to think of my poor 
widow, whofe hufband had been my firfl; benefadkor, 
and Ihe, while it was in Tier power, my faithful ftew- 
ard and inftruQior : So the firft thing I did, I got a 
merchant in Lijbon to write to his correfpondent in 
London^ not only to pay a bill, but to go find her 
out, and carry her in money an hundred pounds from 
me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her 
poverty, by telling her flie fhould, if I lived, have a 
farther fupply : At the fame time I fent my two 
fillers in the country, each of them an hundred 
pounds, they being, though not in want, yet not in 
very good circumftances ; one having been married, 
and left a' widow ; and the other having an hufband 
not fo kind to her as he fhould be. 

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I 
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durfl com- 
mit the grofs of my flock, that J might go away to 
the Brafils^ and leave things fafe behind me ; and 
this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Bra/thy 
and have fettled myfelf there, for I was, as it were, 
naturalized to the place ; but I had fome little fcru- 
ple in my mind about religion, which infenfibly 
drew me back, of which I fhall fay more prefently. 
However, it was not religion that kept me from go- 
ing thither for the prefent ; and as I had made no 
fcruple of being openly of the religion of the coun- 
try, all the while I was among them, fo neither did 
I yet ; only that now and then having of late thought 
more of it than formerly, when I began to think 

of 



364 X.IFE AND ADVENTURES 

of living and dying among them, I began to regret 
my having profeffed myfelf a Papift, and thought it 
might not be the beft religion to die in. 

But, as I have faid, this was not the main thing 
that kept me from going to the Braftls^ but that really 
I did not know with whom to leave my efFefts behind 
me ; fo I refolved at laft to go to England with 
them, where, if I arrived, I concluded I fhould make 
fome acquaintance, or find fome relations, that would 
be faithful to me ; and accordingly I prepared to go 
for England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I 
firft, (the Braftl fleet being juft going away) refolved 
to give anfwers fuitable t© the juft and faithful ac- 
count of things I had from thence ; and firft to the 
prior of St. Auguftine^ I wrote a ktter full of thanks 
for his juft dealings, and the offer of the 872 moi- 
dores, which was undifpofed of, which I defired might 
be given j 500 to the monaftry ; and 372 to the poor, , 
as the prior fhould dired, defiring the good Padre's 
prayers for me, and the like. 

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two truftees, 
with all the acknowledgment that fo much juflice 
and honefty called for ; as for fending them any 
prefent, they were far above having any occafion 
of it. 

Laftly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his 
induftry in the improving the plantation, and his in- 
tegrity in increafing the ftock of the works, giving 
him inftruftions for his future government of my 
part according to the powers I had left with my old 
patron, to whom I defired him to fend whatever bet-

OF kOiBIN'SOK CRItSdH. 36^- 

t:ame due to me, till he fhould hear from me more 
particularly : afluring him, that it was my intention, 
not only to come to him, but to fettle myfelf there 
for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very 
handfome prefent of fome Italian filks for his wife 
and two daughters, for fuch the captain's fon in- 
formed me he had ; with two pieces of fine Englijh 
broad-cloath, the beft I could get in Lijbon^ five 
pieces of black bays, and fome Flanders lace of a good 
value. 

Having thus fettled my affairs, fold my cargo, and 
turned all my eflfedts into good bills of exchange, 
my next difficulty was, which way to go to England : 
I had been accuflomed enough to the fea, and yet I 
had a flrange averfion to go to England by fea at 
that time ; and though I could give no reafon for it, 
yet the difficulty increafed upon me fo much, that 
though I had once fhipped my baggage in order to 
go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but 
two or three times. 

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by fea, and 
this might be one of the reafons : B\it let no man 
flight the flrong impulfes of his own thoughts in 
cafes of fuch moment. Two of the fhips which I 
had fingled out to go in, I mean more particularly 
fmgled out than any other, that is to fay, fo as in one 
of them to put my things on board, and in the other 
to have agreed with the captain ; I fay, two of thefe 
(hips mifcarried, viz. one was taken by the Alge-^ 
rines, ,and the other was cafl: away on the Start, near 
Torbay, and all the people drowned except three ; 

fo 



^66 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fo that In either of thofe veffels I had been made ml- 
ferable, and in which moft, it was hard to fay. 

Having being thus harraffed in my thoughts, my 
old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing-, 
preffed me earneftly not to go to fea ; but either to 
go by land to the Groyne^ and crofs over the Bay of 
Bifcay to Rochdle^ from whence it was but an eafy 
and fafe journey by land to Paris ^ and fo to Calais and 
Dover ; or to go up to Madrid^ and fo all the way 
by land through France. 

In a word, I was fo prepoffeffed againft my going 
by fea at all, except from Calais to Dover ^ that I re- 
folved to travel all the way by land ; which, as I was 
not in hafte, and did not value the charge, was by 
much the pleafanter way; and to make it more fo, 
my old captain brought an Englijh gentleman, the 
fon of a merchant in Lijbon^ who was willing to 
travel with me ; after which, we picked up two who 
were Englijh^ and merchants alfo, and two young 
Portuguefe gentlemen, the laft going to Paris only ; 
fo that we were in all fix of us, and five fervants, 
the two merchants, and the two Portuguefe^ con- 
tenting themfelves with one fervant between two, to 
fave the charge; and as for me I got an Englijh 
failor to travel \vith me as a fervant, befides my man 
Friday^ who was too much a ftranger to be capable 
of fupplying the place of a fervant upon the road. 

In this manner I fet out for Lijbon : and our com- 
pany being all very v/ell mounted and armed, we 
made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour 
to call me captain, as well becaufe I was the oldefl: 

man. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 367 

man, as becaufe I had two fervants, and indeed was 
the original of the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my fea jour- 
nals, fo fliall I trouble you with none of my land 
journals : But fome adventures that happened to us in 
this tedious and difficult journey, I muft not omit. 

When we came to Madrid^ we, being all of us 
ftrangers to Spa'ui^ were willing to flay fome time to 
fee the court of Spain^ and to fee what was worth 
obferving ; but it being the latter part of the fum- 
mer, . we haftened away, and fet out from Madrid 
about the midftle of October : But when we came to 
the edge of Navarre^ we were alarmed at feveral 
towns on the way, with an account that fo much 
fnow was fallen on the French fide of the mountains, 
that feveral travellers were obliged to come back to 
Pampeluna^ after having attempted, at an extreme 
hazard, to pafs dn. 

When we came to Pampeluna itfelf, we found it 
fo indeed ; and to me that had been always ufed to 
an hot climate, and indeed to countries where we 
could fcarce bear any clothes on, the cold was in- 
fufFerable ; nor, indeed, was it more painful than it 
was furprifing, to come but ten days before out; of 
the Old Cajlile^ where the weather was not only warm, 
but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from 
the Pyrenean mountains, fo very keen, fo feverely 
cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumb- 
ing and perifliing of our fingers and toes, was very 
ftrange. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the 
mountains all covered with fnow, and felt cold wea- 
ther. 



368 LIFE Ai^D ADVEKTUHES 

ther, which he had never feen or felt before in hifi 
Ufe. 

To mend the matter, after we came to Fampeluna^ 
it continued fnowing with fo much violence, and fo 
long, that the people faid, winter was come before 
its time ; and the roads, which were difficult before^ 
were now quite impaflable : in a word, the fnow lay- 
in fome places too thick for us to travel ; and being 
not hard frozen, as is the cafe in northern countries, 
there was.no going without being in danger of being 
buried alive every ftep. We ftaid no lefs than twenty 
days at Pampeluna ; when (feeing the winter coming 
on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was 
the fevereft winter all over Europe that had been 
known in many years) I propofed that we fliould all 
go away to Fontarabiaj and there take fhipping for 
Bourdeaux^ which was a very little voyage. 

But while we were confidering this, there came in 
four French gentlemen, who, having been flopped 
on the French fide of the paffes, as we were on the 
Spanifh^ had found out a guide, who traverfing the 
country near the head of Languedoc^ had brought 
them over the mountains by fuch ways, that they 
were not much incommoded with the fnow; and 
where they met with fnow in any quantity, they faid 
it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their 
horfes. 

We fent for this guide, who told us, he would 
undertake to carry us the fame way, with no hazard 
from the fnow, provided we were armed fufficiently 
to prote<!l us from wild beafts ; for he faid, upon 
thefe great fnows, it was frequent for fome 

wolves

%olv6s to fliew themfelves at the foot of the mouri* 
tains, being madfe ravenous for want of food, the 
ground beifig covered ^th fnow^ We told him we 
were well enough prepared for fuch creatures as they 
were> if he would infure us from a kind of two^ 
leggedi wolves, which we \vere told we were in moft 
danger from, efpecially on the French fide of the 
mountains* 

He fatisfied Us there was no danger of that kind 
in the way that we were to go : fo we readily agreed 
to follow him : as did alfo twelve other gentlemen^ 
with their fervants, fome French^ fome Spanifb^ who, 
as I faidj had attempted to go, and were obliged to 
tome back again. 

Accordingly "v^e all fet out from Panipeluna^ with 
Our guide, on the fifteenth of November ; tod in- 
deed, I was furprifed, when, inftead of going for- 
tsrard, he came diredly back with' tls, on the fame 
road that we came from Madrid^ above twenty 
miles; when having paffed two rivers, and come 
ftito the plain country, we found durfelves in a warijt 
climate again, where the country wast pleafant, and 
no fnow to be feen j but oii a fudden, turning to the 
left, he approached the mountains another way ; and 
though it is true, the hills and the precipices looked 
dreadfully, yet he made fo many tours, fuch meanders^ 
and led us by fuch winding ways, we infenfibly paffed 
the height of the mountains, without being much 
incumbered with the fnow ; and all on a fudden he 
(hewed us the pleafant fruitful provinces of Langue^ 
doc and Gafcoigne^ all green and flouriihing ; though

indeed they were at a great diftance, and we hail 
Ibme rough way to pafs yet. 

We were a little uneafy however, when we found 
k fnowed one whole day and a night, fo faft, that we 
could not travel ; but he bid us be eafy, we fhould 
foon be paft it all : we found, indeed, that we begaiar 
to defcend every day, and to come more north than 
before j and fo, depending upon our guide, we weikt 
on* 

It was about two hours before night, when our 
guide being fomething before us, and not joft iit 
fight, out rufhed three raonftrous wolves, and after 
them a bear, out of an hollow way, adjoining to a 
thick wood ; two of the wolves flew upon the guide, 
and had he been half a mile before us, he had been 
devoured indeed, before we could have helped him j 
one of them fattened upon his horfe, and the other at- 
tacked the man with that violence, that he had not 
time, or not prefence of mind enough, to draw his: 
piftol, but hallooed and cried out to us moft luftily j 
my man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride up^ 
and fee what was the matter : As foon as Friday 
came in fight of the man, he hallooed, as loud as» 
the other, O mailer ! O mafter 1 But, like a bold 
fellow, rode diredly up to the man, and with hi» 
piftol ftiot the wolf that attacked him in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my mart 
Friday ; for he, having been ufed to that kind of 
creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but 
went clofe up to him, and fhot him as above ; where- 
as -any of u& would have fired at a farther diftance, 
and have perhaps either miffed the wolf, or endai*- 
gered Ihooting the man» 

But 



•^ tDF ROBINSON CRUSOE* j^Jl 

l&ut it was enough to have terrified a bolder man 
^an I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when^ 
With the noife of Friday's piftol, we heard oh both 
fides the difmalleft bowlings of wolves, and the noife 
Redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was 
to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of 
them J and perhaps indeed there was not fuch a few, 
as that we had no caufe of apprehenfions. 

However, a* Friday had killed this wolf, the 
other, that had fsdlened upon the horfe, left him im^ 
mediately^ and fled, haying happily faftened upon 
hj^head, where the boffes of the bridle had ftuck in 
liis teeth, fo that he had not done him much hurt : 
the man, indeed, was moft hurt ^ for the raging crea^ 
ture had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the 
other time a little above his knee ; and he was juft 
as it were tumbling down by the diforder of the 
horfe, when Friday came up, and fhot the wolf* 

It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the noife of Friday' t 
piftol we all mended our pace, and rid up as faft as 
the way (which was very difficult) would give jis 
leave, to fee what was the matter } as foon as we 
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we 
faw plainly what had been the cafe, and how Friday 
had difengaged the poor guide ; though we did not 
prefently difcern what kind of creature it was he had 
killed* ' 

But never was a fight managed fo hardily, and in 
fuch a furprifing manner, as that which followed be- 
tween Friday and the bear, which gave us all (though 
at firft we were furprifed and afraid for him) the 
greateft diverfion imaginable; as the bear is an 
heavy, clumfy creature, and does not gallop as the

wolf does, which is fwift and light 5 fo he hasrtwdr 
particular qualities, which generally are the rule of 
his aftions ; firft, as to men, who are not his proper 
prey, I fay not hi^ proper prey, becaufe though I can*t 
fay what exceflive hunger might do^ which was now 
their cafe, the ground being all covered with fnow ; 
yet as to men, he does Hot ufually attempt them, ui>- 
lefs they firft attack him ; on the contrafy, if you 
meet him in the woods, if you don't meddle with 
him, he won't meddle with you 5 yet then youmuft 
take care to be very civil to him, and give him the 
toad ; for he is a very nice gentleman, he won't go 
a ftep out of the way for a prince ; nay, if you are 
teally afraid, your beft way is to look another way, 
and keep going on j for fomef imes, if you flop, an4 
ftand ftill, and look ftedfaftly at him, he takes it for 
an affront ; and if-yoti throw or tofs any thing at hint, 
and it hits him, though it were but a bit of flick as 
big as your finger, he takes it for an afFfont, and fets 
all other bufinefs afide to purfue his revenge ; fbr he 
will Tiave fatisfaftion in point of honour, and this 
is his firft quality ; the next is, that if he be once 
affronted, he will never leave you, night or day, 
till he has his revenge, but follow at a good round 
rate till he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and 
when we came up to him, he was helping him off 
from his horfe ; for the man was both hurt and 
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the firft ; 
when, on a fudden, we efpied the bear come out of 
the wood, and a very monftrous one it was, the 
biggeft by far that ever I faw: we were all a little 

furprlfed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 373 

furprifed when we faw him ; but when Friday (fa\Ar 
him, it was eafy toXee joy and courage in the fellow's 
countenance: O! O! O! fays Friday^ three times, 
pointing to him, O mafter ! you give me te leave, me 
fliakee te hand with him, me makee you good laugh. 

I was furprifed to fee the fellow fo pleafed : You 
fool you, faid I, he will eat you up. Eatee me up ! 
eatee me up ! fays Friday^ twice over again ; me 
eatee him up ; me make you good laugh ; you all 
ftay here, me fhew you good laugh : fo down he 
fits, and gets his boots oflF in a moment, and put on 
a pair of pumps (as we call the flat fhoes they wear) 
and which he had in his pocket, and gives my other 
fervant his horfe, and, with his gun, away he flew, 
fwift like the wind. 

The bear was walking foftly on, and offered to 
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, 
calls to him, as if the bear could underftand him : 
Hark ye, hark ye, fays Friday^ me fpeakee wit you. 
We followed at a diftance ; for now being come 
down to the Gafcoigne fide of the mountains, we 
were entered a vaft great foreft, where the country 
was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in it 
fcattered here and there. 

Friday^ who had, as we fay, the heels of the bear, 
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great 
ftone, and throws at him, and hit him juft on the 
head; but did him no more harm thanif hehad thrown 
it againfl: a wall ; but it anfwered Friday's end ; for 
the rogue was fo void of fear, that he did it purely 
to make the bear follow him, and fliew us fome laugh, 
as he called it. 

Bb3 As 



374 ^JP2 AND ADVENTURES 

As foon as the bear felt the ftone, and faw him, ha: 
turns about, and comes after him, taking devililh. 
long ftrides, and Ihuffling along at a ftrange rate, fa 
as he would put an horfe to a middling gallop ; away 
runs Friday^ and takes his courfe, as if he ran to-*' 
\i^ards us for help ; fo we all refolved to fire at once 
upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was^ 
angry at him heartily for bringing the bear baci; 
upon us, when he was going about his own bufinefa 
another way ; and efpecially I was angry that he ha4 
turned the bear upon us, and then run away ; and I 
called out. You dog, faid I, is this your making us 
laugh ? Come away, and take your horfe, that we 
may fhoot the creature. He hears me, and cries out^v 
No flioot, no fhoot, (land ftill, you get much laugh :• 
and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beaft's 
one, he turned on a fudden, on one fide of us, find: 
feeing a great oak tree, fit for his purpofe, he bec-» 
koned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he geta 
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon thq 
ground, at about five or fix yards from the botton^ 
of the tree. 

The bear foon came to the tree, and we followed 
at a diftance ; the firft thing he did, he fl:opped at the 
gun, fmelt to it, but let it lie, and up he fcrambles 
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though fo mon^ 
ftrous heavy : I was amazed at the folly, as I thought 
it, of my man, and could not for my life fee any 
thing to laugh at yet, till feeing the bear get up the 
tree, we all rode nearer to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got. 
QUt to the fmall of ^ large limb of the tree, and the 

bear 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 375 

bear got about half way to him ; as foon as the bear 
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was 
weaker, Ha, fays he to us, now you fee me teachee 
the bear dance ; fo he falls a jumping, and Ihaking 
the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but 
flood ftill, and began to look behind him, to fee how- 
he fliould get back ; then indeed we did laugh hearti- 
ly : But Friday had not done with him by a great 
deal ; when he fees him ftand ftill, he calls out to 
him again, as if he had fuppofed the bear could fpeak 
EngliJIjy What, you come no farther ? Pray you come 
farther. So he left jumping and fhaking the 
bough ; and the bear, juft as if he underftood what 
hefaid, did come a little farther ; then he fell a jump, 
ing again, and the bear flopped again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him 
on the head, and called to Friday to ftand ftill, and 
we would fhoot the bear ; but he cried out earneft- 
ly, O pray ! O pray ! no fhoot, me fhoot by and 
then ; he would have faid, by and bye. However, 
to fhorten the ftory, Friday danced fo much, and 
the bear ftood fo ticklifli, that we had laughing 
enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine what the 
fellow would do ; for firft we thought he depended 
upon fhaking the bear off" ; and we found the bear 
was too cunning for that too ; for he would not 
get out far enough to be thrown down, but clings 
faft with his great broad claws and feet, fo that we 
could not imagine what would be the end of it, and 
where the jeft would be at laft. 

But Friday put us out of doubt c^uickly ; for 

feeing the bear cling faft to the bough, and that he 

B b 4 would

would not be perfuaded to come any farther ; Well, 
well, faid Friday^ you no come farther, me go, me 
go ; you no come to me, me come to you ; and upon 
this he goes out to the fmalleft end of the bough, 
where it would bend with his weight, and gently lets 
himfelf down by it. Aiding down the bough, till he 
came near enough to jump down on his feet, and 
away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and ftands 
ftill. 

Well, faid I to him, Friday^ what will you do 
now ? Why don't you Ihoot him ? No fhoot, faya 
Friday^ no yet, me flioot now me no kill ; me ftay, 
give you one more laugh ; and indeed fp he did, as 
you will fee prefently ; for when the bear faw his 
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where 
he flood, but did it mighty leifurely, looking behimi 
him every ftep, and coming backward till he got into 
the body of the tree ; then with the fiime hinder end . 
foremoft, he came do\^Ti the tree, grafping it witb 
his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very lei*. 
furely ; at this jundure, and jufl before hq could fet 
his hind feet upon the ground, Friday ftepp^ cjlofis^

hurt, and what to do we hardly knew ; the howling 
of wolves ran much in my head ; and indeed ex-, 
cept the noife I once heard on the fhore of Africa^ 
of which I have faid fomething already, I never 
heard any thing that filled me with fo much hor-i 
ror. 

Thefe things, and the approach of night, called 
us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us, we 
ihould certainly have taken the (kin of this mon- 
Arous creature off, which was worth faving; but 
we had three leagues to go, and our guide haftened 
us ; fo we left him, and went forward on our jour- 
ney. 

The ground was ftill covered with fnow, though 
not fo deep and dangerous as on the mountains ; and 
the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were 
come down into the forefl and plain country, preffed 
by himger, to feek for food, and had done a great 
4eal of mifchief in the villages, where they fur- 
prifed the country people, killed a great many of their 
fksep and horfes, and feme people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pafs, of which 
oiur guide told us^if there were any more wolves in 
the cpuntry^ we niould find them there ; and this 
was a finall plain, furrounded with woods on every 
fide, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we 
^s^ to get through the wood, and then we 
^c village where we were to lodge. 
*|f Ml *>nur of fun-iet when we

We met with no- 
in a little plain 
within 





37^ I^IFB AND ADVENTURES 

within the wood, which was not above two furlong* 
over, we faw five great wolves crofs the road, full 
fpeed one .after another, as if they had been in chafe 
of fome prey, and had it in view ; they took no no* 
lice of us, and were gone and out of fight in a few 
moments. 

Opon this our guide, who, by the way, was a 
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a rea- 
dy pofture ; for he believed there were niore wolves 
a coming. 

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; 
but we faw no more wolves till we came through that 
wood, which was near half a league, and entered 
the plain ; as foon as we came into the plain, we had 
occafion enough to look about us. The fir ft objeft 
we met with was a dead" horfe, that is to fay, a poor 
horfe which the wolves had killed, and at leaft a do-, 
zen of them at work ; we could not fay eating of 
him, but picking of his bones rather ; for they had 
eaten up all the flefli before. 

We did not think fit to difturb them at their feaft, 
neither did they take much notice of us ; Friday 
would have let fly at them, but I would not fuflfer 
him by any means ; for I found we were like to 
have more bufinefs upon our hands than we were 
aware of. We were not half gone over the plain, 
but we began to hear the wolves howl in the woods, 
on our left, in a frightful manner ; and prefently af- 
ter we faw about an hundred coming on diredly to- 
wards us, all in a body, and moft of them in a line, 
as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced 
officers. I fcarce knew in what manner to receive 

them ; 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 379 

them ; but found to draw ourfelves in a clofe line, 
was the only way ; fo we formed in a moment j but, 
that we might not have too much interval, I or- 
dered, that only every other man fhould fire 5 and 
that the others, who had not fired, fliould ftand ready 
to give them a fecond volley immediately, if they conw 
tinned to advance upon us ; and that then thofe who 
had fired at firft, fliould not pretend to load their fu- 
fils again, but ftand ready, with every one a piftol, 
for we were all armed with a fufil, and a pair of pif- 
tols each man ; fo we were, by this method, able to 
fire fix volleys, half of us at a time ; however, at 
prefent we had no neceflity ; for, upon firing the firft 
volley, the enemy made a full ftop, being terrified, 
as well with the noife as with the fire ; four of them, 
being ftiot in the head, dropped ; feveral others were 
wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by 
the fnow : I found they ftopped, but did not immedi- 
ately retreat ; whereupon remembering that I had 
been told, that the fierceft creatures were terrified 
at the voice of a man, I caufed all our company to 
halloo as loud as we could, and I found the notion 
not altogether miftaken ; for upon our fliout, they 
began to retire, and turn about ; then I ordered a 
fecond volley to be fired in their rear, which put 
them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. 
This gave us leifure to charge our pieces again, 
and that we might lofe no time, we kept doing ; but 
we had but little more than loaded our fufils, and 
put ourfelves into a readinefs, when we heard a ter- 
rible noife in the fame wood, on our left ; only that 
it was farther onward the fame way we were to go. 

Th« 



380 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

The night was coming on, and the night began td 
be dulky, which made it the worfe on our fide; 
but, the noife increafmg, we could eafily perceive 
that it was the howling and yelling of thofe hellifh 
creatures ; and, on a fudden, we perceived two or 
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind uSy 
?Lnd one on our front, fo that we feemed to be fur- 
rounded with them ; however, as they did not fall 
ypon us, we kept our way forward, as faft as we 
could make our horfes go, which, the way being 
very rough, was only a good large trot; and in 
this manner we only came in view of the entrance 
of the wood through which we were to pafs, at 
the farther fide of the plain ; but we were greatly 
furprifed, when, coming near the lane, or pafs> we 
few a confufqd number of wolves ftanding juft at 
the entrance. 

On a fudden, at another opening of the wood^ 
we heard the noife of a gun ; and, looking that 
way, out rufhed an horfe, with a faddle and a 
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and fixteen. or 
feventeen wolves after him full fpeed : indeed the 
horfe had the heels of them ; but as we fuppofe: 
that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted 
not but they would get up with him at laft i and 
no queftion but they did* 

Here we had a moft horrible fight ; for, riding 
up to the entrance where the horfe came out, we 
found the carcafe of another horfe, and of two men 
devoured by thefe ravenous creatures, and of one 
the man was no doubt the fame whom we heard 
fire a gun, for there lay a gun juft by him fired off; 

but 



W ROBINSON CRUSOE- 38 1 

but as to the man, his head, and the upper part of 
his body, were eaten up* 

This filled us with horror, and we knew n6t 
ivhat courfe to take ; but the creatures refolved us 
foon, for they gathered about us prefently, in hopes 
of prey ; and I verily believe there were three hun- 
dred of them : It happened very much to our advan- 
tage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little 
w^y from it, there lay fome large timber trees, which 
had been cut down the fummer before, and I fup- 
pofe lay there for carriage ; I drew my little troop in 
among thefe trees, and placing ourfelves in a line 
behind one long tree, I advifed them alj to alight, 
and, keeping that tree before us, for a breaft-work, 
to (land in a triangle, or three fronts, inclofing our 
horfes in the centre. 

We did fo, and it was well We did ; for never was 
a more furious charge than the creatures made upon 
us in this place ; they came on us with a growling 
kind of a noife, and mounted the piece of timber 
(which, as I faid, was our breaft-work,) as if they 
were only ruftiing upon their prey ; and this fury of 
theirs, it feems, was principally occafioned by their 
feeing our horfes behind us» which was the prey they 
aimed at : I ordered our men to fire as before, every 
man ; and they took their aim fo fure, that indeed 
they killed feveral of the wolves at the firft volley ; 
but there was a neceffity to keep a continual firing, 
for they came on like devils, thofe behind puftiing on 
thofe before. 

When we had fired our fecond volley of fufils, 
we thought they ftopped a little, and I hoped they 
would have gone off, but it was but a moment, 

for 



381 lIl'E AND AbVENTUfcjEfll 

for otliers came forward again ; fo we fifed orif 
volleys of piftolsj and I believe in thcfe fouf^ 
firings^ we killed feventeen or eighteen of them^ 
and lamed twice as many j yet they came on again^ 

I was loth to fpend our lafl: fliot too haftily ; f<* 
I called my fervant, not my man Friday^ for he wa* 
better employed) for, with the greateft dexterity 
imaginable, he charged my fufil and his own, whild 
we were engaged ; but, as I faid, I called my other 
man ; and giving him a Rorn of powder, I bade hin4 
lay a traki all along the piece of timber, and let it be 
a large train ; he did fo, and had but time to get 
away, when the wolves came up to it, and fome were 
got up upon it ; when I, fnapping an uncharged piftol 
clofe to the powder, fet it on fire ; and thofe that 
were upon the timber were fcorched with it, and fi^fc 
or feven of them fell, or rather jumped in among 
us, with the force and fright of the fire ; we dif- 
patched thefe in an inftant, and the reft were fa 
frighted with the light, which the night, for now ic 
was very near dark, made more terrible, that they 
drew back a little. 

Upon which I ordered our laft piitols to be fired 
off in one volley, and after that we gave a fhout j 
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we fallied imme-' 
diately upon near twenty lame ones, which we found 
ftruggling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with 
our fwords, which anfwered our. expedation } for 
the crying and- howling they made were better un- 
derftood by their fellows ; fo that they fled and left 
us. 

We had, firft and laft, killed about three fcore of 
them J and had it been day-light, we had killed 

many 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 383 

many mere : The field of battle being thus t^ared, 
we made forward again j for we had ftill near a 
league to go ; we heard the ravenous cieatures howl 
and yell in the woods as we went, feveral times ; and 
fometimes we fancied we faw fome of them, but the 
fnow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain ; fo in 
about an hour xssore we came to the town, where we 
•were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright, 
and all in arms ; for, it feems, that, the night be- 
fore, the wolves and fome bears had broken into that 
village, and put them in a terrible fright ; and they 
were obliged to keep guard night and day, bi<l efpe- 
ciallyinthe night, to preferve their cattle, anfl in- 
deed their people. 

The next morning our guide was fo ill, and his 
limbs fo fwelled with the rankling of his two 
wounds, that he could go no farther ; fo we were 
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Tho* 
loufey where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, 
pleafant country, and no fnow, no wolves, or any 
thing like them; but when we told bur flory at 
Tholoufej they told us it was nothing but what was 
ordinary in the great forefl at the foot of the moun- 
tains, efpecially when the fnow lay on the ground ; 
but they enquired much what kind of a guide we 
had gotten, that would venture to bring us that 
way in fuch a fevere feafon ; and told us, it was very 
much we were not all devoured : When we told 
them how we placed ourfelves, and the horfes in the 
middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it 
was fifty to one but we had been all deftroyed ; for 
it was the fight of the horfes that made the wolves 
fo furious, feeing their prey j and that at other times 

they 



384 MtE AMD AfeVEJJ'fUftftS 

they are really afraid of a gun ; but they being fig* 
ceffivc hungry, and raging on that account, the te* 
gernefs to come at the horfes had made them f^e^* 
lefs of daiigei- ; and that if we had not by the cah^ 
tinned fire, and at laft by the ftratagem of the train 
of powder, mattered them, it had been great odds 
but that we had been torn to pi>c\:s j whereas^ had 
we been content to have fat ftill on horfebafck, and 
fired as hotfemen, they would not have takem thd 
horfes fo much for their own, when meli were on 
their backs, as otherwife j and withal they told us^ 
that at laft, if we had ftood altdgetherj and left our 
horfes, they would have been fo eager to have de. 
voured them, that we might have come off fafe^ 
efpecially having our fire-arms in our hands, an.(t 
being fo many in number. 

For my part, I was never fo fenfible of danger irt 
my life ; for feeing above three huDfcdred devils come 
^roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and hairi][ig' 
nothing to Ihelter us, or retreat to, I gave myfelf 
over for loft, ; and as it was, I believe, -I fhall neyef 
care to crofs thofe mountains again 5 1 think I would 
much rather go a thoiifand league^ by fea, thought' 
I were fure to meet with a ftorm once a week.- 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of fit ' 
my paffage through France ; nothing but what other 
travellers have given an account of, with much more 
advantage than I can: I travelled from Tholoufeto 
Paris J and without any confiderable ftay, came to? 
Calais^ and landed fafe at Dover^ the fourteenth of

I wacsi 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE^ 385 

I was no^V come to the centre of my travels, and 
had in a little time all my new difcovered eftate fafe 
about me, the bills of ' exchange, which I brought 
with me, having been very currently paid. 

My principal guide and privy counfellor, was my 
good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money 
I had fent her, thought no pains too much, or care 
too great, to employ for me; and Itrufted her fo 
entirely with every thing, that I was perfectly eafy 
as to the fecurity of my efFeds ; and indeed I was 
very happy from my beginning, and now to the end, 
in the unfpotted integrity of this good gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my effefts 
with this woman, and fetting out for Lijbon, and fo 
to the Brajils : but now another fcfuple came in the 
way, and that was religion ; for as I had entertained 
fome doubts about the Roman religion, even while I 
was abroad, efpecially in my ftate of folitude ; fo I 
knew there was no going to the Brqfils for me, much 
lefs going to fettle there, unlefs I refolved to embrace 
the Roman Catholic religion, without any referve j 
except on the other hand I refolved to be a facrifice 
to my principles, be a martyr for religion, and die 
in the inquifition : fo I refolved to ftay at home, and, 
if I could find means for it, to difpofe of my planta- 
tion. 

To this purpofe I wrote to my old friend at Lijbon^ 
who in return gave me notice, that he could eafily 
difpofe of it there : but that if I thought fit to give 
him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants,

juft upon the fpot, an4 who I knew to be very rich, 
fo that he beUeved they would be fgnd of buying i% { 
he did not doubt, but 1 fliould make 4 or ^000 pieces 
pf eight the more of it. 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it 
to them, and he did fo j and in about eight months 
more, the fliip being then returned, hq fent me an 
ftccount, that they had accepted the offer, and ha4 
remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a corfefpondpnt of 
theirs ?it Lijbon^ to pay for it. 

Jn return, I figned the inftrument of fale iji the 
form which they fent from Lijbony find fent it to my 
pld man, who fent me the bills of exchange for 
32,800 pieces of eight for the eftate ; referving thef 
payment of loo moidores a ye^r, to him, (the old 
man,) during his life, and 50 moidores after^r^s 
to his fon for his life^ Which I had promifcd thepi^ 
and which the plantation was to irxake good as a rent 
charge. And thus I have given the firft part of a 
life of foitune and adventure, a life of Providence*^ 
chequer- work, ajidof a variety which thp world .will 
feldom be able to fliew the like of: beginning foolifli* 
ly, but clofing much more happily than any part of 
it ever gave me leave fo much as to hope for. 

Any one would think, that in this ftate of com- 
plicated good fortune, I was paft running any more 
hazards, ^nd fo indeed I had been, if other circum^ 
fiances had concurred : but I was inured to a wandetr 
ing life, had no femily, nor many relations ; nor^ 
however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance ; 
and though I had fold my eftate in the Brqfilsj yet 
I could not keep that country out of my head,. and

efpecially I could not refift the ftrong inclination I 
had to fee my ifland, and to know if the poor 
Spaniards were in being there j and how the rogues 
I left there had ufed them. 

My true friend the widow earneftly diffuaded me 
from it, and fo far prevailed with me, that almoft 
for feven years (he prevented my running abroad ; 
during which time I took my two nephews, the chil- 
dren of one of my brothers, into my care : the eldeft 
having fomething of his own, I bred up as a gentle- 
man, and gave him a fettlement of fome addition 
to his eftate, after my deceafe ; the other I put out 
to a captain of a fhip ; and after five years, finding 
him a fenfible, bold, enterprifing young fellow, I 
put him into a good fhip, and fent him to fea : and 
this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I 
was, to farther adventures myfelf. 

In the mean time, I in part fettled myfelf here : 
for, firfl of all I married, and that not either to my 
difadvantage or diffatisfaftion ; and had three chil- 
dren, two fons and one daughter : but my wife dying, 
and my nephew coming home with good fuccefs from 
a voyage to Spain^ my inclination to go abroad, and 
his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go 
in his fhip as a private trader to the Eajidndies. This 
was in the year 1694. 

In this voyage I vifited my * new colony in the 
ifland, faw my fucceffors the Spaniards^ had the 
whole flory of their lives, and of the villains I left 
there ; how at firfl they infulted the poor Spaniards^ 
how they afterwards agreed, difagreed, united, fepa-

the Spaniards ; how honeftly the Spaniards ufed them; 
an hiftory, if ic were entered into, as full of variety 
and wonderful accidents as my own part; particu- 
larly alfo as to their battles with the Caribbeans^ who 
landed feveral times upon the ifland, and as to the 
improvement they made upon the ifland itfelf ; and 
how five of them made an attempt upon the maia 
land, and brought away eleven men and five women 
prifoners j by which, at my coming, I found about 
twenty young children on the ifland. 

Here I ftayed about twenty days ; left them fupplies 
of all neceflary things, and particularly of arms, 
powder, fliot, clothes, tools, and two . workmen, 
which I brought from England with mej viz. a 
carpenter and a fmith. 

Befides this, I fliared the land into parts with 
them, referved to myfelf the property of the whole, 
but gave them fuch parts, refpeftively, as they agreed 
on J and, .having fettled all things with them, and 
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them 
there. 

From thence I touched at the Braftls^ from whence 
I fent a bark, which I bought there, with more peo- 
ple, to the ifland ; and in it, befides other fupplies, 
I fent feven women, being fuch as I found proper 
for fervice, or for wives to fuch as would take them. 
As to the EngUJJjmen^ I promifed them to fend them 
fome women from Englflnd^ with a good cargo of necef- 
faries, if they would apply themfelves to planting ; 
which I afterwards could not perform : the fellows 
proved very honefl and diligent, after they were 
mafliered, and had their properties fet apart for them*

them being big with calf, fome fheep, and fome hogs, 
which, when I came again, were confiderably in- 
creafed. 

But all thefe things, with an account how 300 
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their 
plantations, and how they fought with that whole 
number twice, and were at firft defeated and one of 
them killed ; but at laft a ftorm deftroying their ene- 
mie*s canoes, they famiflied or deftroyed almoft all 
the reft, and renewed and recovered the poffeffion 
of their plantation, and ftill lived upon the ifland. 

All thefe things, with fome very furprifmg inci- 
dents in fome new adventures of my own, for ten 
years more, I may, perhaps, give a farther account 
of hereafter.
