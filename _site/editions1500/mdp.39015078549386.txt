R O BIN SO N C R U S O E. 55
R O BIN SO N C R U S O E. 55
for I was fain to dip for it into the Water, a Work which
fatigued me very much ; after this, I went every Day on
board, and brought away what I could get.
I had been 13 Days on Shore, and had been eleven
times on board the Ship; in which Time I had brought

56 The LIFE and AD v EN tur Es of
56 The LIFE and AD v EN tur Es of
56 The LIFE and AD v EN tur Es of
curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a

nothing could come down upon me from the Top : On

In order to do this, I gathered a great Heap of Grapes

for I was near the Shore; but as to my Cargo, it was

R O BIN SO N C R U S O E. 55
R O BIN SO N C R U S O E. 55
R O BIN SO N C R U S O E. 55
for I was fain to dip for it into the Water, a Work which
fatigued me very much ; after this, I went every Day on
board, and brought away what I could get.
I had been 13 Days on Shore, and had been eleven
times on board the Ship; in which Time I had brought

56 The LIFE and AD v EN tur Es of
56 The LIFE and AD v EN tur Es of
56 The LIFE and AD v EN tur Es of
curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a

But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where I lay

nothing could come down upon me from the Top : On

but there was not really any Cave or Way into the Rock
at all.

In order to do this, I gathered a great Heap of Grapes
