DANIEL DE FOE. 

JONUKKimfG tbe ancestry, immediate or remote, of the great 
man who invented "Bobinson Cruaoe," little is known. 
That little, however, as might be reasonably expected of a 
itock from whence sprang so good a man, is fair and honourable ; which, 
Is my thinking — ^that is, to the thinking of an indiridnal who cherishes 
the wazmeat lore and regard for dear old Crusoe — is an exceedin^y 
omofortable fact to reflect on. Trne, it would have mattered little to 
Ids fame as a etory-wiight, had De Toe been no better than a brawling 
tarem-hannter, and his lather and grandfather mere men of tbe mob ; 
but it would bare be%n very paiofol to Crasoe's ten thonaand friends 
and acquaintances to have made the disoorery. The pecoliarities of

DANIBL DE POB. ZY 

Ccncemiiig the boyhood of this person nothing is recorded until we hear 
of bis being bound apprentice to a certain John Levit, a butcher, of Lon- 
don ; and, having duly served his master, we find him a master butcher in 
tibe parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, and of habits altogether different from 
those of his respected fiither, inasmuch as he was a man of sober mind, 
and a strict Nonconformist, and, with his wife, among the most constant 
adherents of the Eev. Dr. Annesley. 

Young Daniel is supposed to have been bom in St. Giles's parish, but 

tiie registration of his birth does not exist in the parish records. This, 

however, may be explained. As before-mentioned, his parents were strict 

Nonoonf ormists ; and their pastor. Dr. Annesley, was, for a considerable 

period after James Eoe the butcher had settled in business, the ordained 

minister of St. Giles's parish church. The severe and simple teachings 

of this good man, however, gave offence, and he was ejected from the 

Hying. After this, Dr. Annesley established a meeting-house in Little St. 

Helen's, Bishopsgate, whither the Eoe family, with the majority of his old 

congregation, followed him. This alteration probably took place shortly 

before Daniel was bom ; and when that auspicious event occurred, the 

boy's parents found themselves in a strait concerning his registration. 

The foolish Church that had closed its doors against their pastor was not 

the place to which the sturdy Nonconformist's child could be carried ; at 

the little meeting-house the ceremony could not be performed ; and so the 

i>irthday of the great Daniel Foe remained unchronided. 

He is above spoken of as named " Eoe," and correctly; for, however 
good his claim may have been to the prefix ''De," his father and his grand- 
father did not adopt it. They were plain Eoes ; and a plain Eoe our hero 
na bom, in the year 1661. (Some few authorities give the date 1664.) 
lazlitt remarks : — ** Upon what occasion it was that De Eoe made the 
Iteration in his name, by connecting it with the foreign prefix, nowhere 
ppears. His motive was probably a dislike to his original name, either 



^. — V uue ocaie, ne tnns replies u> one o 
sneered at his name in conneotion with 
JUvuw : — ** If the gentleman has a &TOI] 
fancy he will not dislike it upon the accon 
a thing which he himself is not, being a 1 
to anybody." 

Of yoimg De Eoe's childhood little 01 
Judging, howeyer, from the man that spm 
sible to conceive him anything but a stud 
sufficient, perhaps, of his other's severity i 
scrapes innumerable, and certainly with su 
fully the punishment thus brought upon 
assumed that he was a daring and ventures( 
fact, who runs away to sea. But these arc 
space cannot here be permitted. It cannc 
that more of such a man's boyhood is not 
merest foreshadowings of the imagination t 
son Crusoe," with all his vicissitudes, adve 
an account of his behaviour from ten till fc

dOigeiit scholar to know." Be Foe ftirther dedares that he left Br. 
Morton'B school with a considerable store of learning. Eiye langoages, 
mtthematim, natural philosophy, logic, geography, and history were 
tnumg his acqnisitionB. 

He remained at school till he was nineteen, when he is again lost sight 
of for two years, and then appears with his first printed effusion. This, 
teeording to Chadwick, was a pamphlet on the then raging war between 
the Anstnans and Turks, and in which he opposed the popular clamour, 
I nd pointed out the disastrous consequences likely to ensue from assisting 
^ Turks against their enemies, who, as he obserres, ^* were at least 
Christians." Hazlitt and others, howeyer, assert that Be Foe's first lite- 
luy production was a lampoon directed against Eoger L'Estrange, who 
ihortly before had published a ** Guide to the Inferior Clergy." The title 
of De Foe's pamphlet was *^ Speculum Crape-Gownorium ; or a Looking- 
Glan for the young Academioks new Foyled, &o. By a Guide to the 
I Inferior Clergy." L'Estrange had in his publication directed the heaviest 
nd sharpest shafts of his wit against the Bissenters, but they were impo- 
tent as reeds compared with Be Foe's rejoining onslaught on the weak- 
nesses of the Established clergy. 

From this period — 1682 to 1685 — Be Foe's mark is missing from 
the pages of histxMry. Then we have the rebellion of the Buke of Mon- 
mouth, and the doughty Baniel Be Foe, a hot-blooded young man of 
twenty-four, enlisted in his cause, — not with his pen, but practically; 
equipped as a soldier, and wearing a sword. The disastrous termina- 
tion of the Monmouth attempt is well known ; and Be Foe with many 
others laid down the unprofitable sword, and returned to their peaceful 
and proper caUings. 

Be Foe, who does not seem as yet to have embarked in any other busi- 
ness speculation save that of pamphlet printing, now turned his attention 
seriously to citizen Ufe, and established himself in Freeman's Yard, Com-

hill, as a hosier, or, according to Hazlitt, '' as a hose-factor or middle-man 
between the mannfactnrer and retail dealer." Whateyer its exact nature, 
the Ereeman's Yard business must haye proyed tolerably satisfactory ; for 
within two years De Foe had come so far to regard himself as a man whose 
future was settled, that, cm his application, he was admitted a liyeryman 
of London on the 26th of January, 1688. 

De Foe continued ten years in the hosiery business. He was not, 
howeyer, so utterly deyoted to it that the dangers of the nation escaped him. 
Within the aboye-mentioned ten years seyeral most important eyents in 
English history transpired, and with the chief of which our hero was asso- 
ciated. About 1686, the King (James II.), actuated by craft and cowardice, 
held out to all religious sects and creeds a project of general toleration — 
Dissenters were to be allowed as much freedom of speech and action as 
members of the Established Church, and Papists as both. Such a pretence 
of generosity on the part of the King was well calculated to find fayonr 
with men as oppressed as were the Dissenters of the period ; but although 
their desire for toleration was great, their hatred of Popery was greater, 
and as a body tibey stood firm against the proposition. At such a time, 
and in such a cause, De Eoe was not likely to be idle. '' Was eyer any- 
thing more absurd,^ wrote he, ** than this conduct of King James and his 
party in wheedling the Dissenters ? Oiying them liberty of conscience by 
his own arbitrary dispensing authority, and his expecting they should be 
content with their religious liberty at the expense of their constitution ? 
a thing, though a few were deluded with, yet the body of Dissenters saw 
through. Hie train, indeed, was laid deep and subtilly; but this was 
plain to eyerybody, that it was wholly inconsistent with Popish interests 
to protect the Dissenters any otherwise than it was made a project to create 
a feud between them and the Church, and in the end destroy both." De 
Eoe afterwards stated that he did his utmost to oppose the scheme, and 
that he wrote two tracts on the subject. 



DANIBL DB FOB. XIX 

This behaviour of the Xing created much discontent among all classes 
of his subjects ; till at last certain of the nobility and gentry, and even 
clergy — including the University of Oxford — petitioned the Prince of 
Orange to come and take possession of the distracted kingdom. The Prince 
repHed with alacrity, and on the 4th of November, 1688 — ^being both his 
birth and marriage day — ^landed at Torbay with fifteen thousand men. 
His march to London was an uninterrupted triumph. The people so far 
from resenting the invasion welcomed the invader as a deliverer, and greeted 
him and his host with tumultuous joy. De Foe was an ardent admirer of 
this revolution. When he heard the news that the army of the Prince of 
Orange was approaching the city, he set out as far as Henley to meet it, 
and joined the motley troop of Dutch soldiers and English soldiers, and 
renegade statesmen, and disaffected clergy and citizens, in their march to 
WhitehalL The 4th of November was ever after regarded by De Foe as 
t sacred day — " a day famous on various accounts, and every one of them 
^ to Britons who love their country, value the Protestant interest, or 
have an aversion to tyranny and oppression. On this day he (the Prince of 
Orange) was bom ; on this day he married the daughter of England ; and 
on this day he rescued the nation from a bondage worse than that of 
^ypt — a bondage of soul as well as bodily servitude ; a slavery to the 
ambition and raging lust of a generation set on fire by pride, avarice, 
emelty, and blood." The revolution was thus consummated without 
bloodshed ; and the last of the Stuarts, finding a throne without the sup- 
port of the people untenable, fled to France, where he was well received 
by the reigning monarch. 

It may be assumed from passages that occur in some of his pamphlets, 
that during his occupancy of the Freeman's Yard warehouse, De Foe had a 
country house in Surrey. He was instrumental in forming the first regular 
Dissenting congregation at Tooting, the Eev. Joshua Oldfield being elected 
their pastor. 



XX MEUOIK OF 

De Foe, in his pampfalets, repeatedly repudiates the occnpatioii of an 
hosier and daims to be a trader — a general merchant. Oldmixon, one of 
De Foe's most annoying enemies, says, " he never had been a merchant, 
otherwise than peddling a little to Portugal." There is every reason to 
believe, however, that during his ten years' experience as a trader he made 
several voyages to Spain and Portugal, and he himself declares that he 
resided in Spain long enough to acquire the language of that country. He 
had some connexion also with Dutch commerce. He is alluded to con- 
temptuously as a "civet*cat merchant;" but, says Hazlitt, "it was pro- 
bably the drug, rather than the animal, in which he traded." 

Whatever may have been the nature of the various enteipnses De Foe 
embarked in during the said ten years, it is certain that they landed him a 
bankrupt, and he had to fly from his creditors. Various causes have been 
assigned for this collapse of his fortune ; but it must be the boldest specu- 
lation to speak of the reasons of a man's failing in business when it is 
actually unknown what the nature of that business was. TTia debts 
amounted to several thousand pounds ; and now his behaviour showed him 
something more thanfa ''pedlar " or a man whose heart was in the till of 
a hosiery shop. He might— and still have been nothing below the average 
'' trade mark" — ^have availed himself of the bankruptcy law, and to a very 
large extent have eluded the payment of his obligations. Had he done so, 
however, he would have been false to his own noble teaching, " Never 
think yourself discharged in conscience though you may be discharged in 
law. No title of honour, no recorded merit, no mark of distinction, can 
exceed that lasting appellation, an honest man. The obligations of an honest 
mind can never die. He that lies buried under such an epitaph has more 
said of him than volumes of history can contain. The payment of debts 
after fair discharge, is the dearest title to such a character that I know : 
and how any man can begin again and hope for a blessing from Heaven, 
or favour from man, without such a resolution, I know not." The debts

I incnired duiing his trading were subsequently paid to the uttermost 
farthing. 

To what part of the kingdom De Foe fled, that he might in quiet arrange 
his affjEdrs, and at the same time avoid the horrors of a debtors' prison, is 
not certain. Probably Bristol was his hiding place. There is a tolerably 
well-authenticated story of his appearing in a certain quarter of that city, 
handsomely dressed with flowing wig, lace ruffles, and a sword at his side — 
hut only on Sundays, '' He there attained the name of the Sunday G^tle- 
man, because through fear of the bailifls he dare not appear in public on 
any other day." 

At this time he was thirty-four years old, and, having arranged his 
pecuniary aflSedrs, he was offered and accepted a situation in the glass duty 
commission. This, however, he only retained for four years, as at the 
expiration of that time the glass tax was repealed. About this time he 
became secretary to a tile and brick making concern at Tilbury, in Essex. 
He must have had a considerable share in the monetary affairs of the 
business, for on its failure in 1703, De Foe's personal loss was three thou- 
sand pounds. 

His duties, however, as a collector of taxes, or secretary at the tile 
works, did not induce him to throw aside his pen. From 1695 till 1701 
he wrote and published numerous works and pamphlets. His '' Essay on 
Prospects," which appeared in 1697, is remarkable for the soundness and 
ingenuity of its arguments, as weU as for the novel views it advocates. A 
tract in defence of the necessity of the maintenance of an English standing 
army was published by him in 1697, and shortly afterwards another tract 
on the same subject appeared. The subject was making considerable stir 
in the country at the time. The treaty of Ryswick had just been signed, 
and consequently a large army which had been engaged in the French war 
was now entirely without employment. It was the popular wish that this 
force should be disbanded. Tradition and precedent alike strengthened the

who likewise rememhered that fact, and i 
opportunity, to push it to an issue. Thi

to increase it. With all the vigour of his pc 
policy, and the King was not ungrateful. 

De Foe now appears to have devoted h 
siderable energy, to literary pursuits. Nun 
and prose, emanated from his fertile pen, th< 
would occupy almost as many pages as are h 
One of the most remarkable, however, and ^ 
attracted the King to him, was '' The True-l

iroid as their cue, had indulged in the most scandalous libels against His 
Majesty, and it was to answer them, and through them their employers 
and admirers, that Be Foe penned his satirical poem. His description of the

entire production.

As might reasonably be expected, although a reply to his enemies 
couched in such language pleased King Williara not a little, and had the 
effect of stopping their clamour, it in no way tended to alter their opinions 
or to promote their esteem for Daniel De Foe, the writer. The poem had 
an enormous sale— at least eighty thousand copies finding their way into 
the hands of an equal number of Englishmen, '^ true-bom " or otherwise. 

From this time De Foe was high in favour with the King, who 
employed him in many secret services the nature of which is not known. 
In one of his '' Beviews," published about ten years after the King's death, 
this bold counsellor tells how that he advised His Majesty "to send a 
strong fleet to the Havannah to seize that part of the island in which it is 
ntoated, and f^m thence to seize and secuiie the possession at least of the 
coast, if not by consequence the Terra Firma^ of the Empire of Mexico, 
and thereby entirely cut off the Spanish commerce and the return of their 
plate ships, by the immense riches whereof, and by which only, both France 
and Spain have been enabled to support this war."

securities for his good befaaTionr during the following seven years. 

It happened, however, that although De Toe hod lost the faith <^ hit

was the idol of the crowd ; and, when he was led out to the pillory, avast

intended as a degrading punishment into a famous triumph.

The imprisonment in Newgate had to be endnied for several months. 
However, this time was not passed by the great man iu an idle way. Novels 
and pamphlets were projected, and a complete edition of his works collected 
and printed. It was while he was a tenant of Newgate also that the 
Revime was eatahlished — a publication which appeared two or three times 
a week for several years. It was entirely written by De Foe. At last,

To lecmit his healtii, De Foe now retired with his family to Bmy St. 
Himmds, continoing Lis literary labonrs, bowerer, with untiring energy. 
in 1706 he was comnussioned by the OoTemment to visit Scotland, with 
I tiew of assisting in the formation of a union between the two coontries. 
So ibly did he acquit himself of this mission, t^t in 1708 a pension 
Tis granted him. Political changes, however, soon depriyed him of this 
benefit. 

Being once more dependent on his pen, he set to work anidnouBly,

sought to quit no more, the leisure of his active spirit was occupied in the 
creation of a series of works which raised his name immeasurably higher 
than it had ever been before in the opinion of his contemporaries, and 
which will preserve that name in freshness and honour so long as the lan- 
guage in which they are written endures." De Foe recovered from hiB 
illness, and, being in his fifty-fifth year, sat down to romance writing with 
a mind as vigorous and elastic as a young man of thirty. Within six years 
he produced more than a dozen works, among the rest, — " The Life, Ad- 
ventures, and Pyracies of Captain Singleton ;" '' The Dumb Philosopher ;" 
"Colonel Jack;" "MoU Flanders;" "The Mysteries of Magic;" "The 
History of the Plague;" and "Eobinson Crusoe." The last mentioned 
story was one of the earliest produced after his retirement from political 
life, and was published in 1719. Concerning " Eobinson Crusoe," nothing 
need here be said. All that could be attempted would be to sing its 
praises to a new air ; and when one has so few words to harp on — " won- 
drous wisdom," " perfection of wit," " enchanting interest," and a few 
others — ^their adaptation to a new tune is difiScult, especially as the said 
tune must be one that every English boy may easily sing, for sing it he 
certainly wiU to some tune or other. 

At the age of sixty, De Foe was famous through his latter works ; he 
possessed a handsome house at Stoke Newington, and could have been in 
no other than easy circumstances. He was sorely afflicted with gout, and 
besides was troubled with a painM intestinal complaint. Another mis- 
fortune he had to bear was heavier than both, — a dissolute, ungrateful son. 
Still, in the teeth of these great troubles, De Foe's teeming brain could not 
be still. His " History of the Plague " is justiy regarded as one of the most 
marvellous of his productions. " No one," says Hazlitt, " can take up the 
book without believing that it is the saddler of Whitechapel who is telling 
his own story ; and that he was an eye-witness to all he relates ; that he 
actually saw the blazing stars which portended the calamity ; that he wit-

nessed the grass growing in the streets ; read the inscriptions upon the 
doors of the infected houses ; heard the bell-men crying * Bring out your 
dead ;' saw the dead carts conyeying the people to their graves, and was 
present at the digging of the pits in which they were deposited. It is no 
wonder that a work so gravely written should have deceived Dr. Mead, 
who quoted it as an authentic history in his ' Treatise on the Plague.' " 

In 1724 appeared '' Eoxana, the Fortunate Mistress ;" and the follow- 
ing year a new " Voyage Bound the World," the most instructive, if not 
the most interesting, of his histories. Other works of a less important 
character followed, and in 1727 was issued ''The Complete V.nglifth 
Tradesman." This is generally regarded as the best of De Foe's prac- 
tical works, and was greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin. Following 
this came ''The Military Memories of Captain Carleton," which, with 
some few pamphlets, carried him on to his sixty-ninth year, when we find 
him engaged on a work of considerable magnitude, entitled " The Com- 
plete Gentleman." 

Of this, however, part only was written, and but a single sheet printed. 
"We find him writing to his printer (Mr. J. "Watt, in Wild Court), apolo- 
gising for some delay, but excusing himself on the ground that he i» 
" exceedingly ill." He was not fated, however, to end his well-worn lif^ 
easily and pleasantly. Strange as it may appear, considering the profitable^ 
nature of his works during the preceding twelve or fiifkeen years, he was 
reduced in his extreme old age to absolute poverty, forfeiting his house at 
Newington, and actually thrown into prison for debt. His imprisonment 
was of but short duration, but his worldly condition never afterwards 
mended. His bodily afflictions increased, and his wicked son added a 
climax to his previous ill-behaviour by squandering the little hoard saved 
from the wreck of his father's property, entrusted to this son for the use of 
his mother and sisters. Writing concerning family matters generally to his 
son-in-law, Mr. Baker, a few months before his death, poor De Foe thus

illdes to tbds scapegrace : " I depended npon him — I trusted >iini — I gave

Excuse my inflimity ; I can say no more, my heart is too full." 

On the 24th of April, 1731, in the eeventieth year of his age, De Foe 

iMud rest from the world wherein he had worked so long and so nobly, 

md which at last treated him so unkindly. He died in the parish he was 

] bom in — St Giles's, Cripplegato — and was buried in what was then known 

I itTindall'B Burying Ground, and now as Bunhill Fields. Whether he died 

' nnoiiiidedby his family, whether he died all alone or attended bystrangers, 

^ cannot be discovered- The worst, however, may be surmised ; for had

ROBINSON CRUSOE 



CHAPTER I. 



^/^maa Crnsoe declares his birth and parentage— He inclines to a seafaring life— HLb father 
expostulates with him— Visits Hull, where a companion tempts him to take a trip by sea — A 
itonn arises, in the midst of which he reflects on his disobedient conduct — The ship springs a

WAS bom in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good 
family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner 
of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate 
by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at 
York ; firom whence he had married my mother, whose relations 
were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and 
fix)m whom I was so called Robinson Krcutznaer ; but, by the 
usual corruption of words in England, we are now called, nay, 
^e call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe ; and so my companions 
*l^yB called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an 
English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous 
Lionel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the 
Spaniards. What became of my second brother, I never knew, any more 
^fc«n my father or mother did know what was become of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head 
^an to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who was 
Teiy ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house

insufficient diet, on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselyes by 
the natural consequences of their way of living ; that the middle station 
of life was calculated for all kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoyments ; 
that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that tem- 
perance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, 
and all desirable pleasures were the blessings attending the middle station 
of life ; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, 
and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands 
or of the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed 
witii perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the body 
of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret burning lust of 
ambition for great things : but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently 
through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living without the 
bitter ; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day's expe- 
rience to know it more sensibly. 

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate man- 
ner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries 
which nature, and the station of life I was bom in, seemed to have pro- 
vided against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread ; that 
he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the 
station of life which he had been just recommending to mo ; and that if 
I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate, 
or £atilt, that must hinder it ; and that he should have nothing to answer 
for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures 
which he knew would be to my hurt : in a word, that as he would do 
very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, 
K> he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any 
encooragement to go away ; and, to close all, he told me I had my elder 
brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persua- 
sions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not 
prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, where he 
was killed ; and though, he said, he would not cease to pray for me, yet 
he would venture to say to me that if I did take this foolish step, God 
would not bless me, and I would have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon 
having neglected his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my 
recovery. 

I observed, in this last part of his discourse, which was truly pro- 
phetic, though I suppose, my father did not know it to be so himself;

and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go 
one Toyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would 
go no more ; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the 
time I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion : she told me she knew it 
wonld be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such a subject ; 
that he knew too well what was my interest, to give his consent to any 
such thing so much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think 
d any such thing, after such a discourse as I ha^ with my father, and 
Rich kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me ; 
and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me ; but 
I might depend I should never have their consent to it : that, for her 
pert, she would not have so much hand in my destruction, and I should 
i nerer have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was 
not 

Though my mother reftised to move it to my father, yet, as I have 
heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him; and that my 
father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her with a sigh, " That 
ho7 might be happy if he would stay at home ; but if he goes abroad, he 
will be the most miserable wretch that ever was bom : I can give no 
oonaent to it." 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose ; though in 
the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to 
boainess, and frequently expostulating with my father and mother about 
their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclina- 
tionB prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, 
and without any purpose of making an elopement that time, but I say, 
being there, and one of my companions being going by sea to London in his 
father's ship, and prompting me to go with them with the common allure- 
ment of seafEiring men, viz., that it should cost me nothing for my passage, 
I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them 
vord of it ; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking 
God's blessing, or my father's, without any consideration of circumstances 
or consequences, and in an ill hour, Qt)d knows, on the 1st of September, 
1651, I went on board a ship bound for London. Kever any young ad- 
Tentorer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer, than 
mine. The ship was no sooner got out of the Humber but the wind 
began to blow, and the waves to rise, in a most frightful manner ; and

clapping me on the shonlder, ''how do yon do after it? I warrant you 
were Mghted, wa'n't yon, last night, when it blew but a cap-full of 
wind ?"^ "A cap-fdll, do yon call it?" said I, */ 'twas a terrible storm." 
'* A storm, you fool !" replies he, " do you call that a storm ? Why, it was 
nothing at all ; give ns but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing 
of such a squall of wind as that. But you are but a fresh-water sailor, 
Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that. D'ye 
see what charming weather 'tis now ?" To make short this sad part of my 
story, we went the way of all sailors ; the punch was made, and I was 
made drunk with it ; and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my 
repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, and all my resolu- 
tions for the fature. In a word, as the sea was returned to its smooth- 
ness of 8urfiEU» and settled calmness by the abatement of the storm, so 
the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of 
being swallowed up by the sea forgotten, and the current of my former 
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in 
my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious 
thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again .sometimes ; but I 
shook them off and roused myself from them, as it were from a distemper, 
and applying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of 
those flts — ^for so I called them; and I had in five or six days got as 
complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not 
to be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have another trial for 
it stiU ; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to 
leave me entirely without excuse: for if I would not take this for a 
deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened 
wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Eoads : the 
wind having been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little 
way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and 
here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or 
eight days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came 
into the same roads, as the conmion harbour where the ships might wait 
for a wind for the river, We had not, however, rid here so long, but 
we should have tided up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh ; and, 
after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads 
being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground 
tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least 



rode with two anchors ahead, and the ct

little. Bat if I can express, at this distance, the thoughts I had about 
me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of 
my former convictions, and the having returned from them to the re- 
solutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself ; and 
these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that 
1 can by no words describe it. But the worst was not come yet ; the 
storm continued with such ftiry, that the seamen themselves acknowledged 
they had never known a worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep 
laden, and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every now and then 
cried out she would founder. It was my advantage, in one respect, that 
I did not know what they meant by founder, till I inquired. However, 
the storm was so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master, the 
boatswain, and some others, more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, 
and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. 
In the middle of the night, and xmder all the rest of our distresses, one of 
the men that had been down on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung 
a leak ; another said there was four feet water in the hold. Then all 
hands were called to the pump. At that very word my heart, as I 
thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed 
where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me 
that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as 
another : at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked very 
heartily. While this was doing, the master, seeing some light colliers 
who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to 
sea, and would come near us, ordered us to fire a gun as a signal of 
distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised that 
I thou^t the ship had broke, or some dreadfrd thing had happened. In 
a word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a 
time when every body had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or 
what was become of me, but another man stepped up to the pump, and' 
thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; 
and it was a great while before I came to myself. 

We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent 
t^t the ship would founder ; and though the storm began to abate a 
little, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a 
port, so the master continued firing guns for help ; and a Hght ship, who 
had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was 
with the utmost hazard the boat came nepr us, but it was impossible for 



10 ADVENTURES OP 

118 to get on boaid, or for the boat to lie near the ship's sidey till at lastr 
the men, rowing very heartily and venturing their lives to save onrs, oar 
men cast them a rope over the stem with a bnoy to it^ and then veered 
it ont a great length, which they, after great labour and hazard, took 
hold of, and we hauled them close under our stem and got all into their 
boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, afber we were in the boat^ 
to think of reaching to their own ship ; so all agreed to let her drive, and 
only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could ; and our master 
promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make 
it good to their master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat 
went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as 
Winterton-Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship, but 
we saw her sink : and then I understood, for the first time, what was 
meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge, I had hardly 
eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking ; for, from that 
moment, they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go 
in : my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly 
with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me. 

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the oar 
to bring the boat near the shore^ we could see (when, our boat mounting 
the waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running 
along the strand, to assist us when we should come near ; but we made 
slow way towards the shore, nor were we able to reach it, till being 
past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward 
towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the 
wind. Here we got in, and, though not without much difficulty, got all 
safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth ; where, as 
unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the 
magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by the 
particular merchants and owners of ships ; and had money given us 
sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we thought fit 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone 
home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem of our blessed 
Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me ; for, hearing 
the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Eoads, it was a 
great while before he had any assurance that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could 



BOBINBON CBUSOB. 11 

• 
nsist; and llioiigb I had seyeral tunes loud calls from my reason, and my 

more composed judgment, to go home, yet I had no power to d<f it. I 

know not what to caU this, nor wiU I urge that it is a secret, overruling 

decree that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, 

eroi though it be before us, and that we push upon it with- our eyes open. 

Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unayoidable misery attending, 

ud which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me 

forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired 

thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with in 

mj first attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the 

master's son, was now less forward than I : the first time he spoke to me 

after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we 

were separated in the town to several quarters ; I say, the first time he 

B8W me, it appeared his tone Was altered, and, looking very melancholy, 

and shaking his head, h^ asked me how I did ? and teUing his father who 

I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go 

iarther abroad, his father, turning to me with a very grave and concerned 

tone, " Young man," says he, " you ought never to go to sea any more ; you 

OQg^t to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a sea- 

fcringman." "Why, sir?" saidl; "willyou goto sea no more?" "That 

ii another case," said he ; " it is my calling, and therefore my duty ; but as 

joa made this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given 

joa of what you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all 

befidlen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," 

continues he, "what are you, and on what account did you go to sea?" 

Upon that I told him some of my story ; at the end of which he burst out 

with a strange kind of passion. " What had I done," says he, " that such 

an unhappy wretch should come into my ship ? I would not set my foot 

in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This indeed 

was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the 

aense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go. 

However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me : exhorted me to go 

back to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I 

might see a visible hand of Heaven against me : " And, young man," said 

he, " depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go you will 

meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments till your father's 

words are fulfilled upon you." 



12 ADVENTUBBB OF 

We parted aoon after, for I made him little answer, and I saw him no 
more : which way he went, I know not, Aa for me, haviiig some money 
in my pocket, I travelled to London by land, and ttiere, as well as on the 
road, had many strnggleH with myself what conise of life I shonld take, 
and whether I should go home or go to sea. As to going home, shame 
opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts ; and it immcdiatelf 
occiuTod to me how I should be laughed at among the ndl^bonrs, and 
shonid be ashamed to eec, not my father and mother only, bat eren eveiy 
body else : from whence I have since often observed, how incongruoiu 
and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to 
that reason which ought to guide them in such cases, viz., that they are 
not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent ; nor ashamed of the 
action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed 
of the retaining, which only can make them be eBt«emcd wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what 
measures to take, and what course of li&.'to l€Ekd.'*An irresistible 
reluctaoce continued to going home ; oud as I stayed awhile, the remem- 
brance of the distress I had been in wore off; and, as that abated, the 
little motion I had in my desires to a return wore off with it, till at lari 
I quite laid aside the thou^ts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

[TTAT evil influence which carried me first away from my 
fSftther's house, that hurried me into the wild and indigested 
notion of raising my fortune, and that impressed those con- 
ceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good 
advice, and to the entreaties, and even the commands of my father; I 
saj, the same influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate 
of all enterprises to my view ; and I went on board a vessel bound to the 
coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did not 
ship myself as a sailor ; whereby, though I might indeed have worked a 
little harder than ordinary, yet, at the same time, I had learned the duty 
and office of a foremastman, and in time might have qualified myself for 
a mate or lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was always my fate 
to choose for the worse, so I did here ; for, having money in my pocket 
and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit 
of a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship, nor 
learned to do any. 

It was my lot, first of all to fall into pretty good company in London ; 
which does not always happen to such loose and unguided young fellows 
as I then was, the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare for 
them very early. But it was not so with me. I first feU acquainted 
with the master of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea, and who, 



14 ADVENTTJBES OP 

having had very good success there, was resolved to go again ; and whey, 
taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all disagreeable sL't 
that time, and hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me, i£ 
I would go the voyage with him, I should be at no expense — I should be 
his messmate and his companion ; and if I could carry any thing with me, 
I should have all the advantage of it that the trade would admit ; and, 
perhaps, I might meet with some encouragement. I embraced the offer, 
and entering into a strict Mendship with this captain, "^o was an h<{nest 
and plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and carried a small 
adventure with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend the 
captain, I increased very considerably ; for I carried about forty pounds 
in such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This forty 
pounds I had mustered together by the assistance of some of my relations 
whom I corresponded with, and who I believe got my father, or, at 
least, my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first adventure. 
This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my 
adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend 
the captain, under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the 
mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account 
of the ship's course, take an observation, aud, in short, to understand 
some things that were needfril to be understood by a sailor : for, as he 
took delight to instruct me, I took delight to leain; and, in a word, 
this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant : for I brought home 
five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which yielded 
me in London, at my return, almost three hundred pounds, and this 
filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed 
my ruin. Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; par- 
ticularly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent calen- 
ture* by the excessive heat of the climate— our principal trading being 
upon the coast, from the latitude of fifteen degrees north, even to the 
Line itself. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader: and my friend, to my great 
misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage 
again ; and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate

climates, and to 'which, therefore, European sailors are peculiarly liable. One of the

sometimes, attempting to walk on it, is lost.

in the former voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This 
was the mihappiest voyage that ever man made ; for though I did not 
cany quite a hundred pounds of my new-gained wealth — so that I had 
two handled poimds left, and which I lodged with my Mend's widow, 
who was very just to me— yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this 
Tojage: and the first was this, viz. — our ship, making her course to^ 
waids the Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and the 
AMean shore, was surprised, in the gray of the morning, by a Turkish 
rarer of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sails she could make. 
We crowded also as much canvass as our yards would spread, or our masts 
cany, to have got clear ; but finding the pirate gained upon us and would 
certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our 
ihip haying twelve guns, and the rover eighteen. About three in the 
afternoon he came up with us ; and bringing to, by mistake, just athwart 
m quarter, instead of athwart our stem as he intended, we brought 
ei^t of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside upon 
him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our fire and pour- 
ing in also his small shot from near two hundred men which he had 
(m board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping 
cloee. He prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; 
hat laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he entered 
nxty men upon our decks, who immediately fcU to cutting and hacking 
the decks and rigging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, 
powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. How- 
6Ter, to cut short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being dis- 
thled and three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were obliged 
to yield, and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to 
the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended ; 
oar was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest of 
oor men were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper 
prize, and made his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his busi- 
JiesB. At this surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant 
to a miserable slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now I looked back 
upon my father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable 
and have none to relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually 
brou^t to pass, that I could not be worse — ^that now the hand of 
Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone, without redemption. But, 



16 ADVBNTURB8 OP 

alas ! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go thronghy as will 
appear in the sequel of this story. 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I 
was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again, 
belieTing that it would, some time or other, be his fSate to be taken by 
a Spanish or Portuguese man-of-war, and that then I should be set at 
liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away, for when he went 
to sea he left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do the 
conmion drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home 
again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin, to look after 
the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might 
take to efEect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it 
Kothing presented to make the supposition of it rational ; for I bad 
nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me, — no fellov- 
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman there but myself : so that 
for two years, though I often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I 
never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put 
the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my 
head. My patron lying at home longer than usual, without fitting out 
his ship — ^which, as I heard, was for want of money — he used constantly, 
once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair, to take 
the ship's pinnace, and go out into the road a-fishing ; and as he always 
took me and a young Moresco with him to row the boat, we made him 
very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catching fish, insomuch that 
sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the 
youth, the Moresco, as they called him, to catch a dish of fish for him. 

It happened one time that, going a-fishing in a stark calm morning, a 
fog rose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, 
we lost sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither, or which way, we 
laboured all day and all the next night, and when the morning came, we 
found we had pulled off to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore, and 
that we were at least two leagues from the shore : however, we got well 
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and some danger, for the 
wind began to blow pretty fi^sh in the morning ; but, particularly, we 
were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of 



B0BIN80N CBUSOB« 17 

limself for the fdttire; and having lying by him the longboat of our 

Rngjlifth ship he had taken^ he resolved he would not go a-fishing any 

more without a compass and some provision ; so he ordered the carpenter 

of his ship, who also was an English slave, to build a little state-room or 

cabin in the middle of the longboat, like that of a barge, with a place to 

stand behind it to steer and haul home the main sheet, and room before 

for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed with that we 

call a shoulder-of-mutton sail, and the boom jibbed over the top of the 

cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for him to He, 

with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put 

in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to diink, particularly his 

loead, rice, and coffee. 

We were frequently out with this boat a-fishing, and as I was most 
dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened 
that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for 
ibh, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for 
whom he had provided extraordinary, and had therefore sent on board 
the boat, overnight, a larger store of provisions than ordinary, and had 
ordered me to get ready three fusees, with powder and shot, which were 
on board his ship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as 
fishing. 

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning 
vith the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and everything 
to accommodate his guests : when, by and by, my patron came on board 
alone/ and told me his guests had put off going, upon some business that 
fell out, and ordered me with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with 
the boat and catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his 
house; and commanded that as soon as I had got some fish, I should 
hdng it home to his house : all which I prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my 
thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at my com-* 
mand; and my master being gone, I prepared 'to Aimish myself not for 
fishing business, but *for a voyage ; though I knew not, neither did I 
so much as consider, whither I should steer ; for any where to get out of 
that place was my way. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to t}iis Moor, 
to get something for our subsistence on board ; for I told him we must 
iu)t presume to eat of our patron's bread. He said, that was true ; so 



18 ADVBNTURB8 OF 

he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind, and three jars 
with fresh water into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles 
stood, which it was evident by the make were taken out of some "Rn gliwh 
prize, and I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as 
if they had been there before for our master. I conveyed also a great 
lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above half a hundred- 
weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, 
all which were of great use to us afterwards, especially the wax, to make 
candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which he innocently came into 
also. His name was Ismael, whom they call Muley, or Moley ; so I called 
to him : '' Moley," said I, '^ our patron's guns are on board the boat, can 
you not get a little powder and shot? it may be we may kill some 
alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the 
gunner's stores in the ship." " Yes," says he, " I will bring some ;" and 

* 

accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held about a pound 
and a half of powder, or rather more, and another with shot, that had five 
or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat : at the same 
time I had found some powder of my master's in the great cabin, with 
which I filled one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, 
pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with every thing 
needfiil, we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the 
entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us ; and 
we were not above a mile out of the port, before we hauled in our sail, 
and set us down to fish. The wind blew from N.N.E., which waa 
contrary to my desire ; for, had it blown southerly, I had been sore ta 
have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz ; 
but jpj resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from, 
that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for when I had 
fish on my hook I would not pull them up that he might not see them, I 
said to the Moor, " This will not do ; our master will not be thus served ; 
we must stand farther off.*" He, thinking no harm, agreed, and being in 
the head of the boat, set the sails ; and as I had the helm, I run the boat 
out near aleague farther, and then brought her to, as if I would fish. Then 
giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and 
making as if I stooped for something behind hiih, I took l.im by surprise, 
with my arm under his twist,* and tossed him clear overboard into the 

. * The hollow on the inside of the thigh.

ROBINSON CBUSOB. 19 

He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, 
begged to be taken in, and told me he would go all over the world with 
me. He swam so strong after the boat that he would have reached me 
very quickly, there being but little wind ; upon which I stepped into the 
cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and 
told him I had 'done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do 
liiin none. '^ But," said I, *^ you swim well enough to reach the shore, and 
the sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore and I will do you no 
barm ; but if you come near the boat I will shoot you through the head ; 
for I am resolved to have my liberty." So he turned himself about, and 
iwam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for 
he was an excellent swinmier. 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have 
diowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he 
was gone I turned to the boy whom they called Xury, and said to him, 
"Xury, if you will be faithful to me I will make you a great man ; but if 
you will not stroke your face to be true to me (that is, swear by Mahomet 
ud his father's beard), I must throw you into the sea too." The boy 
sniled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could not mistrust him ; 
and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming I stood out 
dh^ctly to sea, with the boat rather stretching to windward, that they 
ni^t think me gone towards the Strait's mouth (as indeed any one that 
bad been in their wits must have been supposed to do) ; for who would 
bare supposed we were sailed on to the southward, to the truly Bar- 
barian coast, where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us 
with their canoes and destroy us, where we could never once go on shore 
but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages 
d human kind ? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening I changed my course, and 
iteered directly south and by east, bending my course a little toward 
the east, that I might keep in with the shore ; and having a fair fresh 
gale ci wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe by 
the ilezt day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, 
I could not be less than one hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee, quite 
beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king 
thereabouts ; for we saw no people. 

Tet such was the fidght I had taken at the Moors, and the dreadful 



20 ADYBNTURB8 OF 

apprehensions I liad of falling into their hands, that I wonld not stop, of 
go on shore^ or come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I had 
sailed in that manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the 
southward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in chase 
of me, they also would now give over: so I ventured to make to the 
coast, and came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river; I knew 
not what or where, neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or 
what river. I neither saw, nor desired to see, any people ; the principal 
thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening, 
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the coxmtry ; 
but as soon as it was quite dark,- we heard such dreadful noises of the 
barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what 
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not 
to go on shore till day. " "Well, Xury," said I, " then I won't ; but it may 
be we may see men -by day, who will be as bad to us as those Hons." 
"Then we may give them the shoot-gun,** says Xury, laughing, "make 
them run wey." Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. 
However, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram 
out of our patron's case of bottles to cheer him up. After all, Xury^s 
advice was good, and I took it. "We dropped our little anchor, and lay 
still all night. I say still, for we slept none : for in two or three hours 
we saw vast great creatures (we knew not what to call them), of many 
sorts, come down to the seashore, and run unto the water, wallowing and 
washing themselves, for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they 
made such hideous bowlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard 
the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too ; but we were 
both more frighted when we heard one of the mighty creatures come 
swimming towards our boat : we could not see him, but we might hear 
him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and fririous beast. Xury 
said it was a lion, and it might be so for aught I know, but poor Xury 
cried to me to weigh the anchor, and row away. " No," says I, " Xury, 
we can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and go to sea ; they cannot follow 
ns far." I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it 
was) within two oars' length, which something surprised me ; however, I 
immediately stepped to the cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at 
him, upon which he immediately turned about, and swam towards the 
shore again. 



ROBINSON CBUSOB. 21 

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hideous cries 

and howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as 

higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun ; a thing, I 

belieye, those creatures had never heard before. This convinced me there 

was no going on shore for us in the night upon that coast, and how to 

venture on shore in the day, was another question too ; for to have fallen 

into t^e hands of any of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen 

into the paws of lions and tigers : at least we were equally apprehensive 

of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obHged to go on shore somewhere or 
other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat : when or where 
to get it was the porut. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with 
oae of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and bring somfe to 
me. I asked him why he would go ; why I should not go, and he stay in 
the boat ? The boy answered with so much affection, that he made me 
love him ever after. Says he, "If wild mans come, they eat me, you go 
away." " Well, Xury," said I, " we will both go ; and if the wild mans 
come, we will kill them ; they shall eat neither of us.** So I gave Xury 
a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles, 
which I mentioned before ; and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as 
ve thought was proper, and waded to shore, canying nothing but our arms 
and two jars for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of 
canoes wit^ savages down the river; but the boy, seeing a low place 
about a mile up the country, rambled to it ; and, by and by, I saw him 
come running towards me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or 
frighted with some wild beast, and I therefore ran forwards to help him ; 
but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his 
ihoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but 
different in colour, and longer legs : however, we were very glad of it, 
and it was very good meat : but the great joy that poor Xury came with, 
was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not- take such pains for water ; 
for a little higher up the creek where we were, we found the water fresh 
when the tide was out, which flows but a little way up ; so we filled 
our jars, and feasted on the hare we had killed ; and prepared to go 
on our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that 
part of the country. 



22 ADViNTUBES OF 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very well that 
the islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Yerd Islands also, lay not far 
from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an observation, to 
know what latitude we were in, and did not exactly know, or at least 
remember, what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for 
them, or when to stand off to sea towards them, otherwise I might now 
easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was, that if I 
stood along this coast till I came to that part where the English traded, I 
should find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that 
would relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, the place where I now was must be 
that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions 
and the Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts ; the 
Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the 
Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its 
barrenness ; and, indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious 
numbers of tigers, Hons, leopards, and other fririous creatures which 
harbour there: so that the Moors use it for their hunting only, where 
they go like an army, two or three thousand men at a time ; and, indeed, 
for near a hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a 
waste, uninhabited coxmtry by day, and heard nothing but bowlings and 
roaring of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice, in the daytime, I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe, 
being the high top of the mountain Teneriffe, in the Canaries, and had a 
great mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither ; but having tried 
twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too 
high for my little vessel: so I resolved to pursue my first design, and 
keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left 
this place ; and once, in particular, being early in the morning, we came 
to an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty high ; and the 
tide beginning to flow, we lay stiU, to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes , 
were more about him than, it seems, mine were, calls softly to me, and 
teUs me that we had best go farther off the shore ; " For," says he, " look, 
yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I 
looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a 
terrible great Hon that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a 
piece of the hill that hung, as it were, over him. "Xury," says I,

laid it down then I loaded another gun with two bullets and a third,

him go on shore* ^^Well, go," said I; so the boy jumped into the 
water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the 
other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of the 
piece to his ear, and shot him into the liead again, which dispatched 
him quite. 

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food ; and I was very sony 
to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good 
for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of hirp ; so 
he comes on board and asked me to give him the hatchet. '' Fot what, 
Xury ? " said I. " Me-cut off his head," said he. However Xury oould 
not cut off his head ; but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and 
it was a monstrous great one. I bethought myself, however, that per- 
haps tl;Le skin of him might, one way or other, be of some value to us; 
and I resolved to take off his skin, if I could. So Xury and I went to 
work with him : but Xury was much the better workman at it, for I 
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole day ; 
but at last we got off the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of 
our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards 
served me to lie upon. 

After this stop, we made -on to the southward continually, for ten or 
twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to 
abate very much, and going no oftener into the shore than we were 
obliged to for fresh water. My design in this, was to make the river 
Gambia, or Senegal ; that is to say, any where about the Cape de Yerd, 
where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship : and if I did 
not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, 
or perish among the Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, 
which sailed either to the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East 
Indies, made this Cape, or those islands : and in a word I put the whole 
of my fortune upon this single point, either that I must meet with some 
ship, or must perish. 

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have 
said, I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and in two or three 
places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at 
us : we could also perceive they were quite black and stark naked. 
I was once inclined to have gone on shore to them ; but Xury was my 
better counsellor, and said to me, ** No go, no go." However, I hauled in 
nearer the shore, that I might talk to them ; and I found they ran along 



tlOBINBON CBU60B. 25 

the shore by me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in their 

bands, except one, who had a long slender stick, which Xmy said was a 

lance, and that they would throw them a great way with good aim ; so 

I kept at a distance, hut talked to them by signs, as well as I could, and 

particularly made signs for something to ^at. They beckoned to me to 

stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat : upon this I lowered 

the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country, 

and in less than half-an-hour came back and brought with them two 

pieces of dry flesh and some com, such as is the produce of their country : 

kt we neither knew what the one or the other was ; however, we were 

▼illing to accept it. But how to come at it was our next dispute, for 

1 was not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as much afraid 

of lis : but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the 

shore, and laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till we 

fetched it on board, and then ciEune close to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them 

amends: but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them 

wonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore, came two mighty 

creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury, from 

the mountains towards the sea : whether it was the male pursuing the 

female, or whether they were in sport or in rage we could not teU, any 

more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange ; but I believe it 

was the latter, because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom 

appear but in the night ; and, in the second place, we found the people 

terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that had the lance, 

or dart, did not fly from them, but the rest did ; however, as the two 

creatures ran directly into the water, they did not seem to offer to fall 

opon any of the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam 

abont, as if they had come for their diversion. At last, one of them began 

to come nearer our boat than I at first expected ; but I lay ready for him, 

fer I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury 

load both the others. As soon aa be came fairly within my reach, I fired, 

and shot him directly into the head : immediately he sunk down into the 

water, but rose instantly, and plxmged up and down, as if he was struggling 

for life, and so indeed he was : he immediately made to the shore ; but 

between the wound which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the 

water, he died just before he reached the shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at 



26 ADVBNTUBES OF 

the noise and fire of my gun. Some of them were ready even to die 
for fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when they saw 
the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them 
to come to the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and began to 
search for the creature. I fqund him by his blood staining the water; 
and by the help of a rope, which I slung round him^ and gave the 
Kegroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it was a 
most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree ; and the 
Kegroes held up their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had 
killed him with. 

The other creature, frighted with the fla^h of fire and the noise of 
the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from 
whence they came ; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. 
I found quickly the Negroes were for eating the fiesh of this creature, so 
I was willing to have them take it as a favour from me ; which, when I 
made signs to them that they might take him, they were very thankful 
for. Immediately they fell to work with him ; and though they had no 
knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as 
readily, and much more readily than we could have done with a knife. 
They offered me some of the fiesh, which I declined, making as if I 
would give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave me 
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provisions, which, 
though I did not understand, yet I accepted. Then I made signs to them 
for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom 
upwards, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. 
They called immediately to some of their friends, and there came two 
women, and brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I sup- 
pose, in the sun ; this they set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury 
on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women were as 
stark naked as the men. 

I was now furnished with roots and com, such as it was, and water ; 
and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days 
more, without offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a 
great length into the sea at about the distance of four or five leagues 
before me ; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing, to make 
this point. At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from the 
land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward : then I concluded, 
as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Yerd, and those 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 27 

tiie islands called, from thence, Cape de Yerd Islands. However, they 
were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best to do ; 
for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach one 
nor the other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensiye, I stepped into the cabin, and 
8at me down, Xury haying the helm ; when, on a sudden, the boy cried 
out, " Master, master, a ship with a sail ! " and the foolish boy was frighted 
out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships 
sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their 
reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the 
fihipi but what she was, viz., that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I 
thou^it, was bound to the Coast of Guinea for Negroes. But, when I 
observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound 
some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore : 
upon which I stretched out to sea as much sis I could, resolving to speak 
with them, if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come 
in their way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any 
signal to them; but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to 
despair, they, it seems, saw me, by the help of their perspective glasses, 
and that it was some European boat, which they supposed must •belong 
to some ship that was lost ; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I 
was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ancient on board, 
1 made a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both 
which they saw ; for they told me they saw the smoke, though they did 
not tear the gun. Upon these signals, they very kindly brought to, 
snd lay by for me ; and in about three hours' time I came up with 
them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in 
French, but I understood none of them ; but, at last, a Scotch sailor, who 
was on board, called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was an 
Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors at 
Sallee : t^en they bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, 
and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe^ that I 
was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable, and almost 
hopeless, condition as I was in ; and I immediately offered all I had to 
the captain of t^e ship, as a return for my deliverance ; but he generously 



28 ABYBNTUBES OF 

told me lie would take nothing £rom me, but that all I had should be 
delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils. '' For," says he, '' I haTe 
saved yonr life on no other terms than I would be glad to be saved 
myself; and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken np in Hie 
same condition. Besides, said he, when I carry you to the Brazils, so 
great a way from your own country, if I should take from you what you 
have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away that life 1 
have given. Ko, no, Seignior Inglese" (Mr. EngUshman), says he,. '' I will 
carry you thither in charity, and these things will help to buy your sub- 
sistence there, and your passage home again." 

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the perform- 
ance, to a tittle : for he ordered the seamen, that none should offer to 
touch any thing I had : then he took every thing into his own posses- 
sion, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might have 
them, even so much as my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one ; and that he saw, and told me | 
he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and asked me what I would 
have for it? I told him, he had been so generous to me in every thing, 
that I could not offer to make any price of the boat, but lefb it entirely to 
him : upon which he told me he would give me a note of his hand to pay 
me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil ; and when it came there, if any 
one offered to give more, he would make it up. He offered me also sixty 
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take ; not 
that i was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very loUi 
to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in pro- 
curing my own. However, when I let him know my reason, he owned 
it to be just, and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy 
an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon 
this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the captain I 
have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay de 
TodoB los Santos, or AU Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two days after. 
And now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all 
conditions of life ; and what to do next with myself I was now to 
consider. 

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough 
remember : he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty 
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had

in the boat, and caused every thing I had in the ship to be pnnctaally 
deliyeied to me ; and what I was willing to sell he l>ought, such as the 
ease of bottles, two of my gons, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, 
-for I had made candles of the rest : in a word, I made about two 
hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo ; and with this stock, 
1 went on shore in the Brazils,

HAT) not been long here, but being recommended by the captain 
to the house of a good honest man, like himself, who had an * 
ingcnio as they call it — ^that is, a plantation and a sugar-honse, 
— I lived with him some time, and acquainted myself, by that 
means, with the manner of planting and of making sugar : and seeing 
how well the planters lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, 
if I could get licence to settle there, I would turn planter among 
them ; resolving, in the meantime, to find out some way to get my 
money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. . To this purpose, 
getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land 
that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my 
plantation and settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the 
stock which I proposed to myself to receive from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bom of "RTiglish 
parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I 
was. I call him neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, 
and we went on very sociably together. My stock was but low as well 
as his, and we rather planted for food than any thing else, for about two 
years. However, we began to increase, and otir land began to come 
into order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made 
each of us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to 
come ; but we both wanted help, and now I found, more than before, I 
had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury. 

But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no great 



B0BINS02T CBUBOE. 31 

vender. I had no remedy, but to go on : I was gotten into an employ- 
ment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I 
delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's house and broke 
tbron^ all his good advice: nay, I was coming into the very middle 
station, or upper degree of low life, which my father advised me to 
before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as well have 
staid at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world, as I had 
doDe : and I used often to say to myself, I could have done this as well 
in England, among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off 
to do «it among strangers and savages, in a wilderness, and at such a 
distance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the least 
bowledge of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost 
RfSret I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; 
BO work to be done but by the labour of my hands ; and I used to say, I 
lired just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had 
Qobody there but himself. But how just has it been ! and how should 
all men reflect that, when they compare their present conditions with 
others that are worse, heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and 
be convinced of their former felicity by their experience. I say, how just 
basit been that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island of 
mere desolation, should be my lot, who had so often imjustly compared 
it with the life which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had, in 
all probability, been exceeding prosperous and rich. 

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the 
plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up 
It sea, went back (for the ship remained there, in providing his loading, 
snd preparing for his voyage, near three months) when telling him what 
little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this Mendly and 
sinoere advice : '' Seignior Inglese," says he (for so he always called me), '* if 
yon will give me letters, and a procuration here in form to me, with 
coders to the person who has your money in London to send your effects 
to Lisbon to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are 
proper for this country, I will biing you the produce of them, God 
willing, at my return ; but since human affairs are all subject to changes 

■ 

and disasters, I would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds, 
sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for 
the first, 00 that, if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way ; 



1 



32 ADYBNTUBBS 0^ 

and, if it miscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for p^ 
your supply." 

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could 
not but be convinced it was the best course I could take ; so I accordingly 
prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I bad left my money, and 
a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a fiill account of all my adven- 
tures, — ^my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese 
captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was 
now in, with all other necessary directions for my supply : and whip this 
honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English 
merchants there^ to send over, not the order only, but a fiill account of 
my story to a merchant at London, who represented it e£fectually to her: 
whereupon she not only delivered the money, but, out of her own pocket, 
sent the Portuguese captain a very handsome present for his humanity 
and charity to me. 

The merchant in London vested this hundred pounds in English 
goods, such as the captain had writ for, sent them directly to him at 
Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me at the Brazils : among which, 
without my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of 
them), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, 
necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me. 

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I was 
surprised with joy of it ; and my good steward, the captain, had laid 
out the five pounds which my Mend had sent him for a present for 
himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant under •bond for six 
years' service, and would not accept of any consideration, except a little 
tobacco, which I would have him accept, being of my own produce. 

Neither was this all : but my gqoda being all English manufactures, 
such as cloths, stu£fs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable 
in the country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage ; so 
that I may say, I had more than four times the value of my first cargo, 
and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advance- 
ment of my plantation ; for the first thing I did, I bought me a Negro 
slave, and a European servant also — ^I mean another besides that which the 
captain brought me from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our 
greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with great 



ROBINSON CRU60B. 33 

in my plantation : I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own 
d, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neigh- 
and these fifty rolls, being each of above one hundred pounds 
ight, were well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from 
n. And now, increasing^ in business and in wealth, my head began 
be full of projects and undertakings beyond my reach ; such as are, 
leed, often the ruin of the best heads in business. 
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for all the 
liappy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father so earnestly 
recommended a quiet retired life, and which he had so sensibly described 
^ middle station of life to be full of : but other things attended me, and 
I was still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries; and, par- 
tieularly, to increase my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, 
which in my future sorrows I should have leisure to make, all these 
ouscarriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to my 
foohfih inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination in 
eantradiction to the clearest views of doing myself good in a fair and 
^ l^ain pursuit of those prospects, and those measures of life, which nature 
- \ and Providence concurred to present me with, and to make my duty. 

Ab I had once done thus in breaking away from, my parents, so I could 
not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of 
being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a 
FMh and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing 
-I admitted; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of 
i'\ boman misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent 
^- 1 irith life and a state of health, in the world. 
J To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this part of my 
stoiy : you may suppose, that having nOw lived almost four years in the 
Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plan- 
tation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted ac- 
quaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among 
the merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port ; and that, in my 
discourse among them, I had frequently given them an account of my 
two voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the 
Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast, for trifles — 
rach as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — 
aot only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, etc., but Negroes, for 
tbe aendoe of the BraziLs, in great numbers.

case of my death, making the captain of the ship that had saved my life, as 
before, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my e£fects as I 
bad directed in my -will, — one half of the produce being to himself, and the 
other to be shipped to England. 

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and to 
keep up my plantation : had I used half as much prudence to have looked 
into my own iaterest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have 
done and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so 
prosperous an xmdertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving 
drcmnstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common 
luuards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular mis- 
fortones to myself. 

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy, 
rather than my reason : and accordingly, the -ship being fitted out and the 
cargo famished, and all things done as by agreement by my partners in 
the voyage, I went oh board in an evil hour again, the first of September, 
1659, being the same day eight years that I went from my father and 
mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool 
to my own interest. 

Oar ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six 
gans and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself : we had 
on board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our 
trade with the Kegroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd trifles, 
especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like. 

The same day I went on board, we set sail, standing away to the north- 
ward ux>on our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African 
coast, when they came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, 
which, it seems, was the manner of their course in those days. We had 
very good weather, only excessive hot, aU. the way upon our own coast, 
tiU we came to the height of Cape St. Augastino ; from whence, keeping 
£nther off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound 
for the isle Eemando de Koronha, holding our course N. E. by N. and 
kaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed the Line in 
about twelve days' time, and were, by our last observation, ia seven 
degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or 
hniricane, took us quite out of our knowledge : it began from the south- 
east, came about to the north-west, and then settled in the north-east, 
inHn whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days 



36 IDYSirrURBS OF 

together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, kt 
it carry ua whither ever fate and the fury of the winds directed ; and, 
during these twelve days, I need not say that I expected every da^ to 
be swallowed up, nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save tibeir 
lives. 

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our 
men died of the calenture, and one man and a boy washed overboard. 
About the twelfkh day, the weather abating a little, the master made an 
observation as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven 
degrees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude 
difBwence, west from Cape St. Augnstino ; io that he foxmd he was gotten 
upon the coast of Guyana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the nv^ 
Amazons, toward that of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the Great 
Biver, and began to consult with me what course he should take, for the 
ship was leaky and very much disabled, and he was goin^ directly back 
to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against Hist ; and looking over the charts of the sear 
coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited country 
for us to have recourse to, till we came within the circle of the Caribbec 
islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes, which, bj 
keeping off at sea to avoid the' indrafb of the bay or gulf of Mexico, W€ 
might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days^ sail,'— whereas 
we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of AMea without 
some asistance, both to our ship and to ourselves. 

With this deagn, we changed our course, and steered away N. W. by 
W. in order to reach some of our EngHsh islands, where I hoped foi 
relief: but our voyage was otherwise determined, for being in the latitude 
of twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came upon us, which 
carried us away with the seme impetuosity westward, and drove us so out 
of 1^ very way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives been saved 
as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than 
ever returning to our own country. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men 
early in the morning, cried out, Land ! and we had no sooner nm out d 
the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we 
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being 
so stopped, the sea broke over her ia such a manner that we expected we 
should all have perished immediately ; and we were immediately driven 



ROBINSON CRUBOB. 37 

into our doee quartezs, to shelfer us from the very foam and spray of 
the sea. 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to 
deKiibe or conceive the consternation of men in such circnmstances : we 
knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven, 
whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and 
•8 the rage of the wind was still gr^at, though rather less than at first, 
we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes 
without breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, 
dumld turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking one upon 
mother, and expecting death every moment, and every man acting 
accordingly, as preparing for another world ; for there was little or nothing 
more for us to do in this. That which was our present comfort, and all 
the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did 
not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate. 

Now, thou^ we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship 
lisTing thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect 
her getting o£E^ we were in a dreadfdl condition indeed, and had nothing 
to do, but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. We had a 
boat at our stem just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing 
agaiost the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke away, and 
either sunk, or was driven off to sea ; so there was no hope from her. 
We had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a 
doubtful thing ; however, there was no room to debate, for we fancied the 
ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us she was 
actually broken already. 

In this distress the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat, and, with 
the help of the rest of the men, they got her slung over the ship's side ; 
and, getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in 
omnber, to God's mercy and the wild sed; for though the storm was 
abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, 
and might well be called d&n mid zeSy as the Dutch call the sea in a 
itonn. 

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw plainly 
that the sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we 
should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none; nor, 
if we had, could we have done anything with it, so we worked at the oar 
towards tiie land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution ; 



38 ADVENTURES OP 

for we all knew that when the boat came nearer the shore, she would 
be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we 
committed our souls to God in the most earnest manner, and the wind 
driving us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own 
hands, pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the shore was — whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal— 
we knew not ; the only hope that cpuld rationally give us the least shadow 
of expectation was, if we might happen into some bay or gul^ or the 
mouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run our boat 
in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. 
But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and 
nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, 
as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of 
us, and plainly bid us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it took us 
with such fury, that it overset the boat at once ; and separating us, as 
well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, 
" Ood !" for we were all swallowed up in a moment. 

Jfothing can describe the conftision of thought which I felt, when 
I sunk into the water ; for though I swam very well, yet I could not 
deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having 
driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and 
having spent itself, went back and left me upon the land almost dry, but 
half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, 
as well as breath left, that, seeing myself nearer the main land than I 
expected, I got upon my feet and endeavoured to make on towards the 
land as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take me up 
again ; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it, for I saw the sea 
come after me as high as a great hill, and as fririous as an enemy which 
I had no means or strength to contend with : my business was to hold my 
breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could, and so, by swimming, 
to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible ; 
my greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would carry me a great 
way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again 
with it when it gave back towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty 
foot deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty 
force and swiftness towards the shore, a very great way ; but I held my 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 39 

fareath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might. I 
WB8 ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising 
iq), 80, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out 
aboTe the surface of the water ; and though it was not two seconds of 
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me 
breath and new courage. I was covered again with water a good while, 
bat not so long but I held it out; and finding the water had spent 
itself and began to return, I struck forward against the return of the 
waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood stiU a few moments, 
to recover breath and till the water went from me, and then took to my 
heels and ran with what strength I had farther towards the shore. But 
neither would this deliver me from the ftiry of the sea, which came pour- 
ing in after me again ; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves ai^d 
carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat. 

The last time of these two had well near been fatal to me ; for the 
sea, having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me, 
against a piece of a rock, and that with such force as it left me senseless, 
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance ; for the blow, taking my 
side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body, and 
had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in the 
water ;• but I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and, seeing 
I should be covered again with water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece 
of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave wei^t back. 
Now as the waves were not so high as the first, being near land, I held 
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which brought 
me so near the shore that the next wave, though it went over me, yet 
did not so swallow me up as to carry me away ; and, the next run I took, 
I got to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the 
difBs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger and 
quite out of the reach of the water. 

I was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank 
God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was, some minutes 
before, scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express 
to the life what the ecstacies and transports of the soul are, when it is 
8o saved, as I may say, out of the grave ; and I do not wonder now at that 
custom, viz., that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, 
is tied up and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought 
to him, — I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to 



40

let Itim blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may 
not drive the animal spirita &om the heart, and overwhelm him : 
" for Midden joys, like griefi, confound at Ant" 
I walked about on the shoTc, liftiiig up my hands, and my wbole 
being, as I may say, wrapped np in the contemplation of my deliverance ; 




making a thousand gestures and motionfl, which I cannot describe ; reflect- 
ing upon all my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be 
one soul saved but myself, — for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, 
or any sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes 
that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and fnih of 
the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay ao far off, and con- 
sidered, Lord ! how was it possible I could get on shore ? 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 41 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condi- 
tioQf I began to look round me, to see what kind of a place I was in, and 
what was next to be done ; and I soon found my comforts abate, and 
that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance ; for I was wet, had no 
clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink, to comfort me ; 
neither did I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with 
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts : and that which was parti- 
cularly afflicting to me was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and 
kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other 
creature that might desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing 
about mo but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco m a box. ' This 
was all my provision ; and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, 
that, for a while, I run about like a madman, l^ight coming upon me, I 
began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my lot if there 
were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night they always 
come abroad for their prey. 

All the 'remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was to get 

up into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but thorny — which grew near mc, 

and where I resolved to sit all night — and consider the next day what 

death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about 

a furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, 

which I did, to my great joy, and having drunk, and put a little tobacco 

in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into 

it, endeavoured to place myself so as that, if I should sleep, I might 

not fall ; and having cut me a short stick like a truncheon, for my 

defence, I took up my lodging, and, having been excessively fatigued, 

I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have 

done in my condition, and found myself the most refreshed with it that I 

tliink I ever was on such aiU occasion.

thereat. 




^"KEN I -waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and 
the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell 
as before ; but that which surprised me most was, that 
the ship was liffced off in the night from the sand where 
she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven np almost as far 
as the rock which I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by 
the dashing me against it. This being within about a mile from the 
shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished 
myself on board, that at least I might save some necessary things for 
my use. ' 

"When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about 
me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind 
and the sea had tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my right 
hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her, but 
found a neck, or inlet, of water between me and the boat, which was about 
half a mile broad ; so I came back for the present, being more intent 
upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present 
subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed 
so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship ; and 
here I found a fresh renewing of my grief, for I saw evidently that, if 



B0BIN80N CRUSOB. 43 

we liad kept on board, we had all been safe — ^that is to say, we bad 

all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left 

eotiiely destitute of all comfort and company as I now was. This forced 

tears from my eyes again, but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, 

if possible, to get to the ship ; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather 

was hot to extremity, and took the water : but when I came to the ship, 

my difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board, for as she 

lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing within my 

reach to lay hold of. I swam roimd her twice, and the second time I 

spied a small piece of rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hang 

down by the fore-chains, so low as that with great difficulty I got hold of 

it, and by the help of that rope got into the forecastle of the ship. Here 

I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her 

hold ; but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather 

earth, and her stem lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost 

to the water. By this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in 

that part was dry ; for you may be sure my first work was to search and 

to see what was spoiled and what was free : and first I found that all the 

diip's proyisions were dry and untouched by the water ; and being very 

well disposed to eat, I* went to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with 

biscuit, and eat it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose. 

I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, 

and which I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for what was before 

me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to fiimiah myself with many 

tilings which I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and 
tiiis extremity roused my application; we had several spare yards, and 
two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship. 
I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung as many of them overboard 
88 I could manage of their weight, tying every one with a rope, that 
they might not drive away. When this was done, I went down the 
ship's side, and, pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together at 
both ends, as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or 
three short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I foimd I could walk 
upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the 
pieces being too light ; so I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I 
cut a spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a 
great deal of labour and pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with 



44 ADVBNTUBBB OF 

necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to 
have done upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My 
next care was what to load it' with, and how to preserve what I laid 
upon it from the surf of the sea. But I was not long considering this. 
I first laid all the planks, or boards, upon it that I could get, and having 
considered well what I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests, 
which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my 
raft. The first of these I filled with provisions, viz., breads rice, three 
Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goats' flesh (which wo lived much 
upon), and a little remainder of European com which had been laid by 
for some fowls which we had brought to sea with us, but the fowls were 
killed. There had been some barley and wheat together, but, to my 
great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or 
spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging 
to our skipper, in which were some cordial waters, and, in all, about five 
or six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, there being no 
need to put them into the chests, nor no room for them. While I was 
doing this I found the tide began to flow, though very calm, and I had 
the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on 
shore upon the sand, swim away ; as for my breeches, which were only 
linen and open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings. 
However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found 
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had 
other things which my eye was more upon, as first, tools to work with on 
shore ; and it was after long searching that I found out the carpenter's 
chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much more 
valuable than a ship loading of gold would have been at that time. I got 
it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into 
it, for I knew in general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two 
very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols; these I 
secured first, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two 
old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, 
but knew not where our gunner had stowed them, but with much search 
I found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water. 
Those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now I thought myself 
pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with

tiiem, having neither sail, oar, nor rodder ; and the least capfol of wind 
¥oa]d have oyexset all my navigation. 

1 had thre^ encouragements : 1. A smooth, calm sea^ 2. The tide 
rising, and setting in to the shore. 3. What little wind there was 
blew me towards the land. And thus^ having found two or three 
broken oars ])elonging to the boat, and, besides, the tools which were 
in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer ; and with this 
offgo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well, 
only that I found it drive a little distant from the place where I had 
landed before, by which I perceived that there was some indraft of the 
viter, and consequently I hoped to find some creek or river there^ which 
I ffli^t make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo. 

Ab I imagined, so it was : there appeared before me a little opening of 
the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it ; so I guided 
nj r&ft as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream. But here 
1 had like to have sufEered a second shipwreck, which, if I h£(d, I think 
lerfly wDuld have broke my heart ; for, knowing nothing of the coast, my 
nft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground 
at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off 
towBids that end that was afloat, and so fjEdlen into the water. I did my 
ntmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep them in their 
{daces, but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength ; neither 
doEBt I stir from the posture I was in, but holding up the chests with all 
mj might, stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time the 
rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level ; and a little 
after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off 
widi the oar I had into the channel, and then, driving up higher, I at 
length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, 
od t stzong current or tide running up* I looked on both sides for 
apioper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high 
op the liver, hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore 
i^lved to place myself as near the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which, 
^tii great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last got so near 
* tiiflt, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directiy in ; but 
We I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again, for that 
^ore lying pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to land, 
htt where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and 



46 ADTBNTtJBBS OF 

the other siiik lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. 
All that I conld do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping 
the rafb with my oar, like an anchor ^ to hold the side of it fast to the 
shore, near a flat piece of ground which I expected the water wonid flow 
over ; and so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew 
about a foot of water, I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and 
there fastened, or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into the 
ground, one on one side near one end, and one on the other side near the 
other end ; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and 
all my cargo safe on shore. 

My next work was to view the coimtry, and seek a proi)er place for 
my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure them from what- 
ever might happen. Where I was I yet knew not; whether on the 
continent or on an island, whether inhabited or not inhabited, whether in 
danger of wild beasts or not. There was a hiU, not above a mile from 
me, which 'rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop 
some other hiUs, which lay as in a ridge from it northward. I took out 
one of the fowling-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, 
and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill, where, 
after I had with great labour and difficulty got up to the top, I saw my 
fate, to my great affliction, viz., that I was in an island environed every 
way with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks which lay a 
great way o£^ and two small islands, less than this, which lay about three 
leagues to the west. 

I foimd also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good 
reason to believe, xminhabited, except by wild beasts, of whom, however, 
I saw none ; yet I saw abimdance of fowls, but knew not their kinds, 
neither when I killed them could I teU what was flt for food and what 
not. At my coming back I shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon 
a tree on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the flrst gun that had 
been fired there since the creation of the world : I had no sooner fired, 
but frx)m all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number of 
fowls, of many sorts, making a confused screaming, and crying eveiy 
one according to his usual note ; but not one of them of any kind that I 
knew. As for that creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its 
colour aiiid beak resembling it, but had no talons or daws more than 
common. Its flesh was carrion and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to 



B0BIN80N CBUSOB. 47 

inok to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day; 
▼hat to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, 
&r I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing hut some wild 
beast might deyoui^me, though, as I afterwards found, there was really 
no need for those fears. 

However, as well as I could, I bamcadoed myself roxmd with the 
ehests and boards that I had brought on shore, aud made a kind of a hut 
£ol that ni^t's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to supply 
myself^ except that I had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out 
of the wood where I shot the fowl. 

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out 
of the ship which would be useM to me, and particularly some of the 
rigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land ; and I 
resolyed to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. And, as I 
knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, 
I resolved to set all other things apart till I got every thing out of the sl\ip 
that I could get. Then I called a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, 
whether I should take back the raft, but this appeared impracticable ; so 
I resolved to go, as before, when the tide was down, and I did so, only that 
I stripped before I went from my hut, having nothing on but a chequered 
diiit and a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft; and 
having had experience of the first, I neither made this so imwieldy, nor 
loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful to 
me : as, first, in the carpenter's stores, I foimd two or three bags fall of nails 
and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above all, 
that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured together, 
▼iUi several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two or three 
mm. crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another 
fowliQg-piece, with some small quantity of powder more, a large bag full 
of mudl shot, and a great roll of sheet lead ; but this last was so heavy I 
could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find, and 
& spare fore-topsail, hammock, and some bedding ; and with this I loaded 
my second raft, and brought them all safe on shore to my veiy great 
comfort 

I was under some apprehensions, during my absence from the land, that 
>t least my provisions mi^t be devoured on shore ; but, when I came back, 



ADTBHTTTItBa 0? 







I fonnd no ngn of any TisitoP, iHily there eat a aeatnre like a vild cat 
upon one of the chesta, which, when I came towards it, ran away a littit 
distance and then stood still. She eat very composed and unconcerned, 
and looked tuH in my face, es if she hod a mind to be acquainted witii 
me. I presented my gun at hor, but, aa she did not understand it she 
was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away, npoi 
which I tossed her a bit (^ biscuit, thongh, by the way, I was not verj 
free of it, for my Eitore was not great ; however, I spared her a bit, I say 



BOBINBON CBUSOB. 49 

and she went to it, smelled of it, and eat it, and looked, as pleased, for 
more ; bat I thanked her, and could spare no more, so she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore — ^though I was fain to open the 
banels of powder and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy, 
bemg large casks, — I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail 
and some poles which I cut for that purpose, and into this tent I brought 
evoy thing that I knew would spoil, either with rain or sun ; and I piled 
aQ the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it 
from any sudden attempt either from man or heast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some 
bonds within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and, spreading 
one €i the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, 
nd my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept 
very quietly all night ; for I was very weary and heavy, for the night 
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard aU day, as well to 
£etdi all those things from the ship as to get them on shore. 

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I 
believe, for one man ; but I was not satisfied still, for, while the ship sat 
tqirig^t in that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing out of her 
tbat I could : so eveiy day, at low water, I went on board and brought 
sway something or other; but particularly the third time I went, I 
bnmg^t away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small 
npes and rope*twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass, which 
was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder. 
In a word, I brought away all the sails, first and last, only that I was 
tun to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could ; for 
they were no more usefrd to be sails, but as mere canvass only. 

But that which comforted me more still was, that, at last of all, after I 
had made five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing 
one to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with, — I say, 
after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of 
nun or spirits, and a box of sugar and a barrel of fine flour ; this was 
niprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more provisions, 
except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of 
that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, 
vUdi I cat out ; and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered the 
^ of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables, 



50 ADTENTUBBB OF 

and cuttmg the great cable into pieces sncli as I could moYe, I got two 
cables and a hawser on shoiey with all the iron work I conld get ; and, 
haying cut down the spritsail-yard and the mizen-yaid, and every thing 
I could, to mflike a large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and 
came away : but my good luck began now to leave me ; for this rafb was so 
unwieldy and so overladen, that, after I was entered the little cove where I 
had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I 
did ttie other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. 
As for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore ; but as to 
my cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I 
expected would have been of great use to me. However, when the tide 
was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, 
thou^ with infinite labour ; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a 
work which fatigued me very much. After this I went eveiy day on 
board, and brought away what I could get. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven times on 
board the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of 
hands could well be supposed capable to bring ; though, I believe verily, 
had the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship, 
piece by piece ; but, preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found 
the wind began to rise. However, at low water, I went on board, and 
though I thou^t I had rummaged the cabin so effectually, as that 
nothing more could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in 
it, in one of which I foimd two or three razors, and one pair of large 
scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks ; in another 
I foimd about thirty-six poimds value in money, some European coin, 
some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. '' drug ! " said I aloud, 
'' what art thou good for ? .Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking 
off the ground ; one of those knives is worth all this heap : I have no 
manner of use for thee; e'en remain where thou art, and go to the 
bottx>m, as a creature whose Hfe is not worth saving.'' However, upon 
second thoughts, I took it away ; and, wrapping all this in a piece of 
canvass, I began to think of masting another raft ; but while I was pre- 
paring this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and 
in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently 
occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the 
wind off shore, and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of 



BOBINBON CBUSOB. 51 

lood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all. 
Aooordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam across the 
(bnnel which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with 
difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had about me, 
nd partly the roughness of the water ; for the wind rose very hastily, 
tad before it was quite high water it blew a storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my 
Tealth about me very secure. It blew yery hard all that night, and in 
tiie morning, when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be seen ! 
I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this satisfactory 
reflection, viz., that I had lost no time, .nor abated no diligence, to get 
tmythmg out of her that could be useful to me, and that, indeed, there 
▼as little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more 
time. 

I now gave over any moire thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of 
ber, except what might drive on shore from her wreck, as, indeed, 
divers pieces of her afterwards did ; but those things were of small use 
tome. 

' ICy thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against 
either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the 
idand ; and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and 
▼hat kind of dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the 
earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I resolved upon both, the 
manner and description of which it may not be improper to give an 
leoount of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particularly 
because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed 
it would not be wholesome ; and more particularly because there was no 
fresh water near it : so I resolved to find a more healthy and more con- 
Tenient spot of ground. 

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be 
proper for me : first, Health and fresh water I just now mentioned ; 
secondly, Shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, Security frt>m 
ravenous creatures, whether man or beast ; fourthly, A view to the sea, 
that if Ood sent any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my 
leliverance, for which I was not willing to banish all my expectation yet. 
In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side 
if a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house 



52 ADYBNTURBB OF 

aide, bo that nothing oonld come down upon me from the top. On the 
aide of this rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the 
entrance or door of a cave, but there was not really any cave, or way 
into the rock, at alL 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolyed to 
pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and 
about twice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and, at the end 
of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low grounds by the 
seaside. It was on the north-north-west side of the hill, so that it was 
sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a west-and-by-soutii 
sun, or thereabouts, which in those countries is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hoUow-place, 
which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and 
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and ending. 

In this half-drde I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them 
into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being 
out of the ground about five feet and a half^ and sharpened on the top : 
the two rows did not stand above six inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid 
them in rows, one upon another, within the drde between these two 
rows of stakes up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning 
against them, about two feet and a half hig^ like a spur to a post ; and 
this fence was so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it or 
over it. This cost me a great deal of time and labour, especially to cat 
the piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive them into the 
earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but by a 
short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted 
over after me, and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I 
thought, from all the world, and consequently slept secure in the ni^t, 
which otherwise I could not have done ; though, as it appeared after- 
wards, there was no need of all this caution fitnn the enemies that I 
apprehended danger from. 

luto this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my 
riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have the 
account above ; and I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me fh>mtiie 
rains that in one part of the year are very violent there, I made double, 
vis., one smaller tent witliin, and one larger tent above it> and oovered 



R0BIN60N CRUSOB. 53 

the uppenaoet with a large tarpaulin which. I had saved among the 
buIb. 

And now I lay no more, for a while, in the bed which I had brought 
on share, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and 
bekmged to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing that would 
^poil by the wet ; and having thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the 
entrance, which, till now, I had left open, and so passed and repassed, as 
I laid, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and, 
bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent, 
I laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it 
nuaed the ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made a cave, 
just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. 

It cost me much labour and many days, before all these things were 
lioiig^t to perfection ; and therefore I must go back to some other things 
wbich took up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, 
after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the 
cave, that a storm of rain fiEiIling from a thick, dark doud, a sudden flash 
of lightning happened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as is 
Hatorally the effect of it. I was not so much surprised with the light- 
ning as I was with a thought which darted into my mind as swift as the 
lightniug itself: Oh, my powder ! My very heart sunk within me when I 
thought, that at one blast, all my powder might be destroyed, on which, 
not my defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, entirely 
depended. I was nothing near so anxious about my own danger, though, 
bad the powder took Are, I had never known who had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the stonn was 
over, I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied 
myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a 
little and a little in a parcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might 
not all take fire at once ; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be 
possible to make one part fire another. I finished this work in about a 
fortnight, and I think my powder, which in all was about one hundred 
and forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than one hundred 
parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any 
danger from that ; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, 
I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the 



64 ADTBNTURES OF 

rocks, BO that no wet might come to it, Tnm-hing very carefully -when 
I laid it. 

In the interval of time while tliis was doing, I went out at least onoe 
every day with my gnn, as well to divert myself as to see if I could kiU 




any thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself with 
what the island produced. The first time I went out, I presently dis- 
covered that there were goats in the island, which was a great sataafao- 
tion to me ; but then it wu attended with this misfortune to me, vis., 
that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the 
most difScult thing in the world to come at tiiem : hut I was not dis- 
couraged at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it 
soon happened ; for, after I had found their haonta a little, I laid wait in 
this manner for them : I obaerred, if they saw me in the valleys, thon^ 



BOBINBON CRU60B. 55 

. ^ley were upon the rocks, they would nui away as in a terrible Mght ; 
\nX if they were feeding in the yaUeys, and I was upon the rocks, they 
took no notice of me ; from whence I condnded that, by the position of 
ttior optics, their sight was so directed downward that they did not 

• 

leadily see objects that were above them: so afterwards, I took this 
method — ^I always climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then 
bad frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made among these creatures, 
1 killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck 
to, which grieved me heartily ; but when the old one fell, the kid stood 
stock still by her, till I came and took her up ; and not only so, but when 
1 canied the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me 
quite to my enclosure, upon which I .laid down the dam, and took the 
kid in my arms and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up 
tune ; but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself. 
These two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I eat sparingly and 
iSTed my provisions, my bread especially, as much as possibly I could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to 
provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to bum ; and what I did for 
tiiat, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I 
shall give a full account of it in its place : but I must first give some 
li^e account of myself and of my thoughts about living, which, it may 
well be supposed, were not a few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition ; for, as I was not cast away 
upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite 
out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz., some 
hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I 
had great reason to consider it as a determination of Heaven that, in this 
desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The 
tears would run plentiMly down my face when I made these reflections, 
and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Providence should 
thus completely ruin its creatures, and render them so absolutely miser- 
able, — so without help abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could 
hardly be rational to be thankfrd for such a life. 

But frmething always returned swifb upon me to check these thoughts, 
and to reprove me ; and, particularly, one day walking with my gun in 
my hand by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my 
pfeseait condition, when reason, as it were, expostulated with me the 
other way, thus : '' Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true ; 



suosnce, and wliat would have be

sufSlcient quantity, and was in a fa 
a manner as to live without my gun 
so that I had a tolerable view of sul 
as I lived ; for I considered, from th 
for the accidents that might happen, 
even not only after my ammunition s 
health or strength should decay. 

I confess, I had not entertained a

'T was, by my account^ the 30th of September, when, in the 
maimer as above said, I first set foot upon this horrid island, — 
when the sun, being to ns in its autumnal equinox, was 
almost just over my head ; for I reckoned myself, by observa- 
tion, to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes north of 
the line. 

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my 
thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, 
and pen and ink, and should even forget the sabbath days from the 
working days; but, to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a 
large post, in capital letters, and making it into a great cross, I set 
it np on the shore where I first landed, viz., '^ I came on shore here 
tbe 30th of September, 1659." Upon the sides of this square post I 
cat every day a notch with my knife, and every seventh notch was 
aa long again as the rest, and every first day of the month as long again 
aa tiiat long one ; and thus I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, 
and yearly reckoning of time. 

In the next place, we are to observe that among the many things 
wbich I brought out of the ship, in tbe several voyages which, as above 
mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not at 
all leas usefdl to me, which I omitted setting down before, as, in par- 
ticolar, pens, ink, and paper; several parcels in the captain's, mate's, 
gunner's, and carpenter's keeping ; three or four compasses, some mathe- 
nuitical instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation ; 
bU which I huddled together, whether I might want them or no : also 



68 ADYBNTURBB 07 

I found three very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargor from 
England, and which I had packed up among my things ; some Porta- 
guese books also, and, among them, two or three Popish prayer books, 
and several other books, all which I carefidly secured. And I nmst 
not forget that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose enunent 
history I may have occasion to say something in its place ; for I canied 
both the cats with me, and, as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship 
himself and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore with 
my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years. I wanted 
nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make 
up to me ; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not 
do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I husbanded 
them to the utmost ; and I shall show that, while my ink lasted, I kept 
things very exact, but, after that was gone, I could not, for I could 
not make any ink by any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding 
all that I had amassed together ; and of these, this of ink was one, as 
also spade, pickaxe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth ; needles, 
pins, and thread. As for linen, I soon learned to want that without 
much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily, and it 
was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, 
or surrounded habitation. The piles, or stakes, which wer^ as heavy 
as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in the 
woods, and more by far in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes 
two days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a thiid 
day in driving it into the ground; for which purpose, I got a hesTj 
piece of wood at first, hyit at last bethought myself of one of the iron 
crows, which, however, though I found it, yet it made driving thoee 
posts, or piles, very laborious and tedious work. But what need I haTe 
been concerned at the tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I 
had time enough tQ do it in? Kor had I any other employment, if that 
had been over, at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the 
island to seek for food, which I did, more or less, every day. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstance 
I was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, 
not so much to leave them to any that were to come after me (for I 
was like to have but few heirs), as to deliver my thoughts from daily 



BOBINBON CRUBOB. 69 

pamig upon Hiem, and afflicting my mind : and, as my reason began 
now to master my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as 
I oonld, and to set the good against the evil, that I might have something 
to difltrngmsh my case from worse ; and I stated it very impartially, 
Hke debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries 
I suffered, thus: 

STIL. GOOD. 

I im cast upon a horrible, desolate island, But I am alive ; and am not drowned, 
void of all hope of recorery. as all my ship's company was. 

I am singled ont and separated, as it But I am singled out, too, from aU the 
icie, from all the world, to be miserable. ship's crew, to be spared from death ; and 

He that miraculously sared me from death, 
can deliver me from this condition.

had clothes, I could hardly wear them. 

I am without any defence, or means to But I am cast on an island, where I see 
nuX any violence of man or beast. no wild beast to hurt me, as I saw on the 

coast of Africa ; and what if I had been 
shipwrecked there } 

I hare no soul to speak to, or relieve me. But God wonderfully sent the ship in 

near enough to the dtiore, that I have 
gotten out so many necessary things as will 
either supply my wants, or enable me to 
supply myself, even as long as I live. 

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that there was 
•caroe any condition in the world so miserable, but there was something 
oegstive, or something positive, to be thankM for in it ; and let this 
itand as a direction, from the experience of the most miserable of all 
eonditions in this world, that we may always find in it something to 
oomfort ourselTes from, and to set, in the descriptidn of good and evil, 
on the credit side of the account. 

Haying now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and 
giren oyer looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship, — I say, giving 
oyer these things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my way 
of living, and to make things as easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent imder 
the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables; 
but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up 



60 ADVBNTURBS OP - 

against it of tuifs, about two feet thick on the ontsidei and after some- 
time (I think it was a year and half) I raised rafters from it, leaning* 
to the rock| and thatched, or coyered, it with boughs of trees and sucb 
things as I could get, to keep out the rain, which I found, at some 
times of the year, very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, 
and into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe, 
too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in 
no order, so they took up all my place : I had no room to torn myself^ so 
I set myself to enlarge my cave and works farther into the earth ; for it 
was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on 
it : and so when I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked 
sideways, to the right hand, into the rock, and then taming to the ri^t 
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside 
of my pale or fortification. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were a back way to 
my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things 
as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table ; for without 
these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world,-* 
I could not write, or eat, or do several things, with so much pleasoie, 
without a table. 

So I went to work ; and here I must needs observe that, as reason 
is the substance and original of the mathematics, so, by stating and 
squaring every thing by reason, and by making the most rational judg- 
ment of things, every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic 
art I had never handled a tool in my life ; and yet, in time, by labour, 
application, and contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted nothing but 
I could have made it, especially if I had had tools. However, I made 
abundance of thingi^, even without tools, and some with no more tools 
than an adze and a hatchet, which, perhaps, were never made that way 
before, and that with infinite labour. For example, if I wanted a board, 
I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me, 
and hew it flat on either side with my axe, till I had brought it to be as 
thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by 
this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree ; but this I 
had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for the prodigious 
deal of time and labour which it took m^ up to make a plank or board : 



BOBINBON CRUSOB. 61 

tot my time or labour waa little worth, and so it was as well employed 
one way as another. 

• However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the 
fint place— and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought 
on my raft from the ship. Bnt when I had wrought out some boards, as 
abore, I made large shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over 
mother, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and 
inm-work, and, in a word, to separate every thing at large in their 
places, that I might easily come at them. I knocked pieces into the wall 
of the rock, to hang my guns, and all things that would hang up. 

So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a general maga- 
ime of all necessary things ; and I had everything so ready at my hand, 
^ it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order, and 
especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great. 

And now it was when I began to keep a journal of every day's 
employment ; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much a huiry, and not 
only hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind, and my 
joomal would have been fidl of many dull things ; for example, I must 
have said thus — "Stpt. 30th. — ^After I got to shore, and had escaped 
drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, having 
fizst vomited with the great quantity of salt water which was gotten into 
my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wring- 
ing my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery, 
and crying out, I was undonoi undone ! till, tired and faint, I was forced 
to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not sleep, for fear of 
being devoured." 

Somedaysaftertiiis, and after I had been on board the ship and got all 
{hat I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of 
a little mountain and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship ; then 
fimey at a vast distance I spied a sail— please myself with the hopes of 
it,— emd then, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, 
and sit down and weep like achild, and thus increase my misery by my folly. 
Bat, having gotten over these things in some measure, and having 
settled my household stuff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, 
and all as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal,— of 
wliich I shall here give you the copy (though in it wiU be told all these 
pttticolarB over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I 
foroed to leave it ofL

THE JOURNAL. 

September 30, 1659.— >I, poor miserable Eobinsoe Crusoe, being ship' 
wrecked during a dreadM storm in the offing, came on shore on thi0 
dismal Tmfortanate island, which I called the Islajtd of Despaib, all 
the rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead* 
All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circun* 
stances I was brought to, yiz., I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, 
nor place to fly to, and, in despair of any relief saw nothing but deatii 
before me, either that I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by 
savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the approach of night 
I slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly, though it 
rained all night. 

Oetohw 1. — In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship 
had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much 
nearer the island; which, as it was some comfort on one hand (for 
seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind 
abated, I might get on board, and get some food and necesskries out 
of her for my relief), so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief at 
the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all staid on boarcL 
might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they would not have been 
all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men been saved, we 
might, perhaps, have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to 
have carried us to some other part of the world. I spent great part 
of this day in perplexing myself on these things ; but, at length, seeing 
the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and 
then swam on board. This day also it continued raining, though with 
no wind at all. 

Prom the lit of Oetoh&r to the 24th. — ^All these days entirely spent in 
many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I brought 
on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in these days, 
though with some intervals of fair weather ; but it seems this was the 
rainy season. 

Oct, 20. — I overset my rafb and all the goods I had got upon it, but 
being in shoal water, and the things being, chiefly heavy, I recovered 
mai^y of them when the tide was out. 

Oct, 25, — It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind; 



ROBINSON CRU80B. 63 

dming which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little 
liaider than before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her, 
and that only at low water. I spent this day in coTering and securing 
the goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them. 

Od, 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place 
to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from auy attack 
in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night I fixed 
upon a proper place, under a rock, aud marked out a semicircle for my 
encampment, which I resolye to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortifi- 
ation, made of double piles, lined within with cable, and without with 
tnl 

From the 26th to the SOthy I worked very hard in carrying all my 
goods to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained 
exceeding hard. 

The dl«^, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, 
to lee for some food aud discoTer the country, when I killed a she-goat, 
SDdher kid followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because it 
would not feed. 

NofMnher 1. — I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there fpT the 
fint night, making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing 
my hammock upon. 

Nov. 2. — I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber 
which made my rafts ; and with them formed a fence round me, a little 
within the place I had marked out for my fortification. 

iVbv. 3. — ^I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, 
which were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me 
a table. 

iVbv. 4.— This morning I began to order my times of work, of going 
oat with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion ; viz., every morn- 
ing I walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain ; 
then employed myself to work till about eleven o'clock ; then eat what 
I had to live on ; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather 
being excessive hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The 
working part of this day and the next were wholly employed in making 
my table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and 
necessity made me a complete natural mechanic qpon after, as I believe 
it would do any one else. 

Nov, 5. — This day I went abroad with my gun and dog, and killed 



64 ADYBNTURBS OP 

a wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing: erery 
creature I killed, I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming back 
by the seashore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls which I did not under- 
staud, but was suj*prised, and almost frighted, with two or three seals, 
which, while I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into 
the sea and escaped me for that time. 

Nov. 6. — ^After my morning walk, I went to work with my table 
again, and finished it, though not to my liking ; nor was it long befoie 
I learned to mend it. 

Nov. 7. — ^Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, Qtii, 
10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday, according to my 
reckoning), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado 
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me ; and, even in the 
making, I pulled it to pieces several times. — NoU. I soon neglected my 
keeping Sundays ; for, omitting my mark for them on my post, I forgot 
which was which. 

Nov. 13. — ^This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and 
cooled the earth; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and 
lightning, which frighted me dreadfrilly, for fear of my powder. As 
soon as it was over, I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as 
many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16.— >These three days I spent in making little square 
chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at 
most, of powder ; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places 
as secure and remote from one another as possible. On one of these 
three days I killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I know not 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. — ^This day I began to dig behind my tent, into the rook, to 
make room for my farther conveniency. — Note. Three things I wanted 
exceedingly for this work, viz., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, 
or basket ; so I desisted from my work, and began to consider how to 
supply that want, and make me some tools. Ab for a pickaxe, I made 
use of the iron crows, which were proper enough, though heavy ; but the 
next thing was a shovel or spade : this was so absolutely neceasaiy, that^ 
indeed, I could do nothing effectually without it, but what kind of one 
to make I knew not. . 

Nov. 18. — The next day, in searching the woods, Ifound a tree of tiiat 
wood, or like it, which, in the BraziU, they call the iron tree, for its 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 65 

exceeding hardness : of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my 
tie, I cut a piece, and brought it home, too, with difficulty enough, for 
it was exceeding heavy. The excessiye hardness of the wood, and having 
BO other way, made me a long while upon this machine ; for I worked it 
eifi^ctaally, by little and little, into the form of a shovel or spade, the 
\mdle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part 
lunring no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last me so long: 
lunrever, it served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put 
it to, but never was a shovel, I believe, made after that fashion, or so 
long a-making. 

I was still deficient; for I wanted a basket, or a wheelbarrow. A 
basket I could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs 
that would bend to make wicker- ware, at least none yet found out ; and 
as to the wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel, but that 
I had no notion of, neither did I know how to go about it ; besides, I had 
no possible way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axes of the 
wheel to run in ; so I gave it over : and so, for carrying away the earth 
which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the 
labonrerB carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. 

This was not so difficult to me as the making the shovel ; and yet 
this and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain to make a 
wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days,— I mean, always 
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom failed, and 
Tery seldom failed also of bringing home something fit to eat. 

2fo9, 23. — ^My other work having now stood still, because of my 

laaking these tools, when they were finished I went on, and working 

ereiy day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days 

entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my 

goods commodiously. — Note, During all this time, I worked to make this 

room, or cave, spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, or 

loagazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for a lodging, I 

kept to the tent ; except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it 

rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry, which caused me afker- 

wazds to cover all my place within my pale with long poles in the form 

of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large 

leaves of trees, like a thatch. 

Becember 10. — 1 began now to think my cave or vault finished ; when 
on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth 

6 



66 ADYBNTUBBB OF 

fell down from the top and one side— so much, that, in short, it 
me, and not without reason too ; for if I had been under it I had neyi 
wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster, I had a great deal of wo: 
to do over again, for I had the loose earth to carry out, and, which 
of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be 
no more would come down. 

Dee, 11. — This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got i9r<^ 
shores, or posts, pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of botfrd 
across over each post : this I finished the next day, and, setting mor^ 
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured ^ 
and the posts, standing in rows, served me for partitions to part off my 
house. 

Dee, 17. — From this day to the 20th, I placed shelves, and knockeci 
up nails on the posts, to hang every thing up that could be himg up ^ 
and now I began to be in some order within doors. 

Dec, 20. — ^Now I carried every thing into the cave, and began tc^ 
fiimish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a dresser, tc7 
order my victuals upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me ^ 
also I made me another table. 

Dec, 24. — Much rain all night and all day : no stirring out. 

Dee, 25. — ^Eain all day. 

Dec, 26. — No rain, and the earth much cooler than before, and. 
pleasanter. 

Dec, 27. — Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I catched 
it, and led it home in a string; when I had it home, I bound and 
splintered up its leg, which was broke. — N,B, I took such care of it 
that it lived, and the leg grew well, and as strong as ever; but, by 
nursing it so long, it grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my 
door, and would not go away. This was the first time that I entertained 
a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might have food 
when my powder and shot was all spent. 

Dec, 28, 29, 30. — Great heats, and no breeze : so that there was no 
stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food : this time I spent in 
putting all my things in order within doors. 

January 1. — Yery hot still; but I went abroad early and late with 
my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going 
farther into the valleys which lay towards the centre of the island, I 
found there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to come

•t: howerer, I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them 
inn. 

Jn. 2.— Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set 
him npon the goata ; but I was mistaken, for they all foced about upon 
the dog, and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near 
them. 

/m. 3. — I began my fence, or wall, which, being still jealous of my 
Idag attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong. — 
lf.B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said 
is (he jonmal : it is sufScient to observe, that I was no less time than 
Ihin 6«m the 3rd of January to the Hth of April, working, fimabing, 
ud perfecting this wall, — though it was no more than about twenty-four 
Jitii in lengUi, being a half circle, from one place in the rock to anotiier 
phtce about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre 
hdindit.

LL this time I worked yerj hard, the rains hindering me 
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together ; but I thought 
I should never be perfectly secure till this wall was 
finished: and it is scarce credible what inexpressible 
labour every thing was done with, especially the bringing piles out of 
the woods, and driving them into the ground, for I made them much 
bigger than I needed to have done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced with a 
turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people 
were to come on shore there they would not perceive any thing like a 
habitation ; and it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, 
upon a very remarkable occasion. 

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game eveiy 
day, when the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these 
walks, of something or other to my advantage ; particularly I found a 
kind of wild pigeons, who built, not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but 
rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks: and, taking some 
young ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did so ; but when 
they grew older, they flew all away, which, perhaps, was at first for 
want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them. However, I fre- 
quently found their nests, and got their young ones, which were very 
good meat. 



R0BIX60X CRUSOB. 69 

And. now, in the managing my honsehold affairs, I found myself 
waating in many things which I thought at first it was impossible for 
me to make, as, indeed, as to some of them, it was — ^for instance, I could 
neyer make a cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I 
observed before, but I could neyer airiye to the capacity of making one 
by tiiem, thou^ I spent many weeks about it : I could neither put in 
the heads, nor join the staves so true to one another as to make them 
bold water ; so I gave that also over. 

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle, so that, as soon as 
ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to 
go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees-wax with which I made 
candles in my African adventure, but I had none of that now. The only 
remedy I had was, that, when I had killed a goat, I saved the tallow, 
aod with a little dish made of day, which I baked in the sun, to which 
1 added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me 
lig^t, though not a dear steady light like a candle. In the middle of all 
my labours it happened, that, rummaging my things, I found a little 
bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled with com for the feeding 
of poultry, not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship 
eame from Lisbon. What little remainder of com had been in the bag 
was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks 
aod dust ; and being willing to have the bag for some other use (I think 
it was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or 
some such use), I shook the husks of com out of it, on one side of my 
fortification, under the rook. 

It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned,* that I 
tbrew this stuff away, taking no notice of any thing, and not so much as 
remembering that I had thrown any thing there ; when about a month 
after, or thereabouts, I saw some few stalks of something green shooting 
out of the ground, which I fanded mig^t be some plant I had not seen ; 
bat I was surprised and perfectly astonished when, after a little longer 
time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect gpreen 
barley of the same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and conftision of my 
tlumghts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious 
foandatbn at all : indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my 
bead, nor had entertained any sense of any thing that had befallen me, 
otherwise than as a chance, or, as we Hg^tly say, what pleases Gk)d, 



This touched my heart a little, an( 
I began to bless myself that such a pn 
my account : and this was the more si 
still, all along by the side of the rock, 
proved to be stalks of rice, and whi( 
grow in AMca when I was ashore then

support, but, not doubting but that thi

Besides this barley there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks 

office, which I preserved with the same care, and whose nse was of 

the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz., to make me bread, or rather 

food; for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though I did that 

also after some time. — But to return to my Journal. 

1 worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall 
dime, and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not 
by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign 
on the outside of my habitation. 

April 16.-^1 finished the ladder; so I went up with the ladder 
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on the 
bade: this was a complete enclosure to me, for within I had room 
enough and nothing could come at me from without, unless it could 
fint mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost had all 

my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus : 

As 1 was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the entrance 

into my cave, I was terribly Mghted with a most dreadM surprising 

tbing indeed ; for, aU on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling 

^wn from the roof of my cave, and frx)m the edge of the hill over 

i&y head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in 

& frightM manner. I was heartily scared, but thought nothing of what 

leally was the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was falling 

in, as some of it had done before. And for fear I should be buried 

in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there 

neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which 

I expected might roll down upon me. I was no sooner stepped down 

upon the firm ground but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake; 

for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes 

distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the strongest 

building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth, and a great 

piece of the top of a rock which stood about half a nule frx)m me, 

next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise as I never heard 

in aU my life. I perceived also the very sea was put into a violent 

motion by it, and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water 

than on the island. 

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like, 
or disGOursed with any one that had, that I was like one dead or 




72 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

stupefied, and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one 
that was tossed at sea ; but the noise of the falling of the rock awaked 
me, as it were, and rousing me from the stupefied condition I was in, 
filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling 
upon my tent and all my household goods, and burying all at once: 
this sunk my very soul within me a second time. 

After the third shock was oyer, and I felt no more for some time, 
I began to take courage, and yet I had not heart enough to get over 
my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the 
ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. 
All this while, I had not the least serious religious thought, nothing 
but the common — Lard, have mercy upon me! and when it was oyer, 
that went away too. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grew cloudy, as 
if it would rain : soon after that the wind rose by little and little, so 
that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. The 
sea was, all on a sudden, covered over with foam and froth; the shore 
was covered with the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by 
the roots, and a terrible storm it was ; and this held about three hours 
and then began to abate, and in two hours more it was stark calm, 
and began to rain very hard. 

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and 
dejected, when, on a sudden, it came into my thoughts that these 
winds and rain being the consequence of the earthquake, the earth- 
quake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my cave 
again. With this thought my spirits began to revive, and the rain 
helping also to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent ; but 
the rain was so violent that my tent was ready to be beaten down 
with it, and I was forced to go into my cave, though very much afraid 
and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my head. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole throu^ 
my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would 
else have drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and 
found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more 
composed. And now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very 
much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum — which, 
however, I did then, and always^ very sparingly^ knowing I could have 
no more when that was gone. 



BOBIXBON 0RU60S. 73 

It cantmned raining all that night and great part of the next day, so 
that 1 could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I 
began to think of what I had best do, concluding that, if the island 
WB8 subject to these earthquakes, there would be no living for me in 
a care, but I must consider of building me some little hut in an open 
place, which I might surround with a wall, aa I had done here, and 
60 make myself secure from wild beasts or men: but concluded, if I 
itaid where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive. 

With thi^e thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place 
▼here it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the 
hOl, and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall 
upon my tent. And I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 
20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habitation. 

The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never slept 
in quiet, and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without any fence, 
▼as almost equal to it: but still, when I looked about, and saw how 
erery thing was put in order, how pleasantly concealed I was, and 
liow safe from danger, it made me very loth to remove. 

In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would require a vast 
deal of ^ time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to run 
the venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had 
secured it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution I composed 
myself for a time, and resolved that I would go to work with all speed to 
haQd me a wall with piles and cables, etc., in a circle as before, and set 
my tent up in it when it was finished ; but that I would venture to 
stay where I was till it was finished and fit to remove to. This was 
ihe2l8t 

April 22. — ^The next morning I began to consider of means to put 
this resolve in execution, but I was at a great loss about my tools. 
I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the 
batchets for traffic with the Indians), but with much chopping and 
^tting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull; 
md though I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools 
00. This caused me as much thoug^i as a statesman would have 
Mtowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge upon the life and 
bath of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it 
nth my foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty. — Note. 1 had 
lot seen any such thing in £ngland| or at least not to take notice how it 



74 ADYBNTURB6 OF 

waa done, though smce I have observed it is very common there ; beside^ 
that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine cost me ^ 
fall week's work to bring it to perfection. 

April 28, 29. — These two whole days I took up in grinding my tods, 
my machine for turning my grindstone performing very welL 

April 30. — ^Haying perceived my bread had been low a great while, 1 
now took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, 
which made my heart very heavy. 

May 1. — ^In the morning, looking towards the seaside, the tide being 
low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked 
like a cask : when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or 
three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the 
late hurricane ; and looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed 
to lie higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined the band 
which was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, 
but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone; 
however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on 
upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look 
for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed. The 
forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least 
six feet, and the stem (which was broke to pieces, and parted from the 
rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging of her) was 
tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side, and the sand was thrown so 
high on that side next her stem that, whereas there was a great piece 
of water before, so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the 
wreck vnthout swimming, I could now walk quite up to her when the 
tide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must 
be done by the earthquake ; and as by this violence the ship was more 
broken open than formerly, so many things came daily on shore, which 
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees to 
the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my 
habitation, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in searching 
whether I could make any way into the ship ; but I found nothing was 
to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up 
with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of anything, I 
resolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the ship, con- 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 75 

ehding that eTerything I could get from her would be of some use or 
^^{ otiiertome. 

Mty 3. — I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, 
viiich I thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together ; 
and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I 
coald from the side which lay highest ; but the tide coming in, I was 
obliged to give oyer for that time. 

JK#y 4. — I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat 
o( till I was weary of my sport ; when, just going to leave off, I caught 
a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rope-yam, but 
1 had no hooks ; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared 
to eat, all which I dried in the sun, and eat them dry. 

May 5. — Worked on the wreck: cut another beam asunder, and 
Ixoa^t three great fir planks off from the decks, which I tied together, 
md made swim on shore when the tide of flood came on. 

May 6. — Worked on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out of her, and 
other pieces of iron work ; worked very hard, and came home very much 
tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7.— Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not to work ; 
but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams 
being cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the 
inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into it, but almost fall of 
▼ater and sand. 

May 8. — Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up 
the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand. I wrenched 
(^)ea two planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left 
the iron crow in the wreck for next day. 

May 9. — ^Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the 
body of the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the 
crow, but could not break them up. I felt also the roll of English lead, 
and could stir it, but it was too heavy to move. 

May 10, 11, 13, 14. — ^Went every day to the wreck, and got a great 
deal of pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred 
weight of iron. 

May 15. — I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off 
the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet and driving it with 
the other, but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water I could not 
niake any blow to drive the hatchet. 






76 ADVBNTUBBB OP 

Maff 16. — ^It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared 
more broken by the force of the water, but I staid so long in the woods 
to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going to the wreck 
that day. 

Ifaif 17. — I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great 
distance,, two miles off me, but resolyed to see what they were, and found 
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away. 

Maif 24. — Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck, and with 
hard labour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first 
blowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests; 
but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but 
pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had some Brazil pork in it, but 
the salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every 
day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which I 
always appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the 
tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out ; and by this 
time I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron work, enough to have 
built a good boat, if I had known how ; and also I got, at several times, 
and in several pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet lead. 

June 16. — Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise, or 
turtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my mis- 
fortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity ; for had I happened to 
be on the other side of the isknd, I might have had hundreds of them 
every day, as I found afterwards, but perhaps had paid dear enough fbr 
them. 

June 17 I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore 
eggs, and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and pleasant 
that ever I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, 
since I landed in this horrible place. 

June 18. — Eained all day, and I staid within. I thought at this 
time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly, which I knew was 
not usual in that latitude. 

June 19. — ^Yery ill and shivering, as if the weather had been cold. 

June 20. — No rest all night ; violent pains in ;ny head, and feverish. 

June 21. — ^Yery ill; Mghted almost to death with the apprehensions 
of my sad condition, to be sick, and no help : prayed to Qtod for the 
first time since the storm off Hull ; but scarce knew what I said, or why, 
my thoughts being all confiised. 



BOBINBON ORUBOB. 77 

Jm$ 22. — A little better, but under dreadM apprehenfiioiis of 
aKkness. 

/mm 23. — ^Yery bad again; oold and shiyering, and then a yiolent 
kadache. 

JwM 24. — Much better. 

JwM 25. — ^An ague yery yiolent: the fit held me seyen hours, cold 
it, and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

Jwu 26. — ^Better; and, haying no yictuals to eat, took my gun, but 
bund myself yery weak : howeyer, I kiUed a she-goat, and with much 
liiBculty got it home, and broiled some of it, and eat. I would feun 
it?e stewed it and made some broth, but had no pot. 

/lOM 27. — ^The ague again so yiolent that I lay a-bed all day, and 
ather eat nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst, but so weak, I 
id not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink, 
^ed to Ck>d again, but was light-headed, and when I was not, I was so 
puxrant that I knew not what to say, only I lay and cried, ^^ Lord, look 
pon me ! Lord, pity me ! Lord, haye mercy upon me ! " I suppose I 
id nothing else for two or three hours, till, the fit wearing off, I fell 
ileep, and did not wake lill far in the night. When I awaked, I found 
ijBelf much refireshed, but weak and exceeding thirsty : howeyer, as I 
ad no. water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, 
nd went to sleep again. Li this second sleep I had this terrible dream : 

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the outside of my wall, 
rheie I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw 
man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and 
i^t upon the ground ; he was all oyer as bright as a flame, so that I 
odd but just bear to look towards him : his countenance was most inex- 
lessibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe; when he stepped 
pon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it 
ad done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my appre- 
oision, as if it had been filled with flashes of fire. He was no sooner 
mded upon the earth, but he moyed forward towards me, with a long 
)ear or weapon in his hand to kiU me, and when he came to a rising 
round at some distance he spoke to me, or I heard a yoice so terrible 
lat it is impossible to express the terror of it ; all that I can say I 
oderstood, was this : '* Seeing all these things haye not brought thee to 
spentance, now thou shalt die," — at which words I thought he lifted up 
le spear that was in his hand, to kill me. 



for eight years, of seafaring wick 
nothing but such as were, like

that so much as tended either to It 
towards a reflection upon my owi

BOBINSON CBUSOB. 79 

It is trae, when I got on shore first here, and fonnd all my ship's 
oew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, 
ud some transports of sonl, which, had the grace of Gk>d assisted, might 
bare come np to true thankfulness ; but it ended where it began, in a 
mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I was alive, 
without the least reflection upon the distinguishing goodness of the hand 
which had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved when 
all the rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had been thus 
merciful to me,— even just the same common sort of joy which seamen 
generally have after they have got safe ashore from a shipwreck, which 
tiiey drown all in the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it 
18 over : and all the- rest of my life was like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sensible of 
my condition, — how I was cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of 
bnman kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon 
as I saw but a prospect of living, and that I should not starve and perish 
for hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, and I began to be very 
easy, applied myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply, 
snd was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment 
from. Heaven, or as the hand of God against me: these were thoughts 
which very seldom entered into my head. 

The growing up of the com, as is hinted in my Journal, had, at first, 
Kme little influence upon me, and began to affect me with seriousness as • 
long as I thought it had something miraculous in it, but as soon as ever 
that part of the thought was removed, all the impression which was raised 
from it wore off also, as I have noted already. 

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its 
nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone 
directs such things, yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the impres- 
sion it had made went off also. I had no more sense of Ood, or his judg- 
i&ents, much less of the present affliction of my circumstances being from 
his hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life. 

But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the 
miaeries of death came to place itself before me, — ^when my spirits began 
to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted 
with the violence of the fever,-*conscience, that had slept so long, began 
to awake, and I began to reproach myself with my past life, in which I 
had 00 evidently, by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of Otod 



80 ADYBNTUBBS 07 

to lay me irnder uncommon starokes, and to deal with me in so Tindictiye 
a maimer. 

These reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my dis- 
temper, and in the yiolence, as well of the fever as of the dreadfol 
reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words from me like praying 
to Ood, though I cannot say they were either a prayer attended with 
desires or with hopes ; it was rather the voice of mere Mght and distress, 
liy thoughts were confosed, the convictions great upon my mind, and the 
horror of dying in such a miserable condition raised vapours in my head 
with the mere apprehensions ; and in these hurries of my soul I know not 
what my tongue might express, but it was rather exclamation, such as, 
"Lord, what a miserable creature am I! If I should be sick, I shall 
certainly die for want of help ; and what will become of me ?" Then the 
tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. 

In this interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, andr 
presentiy his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of tiiis 
story, viz., that if I did take this foolish step Gk>d would not bless 
me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected 
his counsel, when there might be none to assist in my recovery. " Now," 
said I, aloud, ''my dear father's words are come to pass: Gbd's justice 
has overtaken me, and I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the 
voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or station 
of life wherein I might have been happy and easy, but I would neither 
see it myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents. 1 
left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the 
consequences of it : I refused their help and assistance, who would have 
lifted me into the world, and would have made every thing easy to me ; 
and now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great for even mitore 
itself to support, and no assistance, no comfort, no advice." Then I cried 
out, " Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress." This was the first 
prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many years. But I 
return to my Journal.

UNE 28. — Having been someThat refreshed with the sleep I 

had bad, and the fit being entirely off, I got up, and thongh 

the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I 

considered that the fit of the ague would retom again the 

next day, and now was my time to get someUiing to refresh 

and rapport myself when I should be ill ; and the first thing 

t I did, I filled a lai^ square coee-bottle with water, and set 

it upon my table, in reach of my bed, and to take off the chill or aguish 

dispontion of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, 



82 ADYBN TUBES OF 

and mixed tiiem together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and 
broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about, but was 
very weak and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my 
miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day. 
At night, I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted 
in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the shell ; and this was the first 
bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, even, as I could remem- 
ber, in my whole life. After J. had eaten, I tried to walk, but found 
myself so weak that I could hardly carry the gun (for I neyer went out 
without that); so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the 
ground, looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and Teiy 
calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occuiBBd 
to me : 

What is this earth and sea, of which I have seen bo much ? Whence 
is it produced ? And what am I, and all the other creatuies, wild and 
tame, human and brutal ? Whence are we ? 

Sure we are all made by some secret power, who formed the earth 
and sea, the air and sky — ^And who is that? Then it followed most 
naturally, — It is God that has made it all. Well, but then — ^it came on 
strangely — if God has made all these things, he guides and governs them 
all, and all things that concepi them ; for the Power that could make all 
things must certainly have power to guide and direct them. 

If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works, either 
without his knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows that I am 
here, and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without 
his appointment, he has appointed all this to befal me. 

^Nothing occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclu- 
sions, and therefore it rested upon me with the greater force, that it must 
needs be that God had appointed all this to befal me — ^that I was brought 
to this miserable circumstance by his direction, he having the sole power, 
not of me only, but of every thing that happened in the world. Imme- 
diately it followed — 

Why has God done this to me ? What have I done to be thus used ? 

My conscience presentiy checked me in that inquiry, as if I had 
blasphemed ; and methought it spoke to me like a voice : " Wretch J doit 
thou ash what thou host done f Look back upon a dreadful misspent Ufe, 
and ask thyself what thou haet not done? Ask, why is it that thou wert

«f-wsr ; deroured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa ; or drowned

Jmeldanef'' 

I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished, and had 
not a word to say, — ^no, not to answer to myself ; but rose up x>ensiye 
md sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had 
been going to bed : but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no 
indination to sleep, so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for 
it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my 
distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought that the 
I^azilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers ; and 
1 had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite 
eozed, and some also that was green, and not quite cured. 

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt, for in this chest I found a cure 
both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked 
for, viz., the tobacco ; and, as the few books I had saved lay there too, 
1 took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned before, and which, to this 
time, I had not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look into — 
I lay, I took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to 
the table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, or 
▼bether it was good for it or no ; but I tried several experiments with 
it) as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a 
pece of a leaf^ and chewed it in my mouth, which, indeed, at first, almost 
stupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had 
not been much used to it. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or 
two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down ; 
nd, lastly, I biumt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close 
OTcr the smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as weU for the heat, as 
I almost for suffocation. 

In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible ond began to 
itsd, but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to bear 
reading, at least at that time ; only, having opened the book casually, 
tbe first words that occurred to me were these : " Call on me in the day 
of trouble : I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." 
[ The words were very apt to my case, and made some impression 



84 ADVBNTURBB OP 

upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so mach 
they did afterwards ; for, as for being delivered^ the word had no eoxmil^ 
as I may say, to me — the thing was so remote, so impossible in my 
apprehension of things, that I began to say, as the children of Israel did, 
when they were promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a table in the 
wilderness ? " — so I began to say, " Can God himself deliver me from, 
this place ? '' And as it was not for many years that any hope appeared, 
this prevailed very often upon my thoughts. But, however, the words 
made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often. 
It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much. 
that I inclined to sleep ; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I 
should want any thing in the night, and went to bed. But before 1 lay 
down, I did what I never had done in all my life — I kneeled down, ani 
prayed to Qod to fiilfll the promise to me, that if I called upon him ia 
the day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and imperfect 
prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, 
which was so strong and rank of the tobacco, that, indeed, I could scarce 
get it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed. I found presently 
it flew up in my head violently, but I fell into a sound sleep, and 
waked no more till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock 
in the afternoon the next day ; nay, to this hour, I am partly of the 
opinion that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost three the 
day after ; for otherwise I know not how I should lose a day out of toj 
reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some years after I h^^ 
done, for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing the Line, I should 
have lost more than one day, — ^but certainly I lost a day in my accouix^ 
and never knew which way. 

Be that, however, one way or other, when I awaked I found mf" 
self exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful: whei>- 
I got up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomacl^ 
better, for I was hungry, and, in short, I had no fit the next day, but 
continued much altered for the better. This was the 29th. 

The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my 
gun, but did not care to travel too far. I killed a seafowl or two, some- 
thing like a brand goose, and brought them home, but was not very 
forward to eat them, so I eat some more of the turtle's eggs, which weiv 
very good. This evening I renewed the medicine which I had supposed 
did me good tke day before, viz., the tobacco steeped in nun, only I did 



BOBINBON CatlSOI. 86 

ut tike BO much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my 
hoA over the smoke : however, I was not bo well the next day, which 
iia (be Irt of Jnly, as I hoped I ahould have been, for I had a little 
que td the cold £t, but it was not much. 

Jklf 2. — I renewed the medicine all the three wayB, and doaed myself 
with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank. 




JuJf 3. — I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recoyer 
Bf fiill strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering 
rinngUi, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, " I will 
ddircr thee," and the impoasibility of my deliTerance lay much upon my 
niod. Id bar of my ever expecting it ; but, as I was discouraging myself 



86 ADYENTUBBS OF 

with such thoughts, it occnrred to my mind that I pored so much upoix 
my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliveranod 
I had received, and I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions 
as these, viz. : '* Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully, too, from 
sickness, from the most distressed condition that could be, and that was 
80 frightfrd to me ? and what notice had I taken of it ? Had I done 
my part ? God had delivered me, but I had not glorified him,-^that is to 
say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance, and 
how could I expect a greater deliverance ? " 

This touched my heart very much, and immediately I knelt down aad 
gave God thanks aloud for my recovery frx)m my sickness. 

July 4. — In the morning I took the Bible, and, begiuning at the New 
Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read 
a while every morning and every night, — not tying myself to the number 
of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It was not 
long after I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply 
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past life. The impres- 
sion of my dream revived, and the words, *'A11 these things have not 
brought thee to repentance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I was 
earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened pro- 
videntially, the very day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these 
words, ^^He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance, and 
to give remission." I threw down the book, and with my heart as well 
as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy, 1 cried cut 
aloud, ''Jesus, thou son of David I Jesus, thou exalted Prince and 
Saviour ! give me repentance ! " 

This was the first time that I could say, in the true sense of the 
words, that I prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with a sense of 
my condition, and with a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the 
encouragement of the word of God; and from this time, I may say, 
I began to have hope that God would hear me. 

l^ow I began to construe the words mentioned above, '' Gall on me in 
the day of trouble : I will deliver thee," in a different sense from what I 
had ever done before ; for then I had no notion of any thing being called 
deliverance, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in : for 
though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the island was certainly a 
prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the world. But now I 
learned to take it in another sense ; now I looked back upon my past life 



ROBINSON CBU60B. 87 

!!& flQch hcnTor, and my sms appeared so dreadful, that my bobI sought 
aotidng of God but deliyerance from the load of guilt that bore down all 
Mj oomfart. As for my solitary life, it was nothing ; I did not so much 
B pn^ to be deliyered from it, or think of it : it was all of no considera- 
kn, in comparison to this. And I added this part here, to hint to whoever 
kill read it, that, whenever tkey come to a true sense of things, they 
lU find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance 
vol affliction. 

But, leaving this part,* I return to my JoumaL 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my 
ly of living, yet much easier to my mind ; and my thoughts being 
orected, by a constant reading the Scripture and praying to Gk)d, to 
lings of a higher nature, I had a great deal of comfort within, which, 
U now, I knew nothing of ; also, as my health and strength returned, I 
Mttrred myself to frimish myself with every thing that I wanted, and 
lake my way of living as regular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking 
bout with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man 
bat was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness : for it is hardly 
9 be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced, 
lie application which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps 
rhst had never cured an ague before, — neither can I recommend it to 
oj one to practise, by this experiment ; and though it did carry o£f the 
it, yet it rather contributed to weakening me, for I had frequent convul- 
ioiu in my nerves and limbs for some time. 

I learnt from it also this, in particular, — ^that being abroad in the 
nny season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be, 
ipecially in those rains which came attended with storms and hurricanes 
P wind ; for as the rain which came in a dry season was always most 
wompanied with such storms, so I found that rain was much more 
mgerous than the rain which fell in September and October. 

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months : all possi- 
lity of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from 
e, and I firmly believe that no human shape had ever set foot upon that 
aoe. Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, frdly to my 
ind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, 
id to see what other productions I might find, which yet I knew 
ithing of 



88 ADYENTURBS OF 

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular surrey 
of the islaad itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I 
brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up, 
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than 
a little brook of running water, and very fresh and good ; but this being 
the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it ; at least, 
not enough to run in any stream so as it could be perceived. 

On the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannahs or 
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass ; and on the rising paits 
of them, next to the higher grounds (where the water, as it might be 
supposed, never overflowed), I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and 
growing to a great and very strong stalk : there were divers other plants 
which I had no notion of, or understanding about, and that might, per- 
haps, have virtues of their own which I could not find out. I searcbed 
for the cassava root, which the Indians in all that climate make their 
bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not 
then understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and, fot 
want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries 
for this time, and came back musing with myself what course I migb^ 
take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants whicl^ 
I should discover, but could bring it to no conclusion ; for, in short, I haid 
made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little 
of the plants in the field, at least, very little that might serve me to any 
purpose now in my distress. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again, and, after 
going something farther than I had gone the day before, I found the 
brook and the savannahs began to cease, and the country became more 
woody than before. In this part I found different fruits, and particularly 
I found melons upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the 
ti'ces : the vines, indeed, had spread over the trees, and the clusters 
of grapes were just now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was 
a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them ; but I 
was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remember- 
ing that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed 
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them 
into fluxes and fevers. But I found an excellent use for these grapes, 
and that was to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried 
grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be (as indeed they 






BOBINSON CBUSOB. 89 

vere) as wliolesoine and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might 
hehad. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation, 
wliich, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from 
borne. In the night I took my first contrivance and got up into a tree, 
where I slept well, and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery, 
tniTelling near four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley,' 
keeping stUl due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north sides 
of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the country 
Kemed to descend to the west, and a little spring of fresh water, which 
iasaed out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due 
east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so fiourishing, every 
thing being in a constant verdure, or flourish of spring, that it looked 
Hke a planted garden. 

I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it 
witii a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with my other afflicting 
thoughts), to think that this was all my own ; that I was king and lord 
of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession, and, if I 
could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord 
of a manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, 
and lemon, and citron trees, but all wild, and few bearing any fruit, — at 
least not then. However, the green limes that I gathered were not only 
pleasant to eat, but very wholesome, and I mixed their juice afterwards 
with water, which made it very wholesome and very cool and refreshing. 
I found now I had business enough, to gather and carry home, and 
I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to 
^Ornish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching. 

In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, and 
a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in 
ttiother place ; and, taking a few of each with me, I travelled homeward, 
and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could 
make, to carry the rest home. 

Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home 
(so I must now call my tent and my cave), but before I got thither the 
grapes were spoiled : the richness of the fruits, and the weight of the 
juice, having broken them and bruised them, they were good for little or 
nothing ; as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few. 



90 ADYBNTURBB OF 

The next day being tke 19th, I went back, haying made me two 
small bags to bring home my harvest ; but I was snrprised when, coming 
to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, 
I found them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, — some 
here, some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I jcon- 
duded there were some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this, 
Imt what they were I knew not. 

However, as I found that there was no laying them up on heaps, and 
no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be 
destroyed, and the other way they would be Grushed with their own 
weight, I took another course ; for I gathered a large quantity of the 
grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they 
might cure and dry in the sun : and as for the limes and lemons, I canied 
as many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great 
pleasure the frnitfiilness of that valley and the pleasantness of the situa- 
tion, the security from storms on that side the water, and the wood ; and 
concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode, which was by 
far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider 
of removing my habitation, and to- look out for a place equally safe as 
where I now was situate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of 
the island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for 
some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me ; but when I came 
to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now by the seaside, 
where it was at least possible that something might happen to my advan- 
tage, and, by the same ill-f&te that brought mp hither, might bring some 
other imhappy wretches to the same place, — and though it was scarce 
probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to endoae myself 
among the hills and woods in the centre of the island, was to anticipate 
my bondage, and to render such an afiSedr not only improbable, but 
impossible, — and that therefore I ought npt by any means to remove. 

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my 
time there for the whole remaining part of the month of July; and 
though, upon second thoughts, I resolved, as above, not to remove, 
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance 
with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well 
staked, and filled between with brushwood ; and hero I lay very secure, 



B0BIN80N CBUBOB. 01 

sometimes two or three nights together, always going over it with a 
ladder, as before, — so that I fancied now I had my country-house and my 
aesrcoast house. And this work took me up till the beginning of August. 
I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, 
but the rains came on and made me stick close to my first habitation ; 
far, though I had made me a tent like the other with a piece of a sail, and 
ipread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from 
storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extra- 
ordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, 
snd began to enjoy myself. The drd of August, I found the grapes I 
had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good raisins 
of the sun : so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was 
rery happy that I did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled 
them, and I had lost the best part of my winter food ; for I had above 
two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all 
down, and carried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain ; 
and from hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, 
erery day till the middle of October, and sometimes so yiolently that 
could not stir out of my cave for several days. 

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my family. 
I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats who ran away from 
me, or, as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tale or tidings 
of her, till, to my astonishment, she came home, about the end of Aug^t, 
with three kittens. This was the more strange to me, because, though 
I had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was 
a quite differing kind from our European cats ; yet the young cats were 
the same kind of house-breed like the old one, and both of my cats being 
females, I thought it very strange ; but, from these three cats, I after- 
wards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill them 
Kke vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much 
as possible. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could 
net stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this confine- 
ment, I began to be straitened for food ; but, venturing out twice, I one 
day killed a goat, and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very 
large tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was reg^ulated thus : 
I eat a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh, or of 



92 .ADTBNTUHEB 07 

the turtle, for my diitner, broiled (for, to mjr great nuBfortime, I had n 
Tewel to boil or ekBW anything), and two or three of the turtle's eggs !a 
my supper. 

During this confinement in my cover, by the rain, I worked daily tir 
or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towsrf 
one side till I came to the outside of the hill and made a door, or wir 
out, which came beyond my fence or wall ; and so I came in and out thE 
way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open : for, as I baa 
managed myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now, . 
thought I lay exposed ; and yet I could not perceive that there va 
any Uving thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had yet seen npoi 
the island being a goat

EPTEMB!ER the 30th — I was now come to the unhappy 
anniversary of my landing, — I cast up the notches on my 
post, and found I had been on shore three hundred and 
sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting 
it apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the 
most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his 
rigjiteous judgments upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on me 
through Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least refreshment for 
twelye hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then eat a biscuit 
^ and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I 
lieganit. 

I had all this time observed no sabbath-day ; for, as at first I had no 
^fnuse of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted to dis- 
tingaiah the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the 
isbbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the days were ; but 
oow having cast up the days, as above, I found I had been there a year, 
10 1 divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath : 
though I found, at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two in my 
teckoning. 

A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I contented myself 
to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable 



94 ADYBNTUBB8 07 

events of my life, withont contmumg a daily memorandimi of other 
things. 

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to 
me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly ; ' 
but I bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to 
relate was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made at 
all. I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and 
rice, which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of 
themselves, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about 
twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after the 
rains, the sun being in its southern position, going from me. 

Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground, as well as I coxdd with my 
wooden spade, and, dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but, as 
I was sowing, it casually, occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow 
it all at first, because I did not know when was the proper time for it; 
so I sowed about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of eacL 

It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one 
grain of that I sowed this time came to anything ; for the dry months 
following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it bad 
no moisture to assist its gr6wth, and never came up at all till the wet 
season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been but netrly 
sown. 

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined was by 1^^ 
drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to make another trial iS^ 
and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowed the re^ 
of my seed in February, a little before the vernal equinox ; and thi^y 
ha^g the rainy months of March and April to water it, sprung up very 
pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop : but having part of the see^ 
left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity 
at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind' 
But by this experiment I was made master of my business, and kneW 
exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect two 
seed-thnes, and two harvests, every year. 

While this com was growing, I made a little discovery, which waa 
of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over and the weather 
began to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit 
up the country to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, 
yet I found all things just as I left them. The circle, or double hedge, 



B0BIK80N CBU60E. 96 

that I had made, was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had 

cut out of some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out and grown 

with long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year 

after lopping its head. I could not tell what tree to call it that these 

sUkeB were cut £rom. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see 

tbe young trees grow, and I pruned them and led them up to grow as 

much alike as I could ; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure 

they grew into in three years, — so that, though the hedge made a circle 

of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might 

WW call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to 

lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more 

stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall 

(1 mean that of my first dwelling), which I did ; and placing the trees, 

or stakes, in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first 

ftmce, they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, 

sod afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order. 

1 found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, 
not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and 
the dry seasons, which were generally thus : — 

Half February ^

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the winds 
^>pened to blow, but this was the general observation I made. After I 
had found, by experience, the ill consequence of being abroad in the rain, 
1 took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not 
be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible during 
the wet months.

In this time I found much employment, and very suitable also to 
time, for I* found great occasion of many things which I had no way to 
ftimish myself with but by hard labour and constant application; par- 
ticularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs 1 
could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing. 
It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that, when I was a boy, I 
used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's, in the town 
where my father Uved, to see them make their wicker- ware ; and being, 
as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the 
manner how they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I 
had by this means so full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted 
nothing but the materials, — when it came into my mind that the twigs of 
that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as 
tough as the sallows, and willows, and osiers, in England ; and I resolved 
to try. 

Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country-house, as I called 
it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as 
much as I could desire ; whereupon I came the next time prepared with 
a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was 
great plenty of them. These I set up to dry within my circle, or hedge, 
and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave ; and here, 
during the next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, 
a great many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing 
as I had occasion : and, though I did not finish them very handsomely, 
yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose ; and thus, after- 
wards, I took care never to be without them, — and as my wicker-ware 
decayed, I made more, especially I made strong deep baskets to place my 
com in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity 
of it. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about 
it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants. I 
had no vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, 
which were almost full of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the 
common size and others, which were case-bottles, square, for the holding 
of waters, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, 
except a great kettle which I saved out of the ship, and which was too 
big for such use as I desired it for, viz., to make broth and stew a bit of 
meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have had, was a tobacco- 



ROBiKSON CRUBOS. 



»7 



pipe, but it iras impoadble tar me b> make one; hoireTer, I foimd k 
MotiiTuice for that, too, at last. 

I employed myself in planting my second rowe of sUkes or piles, aaA 
I thii wicker-work, all the amnmer, or dry aeason, when another bounen 
Mk me up nuoe time than it conld be imagined I coold spare. 




I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, 
d that I had trSTdled up the brook, and so on to where I built my 
wer, and where I had an opening quite to thcsBea, on the other side of 
e ialaod. I now resolved to travel quite across to the seasho^ o, on that 
le. So, taking my gun, and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity 
powder and shot than usnal, with two biscuit-cakeB and a great bnnch 
imiiina in my pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When I had 
«ed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of 



98 ADYBNTURES OF 

the sea, to the west ; and it being a very dear day, I fairly descried and, 
whether an island or continent I conld not teU, but it lay very hi^ 
extending from the west to the west-south-west, at a very great du- 
tance : by my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than 
that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by all my 
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all 
inhabited by savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been in a 
worse condition than I was now ; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispo- 
sitions of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered 
every thing for the best, — I say, I quieted my mind with this, and left 
afflicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there. 

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered that, if this 
land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see 
some vessel pass or repass one way or other ; but if not, then it was the 
savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazil, the inhabitants of 
which are indeed the worst of savages, for they are cannibals, or men- 
eaters, and fail not to murder, and devour all the human bodies that fall 
into their hands. 

With these considerations I walked very leisurely forward. I found 
that side of the island where I now was much pleasanter than mine, the 
open or savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and ML of 
very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have 
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak 
to me. I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I 
knocked it down with a stick, and, having recovered it, I brought it 
home ; but it was some years before I could make him speak : however, at 
last I taught him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the 
accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in 
its place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found, in the low 
grounds, hares — as I thought them to be — and foxes, but they differed 
greatly from all the ot]|er kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy 
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be 
venturous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very good 
too, especially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, 
— which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have famished 
a table better than I, in proportion to the company ; and though my case 



B0BIN80N CRU60B. 99 

deplorahle enough^ yet I had great cause for thankfolness that I was 
not driven to any extremities for food, but had rather plenty, even to 
damties. 

I never travelled, in this journey, above two miles outright in a day, 
or thereabouts, but I took so many turns and returns, to see what dis- 
eoreries I could make, that I came wearied enough to the place whek« 
1 resolved to sit down for all night, and then I either reposed myself in a 
tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the 
^imd, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could 
oome at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see that I had 
taken up my lot on the worst side of the island ; for here, indeed, the 
ihore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas, on the other side, 
1 had found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite 
somber of fowls of many kinds, some of which I had not seen before, and 
many of them very good meat, but such as I knew not the names of, 
except those called penguins. 

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my 
powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I 
eonld, which I could better feed on ; and though there were many goats 
here, more than on the other side of the island, yet it was with much 
more difficulty that I could come near them, the country being flat and 
eren, and they saw me much sooner than when I was on the hills. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine ; but 
yet I had not the least inclination to remove, for, as I was flxed in my 
habitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here 
to be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However, I travelled 
along the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles, 
and then, setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded 
1 would go home again, and that the next journey I took should be on the 
other side of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round till I came 
to my post again ; of which in its place. 

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could 
easily keep all the island so much in my view that I could not miss my first 
dwelling by viewing the country ; but I found myself Tm'gfjilrflTi^ for being 
eome about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very 
large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with 
woods, that I could not see which was my way by any direction but that 



100 ADYENTUBBS OF 

of the gnu, nor even then, nnless I knew very well the position of Utt 
•on at that time of the day. 

It happened, to my farther misfortone, that the weather proved haij 
for three or fonr days while I was in this valley, and, not being able to 
see the snn, I wandered abont very nncomfortably, and at last wai 
obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post, and come back the same 
way I went ; and then by easy jonmeys I turned homeward, the weather 
being exceeding hot, and my gon, ammunition, hatchet, and other things 
very heavy. 

In this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it, 
and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the 
dog. I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often 
been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and bo 
raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder 
and shot should be all spent. 

I made a collar for this little creature, and with a string which I 
made out of some rope yam, which I always carried about me, I led him 
along, though with some difficulty, tOl I came to my bower, and there I 
enclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, from 
whence I had been absent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old 
hutch, and lie down in my hammock bed. This little wandering joumej) 
without settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me that mj 
own house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me, com* 
pared to that ; and it rendered every thing about me so comfortable, that 
I resolved I would never go a great way from it again, while it should 
be my lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long 
journey, during which most of the time was taken up in the wei^tj 
affidr of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, 
and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of 
the poor kid which I had pent in within my little circle, andxesolved to go 
and fetch it home, and give it some food : accordingly I went, and found it 
where I left it, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost starved 
for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of sadi 
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as 
I did before, to lead it away ; but it was so tame with being hungry. Hut 
I had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog, and, as I 






ROBINSON CRU80B. 101 

cootinnally fed it, the creature became so loying, so gentle, and so fond, 
tlut it became from that time one of my domestics also, and would never 
letTe me afterwards. 

The ndny season of the antomnal equinox was now come, and I kept 
the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the 
ittniyersary of my landing on the island, having now been there two 
Tears, and nq more prospect of being deUvered than the first day I came 
there. I spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments 
of the many wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended 
vith, and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. 
I gave humble and hearty thanks, that Gk)d had been pleased to discover 
to me even that it was possible I might be more happy in this solitary 
ooodition than I should have been in a liberty of society and in all the 
pleasures of the world, — ^that he could fully make up to me the defi- 
ciencies of my solitary state and the want of human society, by his 
preaenoe and the communications of his grace to my soul, supporting, 
eomforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his providence here, and 
liope for his eternal presence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy the 
life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked, 
eoned, abominable life I led all the past part of my days ; and now 
1 changed both my sorrows and my joys, — my very desires altered, my 
Sections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from 
what they were at my first coming, or indeed for the two years past 

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the 

ooontry, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon 

me on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the 

woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner 

locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited 

wilderness, without redemption. In the midst of the greatest composures 

of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and make me 

wring my hands and weep like a child : sometimes it would take me in 

the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and 

look upon the ground for an hour or two together; and this was still 

worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, 

it would go ofi^ and the grie^ having exhausted itself would abate. 

But now I began to egLcrcise myself with new thoughts. I daily read 
the word of (}od, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state. 



102 ADVBNTURBB OF 

One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible npon these words, ^' '. 
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Immediately it occtured tha 
these words were to me: why else should they be directed in such i 
manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition a 
one forsaken of God and man? ''Well, then," said I, ''if God does no 
forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, thougi 
the world should all forsake me, seeing, on the other hand, if I had a] 
the world and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would b 
no comparison in the loss ?" 

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was poc 
sible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition, than i 
was probable I should have ever been in any other particular state of th 
world, and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for bring 
ing me to this place. 

I know. not what it was, but something shocked my mind at thfl 
thought, and I durst not speak the words. " How canst thou be such 
hypocrite," said I, even audibly, " to pretend to be thankfiil for a condi 
tion which, however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with, tho 
wouldest rather pray heartily to be delivered from?" So I stoppe 
there ; but, though I could not say I thanked Gt)d for being there, yet 
sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflictin 
providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for m 
wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but m 
very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in Englanc 
without any order of mine, to pack it up among my ^ods, and for assist 
ing me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship. 

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year ; anc 
though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an accoui 
of my works this year as at the first, yet in general it may be observe 
that I was very seldom idle, but having regularly divided my time accord 
ing to the several daily employments that were before me,— such as, firs! 
my duty to God and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly sc 
apart some time for, thrice every day : secondly, the going abroad with m; 
gun for food, which generally took me up three hours every morning, whe: 
it did not rain : thirdly, the ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking wha 
I had killed or catched for my supply : these took up great part of th* 
day. Also it is to be considered that, in the middle of the day, when th< 
sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; 



B0BIN80N CRUSOE. 103 

10 that about four hours in the eyening was all the time I could be sup- 
posed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I changed my 
kan of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and 
abroad with my gun in the afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the 
exceeding laboriousness of my work, the many hours which, for want of 
tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything that I did took up out 
of my time : for example, I was full two and forty days making me 
a board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave, whereas, two 
sawyers, with their tools and sawpit, would have cut six of them out of 
the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this — it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down, 
because my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days 
cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs and reducing it to a 
log or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing, I re- 
duced both the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light enough to 
move ; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a 
board from end to end ; then, turning that side downward, cut the other 
side, till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth 
on both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a 
piece of work, but labour and patience carried me through that and many 
other things : I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why 
80 much of my time went away with so little work, viz., that what might 
be a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and required 
a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. 

But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went through 
many things, and, indeed, every thing that my circimistances made neces- 
sary for me to do, as will appear by what follows.

fWAS noT, in the montiis of November and December, ex> 
pecting my crop of barley and rice. Tt)e ground I had manured 
or dug up for them vas not great, for, aa I obserre*!, my seed 
of each was not above the quantity of half a peck, for I had 
oat one whole crop by sowing in the dry season j but now my crop 
promised very well, when, on a sudden, I found I was in danger of 
losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce poi- 
aible to keep from it; as, first, the goats and wild creatures which I 
called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night 
sod day, as soon as it came np, and eat it so close that it could get no 
time to shoot np into stalk. 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 105 

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an enclosure about it with 
A hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more because it 
nqnired a great deal of speed, the creatures daily spoiling my com. 
Hoverer, as my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it 
totally well fenced in about three weeks' time, and, shooting some of 
the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying 
lum up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night 
hag; so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the com grew 
Tcry strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my com was in the blade, 
10 the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear ; 
for, going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop 
sonounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, which stood, as it 
were, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them 
(for I always had my gan with me) : I had no sooner shot, but there rose 
op a Uttle doud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the 
com itself. 

This touched m^ sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would 
deroiir all my hopes ; that I should be starved, and never be able to raise 
i crop at all ; and what to do I could not tell : however, I resolved not 
to lose my com, if possible, though I should watch it night and day. In 
the first place, I went among it, to see what damage was already done, 
and found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; but that, as it was yet too 
green for them, the loss was not so great, but that the remainder was like 
to be a good crop, if it could be 'saved. 

I staid by it to load my gun, and then, coming away, I could easily 
lee the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited 
tiU I was gone away ; and the event proved it to be so, for as I walked 
ofl^ as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, but they dropped 
down one by one into the com again. I was so provoked that I could 
Bflt have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain 
that they eat now was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in the con- 
Kqnence ; but, coming up to the hedge, I flred again, ^d killed three of 
them. This was what I wished for ; so I took them up, and served them 
>s ire serve notorious thieves in England, viz., hanged them in chains, for 
^ terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost that this should 
have such an efiPect as it had ; for the fowls would not only not come at 
the com, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the islaodi and I 



106 ADYBNTURBB OF 

could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hnng 
there. 

This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end of 
December, which was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my com. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down : and all 1 
could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of the broad- 
swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship. 
However, as my crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it 
down ; in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the can, 
and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbed it 
out with my hands, and at the end of all my harvesting, I found that oat 
of my half peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two 
bushels and a half of barley ; that is to say, by my guess, for I had do 
measure at that time. 

However, this was great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that in 
time it would please God to supply me with bread ; and yet here I was 
perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind nor make meal of my 
com, nor indeed how to clean it and part it ; nor, if n^ade into meal, how 
to make bread of it ; and, if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake 
it : these things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for 
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this 
crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season, and, in the 
mean time, to employ all my study and hours of working to accompHsh 
this great work of providing myself with com and bread. 

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It is a 
little wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much upon, 
viz., the strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing, 
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to be mf 
daily discouragement, and was made more and more sensible of it every 
hour, even after I had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have 
said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise. 

First, I had np plough to trim up the earth, no spade or shovel to dig 
it: well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade, as I observed before ; 
but this did my work but in a wooden manner, and, though it cost me a 
great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out 
the sooner, but made my work the harder, and made it be performed 
much worse. 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 107 

Howerer, this I bore with, too, and was content to work it out with 

JM&iioe, and bear with the badne&s of the performance. When the com 

tiB aowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and 

dng a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch the earth, as it may 

be called, rather than rake or harrow it. 

When it was growing and grown, I have observed already how many 
tilings I wanted to fence it, secure it, ihow or reap it, cure and carry it 
home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it : then I wanted a mill to 
grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven 
to bake it ; and yet all these things I did without, as shall be observed : 
tnd yet the com was an inestimable comfort and advantage to me, too. 
But all this, as I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but 
that there was no help for ; neither was my time so much loss to me, 
because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed 
to these works ; and, as I resolved to use none of the com for bread till 
I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply 
nyself wholly, by labour and invention, to frimish myself with utensils 
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for the making 
the com, when I had it, fit for my use. 

' But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to 
Kw above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's work, at 
least, to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry 
one indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour to work with it : 
bowevCT, I went through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces 
of ground, as near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced 
them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that wood 
which I had set before, which I knew would grow ; so that, in one year's 
time, I knew I should have a quick, or living hedge, that would want 
bnt little repair. This work was not so little as to take me up less than 
three months, because great part of that time was in the wet season, 
▼hen I could not go abroad. 

Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I found 
employment on the following occasions, always observing that all the 
while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and 
teaching him to speak ; and I quickly learnt him to know his own name, 
and at last to speak it out pretty loud, ** Poll," which was the first word 
I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This, 
therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my work ; for now, as I 



108 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

Baid, I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows : yiz.y I had 
long studied, by some means or other, to make myself some earthen 
Tessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at 
them : however, considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, 
if I could find out any suitable clay, I might botch up some such pot 
as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough and strong enough 
to bear handling, and to hold any thing that was dry, and required to 
be kept so ; and, as this was necessary in the preparing com, meal, etc., 
which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some as large as I 
could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what should be put into 
them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how 
many awkward ways I took to raise this paste, — what odd, misshapen, 
ugly things I made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, 
the clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight ; how many cracked 
by the over violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily, and how 
many fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were 
dried ; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the day, 
to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make 
above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in abo«t 
two months' labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them 
very gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, 
which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break ; and 
as, between the pot and the basket, there was a little room to spare, 
I stuffed it fuU of the rice and barley straw, and these two pots being to 
stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry com, and perhaps the 
meal, when the com was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made 
several smaller things with better success, such as little round pots, fiat 
dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and anything my hand turned to, and the 
heat of the sun baked them strangely hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen 
pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these could 
do. It happened, afker some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking 
my meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a 
broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as4iard 
as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and 



BOBINBON CBUBOE. 109 

to myself, that certainly they might be made to bum whole, if they 
woold bum broken. 

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as ta make it bum me 
Bome pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters bum in, or of 
gazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I 
yboed three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon 
flBotfaer, and placed my firewood all roimd it, with a great heap of embers 
vnder them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel roimd the outside, and upon 
tbe top, till I saw the pots in the inside red hot quite through, and observed 
ihat ihej did not crack at all : when I saw them clear red, I let them 
stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I foimd one of them, though 
It did not crack, did melt or run, — ^for the sand which was mixed with the 
day melted by the yiolence of the heat, and would have run into glass if 
I had gone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually, till my pots began to abate 
<f the red colour, and watching them all night, that I might not let the 
ire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good — ^I will not say 
handsome— pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be 
dedred, and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of earthen- 
ware for my use ; but I must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they 
were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of 
■ufcking them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would 
make pies that never learned to raise x>aste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I 
hand I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire, and I had 
hardly patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon the fire 
again, with some water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admira- 
bly well ; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though 
I wanted oatmeal and several other ingredients requisite to make it so 
good as I would have had it. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some 
eom in ; for, as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that per- 
fection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was at a 
great loss, for, of all trades in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified 
far a stonecutter as for any whatever ; neither had I any tools to go about 
it with. I spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut 
hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what 
was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor, 



110 ADVENTURES OF 

indeed, were the rocks in the island of hardness siiffifiiiait, but wen JS 
of a sandy cmmbling stone, which would neither bear the weight of » 
heavy pestle, nor would break the com without filling it with sand : so, 
after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and 
resolved to look out a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed 
much easier, and getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded 
it, and formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then, ^th 
the help of fire, and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the 
Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavj 
pestle, or beater, of the wood called the ironwood, and this I prepared and 
laid by against I had my next crop of com, when I proposed to myself 
to grind, or rather j>ound, my com into meal to make my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or searce, to dress my meal 
and to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see 
it possible I could hare any bread. This was a most difficult thing, so 
much as but to think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessaiy 
things to make it with — I mean fine thin canvass or stuff, to searce the 
meal through. And here I was at a fuU stop for many months, nor did I 
really know what to do. linen I had none left but what was mere rags; 
I had goats'-hair, but neither knew I how to weave it nor spin it ; and had 
I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All the remedy that 
I found for this was, that at last I did remember I had, among the sea- 
men's clothes which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of caUoo 
or muslin, and with some pieces of these I made three small sieves, but 
proper enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for some years. HoW 
I did afterwards, I shall show in its place. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how 1 
should make bread when I came to have com ; for, first, I had no yeast 
— as to that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern 
myself much about it : but for an oven I was indeed in great pain. A1 
length I found out an expedient for that also, which was this — I made 
some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, — that is to say, about tw( 
feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep : these I burnt in the fire 
as I had done the others, and laid them by, and when I wanted to bake 
I made a great fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with some squari 
tiles of my own making and burning also ; but I should not call then 
square. 

When the firewood was biunt pretty much into embers, or live coals. 



ROBINSON CBUSOB. Ill 

I drew them forward npon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and 
tkae I let them lie till the hearth was very hot ; then, sweeping away all 
tie embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves, and whelming down the 
eirthen pot upon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, 
to keep in and add to the heat ; and thus, as well as in the best oven in 
tiie world, I baked my barley loaves, and became, in a little time, a good 
pifltrycook into the bargain ; for I made myself several cakes of the rice 
and puddings — ^indeed I made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into 
them, supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up most part 
«f the third year of my abode here : for, it is to be observed that in the 
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to 
manage ; for I reaped my com in its season, and carried it home as well 
II I could, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time 
to rub it out ; for I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh 
it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of com increasing, I really wanted to 
baQd my bams bigger : I wanted a place to lay it up iu, for the increase 
of the com now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about 
twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more, insomuch that I now 
molred to begin to use it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a great 
vlule : also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a 
whole year, and to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice 
were much more than I could consume in a year ; so I resolved to sow 
jiut the same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that 
Qch a quantity would fully provide me with bread, etc. 

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts 
na many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the 
either side of the island, and I was not without secret wishes that I was 
on shore there, fancying that, seeing the main land and an inhabited 
ooontry, I might find some way or other to convey myself farther, and 
pcthaps at last find some means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a con- 
dition, and how I might fall into the hands of ravages, and perhaps such 
u 1 might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of 
AUca, — ^that if I once came into their power, I should run a hazard of 
more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten. 



112 ADYBNTURBS OF 

for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coast were cannibalB, or 
men-eaters, and I knew, bj the latitade, that I could not be tar off from 
that shore, — ^that, suppose they were not cannibals, yet they might kfll 
me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, 
even when they have been ten or twenty together ; much more I, tiuit 
was but one, and could make little or no defence. All these things, I 
say, which I ought to have considered weU of^ and I did cast up in my 
thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my apprehensions at first ; and 
my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to that shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoulder- 
of-mutton sail with which I sailed aboye a thousand miles on the coast of 
Africa ; but this was in Tain : then I thought I would go and look on our 
ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great 
way, in the storm when we were first cast away. She lay almost where 
she did at first, but not quite, and was turned by the force of the wayea 
and the winds almost bottom upward against the high ridge of beachj 
roug^ sands, but no water about her, as before. 

If I had had h^nds to have refitted her, and to have launched her into 
the water, the boat would have done very well, and I might have gone 
back into the Brazils with her easy enough ; but I might have easQy fore- 
seen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, 
than I could remove the island. However, I went to the wood, and cut 
levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to try what !• 
oould do, suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her down, I 
might easily repair the damage she had received, and she would be a verj 
good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily. 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I 
think, three or four weeks about it : at last, finding it impossible to heaTe 
it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to under- 
mine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to throat 
and guide it right in the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was imable to stir it up again, or to gci 
under it, much less to move it forwards towards the water ; so I waa 
forced to give it over, and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, 
my desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than decreased, 
as the means for it seemed impossible. 

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not possible to 
make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those dimates 



ROBINSON CRUBOB. 113 

make, eyen without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz., of the 
tnmk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but easy, and 
l^eased myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my 
brring much more conyenience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians ; 
bat not at all considering the particular inconyeniences which I lay under 
more than the Indians did, yiz., want of hands to moye it, when it was 
made, into the water — a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all 
tiie consequences of want of tools could be to them ; for what was it to me 
that, when I had chosen a yast tree in the woods, I might with great trouble 
cat it down, if after I might be able with my tools to hew and dub the 
outside into a proper shape of a boat, and bum or cut out the inside to 
make it hollow, so to make a boat of it — ^if, after all this, I must leaye it 
just there where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the water ? 

One would haye thought I could not haye had the least reflection 
upon my mind of my circumstance, while I was making this boat, but I 
ahoold haye immediately thought how I should get it into the sea ; but 
my thoughts were so intent upon my yoyage oyer the sea in it, that I 
nerer once considered how I should get it off the land ; and it was really, 
in its own nature, more easy for me to guide it oyer forty-fiye miles of sea, 
tban about forty-fiye fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the 
titer. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did, 
tho had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design, 
without determining whether I was eyer able to undertake it ; not but that 
fte difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head, but I put a 
Etop to my own inquiries into it, by this fooHsh answer which I gaye 
myself: *^ Let me first m^e it, I'll warrant I'll find some way or other 
to get it along when it is done." 

This was a most preposterous method ; but the eagerness of my fancy 
prerailed, and to work I went and felled a cedar tree — I question much 
whether Solomon eyer had such a one for the building of the Temple at 
Jerusalem ; it was fiye feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next 
the stump, and four feet eleyen inches diameter at the end of twenty-two 
feet, after which it lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. 
It was not without infinite labour that I felled this tree ; I was twenty 
days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom ; I was fourteen more 
getting the branches and limbs, and the yast spreading head of it, cut off, 
^^bich I hacked and hewed through with my axe and hatchet, with inex- 



114 ADVENTURB8 OF 

pressible labour : after this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to 
a proportion, and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it might 
swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three months more to 
clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it : this I 
did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of 
hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and 
big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big 
enough to have carried me and all my cargo. 

"When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with 
it. The boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a canoe, or 
periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke 
it had cost, you may be sure, for there remained nothing but to get it into 
the water ; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no question but I 
should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be per- 
formed, that ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though they cost 
me infinite labour, too. It lay about one hundred yards from the water, 
and not more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the 
creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into 
the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity : this I began, and it 
cost me a prodigious deal of pains — but who grudge pains that have their 
deliverance in view ? but when this was worked through, and this diffi- 
culty managed, it was still much at one, for I could no more stir the 
canoe than I could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock 
or canal, to bring water up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the 
canoe down to the water. Well, I began this work, and when I began 
to enter upon it, and calculated how deep it was to be dug, how broad, 
how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found that by the number of hands 
I had, being none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve years 
before I should have gone through with it ; for the shore lay high, so that 
at the upper end, it must have been at least twenty feet deep : so at 
length, though with great reluctance, I gave this attempt over also. 

This grieved me heartily, and now I saw, though too late, the folly 
of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge 
rightly of our own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in this place, 
and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much com- 



BOBINSON CBUBOB. 115 

fort as ever before ; for, by a constant study and serious application of the 

word of Grod, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a different 

knowledge fix)ni what I had before. I entertained different notions of 

things. I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had 

Bothing to do with, no expectation from, and, indeed, no desires about : 

in a word, I had nothing, indeed, to do with it, nor was ever like to 

liave ; so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, 

Tiz., as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it, — and well might I 

say, as father Abraham to Dives, '* Between me and you there is a great 

gulf fixed." 

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world 
kere : I had neither the lust of the" flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride 
of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now capable of 
enjoying: I was lord of. the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I might 
call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had posses- 
aon of. There were no rivals ; I had no competitor, none to dispute 
wvereignty or command with me : I might have raised ship-loadings of 
wm, but I had no use for it ; so I let as little grow as I thought enough 
for my occasion. I had tortoises or turtles enough, but now and then one 
was as much as I could put to any use. I had timber enough to have 
l^uilt a fleet of ships ; I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have 
cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had been built. 

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable. I had enough 
to eat and to supply my wants, and what was the rest to me ? If I killed 
niore flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or the vermin; if I 
"owed more com than I could eat, it must be spoiled : the trees that I 
cut down were lying to rot on the ground, — I could make no more use of 
them than for fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon 
just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther good 
to us than as they are for our use, and that whatever we may heap 
^p ta give others, we enjoy as much as we can use, and no more. 
Tbe most covetous griping miser in the world would have been cured of 
the vice of covetousness, if he had been in my case, for I possessed infi- 
^tely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for desire, 
except it was of things which I had not, and they were but trifles, 
thongh indeed of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of 
money, as well gold as silver, above thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas ! 



116 ADVBNTUBBS OP 

there the nasty, soiry, useless stuff lay : I had no manner of bnsmesB fbr 
it, and I often thought with myself, that I would have given a handfhl 
of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my com; 
nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny-worth of turnip and cairot 
seed out of England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of 
ink. As it was, I had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from 
it, but there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of 
the cave in the wet season ; and if I had had the drawer i^ of diamonds 
it had been the same case, and they had been of no manner of valae 
to me, because of no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it 
was at first, and much easier to my mind, as weU as to my body. I 
frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of 
God's providence, which had thus spread my. table in the wilderness. 
I learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less 
upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what 
I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I 
cannot express them, and which I take notice of here, to put those 
discontented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably whst 
Otod has given them, because they see and covet something that he 
has not given them. All oiir discontents about what we want appeared 
to me to spring from the want of thankfulness for what we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be 
so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was ; and this 
was, to compare my present condition with what I at first expected 
it should be, — nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the 
good providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be 
cast up near to the shore, where I not only could come at her, but 
could bring what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfoit; 
without which, I had wanted for tools to work, weapons for defsnce, of 
gunpowder and shot for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself 
in the most lively colours how I must have acted if I had got nothing out 
of the ship ; how I could not have so much as got any food, except fish 
and turtles, and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must 
have perished first ; that I should have lived, if I had not perished, liko 
a mere savage ; that, if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, 
I had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh from the skin and the 



BOBINBON CBTTBOB. 117 

bofweby or to cat it up, but must gnaw it with my teeth^ and pull it with 
BT dawi Hke a beast 

These reflections made me yery sensible of the goodness of Froyidence 
to me, and very thankfal for my present condition, with all its hardships 
nd miflfortanes ; and this part also I cannot but recommend to the reflec- 
tkm of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, ** Is any affliction like 
■ioe ?' Let them consider how much worse the cases of some people are, 
ad their case mig^t haye been, if Froyidence had thought fit. 

I had another reflection which assisted me also to comfort my mind 
with hopes, and this was— comparing my present condition with what I 
bad deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of Fro- 
ndence. I had lived a dreadfdl life, perfectiy destitute of the knowledge 
ad fear of God. I had been well instructed by father and mother, neither 
bad they been wanting to me, in their early endeavours to infuse a 
idigious awe of Gkxi into my mind, a sense of my duty, and of what the 
Bature and end of my being required of me. But, alas ! falling early into 
tbe seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most destitute of the fear of 
God, though His terrors are always before them, — I say, falling early 
into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that littie sense of 
idigion which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my messmates, 
"^ a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of death, which 
grew habitual to me, — by my long absence from all manner of oppor- 
tonities to converse with any thing but was like myself, or to hear any 
thing of what was good, or tended towards it. 

80 void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least sense of 
vb&t I was, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed 
(such as my escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese 
master of a ship, my being planted so well in Brazil, my receiving the 
eargo from England, and the like), I never had once the words, ** Thank 
Ood," so much as on my mind, or in my mouth ; nor, in the greatest dis- 
tteas, had I so much as a thought to pray to Him, or as much as to say, 
''Lord, have mercy upon me!" — ^no, not to mention the name of Ood, 
unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have 
•heady observed, on the account of my wicked and hardened lil'e past ; 
and when I looked about me, and considered what particular providences 
bad attended me since my coming into this place, and how Gtod had dealt 
boontifiilly with me, — ^had not only punished me less than my iniquity 



118 ADVBNTURBS OF 

had deserved, bat had so plentifully provided for me, — ^this gave me great 
hopes that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercies in 
store for me. 

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to resignation 
to the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but 
even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition, and that I, who was yet 
a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due punish- 
ment of my sins ; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason 
to have expected in that place, that I ought never more to repine at mj 
condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily bread 
which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought ; that I ought 
to consider I had been fed even by a miracle as great as that of feeding 
Elijah by ravens, — nay, by a long series of miracles ; and that I could 
hardly have named a place in the uninhabited part of the world where 1 
could have been cast more to my advantage, — a place where, as I had no 
society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous 
beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life, — ^no venomous 
creatures, or poisonous, which I might have fed on to my hurt,— no 
savages, to murder and devour me. 

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life of 
mercy another, and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to 
be able to make my sense of God's goodness to me, and care over me, iiL 
this condition, be my daily consolation ; and after I made a just improye- 
ment of these things I went away and was no more sad. 

I had now been here so long, that many things which I brought on 
shore for my help were either quite gone, or very much wasted, and near 
spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but a yery 
little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so 
pale, it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long ^ 
it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on 
which any remarkable thing happened to me ; and first, by casting tip 
times past, I remembered that there was a strange concurrence of dap i^^ 
the various providences which befel me, and which, if I had been super- 
stitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had 
reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity. 

First, I had observed that the same day that I broke, away from mj 
father and my Mends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the 



BOBINBON CRUBOB. 119 

mne day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a 
dave ; the same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of the 
ship in Yarmouth Beads, that same day of the year afterwards I made 
my escape from Sallee in the boat ; the same day of the year I was bom 
on, vi«. the 30th of September, the same day I had my life so mira- 
culously saved twenty-six years after, when I was cast on shore in this 
island, — so that my wicked life, and my solitary life, began both on 
a day. 

The next thing to my ink being wasted, was that of my bread, — I 
mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship : this I had husbanded 
to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above 
a year ; and yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got 
any com of my own, and great reason I had to be thankful that I had 
any at all, the getting it being, as it has been already observed, next to 
miraculous. 

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had none 
a good while, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests 
of tiie other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times 
1 eoold bear no clothes on but a shirt, and it was a very great help to me 
that I had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen 
^tfdiirts. There were also several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which 
i Were left, indeed, but they were too hot to wear, and though it is true 
that the weather was so violently hot that there was no need of clothes, 
yet I could not go quite naked, no, though I had been inclined to it, 
which I was not, nor could I abide the thought of it, though I was all 
tlone. 

One reason why I could not go quite naked was — ^I could not bear the 
heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on ; nay, 
the very heat frequently blistered my skin, whereas, with a shirt on, the 
^ iteelf made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold 
cooler than without it. No more could I ever bring myself to go out in 
the heat of the sun without a cap or hat : the heat of the sun beating 
with such violence as it does in that place, would give me the headache 
preaently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so 
that I could not bear it, — whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently 
go away. 

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the few rags I 
^ which I called clothes, into some order. I had worn out all the 



120 ADYBNTURES OF 

waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I conld not make 
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such 
other materials as I had ; so I set to work a-tailonng, or rather, indeed, 
a-botching, for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made shift 
to make two or three waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great 
while : as for breeches, or drawers, I made but very sorry shift, indeed, 
till afterwards. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that 1 
killed, — I mean four-footed ones ; and I had hung them up, stretched out 
with sticks, in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and 
hard that they were fit for little, but others, it seems, were very usefoL 
The first thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the 
hair on the outside, to shoot off the rain ; and this I performed so well 
that, after this, I made me a suit of clothes wholly of those skins, — ^that is 
to say, a waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for they 
were rather wanted to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not 
omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made, for, if I was a ba^ 
carpenter, I was a worse tailor ; however, they were such as I mad* 
very good shift with, and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, tt^ 
hair of the waistcoat and cap being outmost, I was kept very dry. 

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make me ^ 
umbrella. I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind '^ 
make one. I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are ve^ 
useful in the great heats which are there, and I felt the heats every jot ^ 
great here, and greater, too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I w^ 
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as wel 
for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a grea< 
while before I could make any thing likely to hold, — nay, after I though'^ 
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind ^ 
but at last I made one that answered indifferently well. The main 
difficulty I found was to make it to let down : I could make it to spread^ 
but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be portable for 
me any way but just over my head, which would not do. However, at 
last, as I said, I made one to answer ; I covered it with skins, the hair 
upwards, so that it cast off the rain like a pent-house, and kept off the 
sun so effectually that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather, witb 
greater advantage than I could before in the coolest ; and, when I had nc 
need of it^ I could dose it^ and carry it under my ann.

a canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the

■ansted to pnt an end to that desigii, and now I thought no more of 
it. Bnt, Bs I had a hoat, my next design was to make a tour round 
the island ; for, as I had been on the other side in one place, croBsing, 
■s I have already described it, over the land, so the discoTeries I made in 
HuA journey made me very eager to see the other parte of the coast : and 
now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with disci«tion and 
tonsidenition, I fitted up a httle mast to my boat, and made a sail to it 
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in store, and of 
which I had a great store by me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found she would 
Mil very well : then I made little lockem, or boxes, at either end of my 
beat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, cte. into, to be kept 
dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea ; and a little long hollow 
[^ I cut in the inside of the boat where I could lay my gun, making 
)^) to hang down over it to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a stop at the stem, like a mast, to stand 
"w my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning ; and 
thui I every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never 
vtnt far out, nor far from the little creek. Bnt at last, being eager 
to view the circumference of my little kingdom, 1 resolved upon my tour; 
od accordingly I victuaUed my ship for the voyage, putting in two 
4wen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley bread, an 
wrthen pot full irf parched rice (a food I eat a great deal of) a little 
botUe of ram, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two 
Wp watoh-coats of those which, as I mentioned before, I hjj Mved out 
at the seamen's chesta ; these I took, one to lie npon, ^d the otbtr t»

to sea, and, above all, doabting bow I Bbonld get back agais ; so I came 
to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an anchor with a piece of 
broken gr^pling which I got out of the ahip. 

Having secured my boat, I took mj gun and went on shore, climbing 
np a hill which seemed to overlook that point, where I aaw the fiiU 
extent of it, and resolved to venture 



.r-v 




In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perodved 
a strong, and indeed a most f\irioua cnirent, which ran to the eeat, 
and even came close to the point ; and I took the more notice of it, 
because I saw there might be some danger that, when I came into it, 
I might be cairied out to sea by the Htrength of it, and not be able 
to make the island again; and, indeed, bad I not gotten first npOD 
this hill, I believe it would have been so, for there was the same 
current on the other aide of the island, only that it set off at a farther dis- 
tance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under the shore, — so I had 
nothing to do bat to get out of the first current, and I should presently 



I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty 
fiiesh (at east-sonth-east, and that being just contrary to the said current) 
made a great breach of the sea upon the point, so that it was not safe for 
me to ke^ too dose to the shore, for the broach, nor to go too for of^ 
because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over ni^t, 
the sea was calm, and I ventured ; but I am a warning piece again to all 
tash and ignorant pilots, for no sooner was I ctnue to the point, when I

not my boaf s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great 

depth of water, and a current like the sluice of a mill ; it carried my boat 

along with it with such violence, that all I could do could not keep her 

10 much as on the edge of it ; but I found it hurried me farther and 

father ofitt from the eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no 

▼ind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with my paddles 

ngnified nothing. And now I began to give myself over for lost ; for 

ti the cmrent was on both sid^s of the island, I knew in a few leagues' 

distance Hiey must join again, and then I was irrecoyerably gone, nor did 

I flee any possibility of avoiding it : so that I had no prospect before me 

Int of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of 

fltaiving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big 

almost as I could lifb, and had tossed it into the boat ; and I had a great 

jtf of fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots ; but what was 

all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was 

no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand leagues at least ? 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make 
tile most miserable condition that mankind could be in, worse. Now, 
I looked back upon my desolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place 
in the world, and all the happiness my heart could wish for was to be 
there again. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes. '' 
bappy desert!" said I, ''I shall never see thee more. miserable 
creatore!" said I, ** whither am I going!" Then I reproached myself 
with my imthankfiil temper, and how I had repined at my solitary condi- 
tioa ; and now what would I give to be on shore there again ! Thus we 
oerer see the true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its 
contraries, nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. 
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was in, being driven 
^ my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the 
vide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever re- 
covering it again. However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength was 
tbnost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to the northward — ^that is, 
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay on — as possibly I 
coold, when about noon, as the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt 
K little breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the south-south-east. 
^ cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in about half an 
hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was gotten 
8t a frightful distance from the island, and had the least cloud or hazy

weather intervened, I liad been undone another way too, for I had no 
compass] on board, and should never have known how to have steered 
towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it ; but the weather 
continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread 
my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the 
current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch 
away, I saw, even by the clearness of the water, some alteration of the 
current was near ; for where the current was so strong the water was 
foul, but perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate, and 
presently I found, to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea 
upon some rocks : these rocks, I found, caused the current to part again, 
and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to 
the north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and 
made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with a very 
sharp stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon 
the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or 
who have been in such like extremities, may guess what my present 
surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this 
eddy, and, the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, run- 
ning cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot- 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again directly 
towards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the 
current lay which carried me away at first, — so that when I came near 
the island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, 
the other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out from. 

When I had made something more than a league of way by the help 
of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no farther. 
However, I found that being between the two great currents, viz. that on 
the south side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which 
lay about two leagues on the other side, — I say, between these two, in the 
wake of the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way ; 
and having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly 
for the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about a leagae 
of the island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this dis- 
tance stretching out, a§ is described before, to the southward, and casting 



ROBINSON CRUBOB. 127 

off the curreiLt more southwardly, had, of course, made another eddy to 
tide north ; and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way 
my course lay, which was due west, but almost fuU north. However, 
baying a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west; 
and, in about an hour, came within about a mile df the shore, where, it 
being smooth water, I soon got to land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave GK)d thanks for my 
deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my 
boat ; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat 
close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some trees, and 
laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of 
tiie voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat : 
I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the cause, to think of 
attempting it by the way I went out ; and what might be at the other 
ade (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any 
laore ventures : so I only resolved in the morning to make my way west- 
ward along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay 
«p my firigate in safety, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In 
about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very 
good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to 
a Tery little rivulet or brook, where I found a convenient harbour for my 
Wt, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on pur- 
poee for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I 
went on shore to look about me and see where I was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been 
before when I travelled on foot to that shore, so taking nothing out of my 
boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my 
2>arch. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had 
^ upon, and I reached my old. bower in the evening, where I found 
everything standing as I left it, for I always kept' it in good order, being, 
*8 1 said before, my country house. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade, to rest my limbs, 
for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge, if you can — you that 
fead my story — what a surprise I must be in, when I was awaked out of 
^J sleep by a voice, calling me by my name several times, " Eobin,

not my business, nor would it answer my end ; so I even let hiin out, and 
\b ran away, as if he had been frighted out of his wits. But I did not 
tiieii know, what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a lion. 
If I had let him stay there three or four days without food, and then have 
carried him some water to drink, and then a little com, he would have 
ken as tame as one of the kids, for they are mighty sagacious and 
tractable creatures, where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time : 
ihm I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them 
irith strings together, and with considerable difficulty brought them home. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing them some 
tweet com, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I 
found that if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh when I had no 
powder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way ; when, 
perhaps, I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. 

But then it presently occurred to me that I must keep the tame from 
the wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew up ; and 
the only way for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground, well 
fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually that those 
within might not break out, or those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet, as I saw 
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first piece of work was to 
find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for 
them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them fi^m the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very little 
contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these (being 
a plain open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people call it in 
the western colonies), which had two or three drills of fresh water in it. 
Mid at one end was very woody, — I say they will smile at my forecast, 
when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this piece of ground in 
BQch a manner that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles 
^nt. Nor was the madness of it so great as ta the compass, for if it 
Was ten iftiles about, I was like to have time enough to do it in ; but I 
'i did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much compass as 
j II they had had the whole island, and I should have so much room to 
^^hase them in, that I should never catch them. 

Hy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about fifty yards, when 



/

this thought oGCUired to me ; so I presently stopped short, and for the 
first beginniiigy I resolyed to enclose a piece of about one hundred and 
fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it 
would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so*, ai 
my flock increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work frith 
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece, and, tOl 
I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used 
them to feed as near me as possible, to make them fSamiliar ; and rerj 
often I would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handfdl of rioe, 
and feed them out of my hand, — so that, after my enclosure was finished 
and I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after 
me for a handful of com. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flocik 
of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years more, I had three 
and forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food. And aftsr 
that I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in, with little 
pens to drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of oae 
piece of ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's flesh to feed 00 
' when I pleased, but milk too, a thing which, indeed, in my beginning 
I did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughtSy 
was really an agreeable surprise : for now I set up my dairy, and had 
sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives sap' 
plies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make lue of 
it, so I that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or 
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after many miscarriages, 
made me both butter and dieese at last, and never wanted it afterwards. 

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his creatures, even i^ 
those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destruotioD' 
How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to piaiflo 
him for dungeons and prisons. What a table was here spread for me in * 
wilderness where I saw nothing at first, but to perish for hunger. 

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my Hitle family 
sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and lord of tb^ 
whole island : I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command; 
I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, — and no rebels among

• 

CAJNNOT say that, after this, for five years, any extraordinaiy 
thing happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the 
same posture and place, just as before ; the chief thing I was 
employed in, besides my yearly planting my barley and rice and 
curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have a 
sufficient stock of the year's provisions beforehand, — ^I say, besides this 
yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out with my gun, I had one 
labour — to make me a canoe, which at last I finished ; so that by digging 
a canal to it of six feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the 
creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big, — as I 
made it without considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should 
be able to launch it-rso, never being able to bring it to the water, <^ 
bring the water to it, 1 was obliged to let it lie where it was, as 
memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time. Indeed, the next tim^i 
though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where 1 
could not get the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, oi 
near half a mile, yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave i* 
over ; and though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged td-S 
labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of i* 
was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when ^ 
made the first, — I mean, of venturing over to the terra firma, wheT^ 
it was above forty miles broad ; accordingly, the smallness of the bo^^ 



B0BIN60N CBUSOE. 123 

ttosted to put an end to that design, and now I thought no more of 
h. But, as I had a hoat, my next design was to make a tour round 
tlie island; for, as I had been on the other side in one place, crossing, 
tt I have already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in 
that journey made me yery eager to see the other parts of the coast : and 
oow I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island. 

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with discretion and 
consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and made a sail to it 
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which lay in store, and of 
which I had a great store by me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I foimd she would 
sail very well : then I made little lockers, or boxes, at either end of my 
boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, etc. into, to be kept 
dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea ; and a little long hollow 
place I cut in the inside of the boat where I could lay my gun, making 
a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stem, like a mast, to stand 
over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning ; and 
thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never 
Went far out, nor far from the little creek. But at last, being eager 
to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour ; 
and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two 
dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley bread, an 
earthen pot fall of parched rice (a food I eat a great deal of), a little 
bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two 
large watch-coats of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out 
of the seamen's chests ; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to 
coYer me in the night. 

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or 
iny captivity — which you please — that I set out on this voyage, and 
I found it much longer than I expected ; for, though the island itself 
Was not very large, yet, when I came to the east side of it, I found 
ft great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above 
Water, some under it, and beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry half 
ft league more, — so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea 
^ double that point. 

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise, 
ftod come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out

I was BO dead asleep at firet, being fotigned with rowing, or paddling 
as it is called, the first part of the day, and walking the latter part, tiis 
I did not awake thoroughly, and dozing between sleeping and waking

irhere had I been ? just as if he had been oyerjoyed to see me again : and 
80 1 carried him home along with me. 

1 had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough 
to do for many days, to sit still and reflect upon the danger i had been in. 
I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of 
the island, but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As to 
the east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew weU enough 
there was no venturing that way ; my rery heart would shrink, and my 
Tery blood run chill, but to think of it ; and as to the other side of the 
isbnd, I did not know how it might be there, but, supposing tl^e current 
nn with the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on 
tlie other, I might run the same risk of being driven down the stream

yffj much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning

happily in all things, except that of society. I improved myself in this 
time in all the mechanic exercises which my necessities put me upon 
applying myself to, and I believe could, upon occasion, have made a very 
good carpenter, especially considering how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthen- 
ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which 
I found infinitely easier and better, because I made things round and 
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to look upon. But 
I think I never was more vain of my own performance, or more joyfdl 
iat anything I found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe ; 
and thoagji it was a very u^y clumsy thing when it was done, and only 
burnt red like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm and would 
draw Uie smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been 
always used to smoke : and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot 
them at first, not knowing there was tobacco in the island ; and afterwards, 
when I searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.

130 ADVENTURES OP 

In my wickerware also I improyed much, and made abundance of 
necessary baskets, as well as my inyention showed me, — though not very 
handsome, yet convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching things 
home in. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in 
a tree, flay it and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a 
basket ; and ^e like by a turtle— I could cut it up, take out the eggs, 
and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them 
home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large deep baskets 
were my receivers for my com, which I always rubbed out as soon as it 
was. dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets instead of a granary. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably, and this was 
a want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously 
to consider what I must do when I should have no more powder, — that is 
to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as I observed, in the 
third year of my being hero, kept a young kid, and bred her tame : I. was 
in hopes of getting a he-kid, but I could not by any means bring it to 
pass, till my kid grew an old goat, and I could never And in my heart to 
kill her, till she died at last of mere age. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have 
said,' my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap 
and snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive ; 
and particularly I wished to possess a she-goat great with young. 

For this purpose, I made snares to hamper them, and believe they 
were more than once taken in them ; but my tackle was not good, for I 
had no wire, and I always found them broken, and my bait devoured. 

At length I resolved to try a pitfall, — so I dug several large pits in 
the earth, in places where I had observed the goats used to feed, and over 
these pits I placed hurdles of my own making, too, with a great weight 
upon them, and several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without 
setting the trap ; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in 
and eaten up the com, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length 
I set three traps in one night, and going the next morning, I found them 
all standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging. 
However, I altered my traps ; and, not to trouble you with particulars, 
going one morning to see my traps,. I found in one of them a large old 
he-goat, and in one of the other, three kids — a male and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was so fierce, 
I durst not go into^ the pit to him, — that is to say, to bring him away 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 131 

ilire, which was what I wanted: I could have killed him, but that was 
lot my business, nor would it answer my end ; so I even let him out, and 
h ran away, as if he had been frighted out of his wits. But I did not 
ften know, what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a lion. 
If I had let him stay there three or four days without food, and then have 
earned him some water to drink, and then a little com, he would have 
beea as tame as one of the kids, for they are mighty sagacious and 
tractable creatures, where they are well used. 

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time : 

> then I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them 

with strings together, and with considerable difficulty brought them home. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing them some 
tweet com, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. And now I 
fcond that if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh when I had no 
powder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way; when, 
perhaps, I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. 

But then it presently occurred to me that I must keep the tame from 
tiie wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew up ; and 
the only way for this was to have some enclosed piece of ground, well 
ienced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so effectually that those 
within might not break out, or those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet, as I saw 
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first piece of work was to 
find out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for 
them to eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very little 
eontrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for aU these (being 
a plain open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people call it in 
the w^tem colonies), which had two or three drills of fr^sh water in it, 
and at one end was very woody, — I say they will smile at my forecast, 
when I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this piece of ground in 
Boch a manner that my hedge or pale must have been at least two miles 
•bout. Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass, for if it 
was ten iftiles about, I was like to have time enough to do it in ; but I 
hd not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much compass as 
\f they had had the whole island, and I should have so much room to 
chase them in, that I should never catch them. 

Hy hedge was begun and carried on, I believe about flfky yards, when 



132 ADYENTTTBB8 OF 

this thought occuired to me ; so I presently stopped short, and for thi 
first beginmngy I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred am 
fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as L 
would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, bo, ai 
my flock increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work witi 
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece, and, til 
I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and usee 
them to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar ; and ver^ 
often I would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handM of rioo 
and feed them out of my hand, — so that, after my enclosure was finiahec 
and I let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating aftei 
me for a handM of com. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flod 
of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years more, I had tfaiei 
and forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food. And aftes 
that I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in, with little 
pens to drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of oii<^ 
piece of ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's flesh to feed oi 
when I pleased, but milk too, a thing which, indeed, in my beginning 
I did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts 
was really an agreeable surprise : for now I set up my dairy, and ha^ 
sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives sap- 
plies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make use o^ 
it, so I that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter Qt 
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after many miscaniage^ 
made me both butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards. 

How merciMly can our great Creator treat his creatures, even is 
those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in destructioo. 
How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us cause to pnis0 
him for dungeons and prisons. What a table was here spread for me in * 
wilderness where I saw nothing at first, but to perish for hunger. 

It would have made a stoic smile to have seen me and my Ulde familj 
sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, the prince and lord of ihd

TILDEN FOUNDATIONS 



B0BIN80N CBU80B. 183 

by my servazits ! Poll, as if he had been my favotirite, was the only per- 
son permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now grown very old and 
crazy, and had found no species to midtiply his kind npon, sat always at my 
right hand, and two cats, one on one side of the table, and one on the other, 
expecting now and then a bit fix)m my hand, as a mark of special favonr. 

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for 
they were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation 
by my own hand; but one of them having midtiplied by I know not 
"^hat kind of creature, these were two which I had preserved tame; 
'Whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome 
to me at last, for they would often come into my house, and plunder me 
too, tiU at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many : 
at length they left me. With this attendance, and in this plentiM 
itianner, I lived ; neither could I be said to want anything but society, 
and of that in some time after this, I was like to have too much. 

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my 
boat, though very loth to run any more hazards, and therefore sometimes 
I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at other times I sat 
myself down contented enough without her. But I had a strange 
Uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island where, as I 
liave said, in my last ramble, I went up to the hill to see how the shore 
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had to do. This 
inclination increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to 
travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so ; but had 
any one in England been to meet such a man as I was, it must either have 
frighted him or raised a great deal of laughter; and, as I frequently 
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my 
travelling through Yorkshire, with such an equipage and in such a dress. 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with, a flap 
hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the 
rain off from running into my neck ; nothing being so hurtful in these 
climates as the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes. I had a short jacket 
of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to about the middle of my thighs, 
and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same, made of the skin of an old 
he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side, that, like 
pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had 
none, but I had made me a pair of something — I scarce know what to c^ 
them — ^like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat- 



134 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

terdashes, but of a most barbarous shape, as were all the rest of my elothes. 
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together with 
tw-o thongs of the same, instead of buckles ; and in a kind of a frog on 
either side of this, instead of a sword and a dagger, hung a little saw and 
.a hatchet — one on one side, and one on the other. I had another belt, 
not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung oyer mj 
shoulder ; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, 
both made of goat's skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the 
other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder mj 
gun, and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella, bnt 
which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, next to 
my gun. As for my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-Hke 
as one might expect from a man not at all carefril of it, and living within 
nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered to 
grow till it was about a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had both sasam 
and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my 
upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, 
such as I had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee — for the Moors did not 
wear such, though the Turks did : I will not say they were long enough 
to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape monstrons 
enough, and such as, in England, would have passed for frightfrd. 

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to 
observe me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more to 
that part. In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out 
five or six days. I travelled first along the seashore, directly to the pl&^ 
where I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks, and 
having no boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer wft7 
to the same height that I was upon before, when looking forward to the 
point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double v(i^ 
my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to see the sea smooth and quic^ 
— ^no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there than in other places' 

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend soitL' 
time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide h^ 
occasioned it : but I was presently convinced how it was, viz., that tb 
tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of watet 
from some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current 
and that, according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west, or fran 
the north, this current came nearer, or went farther from the shore : foi 



BOBINSON CBUSOB. 135 

iraitmg thereabouts till the eyening, I went up to the rock again, and 

then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as before, 

only that it ran farther off, being near half a league from the shore, — 

whereas, in my case, it set close from the shore, and hurried me and my 

canoe along with it, which at another time it would not have done. 

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe 
tlie ebbing and flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat 
about the island again : but when I began to think of putting it in 
practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the 
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any 
patience; but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, and this 
▼as, that I would build, or rather make me another periagua or canoe, 
aod 80 have one for one side of the island, and one for the other. 

You a^ to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two planta- 
tions in the island; one, my little fortiflcation or tent, with the wall 
about it under the rock, and with the cave behind me, which by this 
time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another. 
One of these, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond 
my wall or fortiflcation — that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to 
the rock — was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which I have 
given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would 
hold five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of provision, 
especially my com, some in the ear, cut off short from the straw, and the 
other rubbed out with my hand. As for my wall, made, as before, with 
long stakes or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time 
grown so big and spread so very much, that there was not the least 
i^ypearance, .to any one's view, of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and 
^pon lower groimd, lay my two pieces of com groimd, which I kept culti- 
Tated, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season ; and when- 
ever I had occasion for more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this I had my coimtry seat, and I had now a tolerable planta- 
tion there also ; for first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I 
bpt in repair, — ^that is to say, I kept the hedge which circled it in con- 
stantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the 
inside : I kept the trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but 
were now grown very firm and tall, — I kept them always so cut, that 
they might spread, and grow thick and wild, and make the more agree- 



136 ADYBNTUBBS Oir 

able shade, which they did effectually to my mind. In the middle of this 
I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread oyer polefl, 
set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair or renewing; 
and under this I had made me a couch, with the skins of the creatures I 
had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on them, such as 
belonged to our sea bedding, and a great watch-coat to cover me ; and here, 
whenever absent from my chief seat, I took up my coimtry habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, — that is to saj, 
my goats ; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and 
enclose this ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the goats 
should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite labour, I had 
stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one 
another, that it was rathet a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce 
room to put a hand through between them; which afterwards, when 
those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made the 
enclosure strong like a wall, indeed, stronger than any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no 
pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable 
support ; for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus 
at my hand woidd be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese 
for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years ; and 
that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my 
enclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of keeping them together. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally 
depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed 
to preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my 
whole diet; and, indeed, they were not agreeable only, but physical| 
wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree. 

As this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the 
place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my 
way thither ; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all things 
about, or belonging to her, in very good order. Sometimes I went out in 
her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor 
scarce ever above a stone's cast or two frt)m the shore, I was so apprehen- 
sive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents, or winds, 
or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my life.

CHAPTER XI. 



^ T happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was 
sb exceedingly Enrprified witb the piint of a man's naked foot on 
W the shore, irhich was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood 
^ like one thanderstnick, or as if I had seen ac apparitiim: I 
ned, I looked nnnd me ; I oonld hear nothing, nOr see anything. I 



138 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

went up to £i rising ground, to look farther — I went up the shoiey and 
down the shore ; but it was all one, — I could see no other impression but 
that one. I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to obserre 
if it might not be my fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there 
was exactly the very print of a foot — ^toes, heel, and every part of a 
foot : how it came thither I know not, nor could in the least imagine ; 
but, after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused 
and out of myself, I came home to my fortdflcation, not feeling, as we say, 
the ground I went on, but terrifled to the last degree — looking behind me 
at every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying 
every stump at a distance to be a man. 'Nor is it possible to describe how 
many various shapes affiighted imagination represented things to me in, 
how many wild ideas were found every moment in my fancy, and vhat 
strange unaccoimtable whimsies came into my thoughts by the way. 

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), 
I fled into it like one pursued ; whether I went over by the ladder, as 
flrst contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a door, 
I cannot remember: no, nor could I remember the next morning; for 
never frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of 
mind than I to this retreat. 

I slept none that night : the farther I T^as from the occasion of my 
fright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary 
to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of all 
creatures in fear ; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightfol ideas 
of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself 
even though I was now a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must 
be the devil, and reason joined in with me upon this supposition ; for how 
should any other thing in human shape come into the place? yfhssre 
was the vessel that brought them ? What marks were there of any other 
footsteps ? And how was it possible a man should come there ? But then 
to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in such a plaoci 
where there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print 
of his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not 
be sure I should see it, — ^this was an amusement the other way. I oon' 
sidered that the devil might have found out abundance of other ways to 
have terrifled me, than this of the single print of a foot ; that, as I lived 
quite on the other side of the island, he would never have been so simple 
as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether I 



BOBINSON CRUSOB. 139 

should ever see it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of the 
sea, upon a high wind, woidd have defaced entirely : all this seemed 
inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all the notions we usually 
entertain of the suhtilty of the devil. 

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all 
apprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded, then, 
that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz., that it must be some 
of the savages of the main land over against me, who had wandered out 
to sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents or by contrary 
ynndsy had made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away 
again to sea ; being as loth, perhaps, to have staid in this desolate island 
as I would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very thank- 
ful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that 
time, or that they did not see my boat, by which they would have con- 
cluded that some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have 
searched farther for me: then terrible thoughts racked my imagination 
about their having foimd my boat, and that there were people here ; and 
that if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers, 
and devour me : that if it should happen so that they should not find me, 
yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my com, carry away all my 
flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want. 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope : all that former confi- 
dence in Gk)d, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I 
had had of his goodness, now vanished, as if He that had fed me by 
miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his power the provision which he 
had made for me by his goodness. I reproached myself with my easiness, 
that would not sow any more com one year than would just serve me 
tin the next season, as if no accident could intervene to prevent my 
^joying the crop that was upon the ground ; and this I thought so just 
» reproof that J resolved for the future to have two or three years' com 
Wordiand, so that whatever might come, I might not perish for wapt of 
bead. 

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man ! and by 
^hat secret differing springs are the affections hurried about, as differing 
circumstances present! To-day we love what to-morrow we hate; 
to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to- 
morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of: this was 



140 ADVBNTUBKS OF 

exemplified in me at this time, in tiie most lively manner imaginable; 
for I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished from haman 
society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the bonndless ocean, cnt off 
from mankind, and <)ondemned to what I called silent life ; that I was as 
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among the liTing, 
or to appear among the rest of his creatures ; that to have seen one of my 
own species would have seemed to me a raising me firom death to life, and 
the greatest blessing that Heayen itself, next to the supreme blessiag of 
salvation, could bestow — ^I say, that I should now tremble at the very 
apprehensions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at 
but the shadow, or silent appearance, of a man's having set his foot on 
the island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life ; and it affoided me a great 
many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my 
first surprise. I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely 
wise and good providence of GK>d had determined for me ; that as I could not 
foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not 
to dispute His sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted 
right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought 
fit ; and who, as I was a creature who had offended him, had likewise a 
judicial right to condemn me to what punishment he thought fit, and 
that it was my part to submit to bear his indignation, because I had 
sinned against him. I then reflected that God, who was not only 
righteous but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict 
me, so he was able to deliver me ; that, if he did not think fit to do it, it 
was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his 
will ; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, praj 
to him, and quietly to attend to the dictates and directions of his daily 
providence. 

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, — ^I may say weeks 
and months ; and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I 
cannot omit, viz., one morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with 
thoughts about my danger from the appearance of savages, I found it dis- 
composed me very much ; upon which these words of the Scripture cam^ 
into my thoughts, *' Call upon me in the day of trouble : I will deliver 
thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of n^7 
bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged 
to pray earnestly to Ood for deliverance : when I had done prayiagy I 



ROBINSON CRU80B. 141 

took np my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words that presented 
to me were, '' Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and he shall 
strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to 
express the comfort this gave me. Li answer, I thankfully laid down the 
iMok, and was no more sad, at least, not on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it 
came into my thonght one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of 
mj own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I 
came on shore from my boat : this cheered me np a little too, and I began 
to persuade myself it was all a delusion ; that it was nothing else but my 
own foot ; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as well as 
I was going that way to the boat ? Again, I considered also, that I could 
I7 no means tell, for certain, where I had trod, and where I had not *, 
and that if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had played 
the part of those fools who strive to make stories of spectres and appari- 
tions, and then are frighted at them more than any body. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not 
BtiiTed out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to 
starye for provision ; for I had little or nothing within doors but some 
bailey cakes and water. Then I knew that my goats wanted to be 
mOked too, which usually was my evening diversion, and the poor crea-^ 
toies were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it ; and, indeed, it 
almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk. 

Heartening myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing 
Imt the print of one of my own feet, and so I might be truly said to start 
stmy own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country 
house to milk my flock ; but to see with what fear I went forward, how 
often I looked behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay 
down my basket and run for my life, it would have made any one have 
fliought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been 
lately most terribly Mghted ; and so, indeed, I had. 

However, as I went down thus two or three days, and having seen 
nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really 
nothing in it but my own imagination ; but I could not persuade myself 
folly of this till I should go down to the shore again, and see this print 
of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any similitude 
or fitness, that I might be assured it was my own foot : but when I came 
to the place, first, it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my 



142 ADYENTUBBS OF 

boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere thereabout ; secondly, 
when I came to measure the mark with my own foot, I foimd my foot 
not so large by a great deal. Both these things filled my head with new 
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree, so 
that I shook with cold like one in an ague, and I went home again, filled 
with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there; or, 
in short, that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised before 1 
was aware, — and what course to take for my security I knew not. 

Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear! 
It deprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their 
relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my 
encloures and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, that the 
enemy might not find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of 
the same or the like booty ; then to the simple thing of digging up my 
two com fields, that they might not find such a grain there, and still be 
prompted to frequent the island ; then to demolish my bower and tent, 
that they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to 
look farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subject of the first night's cogitations after I was come 
home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were 
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above. Thus fear of 
danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when 
apparent to the eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by 
much, than the evil which we are anxious about : and, which was worse 
than all this, I had not that reHef in this trouble from the resignation I 
used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, 
who complained not only that the Philistines were upon him, but that 
Ood had forsaken him ; for I did not now take due ways to compose my 
mind, by crying to Ood in my distress, and resting upon his providence, 
as I had done before, for my defence and deliverance ; which, if I had 
done, I had at least been more cheerfidly supported under this new sur- 
prise, and perhaps carried through it with more resolution. 

This confasion of my thoughts kept me waking all night ; but in the 
morning I fell asleep, and having, by the amusement of my mind, been, 
as it were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and 
waked much better composed than I had ever been before. And now I 
began to think sedately ; and, upon the utmost debate with myself, I con- 
cluded that this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no 



B0BIN80N CRU80B. 143 

Azther from the main land than as I had seen, was not so entirely ahan- 
dooed as I might imagine ; that, althong^ there were no stated inhahitants 
irho lived on the spot, yet, that there might sometimes come hoats off 
from the shore, who, either with design, or, perhaps, never but when they 
were driven by cross winds, might come to this place; that I had 
lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with the least shadow or 
figure of any people yet ; and that, if at any time they should be driven 
here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they 
eoold, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there upon any oc- 
casion to this time : that the most I could suggest any danger from, was 
from any such casual accidental landing of straggling people frrom the 
main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were here against 
tlieir willsy so they made no stay here, but went off again with all 
poasible speed — seldom staying one night on shore, lest they should not 
bare the help of the tides and daylight back again ; and that, therefore, 
I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in case I should 
see any savages land upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to 
bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond 
where my fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering 
tiiia, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the same 
iiuumer of a semicircle, at a distance frx)m my wall, just where I had 
jdanted a double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made 
Qiention : these trees having been planted so thick before, there wanted 
t>Qt a few piles to be driven between them, that they should be thicker 
^ stronger, and my wall would be soon finished. 

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was thickened with 
pieces of timber, old cables, and every thing I could think of to make it 
Btrong, having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my 
^nn out at. In the inside of this, I thickened my wall to about ten feet 
^ck, with continually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at 
^ foot of the wall, and walking upon it ; and through the seven holes 
I contrived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I got 
B^^en on shore out of the ship : these I say I planted like my cannon and 
^tted them into frrames, that held them like a carriage, that so I could fire 
^ the seven guns in two minutes' time. This wall I was many a weary 
i&onth in finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a 



144 ADYSNTURBB 07 

great way every way, as ftill with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like 
wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand ; insomuch, 
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a 
pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might have room 
to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if 
they attempted to approach my outer wall. 

Thus in two years' time, I had a thick grove, and in five or six yean* 
time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrous tiiick and 
strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable ; and no man, of what 
kind soever, would ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much 
less a habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in 
and out (for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a 
part of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place 
another ladder upon that : so, when the two ladders were taken down, no 
man living could come down to me without mischiefing himself, and if 
they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for mj 
own preservation; and it will be seen, at length, that they were not 
altogether without just reason, though I foresaw nothing at that time 
more than my mere fear suggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other 
affairs ; for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats : 
they were not only a present supply to me on every occasion, and began to 
be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, bnt also 
without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones ; and I was loth to 
lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again. 

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two 
ways to preserve them ; one was, to find another convenient place to dig a 
cave under ground, and to drive them into it every night ; and the other 
was, to enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and 
as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a doxen 
young goats in each place, so that if any disaster happened to the flock in 
general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and time ; 
and this, though it would require a great deal of time and labour, I 
thought was the most rational design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of 
the island ; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as mj 
heart could wish for : it was a little damp piece of ground, in the middle 



BOBINSON CRU80B. 145 

of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself 
once before, endeayourmg to come back that way from the eastern part of 
the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so sur- 
itnmded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature ; at least, 
it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other pieces of 
groimd I had worked so hard at. 

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and in less 
than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my flock, or herd, 
edl it which you please, who were not so wild now as at first they might 
be supposed to be, were well enough secured in it. So, without any 
farther delay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to this piece ; 
and when they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had 
made it as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and 
i took me up more time by a great deal. 

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehen- 
nous on the account of the print of a man's foot which I had seen ; for, 
ai yet, I never saw any human creature come near the island, and I had 
now lived two years under these uneasinesses, which, indeed, made my 
life much less comfortable tk^ it was before, as may welH)e imagined by 
any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of the fear of man. 
And this I must observe, with grief too, that the discomposure of my 
loind had too great impressions also upon the religious part of my 
thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages 
Qod cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in a 
<hie temper for application to my Maker, — at least not with the sedate 
calnmess and resignation of soul which I was wont to do. I rather 
played to €kxl as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded 
^th danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and 
deroared before morning ; and I must testify from my expmence, that a 
^per of peace, thankfulness, love,, and affection, is much the more 
prqper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure ; and that, 
Under the dread of mischief impending, a man is ito more fit for a 
oomforting performance of the duty of praying to God, thai^ he is for a 
repentance on a sick bed; for these discomposures affect the mind as 
the others do the body, and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily 
he as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater, — praying to 
God being properly an act of the mind, not of the body. 

But to go on : After I had thus secured one part of my little living 

10 



146 ADYENTUBE8 OF 

stock, I went about the whole island searching for another private place 
to make such another deposit ; when, wandering more to the west point 
of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to ^ea, I thought r 
I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspectiYe ^ 
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests which I saved out of our ship ; ^ 
but I had it not about me, and this was so remote that I could not tell ^ 
what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to ^ 
hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not, I do not know; 
but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it _: 
over, only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in my -^ 
pocket. ~ 

When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where r- 
indeed I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the -^ 
seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the E 
island as I imagined ; and, but that it was a special providence that 1 ' 
was cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came, 1 I 
should easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the ^ 
canoes frx)m the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at ^ 
sea, to shoot over to that side of the island for harbour : likewise, as thej - 
often met and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any 
prisoners, would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their 
dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them, — of i 
which hereafter. - 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being ^ 
the south-west point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and 
amazed ; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind at : 
seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of 
human bodies; and, particularly, I observed a place where there had 
been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I 
supposed the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings 
upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained 
no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while ; all my 
apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inTiTimfliij 
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, 
which, though I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a view of 
before : in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle ; my 
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature 



ROBINSON CBUSOB. 147 

Charged the disorder from my stomach, and having vomited with an 
Uacommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in 
tte place a moment. So I got me up the hill again with all the speed I 
Boold, and walked on towards my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still 
nrhile as amazed, and then recovering myself^ I looked up with the 
itmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave 
hd thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I was 
istinguished from such dreadful creatures as these ; and that, though 
had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me 

> many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks for than to 
smplain of; and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable 
mdition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope 
r His blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to 
1 the misery which I had suffered or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and began 

> be much easier now, as to the safety of my circimistances, than ever I 
«9 before ; for I observed that these wretches never came to this island 
I search of what they could get, — perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or 
ot expecting any thing here, and having often, no doubt, been up in 
le covered woody part of it, without finding any thing to their purpose, 
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the 
iast footsteps of human creature there before ; and I might be eighteen 
loare as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to 
iiem, which I had no manner of occasion to do, it being my only 
nsiness to keep myself entirely conceale(} where I was, unless I fbund a 
etter sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to. 

Tet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I 
ave been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their 
evouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, 
nd kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this : 
rhen I say my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz., my 
aetle, my country seat — which I called my bower, — and my enclosure 
a the woods: nor did I look after this for any other use than as an 
nclosure for my goats ; for the aversion which nature gave me to these 
icUish wretches was such, that I was fearfcd of seeing them as of seeing 
he devil himself. Nor did I so much as go to look after my boat in all 
his time, but began rather to think of making me another ; for I could 



148 



AUVENTDBS8 01 



not tiunk of ever making any more attempts to bring the other bostmo'' 
the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at tMi 
in vhich, if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew "wiii^ 
irould have been my lot. 



I 




Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of 
being discovered by tjiese people, began to wear off my uneaainesg sboiit 
them, and I began to live just in the same composed manner as beforei-^ 
only with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my ej* 
more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by mj 
of thorn ; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, Icat iBj 
of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it. And it was Qasf 
fore a very good previdonce to me thftt I had fiimiBhed myself with a tame 
breed of goats, and that I needed not hunt any more about the woods 



BOBINSON CRUSOB. 149 

or ahoot at them, — and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by- 
traps and snares, as I had done before : so that for two years after this, 
I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went out without 
it; and, which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I 
alvajB carried them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them 
in my goat's-skin belt. I also furbished up one of the great cutlasses 
that I had ont of the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also ; so that 
I vaa now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad, if 
joa add to the former description of myself, the particular of two pistols, 
and a great broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a 
scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, except- 
ing these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm sedate way of living. 
AH these things tended to show me, more and more, how far my condi- 
tion was from being miserable, compared to some others — nay, to many 
other particulars of life, which it might have pleased God to have made 
my lot It put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be 
among mankind at any condition of life, if people would rather compare 
t^ir condition with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than 
1)6 always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their 
innrmurings and complainings. 

As in my present condition there were not really many things which 
1 wanted, so, indeed, I thought that the frights I had been in about 
these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preser- 
vation, had taken off the edge of my invention for my own conveniences, 
sod I had dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts too 
much upon, — and that was, to try if I could not make some of my barley 
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This was really a 
whimsical thought, and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it ; 
fir I presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary 
to the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply, — 
as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as I have 
observed already, I could never compass — ^no, though I spent not only 
many days, but weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. 
En the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it 
rork, no copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet, all these things not- 
irithstanding, I verily believe, had not these things intervened — I mean 
the frights and (errors I was in about the savages — ^I had undertaken it, 



150 ADYENTUBBS OF 

and perhaps brought it to pass too ; for I seldom gave any thing over 
without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my head enough to 
begin it. 

But my invention now ran quite another way ; for, night and day 1 
could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these monsters in 
their cruel, bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the yictim they 
should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger volume than 
this whole work is intended to be, to set down all the contrivances 1 
hatched, or rather brooded upon in my thoughts, for the destroying these 
creatures, or at least frightening them, so as to prevent their coming 
hither any more ; but all was abortive, — nothing could be possible to take 
effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself;' and what could one man 
do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them 
together, with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they 
could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun ? 

Sometimes I contidved to dig a hole under the place where they made 
their fire, and put in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when they 
kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all that was 
near it ; but as, in the first place, I should be very loth to waste so much 
powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity of one banel, 
so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain time, when it might 
surprise them, and, at best, that it would do little more than just blow 
the fire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make them 
forsake the place: so I laid it aside, and then proposed that I would 
place myself in ambush in some convenient place, with my three guns all 
double-loaded, and, in the middle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at 
them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at 
every shot ; and then falling in upon them with my three pistols, and my 
sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should kill them 
all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I was so fall of 
it that I often dreamt of it, and sometimes that I was just going to let fly 
at them in my sleep. 

I went so far with it in my imagination, that I employed myself 
several days to find out proper places to put myself in ambuscade, as I 
said, to watch for them ; and I went frequently to the place itself, which 
was now grown more familiar to me : and especially while my mind was 
thus filled with thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or 
thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it, the horror I had at the 



BOBINSON CRUSOB. 151 

place, and at the signals of the barbarous wretches deyouriiig one another, 
<2)etted my malice. 

Welly at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where I was 
■tisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming ; and 
ni^t then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey 
njBelf, unseen, into thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow 
\ugd enough to conceal me entirely, and where I might sit and observe 
in their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they 
vers so close t9gether as that it would be next to impossible that I should 
oin my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the 
Snt shot. 

In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design ; and, accordingly, I 
prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets 
I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about 
&e size of pistol bullets; and the fowling piece I loaded with near a 
handful of swan-shot, of the largest size ; I also loaded my pistols with 
iboat four bullets each : and in this posture, well provided with ammuni- 
tion for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and, in my imagina- 
tion, put it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning, up to 
th^ top of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three 
miles, or more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming 
oear the island, or standing over towards it ; but I began to tire of this 
bard duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my watch, 
but came always back without any discovery, there having not in all that 
time been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but not on 
tlie whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach every way. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also 
I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the 
while in a suitable form for so outrageous an execution as the killing 
twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all 
entered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any further than my passions 
Were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of 
tile people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence, 
in his wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide than that 
of their own abominable and vitiated passions ; and, consequently, were 
left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and 
receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned 



L52 ADYBNTUtlBS OF 

of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them 
into. But now, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruit- 
less excursion, which I had made so long and so far every morning in 
vain, so my opinion of the action itself began to alter ; and I began, with 
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was going to engage 
in — what authority, or call, I had to pretend to be judge and executioner 
upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many 
ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the execu- 
tioners of his judgments one upon another ; also how far these people 
were offenders against me, and what right I had to eiigage in the quarrel 
of that blood which they shed promiscuously one upon another. I debated 
this very often with myself, thus : — " How do I know what God himself 
judges in this particular case ? It is certain these people do not eonunit 
this as a crime ; it is not against their own consciences reproving, or their 
light reproaching them. They do not know it to be an offence, and then 
commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins we 
commit. They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war, 
than we do to kill an ox ; nor to eat human flesh than we do to eat 
mutton." 

^Tien I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I waa 
certainly in the wrong in it, — that these people were not murderers in 
the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more 
than those Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners 
taken in battle ; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole 
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw 
down their arms and submitted. 

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the usage they gate 
one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to 
me : these people had done me no injury, — ^that if they attempted mc, or 
I saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to fall upon them, 
something might be said for it ; but that I was yet out of their power, 
and they had really no knowledge of me, and consequently no design 
upon me, and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them : 
that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards i^ all their bar- 
barities practised in America, where they destroyed millions of these 
people, who — however they were idolaters and barbarians, and had 
several bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing 
human bodies to their idols — ^were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent 



I 






ROBINSON CBUSOB. 153 

people, and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with 
the utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards themselves, 
at this time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere 
hatchery — a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to 
God or man, and such as for which the very name of a Spaniard is 
reckoned to be MghtM and teixible to all people of humanity, or of 
Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly 
eminent for the product of a race of men who were without principles of 
tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is 
reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the mind. 

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full 
stop ; and I began, by little and little, to be off my design, and to con- 
clude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution 4o attack the savages 
—that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they first 
attacked me, and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent; but 
that if I were discovered and attacked, then I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this really was the 
▼ay, not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for 
unless I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at 
that time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of 
them escaped to tell their country-people what had happened, they would 
come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and 
1 should only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at present I 
had no manner of occasion for. 

' Upon the whole, I concluded that neither in principle nor in policy 
I ought, one way or other, to concern myself in this affair ; that my 
hnainess was by all possible means to conceal myself from them, and not 
to leave the least signal to them to guess by that there were any living 
creatures upon the island, — I mean of human shape. 

Religion joined in with this prudential resolution, and I was convinced 
iM)w, many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying 
^ my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures, — ^I mean 
uinocent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one 
Another, I had nothing to do with them; they were national, and I 
ought to leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor of nations, 
and knows how, by national punishments, to make a just retribution for 
national offences, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in 
a public manner, by such ways as best please Him.

N this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and 
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these 
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill 
to see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know 
whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that I 
might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against 
them, or be provoked by any advantage which might present 
itself, to fall upon them : only this I did, I went and removed 
^y boat, which I had on the other side of the island, and carried it down 
to the east end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove which 
I found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the 
currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats, 
^pon any accoimt whatsoever. ^ 

With my boat I carried away every thing that I had left there 
longing to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, viz., 
A mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, 
I>ut, indeed, which could not be called either anchor or grappling ; how- 
<^er, it was the best I could make of its kind. All these I removed, 
that there might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or any appear- 
ance of any boat, or of any human habitation, upon the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, and 
Seldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant employment, 
^., to milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, 
which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was quite out of

ADYBNTURES OF 



danger ; for certam it is, that these savage people, who eometimei branted 
this island, never came with any thoughts of finding any thing here, and 
conseqnently never wandered off from the coast, and I donbt not but 
they might hare been several times on shore after my apprehensions of 
them had made me cantioas, as well as before ; and, indeed, I looked back 




with some horror npon the thou^ts of what my condition vonld hsrs 
been if I had chopped upon them and been discovered before that, when 
— naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded often onlf 
with small shot — I walked every where, peeping and peering about the 
island to see what I could get, — what a Burpriae should I have been in, 
i^ whefl I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead of that, 
seen fiileen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and, by tlis 
swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escaping them ? 

The thoughts of this sometimes snnk my very soul within, me, wA 
distressed my mind so much that I conld not soon recover it ; to think 
what I should have done, and how I not only should not have been able 
to resist thcin, but even should not have had presence of mind enough to 
do what I might have done, much less what now, afW so much con- 
sideration and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed, alter serioni 
tiunking of these things, I would be very melancholy, and sometimM it 
would last a great while ; but I resolved it at last all into thankfulness 
to that Providence which had delivered me from so many unseen dangen, 



BOBINSON CBUSOB. 157 

and liad kept me from those mischiefs which I could no way have been 
the agent in deliyering myself from, because I had not the least notion of 
my such thing depending, or the least supposition of it being possible. 

This renewed a contemplation which often had come to my thoughts 
in former time, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of 
Hearen in the dangers we run through in this life, — how wonderftdly we 
are delivered when we know nothing of it ; how, when we are in a quan- 
dary (as we call it) — a doubt or hesitation whether to go this way or that 
▼ay, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that 
way; nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business, has 
called to go the other way, — yet a strange impression upon the mind, from 
ve know not what springs, and by we know not what power, shall over- 
mle us to go this way, and it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone 
that way which we should have gone, and even to our imagination ought 
to hare gone, we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and 
many like reflections, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that 
▼heneyer I found those secret hints or pressings of my mind, to doing or 
not doing any thing that presented, or to going this way or that way, I 
never failed to obey the secret dictate, though I knew no other reason fop 
it than that such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon my mind. I could 
give many examples of the success of this conduct in the course of my 
life, but more especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this imhappy 
island ; besides many occasions which it is very likely I might have taken 
Notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I saw with now. 
Bat it is never too late to be wise ; and I cannot but advise all consider- 
ing men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as 
Jnine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret inti- 
mations of Providence, let them come from what invisible intelligence 
they will : that I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for, but 
eertainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and a secret commn- 
nication between those embodied and those unembodied, and such a proof 
as can never be withstood,— of which I shall have occasion to give some 
Teiy remarkable instances in the remainder of my solitary residence in 
^ dismal place. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess that 
these anxieties — these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that 
^as now upon me — put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances 
^t I had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences. I had 



158 ADVENTUBEB OF 

the care of my Bofety more now upon my hands than that of my food. I 
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise 1 
should make should be heard ; much less would I fire a gun, for the same 
reason, and, above all, I was intolerably imeasy at making any fire, lest 
the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betny 
me; and for this reason I removed that part of my business which 
required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, etc., into my new apait- 
ment in the woods, where, after I had been some time, I found, to mj 
unsx>eakable consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in 
a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth 
of it, would be so hardy as to venture in, nor, indeed, would any man 
else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, 
by mere, accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe 
all such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick 
branches of trees to make charcoal ; and, before I go on, I must obseire 
the reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus : 

I was a&aid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; 
and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking my 
meat, etc. : so I contrived to bum some wood here, as I had seen done in 
England, under turf, till it became chark, or dry coal ; and then, putting 
the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the servioeB 
for which fire was wanting, without danger of smoke. 

But this is by-the-bye. While I was cutting down some wood here, 
I perceived that, behind a very thick branch of low brushwood or mider- 
wood, there was a kind of hollow place : I was curious to look into it, 
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it was pretty 
large, — that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and per- 
haps another with me ; but I must confess to you I made more haste oat 
than I did in, when, looking farther into the place, and which was 
perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature — whether 
devil or man I knew not — ^which twinkled like two stars, the dim light 
from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection. 

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to call 
myself a thousand fools, and tell myself that he that was afraid to see 
the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and that 
I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave that was more frightful 
than myself. Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a greftt 



ROBINSON CBUSOB. 159 

fiiebrandy and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: 
I had not got three steps in, but I was almost as much Mghted as I 
¥88 before, for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, 
ind it was followed by a broken noise, as if of words half expressed, and 
then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed struck with 
BQch a surprise that it put me into a cdld sweat ; and if I had had a hat 
on my head, I will not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted 
it off. But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encourag- 
ing myself a little with considering that the power and presence of God 
was every where, and was able to protect me — upon this I stepped 
fomaid again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little 
3Ter my head, I saw lying on the ground,' a most monstrous, Mghtful, 
old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for life, and 
djing, indeed, of mere old age. 

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to 
get up, but was not able to raise himself ; and I thought with myself he 
mig^t even lie there, for if he had Mghted me so, he would certainly 
fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come in 
there while he had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, 
when I found the cave was but very small, — that is to say, it might be 
tWt twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round or square, 
lU) hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere 
Datnrs. I observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it 
that went in further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon 
niy hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not : so, 
hanng no candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come 
•gain the next day, provided with candles and a tinderbox, which I had 
nude of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildflre in the pan. 

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of 
Diy own making, for I had made very good candles now of goat's tallow ; 
<uid going into this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours, as I 
We sa^ almost ten yards, which, by the way, I thought was a venture 
Md enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what 
^88 beyond it. When I was got through the strait, I found the roof rose 
^Jier up, I believe near twenty feet ; but never was such a glorious 
sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was to look round the sides and 
^ of this vault or cave. The wall reflected a hundred thousand lights 



160 ADVENTURES OP 

to me from my two candles ; what it was in the rock, whether diamonds^ 
or any other precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I 
knew not. 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind, 
as could be expected, though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, 
and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no 
nauseous or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any damp 
or wet on the sides or roof: the only difficulty in it was the entrance, 
which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I 
wanted, I thought that was a convenience,— so that I was really rejoiced 
at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those 
things which I was most anxious about to this place ; particularly, I 
resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare anns, 
viz., two fowling-pieces (for I had three in all), and three muskets (for 
of them I had eight in all), so I kept at my castle only five, which stood 
ready mounted like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence, and were ready 
also to take out upon any expedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took occasion to 
open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, and which had 
been wet, and I found that the water had penetrated about three or four 
inches into the powder on every side, which caking and growing hard, 
had preserved the inside like a kernel in a shell, so that I had near sixty 
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask ; and this was an 
agreeable discovery to me at that time : so I carried all away thither, 
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, 
for fear of a surprise of any kind : I also carried thither all the lead I had 
left for bullets. 

I fimcied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which were said 
to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them ; 
for I persuaded myself while I was here, if five hundred savages were to 
hunt me, they could never find me out ; or, if they did, they would not 
venture to attack me here. 

The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the mouth of Jhe caTe 
the next day after I made this discovery, and I found it much easier to 
dig a great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than 
to drag him out ; so I interred him there, to prevent o£fence to my nose. 

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this island, aid 
was so naturalized to the place«and to the manner of living, that could 1

hre but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place 
to difitorb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending- 
the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me 
down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had also arrived at some 
]Me diversions and amnsements, which made the time pass more plea- 
santly with me a great deal than it did before ; as, first, I had taught Thj 
Poll, as I noted before, to speak, and he did it so familiarly, and talked 
80 articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me, and he lived 
with me no less than six-and-twenty years: how long he might live 
afterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils 
that they live a hundred years. Perhaps poor Poll may be aHve there 
still, calling after '' Poor Eobin Crusoe" to this day. I wish no English- 
man the ill-luck to come there and hear him ; but, if he did, he would 
certainly believe it was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and 
loTing companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and 
Uien died of mere old age. As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have, 
obeerved, to that degree that I was obliged to shoot several of them at 
first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had; but, at length, 
when the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after some 
time continually driving them from me, and letting them have no pro- 
ton with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two or three 
fiiTonrites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when they had any, I 
always drowned, and these were part of my family. Besides these, I 
always kept two or three household kids about me, which I taught to 
feed out of my hand ; and I had two more parrots, which talked pretty 
^ell, and would all call Bobin Crusoe, but none like my first, nor, indeed, 
^d I take the pains with any of them that I had done with him. I 
had also several tame seafowls, whose names I knew not, which I caught 
upon the shore, and cut their wings ; and the little stakes which I had 
planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good thick grove, 
these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was 
very agreeable to me. So that, as I said above, I began to be very well 
contented with the life I led, if it might but have been secured from 
the dread of the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed ; and it may not be amiss for all people 
who shall meet with my story, to make this just observation from it, viz., 
low frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil which in itself we 
eek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen into, is the most

162 ADYBKTURBS OF 

dreadM to us, is ofkentimes the very means or door of our deliyeranoe, 
by which alone we can be raised again from the affliction we are Men 
into. I conld give many examples of this in the conrse of my nnaccount- 
able life, but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in 
the circumstances of my last years of solitary residence in this island. 

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty- 
third year ; and this, being the southern solstice — ^for winter I cannot call 
it — ^was the particular time of my harvest, and required my being pretty 
much abroad in the fields : when going out pretty'early in the morning, 
even before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a 
light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two 
miles, towards the end of the island where I had observed some savages 
had been, as before ; but not on the other side, but, to my great affliction, 
it was on my side of the island. 

I was, indeed, terribly surprised -at the sight, and stopped short 
within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised ; and 
yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that, if 
these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my com standing 
or cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would immediately 
conclude that there were people in the place, and would then never gite 
over till they had found me out. In this extremity, I went back directly 
to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things without 
look as wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence: 
I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to say, my muskets, 
which were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and 
resolved to defend myself to the last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to 
commend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to 
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. 

After sitting awhile, and musing what I should do in this case, I 
was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer ; so, setting up my 
ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed 
before, and then pulling the ladder up after me, I set it up again, and 
mounted to the top of the hill, and pulling out my perspective glass, 
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flatt on my belly on the 
ground, and began to look for the place. I presently found there i^ere 
no less than nine naked savages, sitting round a small fire they had made, 
not* to warm them,-^for they had no need of that, the weather being 



BOBINSON CRUSOB. 163 

^xtiemdj hot, but, as I supposed, to dress their barbarous diet of human 
flesh, which they had brought, whether alive or dead I could not know. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had haled up upon the 
ihore ; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the 
letoni of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine what 
xmfusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my side 
Ike island, and so near me too ; but when I observed their coming must be 
always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate 
m my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the time 
d the tide of flood, if they were not on shore before : and having made 
tliis observation, I went abroad about my work with the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as the tide made to the west- 
waid, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all 
tway. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they 
went off they went to dancing, and I could easily discern their postures 
and gestures by my glasses : I could not perceive by my nicest observation 
bot that they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon them ; 
bat whether they were men or women, that I could not distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my 
shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great sword by my side, 
without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make, I went 
sway to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all. As 
soon as I got thither, which was not less than two hours (for I could 
not go apace, being so loaden with arms as I was), I perceived there had 
been three canoes more of savages on that place ; and looking out farther, 
I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main. 

This was a dreadfid sight to me, especially when, going to the shore, 
I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had been 
sbont had left behind it, viz., the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of 
Human bodies, eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and 
sport I was so filled with indignation, that I began now to premeditate the 
destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be who or how many soever. 

It seemed evident to me that the visits which they thus made to this 
island were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen months before any 
oume of them came on shore there again, — that is to say, I never saw them, 
nor any footsteps or signals of them, in all that time ; for, as to the rainy 
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far : yet all 
this while I Hved uncomfortably, by reason of constant apprehensions I

■was in of their coming upon me by anipriBe. From whence I obtene, 
that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering, especially 
if there is no room to shake off that expectation, or those apprehenidona. 

Boring all this time I was in the murdering humour, and took up 
most of my hours, which shonld have been better employed, in contriying 




how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very next time I should aw 
them, especially if they should be dlyided, as they were the last time, 
into two parties ; nor did I consider at all, that if I killed one party, 
suppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill 
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, tiUIshouldbeatlengthnolta* 
murderer than they were in being men-caters, and perhaps much more N- 
I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of nasi, 
expecting that I should one day or other fall into the hands of thw 
merciless creatures ; and if I did at any time yenture abroad, it was not 
without looking round me with the greatest cate and caution imaginable' 
And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it waa that I l'*^

dred canoes with them, in a few days, and then I knew what to expect 
HoFerer, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever saw 
aoj more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon 
objore. It is true, they might have been there once or twice, but either 
tliej made no stay, or at least I did not hear them ; but in the month of 
Kay, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I 
had a very strange encounter with them,— of which in its place. 

The perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen months' 
mteryal was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful 
dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night : in the day, great 
trembles overwhelmed my mind, and in the night I dreamed often of 
killing the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify the doing of 
it But to waive all this for a while : it was in the middle of May, on 
the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would 
iBckon, for I marked all upon the post still ; I say, it was on the six- 
teenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a 
great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. 
I know not what was the particular occasion of it, but as I was reading 
in the Bible, and taken up with serious thoughts about my present 
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at 
Bea. This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature from 
^y I had met with before ; for the notions this put into my thoughts 
Were quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste 
imaginable, and in a trice clapped up my ladder to the middle place 
^ the rock and pulled it after me, and, mounting it the secotid time, got 
to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bade me listen for 
ft second gun, which accordingly, in about half a moment, I heard, and, 
by tiie sound knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was 
dnren out with the current in my boat. 

I immediately considered that this must be some ship in distress, and 
tbat they had some comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired 
these guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had this presence 
of mind at that minute, as to think that though I could not help them, it 
nu^t be they might help me : so I brought together all the dry wood I 
<^uld get at hand, and, making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon 
the hilL The wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though the wind 
Mew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that I was certain, if there was 
^y such thing as a ship, they must needs see it ; and no doubt they did^ 



165 ADVENTURES OP 

for as soon as ever my fire blazed up I heard another gtm, and after that 
several others all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long, 
till day broke ; and when it was broad day, and the air cleared np, I sair 
something at a great distance at sea, fiQl east of the island, — ^whetiier a 
sail or a hull I could not distinguish, the distance was so great, and the 
weather still continuing hazy also— at least it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceired that it did 
not move, so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor: and 
being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, 
and ran towards the south-east side of the island, to the rocks where I 
had formerly been carried away with the current ; and getting up there, 
the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my 
great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night upon those con- 
cealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat,-^-and which rocks, 
as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a counter-stream, or 
eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from the most desperate, 
hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my life. 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction ; for it 
seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and 
the rocks being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in Ac 
night, the wind blowing hard at east and east-north-east. Had they seen 
the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I 
thought, have endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help 
of their boat ; but the firing of their guns for help, especially when they saw, 
as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts : First, I imagined 
that upon seeing my light, they might have put themselves into their 
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore, but that the sea going 
very high, they might have been cast away ; other times I imagined that 
they might have lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways^ 
as, particularly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which manf 
times obliges men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to 
throw it overboard with their own hands ; other times I imagined they 
had some other ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of dis- 
tress they had made, had taken them up and carried them off; other 
whiles I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being 
hurried away by the current, were carried out into the great ocean, where 
there was nothing but misery and perishing,— and that, perhaps, they mi^t 
by this time be starving, and in a condition to think of eating one another* 



BOBINSON CBUSOB. 167 

As all tliese were but conjectures at best, so, in tbe condition I was 
ID, I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and 
Jttfy tiiem,-^which had still this good effect on my side, that it gave me 
more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and com- 
Ibrtably provided for me in my desolate condition, and that of two ships' 
Dompanies, who were now cast upon this part of the world, not one life 
ihould be spared but mine. I learnt here again to observe, that it is very 
rare that the providence of God casts us into any condition of life so low, 
IT any misery so great, but we may see something or other to be thankful 
for, and may see others in worse circumstances than our own. 

Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so 
nmch as see room to suppose any of them were saved ; nothing could 
make it rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish 
there, except the possibility only of their being taken up by another ship 
in company ; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the 
least signal or appearance of any such thing. 

1 cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a strange 
longing or hankering of desire I felt in my soul upon this sight, — break- 
ing out sometimes thus : '* Oh, that there had been but one or two, nay, 
or but one soul saved out of the ship, to have escaped to me, that I might 
hi have had one companion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to me, 
and to have conversed with!" In all the time of my solitary life, I 
nerer felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my fellow- 
creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it. 

There are some secret moving springs in the affections, which, when 
tliey are set a-going by some object in view— -or be it some object though 
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by the power of imagina- 
tion — ^that motion carries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent 
eager embracings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable. 

Such were these earnest wishings, that but one man had been saved. 
Oh, ttuit it had been but one ! I believe I repeated the words, " Oh, that 
It had been but one !" a thousand times, and my desires were so moved 
hy it, that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch together, and 
niy fingers press the t>alms of my hands, that if I had had any soft thing 
in my hand it would have crushed it involuntarily ; and my teeth in my 
1^ would strike together, and set against one another so strong, that for 
Bome time I could not part them again. 

Let the naturalist explain these things, and the reason and manner of

tiiem: all I can say to them is — to describe the fact, which Tas ereu 
snTpnaiiig to mo, when I found it: though I knew not iiom -what it 
shonld proceed, it was donbtlew the effect of ardent wishes, and of HtronK 
ideas formed in my mind, Toallsing the comfort which the conTcraaHon ol 
one of my fellow Christians would have been to me. 




But it waa not to be : mtlier their fiite or mine, or both, forbade it • 
for tall the last year of my being on this island, I never knew whetlieT 
any were saved out of that ship or no ; and had only the affliction, some 
days after, to see the corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of 
the island which was next the shipwreck. He had on no clothes hut a 
seaman's waistcoat, a pur of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linoi 
shirt ; hut nothing to direct mc bo much as to gness what nation he was 
of: he had nothing in his pockets but two piecea-of-cight and a tohaoco- 
pipo : the last was to me of ten times more volne than the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat 
to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that 
might be useful to me ; but that did not altogether press me so much ai 
the possibility that there might be yet some living creature on board, 
whose life I might jkot only save, but might, by saving that Ufe, comfort 



R0BIN80N CAUBOE. 169 

my own to the last degree. And this thought clung so to my heart, that 

I could not be quiet night nor day, but I must venture out in my boat on 

board this wreck ; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought 

the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted, 

that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I should be 

wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, 
prepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot 
of firesh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had stiU a 
great deal of that left), and a basket fiiU of raisins ; and thus loading 
myself with every thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the 
TBter out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then 
▼ent home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag fall of rice, 
the umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another large pot faH of 
fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves or barley-cakes, 
mote than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese : all which, 
with great labour and sweat, I brought to my boat, and praying to Qod 
to direct my voyage, I put out ; and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along 
the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the island on the north- 
east side. And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to 
Teotnre or not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran con- 
stantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very 
teirible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, 
iod my heart began to fail me ; for I foresaw that if I was driven into 
^ther of those currents, I should be carried a vast way out to sea, and per- 
^)s out of reach or sight of the island again, and that then, as my boat was 
but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost. 
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my 
Qtterprise, and having haled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I 
'^)ped out, and sat me down upon a little spot of rising ground, very 
(^ensiye and anxious between fear and desire about my voyage ; when, as 
^ Was musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood 
^^me on, upon which my going was for so many hours impracticable, 
^pon this, it presently occurred to me that I should go up to the highest 
•^lece of ground I could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the 
^ or currents lay, when the flood came in, that I might judge whether 
^ I was driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another 
^ay home, with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought was 



170 ADYBNTURB8 OF 

no Booner in mj head but I cast my eye upon a little hill which suffi- 
ciently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had jbl clear view 
of the currents or sets of the tide, and which way I was to goide myself 
in my return. Here I found that, as the current of the ebb set out dose 
by the south point of the island, so the cunent of the flood set in dose by 
the shore of the north side, and that I had nothing to do but to keep to 
the north side of the island in my return, and I should do well enou^. 

Encouraged with this obserration, I reaolved the next morning to set 
out with the first of the tide ; and reposing myself for the nig^t in my 
canoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out. I first 
made a little out to sea, fiQl north, till I began to feel the benefit of the 
current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and 
yet did not so hurry me as the southern side current had done before, and 
so as to take from me all government of the boat ; but having a strong 
steerage with my paddle, I went, I say, at a great rate directly for the 
wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. It was a dismal sight 
to look at: the ship, which, by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, 
jammed in between two rocks: all the stem and quarter of her was 
beaten to pieces with the sea ; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the 
rocks, had run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were 
brought by the board, — ^that is to say, broken short off; but her boltsprit 
was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I came dose to 
her, a dog appeared upon her, which, seeing me coming, yelped and cried, 
and as soon as I called him jumped into the sea to come to me, and I took 
him into the boat, but found him almost dead for hunger and thirst I 
gave him a cake of my bread, and he eat it like a ravenous wolf that had 
been starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature some 
fresh water, with which, if I had let him, he would have burst himself. 

After this, I went on board. The first sight I met with was two 
men drowned in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms 
fast about one another. I conduded, as is indeed probable, that when 
the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high and so con- 
tinually over her, that the men were not able to bear it, and weie 
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water as much as if they 
had been under water. Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the 
ship that had life, nor any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled 
by the water. There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy 
I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water bdng

ebbed oat, I could see; but they were too big to meddle with. I 
saw seTeral chests, which I believe belonged to some of the seamen, and 
I got two of them into the boat, without examining what was in them. 
Had the stem of the ship been fixed, and the fore part broken off, I am 
persuaded I might have made a good voyage ; for, by what I found in 
these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of 
wealth on board : and, if I may guess from the course she steered, she 
must have been bound from Buenos Ayres, or the Bio de la Plata, in the 
south part of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the Gulf 
of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure 
in her, but of no use at that time to anybody ; and what became of the 
rest of her people I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about 
twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty.' There 
were several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about 
four pounds of powder in it : as for the muskets, I had no occasion for 
them, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and 
tongs, which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a 
copper pot to imake chocolate, and a gridiron : and with this cargo and 
the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again ; and the 
same evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again, 
weary and fatigued to the last degree. 

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I resolved to 
harbour what I had gotten in my new cave,^-not to carry it home to my 
castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began 
to examine the particulars. The cask of liquor I found to be a kind of 
rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils, and in a word, not at all 
good ; but when I came to open the chests, I found several things which 
I wanted, — ^for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extra- 
ordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and very good: the 
bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I 
found two pots of very good succades, or sweetmeats, so fastened also on 
the top that the salt water had not hurt them ; and two more of the 
same, which the water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts, 
which were very welcome to me ; and about a dozen and a half of white 
linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths : the former were also very 
welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day. Be- 
sides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found three great bags 



172 



ADTBNTQRBB Or 



of piecei-of-eight, vhich held about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and li I 
one of them, wrapped up in a paper, Bix doubloons of gold and Bomi 
bars or wedges- of gold, — I sappoee they might all weigh near a pound. 

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little ralne: 1 
but hj the cirdunstances, it mnst hare belonged to the gtumer's mitt, I 




thou^ there was no powder in it, but about two pounds of glazed poirdcr 
in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces va 
occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that was of 
much use to me : for as to the money, I had uo manner of occasion i>t 
it ; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have given it aU 
for three or four pair of English shoes and stocUxigs, which were thiop 
I greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet now for many Tears. I 
had indeed gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took off the feet of tlu 
two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I fbnnd two pair mon 
in one of the cheste, which were very welcome to me ; but they weie 
not like our English shoes, either tor ease or service, being rather whit 
we call pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's cheat about fiftf 
pieces-of-eigbt in royals, but no gold : I suppose this belonged to a poom 
man than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer. 

'Well, however, I lugged the money home to my cave, and laid it up. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 173 

as I had done that before wliich I brought from our own ship ; but it was 
great pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my 
aliare, for I am satisfied that I might have loaded my canoe several times 
orer with money, which, if I ever escaped to England, would have lain 
here safe enough till I might have come again and fetched it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I 
went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her 
old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my 
old habitation, where I found every thing safe and quiet. So I began 
to repose myself, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family 
affiairs; and, for a while, I lived easy enough, only that I was more 
Tigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so 
much ; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to 
the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages 
never came, and where I could go without so many precautions and such 
a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went the 
other way. 

I lived in this condition near two years more ; but my unlucky head, 
that was always to let me know it was bom to make my body miserable, 
was all these two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were 
possible, I might get away from this island ; for sometimes I was for 
makLng another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that 
there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage, — sometimes 
for a ramble one way, sometimes another ; and I believe, verily, if I had 
had the boat that I went from Bailee in, I should have ventured to sea, 
bound any where — I knew not whither. 

I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who are 
touched with that general plague of mankind, whence, for aught I know, 
one half of their miseries flow, — I mean that of not being satisfied with 
the station wherein God and nature hath placed them ; for, not to look 
back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my father — 
the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my original sin — ^my subse- 
quent mistakes of the same kind had been the means of my coming into 
this miserable conditicm ; for had that Providence, which so happily had 
seated me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, 
and I could have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have 
been, by this time, — I mean in the time of my being in this island, — 
one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils.* Nay, I am

penoaded, that by the improvements I had made in tiiat little time I 
lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had staid, 
I might have been -worth a bnndied thonsand moidores. And what bus- 
ness had I to leave a settled fortune, a vell-Btocked plantation, impicmiig 
and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes, vrben pstimc 
and time would have so increased our stock at home, that we could hste 
bought tfaem at our door from those whose business it was to fetch them; 
and though it bad cost us something more, yet the difference of that ^m 
was by no means vorth saving at so great a hazard F 

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young beads, so reflection npon tk 
foUy of it is as ordinarily the exercise of more years, or of the dev- 
bought experience of time, — and so it was vith me now ; and yet so deep 
had the mistake tak^k root in my temper, that I could not satia^ mpeV 
in my station, but was continually poring up(m the means and posninlity 
of my escape from this place. And that I may, with &e greater plesnue 
to the reader, bring on the remaining part c^ my story, it may not be im- 
proper to ^ve some account of my first ctmceptionB' on the subject of thi) 
foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what foundatitm, I acted.

AM now to be supposed to be retired into my castle, after my 
late voyage to the wreck — ^my Mgate laid np and secnred under 
water, as usual, and my condition restored to what it was 
before : I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was 
U the richer, for I had no more use for it than the Indians of 
I l^fore the Spaniards came thither. 

IS one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four-and- 
h year of my first setting foot on this island of solitariness, I was 

my bed, or hammock, awake and very well in health, — had no 
• distemper, no uneasiness of body, no, nor any uneasinesss of 
ore than ordinary, but could by no means dose my eyes, that is, 
sleep ; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows : 
as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable crowd of 
I that whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the 

in this night's time : I ran over the whole history of my life 
i;ure, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this 
nd also of that part of my life since I came to this island. In 
ctions upon the state of my case since I came on shore on this

d in erer since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand ; — ^not

nd might have been several hundreds of them at times on shore

there ; but as I had never known it, and was incapable of any appiehen- 
sions about it, my satisfaction was perfect though my danger was the 
same, and I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had neyer 
really been exposed to it. This famished my thoughts with many very 
profitable reflections, and particularly this one : How infinitely good that 
Proyidence is, which has provided, in its government of mankind, each 
narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things ; and though he 
walks in the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if 
discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept 
serene and calm, by having the events of things hid from his eyes, and 
knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I- came to 
reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in 
this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, 
and with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but a brow 
of a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been betrreen 
me and the worst kind of destruction, viz., that of falling into the hands of 
cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view 
as I did on a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime to kill 
and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or curlew. I should imjustlj 
slander myself, if I should say I was not sincerely thankM to my 
great Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with grwt 
humility, that all these unknown deliverances were due, and withont 
which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken 
up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures, — I mean the 
savages, and how it came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of 
all things should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, 
to something so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its own 
kind ; but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it 
occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these wretches Hved 
in ? how far off the coast was from whence they came ? what they ven- 
tured so far from home for? what kind of boats they had? and why 
I might not order myself and my business so, that I might be as able 
to go over thither as they were to come to me ? 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with 
myself when I came thither ; what would become of me, if I fell into 
the hands of the savages ; or how I should escape from them, if they 



ROBINSON CBUBOB. 177 

ittempted me ; — no^ nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach 
Qie coasty and not be attempted by some or other of them, without any 
possibility of deUvering myself; and if I should not fall into their hands, 
▼bat I should do for provision, or whither I should bend my course: 
none of th^e thoughts, I say, so much as came m my way ; but my mind 
was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing orer m my boat to the 
nain land. I looked upon my present condition as the most miserable 
that could possibly be; that I was not able to throw myself into any 
tlung, i)ut death, that could be called worse ; that if I reached the shore 
(tf the main, I might perhaps meet with relief, or J might coast along, as 
I did on the shore of Ai^ca, till I came to some inhabited country, and 
where I might find some relief; and after all, perhaps, I might fall in 
with wjme Christian ship that might take me in ; and, if the worst came 
to the worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all these 
Buseries at once. Pray note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, 
an impatient temper, made, as it were, desperate by the long continuance of 
my troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been on 
board of^ and where I had been so near the obtaining what I so earnestly 
koged tot, wiz., somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from, 
of the place where I was and of the probable means of my deliverance, — 
I lay I was agitated wholly by these thoughts. All my calm of mind, in 
my resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of 
Heaven, seemed to be suspended, and I had, as it were, no power to turn 
my thoughts to any thing but to the project of a voyage to the main, 
which came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, 
that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such 
^eace that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as 
hi^ as if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of 
my mind about it, nature— as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with 
the very thought of it — threw me into a sound sleep. One would have 
tlumg^t I should have dreamt of it, but I did not, nor of any thing relat- 
ing to it ; but I dreamt that as I was going out in the morning, as usual, 
^om my castle, I .saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages 
<^Qmi]ig to land, and that they brought with them another savage whom 
^ were going to kill, in order to eat him, — ^when, on a sudden, the 
aavage that they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life ; 
^ I thought, in my sleep, that he came running into my little thick 

12 



178 ADYBNTURBB OF 

grove before my fortification, to hide himself, and. that I, seeing bim 
alone, and not perceiving that the others songht him that way, shoved 
myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him ; that he kneeled 
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him, upon which I showed 
my ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became 
my servant ; and that as soon as I had gotten this man, I said to myself 
"iNow I may certainly venture to the main land; for this fellow will 
serve me as pilot, tind will tell me what to do, and whither to go for pro- 
visions, and whither not to go for fear of being devoured ; what places to 
venture into, and what to escape." I waked with this thought, and was 
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape 
in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon coming to 
myself and finding it was no more than a dream, were equally extra- 
vagant the other way, and threw me into a very great dejection of 
spirit. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion — ^that my only way to 
go about an attempt for an escape was, if possible, to get a savage isto 
my possession ; and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners whm 
they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to kilL But 
these thoughts still were attended with this difficulty, that it was 
impossible to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of them, and 
killing them all : and this was not only a very desperate attempt^ and 
might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the 
lawfulness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding 
so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not repeat 
the arguments which occurred to me against this, they being the same 
mentioned before : but though I had other reasons to offer now, vix., 
that those men were enemies to my life, and would devour me if thej 
could; that it was self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deUrer 
myself from this death of a life, and was acting in my own defence aa 
much as if they were -actually assaulting me, and the like ; — I say, 
though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human 
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I could by 
no means reconcile myself to a great while. 

However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after 
great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way and another 
struggled in my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of 
deliverance at length mastered all the rest ; and I resolved, if possibki 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 179 

to get one of these savages into my hands, cost what it wonld. My next 
thing, then, was to contriye how to do it, and this indeed was very 
difficult to resolve on ; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for 
it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they 
came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking such measures as 
the opportunity should present, let be what would be. 

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as 
often as possible, and indeed so often, till I was heartily tired of it ; for 
it was above a year and a half that I waited, and for great part of that 
time went out to the west end and to the south-west comer of the island, 
afanost every day, to see for canoes, but none appeared. This was very 
discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I cannot say that 
it did in this case— as it had done some time before that-^wear off the 
edge of my desire to the thing ; but the longer it seemed to be delayed, 
the more eager I was for it : in a word, I was not at first so careM to 
shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was 
now eager to be upon them. 

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, — nay, two or three 
savages^ if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do 
whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being able at any 
time to do me any hurt It was a great while that I pleased myself with 
this affair, but nothing still presented ; all my fancies and schemes came 
to nothing, for no savages came near me for a great while. 

About a year and a half after I had entertained these notions, and by 
long musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of 
an occasion to put them in execution, I was surprised, one morning early, 
with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side the 
island, and the people who belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight. 
The number of them broke all my measures, — ^for seeing so many, and 
knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more, in a 
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my measures to 
attack twenty or thirty men single-handed ; so I lay still in my castle, 
perplexed and discomforts : however, I put myself into all the same 
postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for 
action, if anything had presented. Having waited a good while, 
listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient, 
I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of 
the hill by my two stages, as usual, standing so, however, that my head 



180 ADYBNTUBBS 07 

did not appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any 
means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective g^aas, that they 
were no less than> thirty in number, that they had a £b:e kindled, and 
that they had had meat dressed ; how they had cooked it, that I knew 
not, or what it waa, but they were all dancing, in I know not how many 
barbarous gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspectiTe, 
two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, tiiey 
were laid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I peroeiTed 
one of them immediately fell, being knocked down, I suppose, witli a 
dub or wooden sword, for that was their way, and two or three ottoB 
were at work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the 
other victim* was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for 
him. In that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at 
liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from 
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands directly tovaids 
me — I mean towards that part of the coast where my habitation was. 

I was dreadfully Mghted (that I must acknowledge) when I perceived 
him to run my way, and especially when, as I thought, I saw Um 
pursued by the whole body ; and now I expected that part of my dieam 
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my 
grove, — but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream for the 
rest of it, viz., that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and 
find him there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to 
recover when I found that there were not above three men that followed 
him, and stiU more was I encouraged when I found that he outstiipped 
them exceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that, if be 
could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away 
from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentiooed 
often at the first part of my story, when I landed my cargoes out of ^ 
ship ; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor 
wretch would be taken there : but when the savage escaping cane 
thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up, but plunging 
in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and na 
on with exceeding strength and swiftness* When the three penooB 
came to the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the tbiid 
could not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others^ 



BOBINSON CBU&OB. 181 

but went no farther, and soon afto went sofQy back again, which, as it 
hsppenedf was very well for him in the main. 

I obserred that the two who swam were yet more than twioe as long 
swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It 
eame now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that 
DOW was my time to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or 
Mnstant, and that I was called plainly by Brovidence to save this poor 
settnre's life. I immediately ran down the ladders with all possible 
izpedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both but at the foot of 
the ladders, as I observed above ; and, getting up again with the same 
laste, to the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and having a very 
dunrt cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way between the pur- 
men and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking 
Mek, was at first, perhaps, as much frighted at me as at them ; but I 
l)eekoned with my hand to him to come back, and in the meantime I 
dowly advanced towards the two that followed, then rushing at once 
ipon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I 
was loth to fire, because I would not have the rest hear, though, at that 
iistance, it would not have been easily heard, and being out of sight of 
Qie smoke too, they would not have easily known what to make of it. 
Kaving knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him stopped, as 
if he had been frighted, and I advanced apace towards him ; but as I came 
hearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting 
tt to shoot at me, — so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which 
I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who fled, but 
had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed (as he 
thought), yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece, that 
be stood stock-still, and neither came forward nor went backward, though 
be seemed rather inclined to fly still, than to come on. I hallooed again 
bo him, and made signs to come forward, which he easily understood, and 
came a little way — ^then stopped again, and then a little farther, an^ 
stopped again ; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if 
he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two 
enemies were. I beckoned him again to come to me, and gave him all 
the signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he came nearer 
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of ac- 
knowledgment for my saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked 
pleaaantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer ; at length he came 



182 ADYBNTURBB OF 

close tx) me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the gronnd, and laid 
his head upon the gronnd, and, taking me by the foot, set my foot upon 
his head : this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slaye for erer. 
I took him ap, and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could 
But there was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the savage whom 
I knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began 
to dome to himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him the sayage, ! 
that he was not dead : upon this he spoke some words to me, and though 
I could not understand thein, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear, . 
for they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own | 
excepted, for above twenty-five years. But there was no time for such | 
reflections now : the savage who was knocked down recovered himself bo 
far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to 
be afraid ; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, 
as if I would shoot him : upon this my savage, for so I call him now, 
made a motion to me to lend him my sword which hung naked in a belt 
by my side ; — so I did : he no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, 
and, at one blow, cuts off his head as cleverly, no executioner in Germany 
could have done it sooner or better, — which I thought very strange for 
one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, 
except their own wooden swords : however, it seems, as I learned after- 
wards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood 
is so hard, that they will cut off heads even with them, aye and arms, and 
that at one blow too. When he had done this, he comes laughing to 
me, in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and witli 
abundance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it down with the 
head of the savage that he had killed, just before me. 

But that which astonished him most was to know how I had killed 
the other Indian so far off ; so, pointing to him, he made signs to me 
to let him go to him : so I bade him go, as well as I could. "When 
he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him, — ^turned him 
first on one side, then on the other, looked at the wound the bullet had 
made, which it seems was just in his breast where it had made a hole, 
and no great quantity of blood had followed ; but he had bled inwaidlyi 
for he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came 
back ; so I turned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow me, maldng 
signs to him that more might come after them. Upon this, he signed 
to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might not bo

een by the rest, if they followed ; and so I made signs again to him to 
b 80. He fell to work, and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the 
and with his hands big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged 
lim into it and coyered him, and did so also by the other : «I believe 
tie had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him 
away, I carried him not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave on 
the farther part of the island ; so I did not let my dream come to pass 
b that part, viz. that he came into my grove for shelter. 

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught 
of water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for, by his 
niiming; and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go lie 
down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had laid a great parcel 
of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself 
sometimes. So the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep. 

He was a comely, handsome fellow — perfectly well made, with 
straight, strong limbs, not too large — ^tall, and well shaped, and, as I 
reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, 
not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly 
in his face ; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of an Euro- 
pean in his countenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair was 
^ng and black, not curled like wool ; his forehead very high and large, 
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour 
of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of an 
Ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and 
(>ther natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour, 
that had in it something very agreeable, though not very easy to 
lescribe. His face was round and plump ; his nose small, not flat 
ike the Negroes; a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well 
let, and white as ivory. After he had slumbered — rather than slept — 
ibout half an hour, he waked again, and comes out of the cave to me, 
or I had been milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure just 
)y : when he espied me, he came running to me, laying himself down 
gain upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble, thank- 
iil disposition, making a great many antic gestures to show it. At 
ast, he lays his head fiat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets 
Qy other foot upon his head, as he had done before ; and after this 
nade all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission imagin- 
ible, to let me know how he would serve me as long as he lived. I 



ia4 ADYBNTUBBS 07 

understood him in many things, and let him know I was very weQ 
pleased with him. In a little time I began to speak to him^ and teach 
him to speak to me ; and, first, I made him know his name should be 
Fbidat, which was the day I sayed his life : I called him so for Hie 
memory of the time. I likewise taught him to say ^'Master:" and 
then let him know that was to be my name : I likewise taught him to 
say " Yes" and " No," and to know the meaning of .them. I gaye 
him some milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before 
him, and sop my bread in it ; and I gaye him a cake of bread to do 
the like, which he quickly compHed with, and made signs that it was 
very good for him. 

I kept there with him all that night, but as soon as it was day I 
beckoned to him to come with me, and let him know I would give 
him some clothes, at which he seemed very glad, for he was staik 
naked. As we went by the place where he had buried the two men, 
he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he had 
made to find them again, making signs to me that we should dig them 
up again, and eat them. At this I appeared very angry, expressed 
my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, 
and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he did imme- 
diately, with great submission. I then led him up to the top of the 
hill, to see if his enemies were gone ; and pulling out my glass, I 
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no appea^ 
ance of them or their canoes, — so that it was plain they were gone, 
and had left their two comrades behind them, without any search after 
them. 

But I was not content with this discovery ; but having now more 
courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took. my man Friday witli 
me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his 
back, which I found he could use very dexterously, making him carry 
one gim for me, and I two for myself; and away we marched to the 
place where these creatures had been, for I had a mind now to get 
some fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the place, my very 
blood ran chill in my veins and my heart sunk within me at the horror 
of the spectacle : indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to 
me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered with 
human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, great pieces of flesh 
left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched, and, in short, all 







tj

BOBINBON GBUSOB. 185 

I tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after 
ictory oyer their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the 
M of three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of 
bodies; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they 
ight over four prisoners to feast upon — that three of them were 
a up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth ; that there 
been a great battle between them and their next king, whose sub- 
f it seems, he had been one of, and that they had taken a great 
ber of prisoners, all which were carried to several places by those 
had taken them in the fight, in order to feast upon them, as was 
here by these wretches upon those they brought hither, 
caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whateyer 
ined, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon 
ad bum them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering 
ach after some of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature ; 
E discovered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at 
least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it, — ^for I had, 
rme means, let him know that I would kill him if he ofPered it. 
^en we had done this we came back to our castle, and there I 
to work for my man Friday ; and, first of all, I gave him a pair of 
I drawers which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I mentioned, 
h I found in the wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted 
very well; then I made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as 
Bkill would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good tailor; 
[ gave him a cap, which I made of a hare's skin, very convenient and 
onable enough : and thus he was clothed for the present, tolerably 
and was mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed 
is master. It is true, he went awkwardly in these things at first: 
ing the drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the 
tcoat galled Ms shoulders, and the inside of his arms ; but a little 
% them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to 
L, at length he took to them very well. 

?he next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began 
msider where I should lodge him; and that I might do well for 
and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him, in 
vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the 
and in the outside of the first : and as there was a door or entrance 
B into my cave, I made a formal framed doorcase, and a door to it 



i 



186 ADYBNTUBEB OF 

of boards, and set it up in the passage a little within the entrance; 
and, causing the door to open on the inside, I barred it up in the 
night, taking in my ladders to ; so that Friday could no way come at 
me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise 
in getting over that it must needs waken me : for my first wall had 
now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and 
leaning up to the side of the hill, which was again laid across with 
smaller sticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness 
with the rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds ; and at the hole or 
place which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind 
of trapdoor, which, if it had been attempted on the outside, would not 
have opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great 
noise : and as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never man had a more 
fEuthfol, loving, sincere servant than Priday was to me : without pas- 
sions, Bullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged, his veiy 
affections were tied to me like those of a child to a father ; and I dare 
say he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon any 
occasion whatsoever ; the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out 
of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions 
as to my safety on his account. 

This frequently -gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, 
that however it had pleased God, in his providence, and in the govern- 
ment of the works of his hands, to take from so great a part of tlie 
world of his creatures the best uses to which «their faculties and the 
powers of their souls are adapted, — ^yet that he has bestowed upon them 
the same powers, the same reason, the same affections, the same senti- 
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of 
wrongs, the tome sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and aU the 
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that he has given to ns; 
and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, they 
are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the right uses for 
which they were bestowed, than we are. And this made me veiy 
melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, 
how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have these 
powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of Grod, 
and by the knowledge of his word added to our understanding; and 
why it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from so many 



BOBINBON CBUBOS. 187 

18 of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would 
1 much better use of it than we did. 

3m hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the sovereignty 
Tidence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a dis- 
n of things, that should hide that light from some, and reveal it 
ers, and yet expect a like duty from both ; but I shut it up, and 
d my thoughts with this conclusion — first, that we do not know 
lat light and law these should be condemned; but that, as God 
.ecessarily, and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and 
to it could not be but that if these creatures were all sentenced 
mce from himself, it was on account of sinning against that light, 
, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such 
as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the 
ition was not discovered to us ; and, secondly, that stiU, as we 
I clay in the hands of the potter, no vessel could say to him, 
r hast thou formed me thus ?" 

t to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted with 
nd made it my business to teach him every thing that was proper 
ke him useful, handy, and helpfrd, but especially to make him 
and understand me when I spoke : and he was the aptest scholar 
ver was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, 
> pleased when he could but iinderstand me, or make me under- 
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now 
3 began to be so easy, that I began to say to myself, that could 
have been safe from more savages, I cared not if I was never to 
3 from the place while I lived.

CHAPTER XIV. 

Ckufloe attempts to reeUdm Friday firom eaimibaUiin, and oo&Tenea with him about hia eomitty tad

Pagan priestcraft— Friday finds it difflcolt to accoont for the existence at ctiI— The Mvage 
beeomes a Christlaa, and Cnnoe is completely happy. 

FTER I had been two or three da3r8 retamed to my casUe, 
I thought that, in order to bring Friday off from his 
horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's 
stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took 
him out with me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intoiding 
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it; 
but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two 
young kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday. "Hold," said 
I; "stand still;" and made signs to him not to stir. Immediatelj 
I presented my piece, shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor 
creature, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the sayage— his 
enemy, but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was done, was 
sensibly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that I 
thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had 
shot at, or perceive that I had killed it, but ripped up his waistooal, 
to feel if he was not wounded ; and, as I found presently, thought I 
was resolved to kill him, for he came and kneeled down to me, and 
embracing my knees, said a great many things I did not understand," 
but I could easily see that his meaning was, to pray me not to IdU 
him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; 
and, taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and, pointing to tbe 
kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which 
he did: and while he was wondering, and looking to see how the 



ROBINSON OBUBOB. 189 

reatnie was killed, I loaded my gun again : and, by and by, I saw a great 
Dwl, like a hawk, sit upon a tree, within shot ; — so, to let Friday nnder- 
tand a little what I wonld do, I called him to me again, pointing at 
he fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a 
Uiwk, — ^I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to th0 
praond under the parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I made 
dm understand that I would shoot and kill that bird. Accordingly, I 
ired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He 
tood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all that I had said to 
m; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did not see me 
Qt any thing into the gun, but thought there must be some wonderfid 
and of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, 
r any thing, near or far off : and the astonishment this created in him was 
ach as could not wear off for a long time, and I beHeye, if I would 
Are let him, he would have worshipped me and my gun. As for the 
:im itself, he would not so much as touch it for several days after; 
ut would speak to it and talk to it as if it had answered him, when 
e was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire 
t not to Vi'll him. 

Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to 
im to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stayed 
yme time ; for the parrot, liot being quite dead, had fluttered a good 
^y from the place where she fell : however, he found her, took her 
p, and brought her to me ; and as I had perceived his ignorance about 
le gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not 
t him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark that 
i^t present. But nothing else offered at that time, — so I brought 
)me the kid, and the same evening I took the skin of^ and cut it out 

well as I could ; and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or 
3wed some of the flesh, and made some very good broth. After I had 
gun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very ^ad 
it, and liked it very well ; but that which was strangest to him, 
18 to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the salt 
18 not good to eat ; and, putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed 
nauseate it, aqd would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth 
th fresh water after it : on the other hand, I took some meat in my 
rath without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of 
tf as fast as he had done at the salt ; but it would not do— he would 



190 . ADYBNTURBS OP 

never care for salt with his meat or in his broth, at least not a great wbik^ 
and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved 
to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid : this I did, 
by hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen many people do 
in England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one 
cross on the top, and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the 
meat turn continually. This Friday admired very much ; but when he 
came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he 
liked it, that I could not but understand him, and at last he told me 
that he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very glad 
to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some com out, and 
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before ; and he soon 
imderstood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen wliat 
the meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of : for after that 
I let him see me make my bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time 
Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it 
myself. 

I began now to consider that, having two mouths to feed instead d 
one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger 
quantity of com than I used to do : so I inarked out a larger piece of 
land, and began the fence in the same manner as before, in which 
Friday not only worked very willingly and very hard, but did it yery 
cheerfully : and I told hiTn what it was for — ^that it was for com to 
make more bread, because he was now with me, and that I might hate 
enough for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible of that part, 
and let me know that he thought I had much more labour upon me on 
his accoimt than I had for myself; and that he would work the harder 
for me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place. 
Friday began to talk pretty well, and imderstand the names of almo^ 
every thing I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send 
him to, and talk a great deal to me, — so that, in short, I began now to 
have some use for my tongue again, which, indeed^ I had very little 
occasion for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure 
of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself' 
his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more every dajy 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 191 

tni I began really to love the creature ; and, on his side, I believe he 
loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love any thing before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his 
own country again; and, having learned him English so well that he 
could answer me almost any questions, I asked him whether the nation 
that he belonged to never conquered in battle ? At which he smiled, 
and said, "Yes, yes, we always fight the better,"— that is, he meant, 
always get the better in fight ; and so we began the following discourse : 
"You always fight the better?" said I, "how came you to be taken 
prisoner then, Friday?" 

Fbeday. My nation beat much, for all that. 

Master. How beat ? If your nation beat them, how came you to be 
taken? 

Fbiday. They more many than my nation in the place where^me was ; 
they take one, two, three, and me ; my nation overheat them in the 
yonder place^ where me no was ; there my nation take one, two, great 
thousand. 

Master. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of 
your enemies, then ? 

FRinAY. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the canoe ; 
my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the men, 
they take ? Do they carry them away and eat them, as these did ? , 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up. 

Master. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other place, where they think. 

Master. Do they come hither ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else place. 

Master. Have you been here with them ? 

Friday. Yes, I have been here ; (points to the north-west side of the 
island, which, it seems, was their side.) 

By this I imderstood that my man Friday had formerly been among 
the savages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island, 
on the said man-eating occasions that he was now brought for ; and 
some time after, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being 
the same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told 
ne he was there once when they eat up twenty men, two women, and 
me child : he could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them

by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing to me to tell tko 
over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces wliat follows,— tint 
after I had had this discourse with him, I asked him how far it was 
from onr island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost 
He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that, after 
a little way out to sea, there was a current and a wind, alwap one 
way in the morning, the other in the afternoon. 

This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going 
out or coming in ; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the 
great draft and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque, in the mouth of 
which river, as I found afterwards, our island lay ; and that the land 
which I perceived to the west and north-west was the great iaUnd 
Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday 
a thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, tiie 
coast, and what nations were near : he told me all he knew, with the 
greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the sereral 
nations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than Caiibs : 
from whence I easily understood that these were the Caiibbees, irtiA 
our maps place on that part of America which reaches from the mouth 
of the river Oroonoque to Guiana, and onwards to St. Martha. He told 
me that up a great way beyond the moon — ^that was, beyond the setting 
of the moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt white 
bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which 1 
mentioned before, and that they had kiUed much mans — ^that was his 
word, — ^by which I understood, he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelti^ 
in America had been spread over whole countries, and were remembered 
by all the nations, from father to son. 

I enquired if he could teU me how I might come from this island, and 
get among those white men: he told me, ''Yes, yes, I might go in 
two canoe." I could not imderstand what he meant, or make him 
describe to me what he meant, by two canoe, till at last, with great 
difficulty, I found he meant that it must be in a large great boat, as big 
as two canoes. 

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very well ; 
and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time or other, I 
might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place, and that 
this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.

Daring tbe long time that Fiiday had now been vith me, and that be 
pa to Bpeok to me, and understand me, I was not venting to ky a foon- 
tiaii of religjoufl knowledge in hie mind. I oaked him, one time, who 
dc him ? The poor creature did not nnderatand me at all, but thought 




id asked who wac hia &ther ? but I took it by another handle, and 
id him who made the sea, the ground we walked on, and the hilla 
woodfl ? He told me, it was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond 
: he conld deeciibe nothing of this great peraon, but that he was very 



194 ADTENTUREB OF 

old, much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or ^ 
stars. I asked him then, if this old person had made all things, wliy ^ 
not all things worship him ? He looked very grave, and with a perfe^ 
look of innocence said, " All things said to him !" I asked him if ^ 
people who die in his country went away any where ? He said, " Yes 5 
they all went to Benamuckee." Then I asked him whether those thef 
eat up went thither too ? He said, " Yes." 

Prom these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the 
true God. I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there, 
pointing up towards heaven ; that he governs the world by the same 
power and providence by which he made it ; that he was omnipotent, 
could do every thing for us, give every thing to us, take every thing from 
us ; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He listened with gieat 
attention, and received with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being 
sent to redeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, and 
his being able to hear [us, even in heaven. He told me one day, that if 
our Gt>d could hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a greater 
Gt>d than their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could 
not heai;. till they went up to the great mountains where he dwelt to 
speak to him. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak to him? 
He said, " No ; they never went that were young men : none went 
thither but the old men," whom he called their Oowookakee, — that is, as 
I made him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy; and that thej 
went to say, " 0" (so he called saying prayers), and then came back, and 
told them what Benamuckee said. By this I observed, that there is 
priestcraft even among the most blinded, ignorant pagans in the world; 
and the policy of making a secret of religion, in order to preserve the 
veneration of the people to the clergy, is to be found among all rehgions 
in the world, even among the most brutish and barbarous savages. 

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday, and told him 
that the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say 
** " to their god Benamuckee was a' cheat, and their bringing word from 
thence what he said was much more so ; that if they met with any 
answer, or spoke with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit ; and 
then I entered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the original 
of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his 
setting himself up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead 
of Gt)d, and as God, and the many stratagems he made use of to delude 



ROBINBON 0RU8OB. 195 

I ^Kunkmd to their ruin ; how he had a secret access to our passions and 
^ m affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations as to cause ns 
^^ to be our own tempters, and to run upon our destruction by our own 



I fonnd it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind about 
tfie devil, as it was about the being of a God : nature assisted all my 
Hj^nments to evidence to him even the necessity of a great First Cause, 
mi overruling governing Power, a secret, directing Providence — and of 
Ik equity and justice of paying homage to him that made us, and the 
like. But there appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil 
tfmtf'^af his original, his being, his nature, and, above all, of his 
inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so too ; and the poor 
creature puzzled me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural 
aid innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. 

I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of Ood, his 
cmnipotence, his dreadful aversion to sin — ^his being a consuming fire to 
ihe workers of iniquity, — how, as he had made us all, he could 
destroy us and all the world in a moment ; and he listened with great 
Kriousness to me all the while. After this, I had been telling him how 
file devil was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice 
and skill to defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the 
kingdom of Christ in the world, and the like. '' Well," says Friday, 
''but you say Gt>d is so strong, so great ; is he not much strong, much 
Ba^t as the devil?" "Yes, yes," says I, "Friday, God is stronger 
klian the devil : God is above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to 
kiead him under our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations, and 
^nch his fiery darts." " But," says he again, " if God much strong, 
much might as the devil, why God no kill the devil, so make him no 
more do wicked ? " 

I was strangely surprised at his question; and, after all, though I 
was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill enough 
qoahfied for a casuist, or a solver of difficulties, — and, at first, I could 
Bot tell what to say, so I pretended not to hear him, and asked him what 
be said? but he was too earnest for an answer, to forget his questioUi 
BO Uiat he repeated it in the very same broken words as above. By this 
time I had recovered myself a little, and I said, " God will at last punish 
Um severely ; he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the 
bottomless pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy 



196 ADYENTURBS OF 

Friday ; but he retams upon me, repeating my wordB, ** Eeserre at last: 
me no understand ; but why not kill the deyil now — not kill great ago?' 
'< Tou may as well ask me/' said I, ^' why God does not kill you and me, 
when we do wicked things here that offend him ? We are preserved ta 
repent and be pardoned." He muses a while at this. ^'Well, weU," 
says he, mighty affectionately, '^ that well : so you, I, deyil, all wid^ed, 
all preserve, repent, Gt>d pardon all." Here I was run down again bj 
him to the last degree ; and it was a testimony to me, how the mere 
notions of nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to tbe 
knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the supreme bdng 
of God, as the consequence of our nature, yet nothiug but divine revelft- 
Hoa can form the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a redemptun 
purchased for us ; of a Mediator ; of a new covenant ; and of an Inte^ 
cessor at the footstool of God's throne : I say, nothing but a revelatum 
^m Heaven can form these in the soul, and that, therefore, the gospel d 
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I mean the Word of God, and the 
Spirit of God, promised for the guide and sanctifier of his people, are the 
absolutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in the saving know- 
ledge of God, and the means of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my maiii 
rising up hastily, as upon sotae sudden occasion of going out : tikes 
sending him for something a great way off, I seriously prayed to God 
that he would enable me to instruct savingly this poor savage, assisting, 
by his Spirit, the heart of the poor ignorant creature to receive the lig^ 
of the knowledge of Gbd in Christ reconciling him to Himself, and would 
guide mo to speak so to him from the word of God, as his conscience 
might be convinced,^ his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he came 
again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon the subject of 
the redemption of man by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine 
of the gospel preached from heaven, viz., of repentance towards God, and 
faith in our blessed Lord Jesus. I then explained to him, as well as I 
could, why our blessed Eedeemer took not on him the nature of ang^ 
but the seed of Abraham ; and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had 
no share in the redemption, — ^that he came only to the lost sheep of the 
house of Israel, and the like. 

I hdd, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods 
I took for this poor creature's instruction, and must acknowledge, what 1 
believe 'all that act upon the same principle will find — that, in laying 



B0BIN80N CBTJ60B. 197 

tUngs open to bim, I really informed and instmcted myself in many 
things that either I did not know, or had not ftdly considered before, but 
yf\atti occurred naturally to my mind npon my searching into them, for 
Uie information of this poor savage; and I had more affection in my 
inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt before : so that, 
whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me or no, I had great 
letson to be thankful that ever he came to me. My grief sat lighter 
HpoiL me ; my habitation grew comfortable to me beyond measure ; and 
when I reflected that, in this solitary life which I had been confined to, 
I had not only been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to seek to 
tibe hand that brought me thither, but was now to be made an instrument, 
under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I knew, the soul, of a 
poor savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of the 
Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to know whom is 
life eternal ; — I say, when I reflected upon all these things, a secret joy 
nn through every part of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I 
was brought to this place, which I had often thought the most dreadful 
of all afflictions that could possibly have befallen me. 

In this tiiankM frame I continued all the remainder of my time, and 
the conversation which employed the hours between Friday aud me was 
SQch as made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and 
completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be found 
in a sublunary state. The savage was now a good Christian, a much 
better than I, — ^though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that 
▼e were equally penitent, and comforted, restored penitents. "We had 
here the word of Ctod to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to in- 
struct, than if we had been in England. I always applied myself to 
reading the Scripture, and to let him know as well as I could the mean- 
ing of what I read ; and he again, by his serious inquiries and question- 
ings, made me, as I said before, a much better scholar in the Scripture- 
knowledge than I should ever have been by my own mere private reading. 
Another thing I caonot refrain from observing here also, from experience 
in this retired part of my life, viz., how inflnite and inexpressible a bless- 
ing it is t^at the knowledge of God, and of the doctrine of salvation by 
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the word of God, — so easy to be 
received and understood, that, as the bare reading the Scripture made me 
capable of understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly on to 
the great work of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a 



198 ADTBNTITBBB 07 

SaTionr for life and salTation, to a stated reformatioii in practice, md 
obedience to all God's commands, and this vitliont any tcaclier or ii-

to the enli^tening this savage creature, and bimging him to be nich 
Chriatiaii as I liave known few eqoal to him in my life. 

Ab to the dieput«B, wrangling, strife, and contention, which ban 
in the world about religion, whether nicetiea in doctrinei, or 
if church goTemment, they were all perfectly useless to hb, m for 
aught I can yet see, they have been to all the rest in the world. "We bd

that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points in religion, which bin 
made such conJ^isions in the world, would hare been to us, if we cooU 
hare obtained it. Sut I must go on with the historical part of tianp,

ETEB Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, 
and that lie could understand almost all I said to him, 
and speak fluently, though in broken EngUsh, to me, I 
acquainted him with my own story, or at least so much 
related to my coming into this place ; how I had lived here, and 
ag : I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of gun- 
' and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, 
he was wonderfully delighted with ; and I made him a belt with 
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in, — and in 
»g, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not 
good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon other 

OS. 

escribed to him the countries of Europe, and particularly England, 
I came from ; how we lived, how we worshipped GK)d, how we be- 
x> one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world, 
him an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and 
I him, as near as I could, the place where she lay ; but she was all 
in pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat, 
we lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir with my 
strength then, but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon 
this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I 
tiim what it was he studied upon ? At last, says he, '^ Me see such 



200 ADTSNTUBB8 OT 

boat like come to place at my nation." I did not understand bim a good 
while ; but, at last, when I bad examined fartber into it, I understood by 
bim, that a boat, sucb as tbat bad been, came on sbore npon the coimtij 
wbere be lived ; tbat is, as be explained it, was driven tbitber by stresa 
of weatber. I presently imagined tbat some European sbip must hare 
been cast away upon tbeir coast, and tbe boat migbt get loose, and diire 
asbore ; but was so dull, tbat I never once tbougbt of men making 
escape from a wreck tbitber, mucb less wbence they migbt come : so I 
only inquired after a description of tbe boat. 

Friday described tbe boat to me well enougb, but brought me better 
to understand bim when be added, with some warmth, " We save the 
white mans from drown." Then I presently asked bim, if there were 
any white mans, as be called them, in tbe boat? " Yes," be said ; "the 
boat full of white mans." I asked bim how many ? He told upon his 
fingers seventeen. I asked bim then what became of them ? He told 
me, ** They live, they dwell at my nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently imagined that 
these might be the men belonging to tbe sbip that was cast away in 
sight of my island, as I now called it ; and who, after the sbip was stnick 
on tbe rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, bad saved tbemselyes in 
tbeir boat, and were landed upon that wild sbore among tbe savages. 
Upon this, I inquired of bim more critically what was become of them ; 
be assured me they lived still there ; that they bad been there about ioox 
years ; tbat the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live on. 
I asked bim how it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them*' 
He said, ** Ko, they make brother with them ;" that is, as I understood 
bim, a truce ; and then he added, '^ They no eat mans but when make the 
war fight ;" that is to say, they never eat any men but such as come to 
fight with them, and are taken in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that, being upon the top ot 
tbe biU, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have said, I had, 
in a clear day, discovered tbe main or continent of America, Friday, the 
weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the main land, 
and, in a kind of surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to 
me, for I was at some distance from bim. I asked bim what was the 
matter ? "0 joy !" says he ; ** glad ! there see my country, there ©y 
nation ! " I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his 
face, and bis eyes sparkled, and bis countenance discovered a strange 



'— 



BOBINfiON ORUSOB. 201 

mess, as if he had a mind to be in his own country again. This 
rvation of mine put a great many thoughts into me, which made me 
brart not so easy about my new man, Friday, as I was before ; and I 
le no doubt but that if Friday could get back to his own nation again, 
irauld not only forget all his religion, but all his obligation to me, and 
lid be forward enough to giye his countrymen an account of me, and 
le back perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon 

at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his 
mies, when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest 
Ltnre Tery much, for which I was very sorry afterwards. However, 
ny jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I was a Httle more 
tunspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before : in which I 
\ certainly in the wrong too, the honest, grateful creature having no 
Qght about it, but what consisted with the best principles, both as a 
gious Christian, and as a grateful Mend, as appeared afterwards to my 
. satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day 
nping him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which 
ispected were in him ; but I found everything he said was so honest 
[ so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion ; and, 
ipite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again : 

did he, in the least, perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could 

suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at 
t so tiiat we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said, 
riday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?" 
Tes," he said, " I be much glad to be at my own nation." "What 
old you do there?" said I; "would you turn wild again, eat men's 
h again, and be a savage as you were before?" He looked full of 
loem, and shaking his head, said, " No, no ; Friday tell them to live 
)d, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn-bread, oattle-flesh, 
Ik; no eat man again." "Why then," said I to him, "they will 
1 you." He looked grave at that, and then said, " Ko, they no kill 
«, they willing love learn." He meant by this, they would be willing 
learn. He added, " they learned much of the bearded mans that came 
tlie boat." Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He 
iled at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I told him I 
^d make a canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would go 



202 ADYBNTUBBB OF 

with him. " I go ?" says I ; " why, tiiey will eat me, if I come there." 
'^Ko, no," says he ; '^me make they no eat you; me make they much 
love you.'' He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his enemies, 
and saved his life, and so he would make them love me. Then he told 
me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen white men, or 
bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore there in distress. 

Erom this time, I confess I had a mind to venture over, and see if I 
could possibly join with those bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were 
Spaniards, or Portuguese ; not doubting but if I could, we might find 
some method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good 
company together, better than I could from an island forty miles off the 
shore, and alone, without help. So, after some days, I took Friday to 
work again, by way of discourse ; and told him I would give him a boat 
to go back to his own nation ; and accordingly I carried him to my frigate, 
which lay on the other side of the island, and having cleared it of water 
(for I always kept it sunk in the water) I brought it out, showed it biiHy 
and we both went into it. I found he was a most dexterous fellow at 
managing it, and would make it go almost as swift again as I could. So 
when he was in, I said to him, ** Well, now, Friday, shall we go to your 
nation ?'' He looked very dull at my saying so ; which, it seems, was 
because he thought the boat too small to go so far : I then told him 1 luid 
a bigger ; so the next day I went to the place where the first boat lay 
which I had made, but which I could not get into the water. He said 
that was big enough : but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had 
lain two or three-and-twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, 
that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do 
very well, and would carry "much enough vittle, drink, bread;" that 
was his way of talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going 
over with him to the continent, that I told him we would go and make 
one as big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one 
word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the matter 
with him? He asked me again, ""Why you angry mad with Friday? 
What me done ?" I asked him what he meant ? I told him I was not 
angry with him at all. "No angry?" says he, repeating the words 
several times, "Why send Friday home away to my nation?" "'Why," 
says I, " Friday, did you not say you wished you were there ?" "Te^ 
yes," says he, " wish be both there ; no wish Friday there, no master 



V 



BOBINBON GRUBOB. 203 

there." In a word, he would not think of going there without me. '^ I 
go there, Friday !" says I, " what shall I do there ?" He turned very 
quick upon me at this: ''You do great deal much good," says he; 
"joa teach wild mans he good, soher, tame mans; you tell them 
know Gk)d, pray (Jod, and live new life." "Alas! Friday," says I, 
"thou knowest not what thou sayest ; I am but an ignorant man myseli." 
"Yes, yes," says he, ''you teacheeme good, you teachee them good." 
"No, no, Friday," says I, " you shall go without me ; leave me here to 
lire by myself, as I did before." He looked confused again at that word : 
and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it 
np hastily, and gives it to me. " What must I do with this ?" says I 
to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. " "What must I kill you 
for?" said I again.' He retiims very quick, "What you send Friday 
away for ? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke so 
earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his eyes : in a word, I so plainly 
diflcovered the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in 
lum, that I told him then and often after, that I would never send him 
away from me, if he was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse, a settled affection to 
me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the founda- 
tion of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection 
to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which, as 
I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or 
desiie, of undertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination to my 
attempting an escape, as above, founded on the supposition gathered from 
the discourse, viz., that there were seventeen bearded men there ; and, 
therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to find 
oat a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, to 
undertake the voyage. 

There were trees enough in the island to have built a little fl^et, not 

of periaguas and canoes, but even of good large vessels ; but the main 

thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might launch 

it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at first. At last, 

Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found he knew much better than I 

vhat kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell, to this day, what 

irood .to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very like the tree 

we call fiiBtic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much 

of the same colour and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or 



204 ABTBNTURBS OF 

cavity of this tree out) to make it for a bout ; bat t showed him how to 
cut it with tools, which, after I showed him how to use, he did very I 
handily : and in about a month's hard labour we finished it, and made it ' 
very handsome ; especially, when, with our axes, which I showed hk 
how to handle, we cut and liewed the outside into the true shape of a 
boat. After this, howeyer, it cost us near a fi)rtiiight't time to get her 
along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but 
when she was in she would have carried twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it amased 
me to see with what dexterity, and how swift my man Friday would 
manage her, tarn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he 
would, and if we might, venture over in her. "Yes," he said, "he 
venture over in her very well, though great blow wind." However, I had 
a Airther design that he knew nothing of, an4 that was to make a mast 
and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that 
was easy enough to get : so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree, 
which I found near the place, and which there were great plenty of in 
the island ; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him 
directions how to shape and order it. But as to the sail, that was my 
particular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old saik 
enough; but as I had had them now six^and-twenty years by me, and had 
not been very carefal to preserve them, not imagining that I should erer 
have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten, 
and, indeed, most of them were so. However, I found two pieces, Trhich 
appeared pretty good; and with these I went to work, and with a great 
deal of pains, and awkward stitching— you may be sure, for want of 
needles — I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we 
call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom, 
and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually our ships' long boals 
sail with, and such as I best knew how to manage, for it was such a one as 
I had to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in 
the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, vis., rigging and 
fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them, very complete, making a 
small stay, and a sail, or foresail, to it, to assist, if we should turn to 
windward ; and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to t])^ stem 
of her to steer with ; and though I was but a bungling shipwright, J^ 
as I knew the usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I appU^ 



BOUNBO» CBU60E. 206 

KfKlf with BO much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass,— 
titwigh, considering the maaj dull coutrivauceB I had for it that failed, I 
think it cost me almost as much labour as maldiig the boat. 

iiter all this vas done, too, I had my man Friday to teach as to 
▼hit belonged to the narigatioii of my boat ; for, though he knew very 




'%I1 how to paddle the canoe, he knew notliing what belonged to a sail 
Kd a rudder, and was the most amazed when he saw me work the boat 

> and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and filled 
li* way or that way, as the course we Bailed changed ; — I say, when he 
ur this, he stood like ono astonished and amazed. Howerer, with a 
ttle tue, I made all these things faTniHar to T^im, and he became an 
■pot sailor, except that, as to the compass, I could make him understand 
Ety little of that. On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy 
■^Bther, and seldom or never any fbgs in those parts, there was the less 
ccuion fiff a compass, seeing t^e stars wen always to be seen by night, 
nd the shore by day, except in tho rainy reasons, and then nobody cared 

> stir abroad, either by land or sea. 

I was now entered on the sevon-and-tweutieth year of my captivity in 
u> place ; though the three last years that I had this creature with me 
'g^t rather to he left out of account, my habitation being qnite of 
'Other kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the anniTersary of 
y landing here with the same thankfulness to Ood for his mercies as at 
^: and if I had snch cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much 
"tx to now, having such additional testimonieB of the cate of Frovidenoe

over me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily 
delivered ; for I had an invincible impression upon my thonghts that my 
deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another year in this 
place. However, I went on with my husbandry— digging, planting, and 
fencing, as usual: I gathered and cured my grapes, and did eyeiy 
necessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the mean time, upon me, when I kept more 
within doors than at other times; so I had stowed our new vessel as 
secure as I could ; — ^bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in 
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship, and haling her up to 
the shore, at high water mark, I made my man Priday dig a little dock, 
just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water 
enough to float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong 
dam across the end of it, to keep the water out, — and so she lay dry as to 
the tide from the sea : and to keep the rain off, we laid a great many 
boughs of trees so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house, and 
thus we waited for the months of November and December in which 1 
designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as'fhe thought of mj 
design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the 
voyage; and the flrst thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of 
provisions, being the stores for our voyage, and intended, in a week or a 
fortnight's time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was hnsy 
one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Friday, and 
bid him go to ihe sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle, or tortoise, 
a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as 
well as the flesh. Priday had not been long gone, when he came running 
back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the 
ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to speak to 
him, he cries out to me, "0 master! master! sorrow! bad!" 
""What's the matter, Friday?" says I. "0 yonder, there," says he, 
"one, two, three canoe: one, two, three I" By his way of speaking, I 
concluded there were six ; but on enquiry, I found it was but three. 
" WeU, Friday," says I, " do not be frighted." So I heartened him up 
as well as I could : however, I saw the poor fellow waa most teirihly 
scared, for nothing ran in his head but that tliey were come to look for 
him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him ; and the poor Mow 
trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him. I comforted him 



1 



BOBINSON CBUBOB. 207 

as well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, and that 

they wonld eat me as well as him. " But," says I, " Friday, we must 

resolve to fight them. Can you fight, Friday ?" " Me shoot," says he, 

« but there come many great number." '' No matter for that," said I, 

again ; '' our guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I asked 

him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me and stand 

by me ; and do just as I bid him. He said, '' Me die, when you bid die, 

master." So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him ; for 

I had been so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great deal left. 

When he had drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we 

always carried, and loaded them with large swan-shot, as big as small 

pistol-bullets ; then I took four muskets, apd loaded them with two slugs, 

and five small bullets each, and my two pistols I loaded with a brace 

of bullets each : I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and 

gave Friday his hatchet. 

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective glass, and 

went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could discover ; and I found 

quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages, three 

prisoners, and three canoes ; and that their whole business seemed to be 

the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies, — a barbarous 

feast indeed ! but nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual with 

^eiti. I observed also, that they were landed, not where they had done 

"'^hen Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek : where the shore 

^as low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea. 

^Hiis, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came 

^ut, filled me with such indignation, that I came down again to Friday, 

^d told him I was resolved to go down to them and kill them all, and 

*^ed him if he would stand by me. He had now gotten over his Mght, 

^d his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he 

^^a very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would die when I bid die. 

In this fit of f tiry, I took, and divided the arms which I had charged, 

®® l)efore, between us. I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, 

^^<X three guns upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol, and the other 

^'^^*"ee guns myself; and in this posture we marched out. I took a small 

"^t;tle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more 

P^'Wder and bullets; and, as to orders, I charged him to keep close 

^Idnd me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything, till I bid him ; and, 

^ the mean time, not to speak a word. In this posture, I fetched a 



208 ADYBNTURB6 OF 

compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as 
to get into the wood, so that I might come within shot of them before I 
should be discovered, which I had seen, by my glass, it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, 1 •- 
began to abate my resolution : — I do not mean that I entertained any fear ^ 
of their number ; for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain ^ ~ 
I was superior to them, — ^nay, though I had been alone. But it occuned p^ 
to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity I wb» | . 
in, to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither 
done nor intended me any wrong? who, as to me, were innocent, and 
whose barbarous customs were their own disaster; being, in them, a 
token indeed of Gk>d's having left them, with the other nations of that 
part of the world, to such stupidity and to such inhuman courses, bnt did 
not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an 
executioner of his justice ; that, whenever he thought fit, he would take 
the cause into his own hands, and, by national vengeance, punish them as 
a people, for national crimes ; but that, in the mean time,, it was none of 
my business ; that, it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was 
a declared enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular people, 
and it was lawful for him to attack them ; but I could not say the same 
with respect to myself. These things were so warmly pressed upon my 
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and 
place myself near them, that I might observe their barbarous feast, and 
that I would act then as God should direct : but that, unless something 
offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not 
meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all possible wan- 
ness and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched till I came 
to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to them, only 
that one comer of the wood lay between me and them. Here I called 
softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which was just at the 
comer of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me word if 
he could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came 
immediately back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there ; 
that they were all about their fire, eating the fiesh of one of their prisoners, 
and that another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, which, he 
said, they would kill next, and which fired all the very soul within me. 
He told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the bearded men 



ROBINBON CBVBOS. 209 

n he had told me of, that came to tiieir oonntry in the boat. I vas 
I with honor at the very naming the irbite bearded man ; and, going 
e tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the 
I of the sea, with hia hands and his feet tied with flags, or things 
nshea, and that he was an European, and had clothes on. 
heie was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty 
nearer to them than the place where I waa, which, by going a little 
about, I saw I uiight come at undiBCovered, and that then I should 
tluii half shot of them , so I withheld my passion, though I was 




id enraged to the highest degree, and going back about twenty paces, 
; behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came te the other 
■nd then I came to a little ri^g ground, which gave me a full view 
em, at the distance of about eighty yards. 

had not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful wretches sat 
the ground, all dose-huddled together, and had just sent the other 
to butoher the poor Christian, and brii^ him, perhaps, limb by limb, 
eir fire ; and they were stooped down to untie the bands at his feet 
ned to Friday. " Now, Friday," said I, " do as I bid thee." Fiiday 
he would. " Then, Friday," says I, " do exactly aa you see me do ; 
D nothing." So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-pieoe 
the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other 
:et I took my aim at the savages, bidding him do Hie like : then ask- 



210 ADVENTURES OF 

ing him if he was ready, he said, " Yes." " Then fire at them," said I; 
and the same moment I fired also. 

Priday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he 
shot, he killed two of them, and woimded three more ; and on my side, 
I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a j 
dreadful consternation, and all of them who were not hurt jumped upon 
their feet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or whidi > : 
way to look, for they knew not from whence their destruction came. 
Priday kept his eyes dose upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might 
observe what I did ; so, as soon as the first shot was madlb, I threw doiB 
the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Priday did the like : he saw 
me cock and present ; he did the same again. " Are you ready, Friday?' 
said I. "Yes," says he. "Let fly, then," says I, "in the name of 
Ood !" And with that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so 
did Priday ; and as our pieces were now loaden with what I called swan- 
shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only two drop, but so many were 
wounded, that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, 
all bloody, and miserably wounded most of them, whereof three more fell 
quickly after, though not quite dead. 

"^Now, Priday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and 
taking up the musket which was yet loaden, "follow me," — which he 
did, with a great deal of courage, upon which I rushed out ^f the wood, 
and showed myself, and Priday close at my foot. As soon as I perceiTed 
they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Priday do so too ; 
and running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was not very fast, 
being loaden with arms as I was, I made directly towards the poor yictim, 
who was, as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between the place 
where they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were just going to 
work with him, had left him at the surprise of our first fire, and fled in 
a terrible Mght to the sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and thiee 
more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Priday, and bade him 
step forwards, and flre at them; he understood me immediately, and 
running about forty yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and 1 
thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the 
boat, though I saw two of them up again quickly : however, he killed 
two of them, and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom 
of the boat as if he had been dead. 

While my man Priday flred at them, I pulled out my knife, and cat 



BOBINBON CRUBOB. 211 

3 flags that bound the poor yictini ; and loosing his hands and feet, 
ifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. 
s answered in Latin, ** Chnstianus," but was so weak and faint that he 
old scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and 
iTe it him, making signs that he should drink, whioh he did; and I 
rve him a piece of bread, which he eat. Then I asked him what 
nntryman he was, and he said, '^Espagniole;" and being a little re- 
Tered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how much 
i was in my debt for his deHyerance. " Seignior," said I, with as much 
Mmish as I could make up, '^we will talk afterwards, but we must 
S^t now : if you have any strength left, take this pistol ind sword, and 
Y about you." He took them very thankfully ; and no pooner had he 
e arms in his hands, but, as if they had put new vigoux into him, he 
iw upon his murderers like a fury, and had cut two of thebi in pieces in 
I instant ; for the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the 
K>r creatures were so much frighted with the noise of our pieces, that 
tey fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to 
tempt their own escape, than their flesh had to resist our shot : and that ' 
as the case of those five that Priday shot at in the boat ; fi)r as three of 
lem fell with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the fright. 
I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep 
ly charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword ; 
t) I called to Priday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we 
1st fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, 
^hich he did with great swiftness ; and then, giving him mv musket, I 
lat down myself to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me 
^Hen they wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there happened a 
Betce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who 
Diade at him with one of their great wooden swords, the same like weapon 
ftat was to have killed him before, if I had not prevented it. The 
Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though 
^eak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him two great 
Wounds on his head ; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing 

• 

^ with him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my 
•Word out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely 
l^Utting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage 
•Plough the body, and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was run- 
'Uig to help him, could come near him.

Friday being now left to his liberty, porsued tlie flying irretcbea iritti 
DO -weapon in his hioid but his hatchet ; and with that be despatched 
those three, who, as I said bd'ore, were wounded at firet, and &lleD, md 
all the rest he coidd come up with : and the Spaniard coining to me to* 
gun, I gave tiim one of the fowling-pieoea, with which he pursued two of 




the savageB, and wounded tbem both ; but as he was not able to ran, thtT 
both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and kiU"i 
one of them, but the other was too nimble for him ; and though he was 
wounded, yet had plonged himself into the sea, and swam witlk all hi> 
might o£F to those two who were left in the canoe, which three in ^ 
canoe, with one wounded, who we knew not whether he died or no, were 
all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account of the wlial« 
is as follows:— Three killed at oifr first shot from the tree ; two killed at 
the next shot ; two killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by Frids; o^ 



ROBINSON CRU80B. 213 

those at first wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wood ; three killed 
by the Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here and there of their 
wounds, or killed by Priday in his chase of them ; four escaped in the 
boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead — twenty-one in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, and 
though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit 
any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes, 
and pursue them ; and indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest, 
carrying the news home to their people, they should come back perhaps 
with two or three hundred of their canoes, and devour us by mere multi- 
tude : so I consented to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their 
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me ; but when I was in the 
canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand 
and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and almost dead with 
fear, not knowing what the matter was, — ^for he had not been able to look 
up over the side of the boat : he wtts tied so hard neck and heels, and had 
been tied so long, that he had really little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had bound 
him with, and would have helped him up ; but he could not stand or 
speak, but groaned most piteously, belieying, it seems, still, that he was 
only unbound in order to be killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell him of 
his deliverance ; and, pulling out my bottle, made him give the poor 
wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being delivered, revived him, 
and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak, 
and looked in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have 
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, 
hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung, — then cried again, wrung his 
hands, beat his own face and head, and then sung and jumped about 
again^ like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I could 
make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter ; but when he 
came a little to himself, he told me that it was his father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy 
and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his 
fjBkther, and of his being delivered from death ; nor, indeed, can I describe 
half the extravagancies of his affection after this ; for he went into the 
boat and out of the boat a. great many times : when he went into him, 
he would sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's head 



214 ADYSNTURBS OF 

dose to his bosom half an hour together, to nourish it ; then he took his 
arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, and 
chafed and rubbed them with his hands ; and I, perceiving what the case 
was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with, which did 
them a great deal of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other 
savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight ; and it was happy for 
us that we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before 
they could be gotten a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so 
hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was against them, 
that I could not suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached 
to their own coast. 

But, to return to Priday, he was so busy about his father, that I 
could not find in my heart to take him off for some time : but after I 
thought he could leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came 
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme. Then 1 asked 
him if he had given his father any bread ? He shook his head, and said, 
" None, ugly dog eat all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread, out 
of a little pouch I carried on purpose ; I also gave him a dram for him- 
self, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my 
pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins, — so I gave him a hand- 
fol of them for his father. He had no sooner given his father these raisins, 
but I saw him come out of the boat, and run away, as if he had been 
bewitched, he ran at such a rate, — for he was the swiftest fellow of his 
foot that ever I saw : I say he ran at such a rate, that he was out of 
sight, as it were in an instant ; and though I called, and hallooed too, 
after him, it was all one, away he went ; and in a quarter of an hour 1 
saw him come back again, though not so fast as he went, and as he came 
nearer, I foimd his pace was slacker, because he had something in his 
hand. When he came up to me, I foimd he had been quite homc-for an 
earthen jug or pot, to bring his father some fresh water, and that he had 
got two more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but the 
water he carried to his father : however, as I was very thirsty too, I took 
a little sup of it. The water revived his father more than all the nun or 
spirits I had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any 
water left. He said, "Yes;" and I bad,e him give it to the poor 
Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father : and I sent one 



B0BIN80N CBU80B. 215 

of the cakes that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was indeed 
yvrj weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place under the shade 
cf a tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled 
irith the rude bandage he had been tied with. When I saw that, upon 
Jiiday's coming to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and took the 
bead, and began to eat, I went to him and gave him a handful of raisins. 
iHe looked up in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfdl- 
xess that could appear in any countenance ; but was so weak, notwith- 
standing he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could not stand 
up upon his feet : he tried to do it two or three times, but was really not 
able, his ankles were so swelled and so pain^ to him ; so I bade him sit 
atOl, and caused Friday to rub his ankles and bathe them with rum, as 
he had done his father's. 

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or 
peihaps less, all the while he was here, turned his head about to see if 
his fEither was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting ; and 
at hut he found he was not to be seen,^at which he started up, and 
^thout speakiEig a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that one could 
scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went : but when he 
came he only found he had lain himself down to ease his limbs, so Friday 
came back to me presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let 
Priday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he 
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him. But 
Priday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, 
and carried him away to the boat, and set him down sofbly upon the side, 
or gunnel, of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it, and then lifted 
him quite in, and set him close to his father ; and presently, stepping 
out again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster 
than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too : so he brought 
them safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch 
the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him 
whither he went. He told me, ** Go fetch more boat :" so away he went 
like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like him ; and he had the 
other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land. So he 
wafted me oyer, and then went to help our new guests out of the boat, 
which he did ; but they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor 
Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday

to bid them sit down on the bank irhile be came to me, I soon nude ■ 
kind of a hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them up 
both together upon it, between ns. Bnt when we got them to the outside 
of onr wall, or fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it ins 
impoBBible to get them over, and I was resolved not to break it down : m 
I set to work again, and Friday and I, in about two honia' time, mods t 
very, handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that with boo^ 
of trees, being in the space without our outward fence, and betweei 
tliat and the grove of young wood which I had planted ; and here wt 
made them two beds of such things as I had, viz., of good rice stnT, 
with blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and another to cover tiiem, m 
each bed.

l>Y iflland yraa now peopled, and I thought myself veiy 
rich in anbjects; and it was a meiry reflection, which 
I frequently made, how like a king I looked. First of 
) all, the whole covintry was my own mere property, 
M that I had an nndouUed right of dominion. Secondly, my people 
wew perfectly subjected, — I was absolute lord and lawgiver ; they 
all owed their' lives to me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if 
there had been occasion of it, for me. It was remarkable, too, I had 
bnt three anbjects, and they were of three difibrcnt religions : my man 
Friday was a Protestant, hii fother was a Pagan and a cannibal, and the 
Spaniard was a Papist. However, I allowed liberty of conscience 
throughont my dominions. But this is by the way. 

As soon as I had eecnred my two weak rescued prisoneis, and given 
them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of 
TtinlriTig some provision for them ; and the first thing I did, I ordered 
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid 'and a goat, out of my 
potticnlar flock, to be killed, — when I cut off the hinder quarter, and 
chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and 
stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assore yon, of flesh and 
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the broth : and as I 
oooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I 
carried it all into the new tent, and having set a taUe there for them, I 
sat down and eat my own dinner also with them, and, as well as I 
oonld, cheered them and enoonreged them ; Friday being my interpreter,

spoke the language of the savages pretty weU. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of 
the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for | 
want of time, we had left upon the place of battle ; and the next day, I i 
ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which laj 
open to the sun, and would presently be offensiYe. I also ordered him to 
bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I knew were 
pretty much, and which I could not think of doing myself, — ^nay, I could 
not bear to see them, if I went that way ; all which he punctually per- 
formed, and effaced the very appearance of the savages being there,— « 
that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise 
than by the comer of the wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new 
subjects ; and first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought 
of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect 
a return of them, with a power too great for us to resist. Hisfint 
opinion was that the savages in the boat never could live out the stozm 
which blew that night they went off, but must of necessity be drowned, 
or driven south to those other shores, where they were as sure to be 
devoured, as they were to be drowned if they were cast away : but as to 
what they would do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not ; but 
it was his opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted with the 
manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he beHeyed 
they would tell their people they were all killed by thunder and lightniBg) 
not by the hand of man ; and that the two which appeared, viz., Priday 
and I, were two heavenly spirits, or fctries, come down to destroy them, 
and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard 
them all cry out so in their language to one another ; for it was im- 
possible to them to cbnceive that a man could dart fire, and speak 
thunder, and kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done 
npw. And this old savage was in the right ; for, as I understood since, bj 
other hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the island afte^ 
wards, — ^they were so terrified with the accounts given by those four men 
(for, it seems, they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever went 
to that enchanted island would be destroyed with fire from the gods. 

This, however, I knew not ; and therefore was under continual v^ 
prehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, I and 



BOBINSON CRUSOB. 219 

all my army ; for, as there were now four of us, I would have ventured 
upon a hundred of them, fairly in the open field at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their 
coming wore off, and I hegan to take my former thoughts of a voyage to 
the main into consideration, — ^being likewise assured by Friday's father 
that I might depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, if 
I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious 
discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were 
fourteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who, having been cast 
away, and made their escape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed, 
with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and 
indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and 
foimd they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Eio de la Plata to the 
Havanna, being directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly 
hides and silver, and to bring back what European goods they could meet 
with there ; that they had five Portuguese seaman on board, whom they 
took out of another wreck ; that five of their own men were drowned, 
when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite 
dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, 
where they expected to have been devoured every moment. He told me 
they had some arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that 
they had neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled 
aU their powder but a little, which they used, at their first landing, to 
provide themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if 
they had formed no design of making any escape. He said they had 
many consultations about it, but that having neither vessel, nor tools to 
build one, nor provisions of any kind, their coimcils always ended in tears 
aad despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal 
from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they 
were all here, it might not be done. I told him, with freedom, I feared 
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put my life in their hands ; 
for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did 
men always square their dealings by the obligations they had received, so 
much as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it would 
be very hard that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and 
that they should afterwards make me their prisoner in Kew Spain, where 



220 ADYINTUBBB OF 

an Englishman was certain to be made a sacriiice, what neceasitj or what 
accident soever brought him thither ; and that I had rather be deliyefed 
up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the mennless 
claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I added, that 
otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so 
many hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all away, either to the 
Brazils, southward, or to the islands, or Spanish coast, northward ; but that 
if, in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, 
carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill used for mj 
kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before. 

He answered with a great deal of candour and ingenuity, that their 
condition was so miserable, and they were bo sensible of it, that he 
believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that 
should contribute to their deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would 
go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and 
return again, and bring me their answer ; that he would make conditions 
with them upon their solemn oath, that they would be absolutely under 
my leading, as their commander and captain ; and that they should swear 
upon the holy sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and go to such 
Christian country as that I should agree to, and no other, and to be 
directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely 
in such coimtry as I intended ; and that he would bring a contract from 
them, under their hands, for that purpose. 

Then he told me he would iirst swear to me himself, that he wonld 
never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him orders ; and that 
he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen 
the least breach of faith among his countrymen. 

He told me they were all of them very civil, l^onest men, and they 
were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor 
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages, oat 
of all hopes of ever returning to their own country ; and that he was sorey 
if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances I resolved to venture to relieve them, if pos- 
sible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat 
But when we had gotten all things in a readiness to go, the Spaniard 
himself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it, on one 
hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be 
very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of 



ROBINSON CRU60B. 221 

hiB oomrades for at least half a year. The case was thus : He had been 
with OB now about a month, during which time I had let him see in what 
manner I had provided, with the assistance of Froyidencei for my sup- 
port ; and he saw evidently what stock of com and rice I had laid up, 
which, as it was more than sufficient for myself, so it^was not sufficient, 
at least without good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to 
four ; but much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, 
as he said, fourteen still alive, should come over ; and least of all would 
it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage 
to any of the Christian colonies of America : so he told me he thought it 
would be more advisable to let him and the two other dig and cultivate 
some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we 
should wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of com for his 
countrymen, when they should come : for want might be a temptation to 
them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out 
of one difficulty into another. You know, says he, the children of Israel, 
though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet 
rebelled even against God himself, that delivered them, when they came 
to want bread in the Wilderness. 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could 
not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as weU as I was satisfied 
with his fidelity : so we feU to digging all four of us, as well as the 
wooden tools we were furnished with permitted ; and in about a month's 
time, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had gotten as much land 
cured and trimmed up as we sowed two and twenty bushels of barley on, 
and sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare : 
nor, indeed, did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for 
the six months that we had to expect our crop, — ^that is to say, reckoning 
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing ; for it is not to be sup- 
posed it is six months in the groimd in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to put us 
out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been 
very great, we went freely all over the island, wherever we found occa^ 
aion ; and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it 
was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine. To 
this purpose, I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our work, 
and I set Priday and his father to cutting them down ; and then I caused 
the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought on that afiair, to oversee 



222 ABYEKTUBES OF 

and direct their work. I showed them with what indefatigable pains I 
had hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the 
like, tUl they had made about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two 
feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick : 
what prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats 
as much as I could, and, to this purpose, I made Friday and the 
Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for ve 
took our turns), and by this means we got about twenty young kids to 
breed up with the rest ; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the 
kids, and added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for curing 
the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up 
in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of 
the sun are cured, we could have fllled sixty or eighty barrels ; and these, 
with our bread, was a great part of our food, and very good living too, 1 
assure you, for it is an exceeding nouridiing food. 

It was .now harvest, and our crop in good order : it was not the most 
plentiful increase I had seen in the island ; but, hoVever, it was enongh 
to answer our end, — for from our twenty-two bushels of barley we brought 
in and threshed out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like 
in proportion of the rice ; which was store enough for our food to the next 
harvest, though all the fourteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; 
or if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifally have 
victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that is to 
say, of America. 

When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of com, we fell 
to work to make more wickerwork, viz., great baskets, in which we kept 
it, and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often 
blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this kind of 
work ; but I saw no need of it. 

And now, having a faU supply of food for all the guests I expected, I 
gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do 
with those he had left behind them there. I gave him a strict charge, in 
writing, not to bring any man with him who would not first swear, in the 
presence of himself and of the old savage, that he would in no way injure, 
fight with, or attack the person he would find in the island, who was so 
kind as to send for them in order to their deliverance ; but that thej 
would stand by, and defend him against all such attempts, and whereTer 



B0BIN80N CBUBOB. 223 

» 

tbey went, would be entirely under and subjected to his command ; and 
that this should be put in writing, and signed with their hands. How 
we were to have this done, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, 
that indeed was a question which we never asked. 

Under these instructionB, the Spaniard and the old savage, the father 
of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be said to 
oome in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners to be 
deronred by the savages. I gave each of them a musket, with a firelock 
en it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be 
^very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon 
urgent occasions. 

This wafl a cheerf^ work, being the first measures used by me, in 
▼iew of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years anf some days. I 
ga?e them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for them- 
selves for many days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight 
days' time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing 
with them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by which 
I should know them again, when they came back, at a distance, before 
they came on shore. 

They went away with a fair gale, on the day that the moon was at 
tuU, by my account in the month of October ; but as for an exact reckon- 
iiig of days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it again, nor 
liad I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure I was 
light, though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined my account, I 
toond I had kept a true reckoning of years. 

It was no lesrthan eight days I had waited for them, when a strange 
«nd unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not perhaps 
been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, 
when my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, '' Master, 
master, they are come, they are come ! " 

I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could 
get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way, was by 
this time grown to be a very thick wood ; — I say, regardless of danger, I 
went without my arms, which it was not my custom to do ; but I was 
surprised, when turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at 
about a league and a half's distance, standing in for the shore, with a 
shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair 
to bring them in : also I observed presently, that they did not oome from 



224 ADYBNTUBSB OF 

• 

that side which the shore lay on, but from the southeminost end A 
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie dose, for these 
were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know yei 
whether they were Mends or enemies. 

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspectiye glass, to see 
what I could make of them ; and, haying taken the ladder out> I dimbed 
up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive d 
anything, and to take my view the plainer without being discovered. 

I had scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly dis- 
coYcred a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and a half's dis- 
tance from me, south-south-east, but not above a league and a half fixna 
the shore. By my observation, it appeared plainly to be an English ship, 
and the boat ap^ared to -be an English long-boat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in ; though the joy of seemg a 
ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own 
countrymen, and, consequently, friends, was such as I cannot describe ; 
but yet I had some secret doubts hang about me— I cannot tell from 
whence they came— bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, 
it occurred to me to consider what business an English ship could have in 
that part of the world, since it was not the way to or from any part of the 
world where the English had any traffic : and I knew there had been no 
storms to drive them in there, as in distress ; and that if they were really 
English, it was most probable that they were here upon no good design, 
and that I had better continue as I was, than faR into the hands of 
thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, which 
sometimes are given him when he may think there is no possibility of its 
being reaL That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few Hud 
have made any observations of things can deny ; that they are certain 
discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot 
doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, 
why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether 
supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they 
are given for our good ? 

The present question abundantly conjQrms me in the justice of tins 
reasoning ; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition, 
come it from whence it will, I had been imdone inevitably, and in a ftr 
worse condition than before, as you will see presently. I had not kept 



BOBIKBON CRU80B. 225 

myielf long in this poetnre, bst I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if 
they looked for a creek to thmst in at, for the eonvenience of landing ; 
howerer, as ih^ did not come quite far enough, they did not see the 
little inlet where I fonnerly landed njy rafts, but run their boat on shore 
upon the beach at about half a mile from me, which was rery happy for 
me; for otherwise they would have landed just, as I may say, at my 
door, and would soon have beaten me out of my csstle, and perhaps have 
phmdeied me of all I had. 

When they were on shoie, I was Mly satisfied tiiey were Englishmen, 
at least most of them ; one or two I thou^t were Dutch, but it did not 
prove so; there were in all eleren men, whereof three of them I found 
were unarmed, and, as I ti&ought, bound; and when the first four or five 
ef them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of die boat, as 
prisoners : one of the thnse I eould perceive using the most passionate 
gestures of entzeaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of extrava* 
ganee ; tite other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes, 
and appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree as the first. I 
was pofeetly confounded at the sig^t, and knew not what the meaning oi 
it should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could, 
^ master ! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans.'' 
''Why," says I, ''Friday, do yo think they are going to eat them thenf ' 
" Yes," says Friday, " tiiey will eat them." <' No, no," says I^ " Friday, 
I sm afraid they will murder them, indeed ; but you may be sure they 
will not eat them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but 
atood trembling with the horror of tiie sight, expecting every moment 
when the three prisoners should be killed ; nay, onoe I saw one of the 
villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or 
sword, to strike one of the poor men, and I expected to see him fedl every 
moment, at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my 
veins. I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage tiiat was 
gone with him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within 
shot of them, that I might have rescued the three men, for I saw no 
fire-arms they had among them: but it fell out to my mind another 
way. After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by 
the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering about the 
island, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the three 
other men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat 

15 



226 ADYENTtRBB OF 

down all three upon the gromid, very pexudvey and looked like men i^ 
despair. 

This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore and 
hegan to look about me : how I gave myself over for lost ; how wildly I 
looked around me ; what dreadful apprehensions I had ; and how I lodged 
in the tree all night, for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. As 1 
knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive by the proTiden- 
tial driving of the ship nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which 
I have since been so long nourished and supported : so. these three poor 
desolate men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they 
were, how near it was to them, and ho^ effectually and really they were in 
a condition of safety, a^ the same time that they thought themselves lost, 
and their case desperate. So little do we see before us in the world, and 
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the 
world, that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely destitate, but 
that, in the worst circumstances, they have always something to be t^iank- 
fol for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they imagine; 
nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the means by which they 
seem to be brought to their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high water when these people came on shore; 
and while partly they stood parleying with the prisoners they brought, and 
partly wlyle they rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, 
they had carelessly staid till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed 
considerably away, leaving their boat aground. They had left two men 
in the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much 
brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them waking sooner than the other, 
and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the 
rest, who were straggling about, upon which they all soon came to the 
boat ; but it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat being 
very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like 
a quicksand. 

In this condition^ like true seamen, wbo are perhaps the least of all 
mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and away they strolled 
about the country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, 
calling them off from the boat, " "Why, let her alone. Jack, can^t yon? 
ahe'U float next tide," by which I was frdly confirmed in the main in- 
quiry of what countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept myself very dose, not once daring to stir oat of 



ROBINSON CBUBO^B. 227 



ny castle, any farther than to my place of observation near the top of the 
lill ; and very glad I was to think how well it waa fortified. I knew it 
ivas no less than ten hours before the boat could be on float again, and by 
hat time it would be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their 
[notions, and to hear their discourse, if they had any. 

In the meantime I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though with 
more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than I 
had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had«made an excellent marks- 
man with his gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling- 
pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very 
fierce : I had my formidable goat's skin coat on, with the great cap I 
have mentioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my l)elt, and a 
gon upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till 
it was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found 
that, in short, they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I 
thought, laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious 
for their condition to get any sleep, were, however, set down under the 
shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I 
thought, out of sight of any of the rest. 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and leam some- 
thing of their condition. Immediately I marched in the figure as 
above, my man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for 
his arms as I, but not m'aking quite so staring a spectre-like figure as 
Idid. 

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any of 
them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, '' What are ye, gentle- 
men?" 

They started up at the noise ; but were ten times more confounded 
when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made. They made no 
answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly from me, 
when I spoke to them in English. '' GFentlemen," said I, ''do not be 
surprised at me ; perhaps you may have a friend near, when you did not 
expect it." " He must be sent directly from Heaven, then," said one of 
them very gravely to me, and ptdling off his hat at the same time to me, 
" for our condition is past the help of man." " All help is from Heaven, 
sir," said I ; " but can you put a stranger in the way how to help you ? 
for you seem to be in some great distress. I saw you when you landed ;

The pooor man, with tears nmning down his fieice, and trembling, 
looHng like one astonished, returned, '^ Am I talking to Gh)d or man? h 
it a real man or an angel?" ''Be in no fear about that, sir," saidl; 
** if Qtod had sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come l)etter 
clothed, and better armed after another manner than you see me : pray 
lay aside your fears ; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assiit 
you : you see I have one servant only ; we have aims and ammunition,— 
tell us freely, can we serve you ? "What is your case ?" 

'' Our case," said he, '' sir, is too long to tell you, while our murderen 
are so near us : but, in short, sir, I was conmiander of that ship ; my men 
have mutinied against me ; they have been hardly prevailed on not to 
murder me ; and at last have set me on s)iore in this desolate place, ▼ith r 
these two men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger, where we l< 
expected to perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and knovnot 
yet what to think of it." 

** Where are these brutes, your enemies?" said I: "do you know 
where they are gone?" ''Hiere they lie, sir," said he, pointing to i { 
thicket of trees ; ''my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, 9jA f 
heard you speak ; if they have, they will certainly murder us alL" 

" Have they any fire-arms ?" said I. He answered, " They hare only 
two pieces, one of which they have left in the boat," ""Well, then,** «M 
I, " leave the rest to me ; I see they are all asleep, it is aa easy thingto 
kill them all : but shall we rather take them prisoners ?" He toldnfi 
there were two desperate villains among them, that it was scarce safe to 
show any m&tcj to ; but if they were secured, he b^eved all the rest 
would return to their duty. I asked him which they were ? He told vnt 
he could not at that distance distinguish them, but he would obej my 
orders in anything I would direct. " Wdl," said I, '' let us retreat ont 
of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve fazther." 
So they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from tliem- 

" Look you, sir," said I, " if I venture upon your deliverance, are yo* 
willing to make two conditions with me ? " He anticipated my proposal^ 
by telling me, tiiat both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly 
directed and commanded by me in every thing ; and, if the ship was not 
tecovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the vodd 
soever I would send him ; and the two other men said the same.

"Well,** saya I, "my conditioiis are but two— First, That while you

tod if I put arms into your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them 
up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and, in the 
iiea&time, be goyemed by my orders. Second, That if the ship is, or may 
le recovered, you will carry me and my man to England passage free." 

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could 
derise, that he would comply with these mo8t*reasonabIe demands ; and, 
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions, 
88 long as he lived. 

''Well, then," said I, " here are three muskets for you, with powder 
and ball : tell me next what you think is proper to be done." He showed 
lU the testimony of his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be 
▼hoUy guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing any 
thing; but the best method I could think of was to fire upon them at 
onoe, as they lay, and if any were not killed at the first voUey, and offered 
to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's provi- 
dence to direct the shot. 

He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could 
help it — ^but that those two were incorrigible villains, and had been the 
aothors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be 
ondone still ; for they would go on board and bring the whole ship's com- 
pany, and destroy us alL ''Well, then," says I, "necessity legitimates 
my advice, for it is the only way to save our lives." However, seeing 
him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him they should go them- 
selves, and manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and 
soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of 
them were the heads of the mutiny? He said, " No." " Well, then," 
said I, " you may let them escape ; and Providence seems to have awakened 
them on purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, " if the rest escape 
you, it is your fault." 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in his hand, 
and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, each man a piece 
in his hand : the two men who were with him going first, made some 
noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about, and 
leeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, for 
the moment he cried out they fired; I mean the two men, the captain

wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot a 
the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and th< 
other very much woimded ; but not being dead, he started np on his feet 
and called eagerly for help to the others, but the captain, stepping to him, 
told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive 
his yillany, and with that word knocked him down with the stock of his 
musket, so that he never spoke more : there were three more in the com- 
pany, and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this time I was 
come ; and when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, 
they begged for mercy. The captain told them he would spare their 
lives, if they would give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the 
treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithM to him 
in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, 
from whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of their 
sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing to believe them, and 
spare their lives, which I was not against,— only I was obliged to keep 
them boimd hand and foot while they were upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Eriday with the captain's mate to the 
boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sail, which 
they did ; and by-and-bye three straggling men, that were (happilj for 
them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired, and 
seeing their captain, who before was their prisoner, now their conqneror, 
they submitted to be bound also ; and so our victory was complete.

CHAPTER XVII. 

Cniaoe and the ci^>tain eansnlt how they may reooTer the ship from the mntineen— In the mean- 
while a fresh party come ashore — An ambuscade is contrired, and the mutineers lay down their 
arms — ^The captain promises mercy to all except Will Atkins — The ship taken ftxmi the muti- 
neers— Grosoe learea the island, in which he had lired for twenty-eight years. 

T now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one 
another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole 
history, which he heard with an attention ev^n to amazement, 
and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished 
with provisions and ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story is a whole 
collection of wonders, it affected him deeply. But when he reflected from 
thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved there on 
purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not 
speak a word m6re. 

After this communication was at an end, I carried him and his two 
men into my apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the 

top of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had, 

* 

and showed them all the contrivances I had made, during my long, long 
inhabiting that place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing ; but, 
above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had 
concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been now planted 
near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in England, 
was become a little wood, and so thick, that it was impassable in any part 
of it, but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage 
into it. This I told him was my castle and my residence, but that I had 
a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon 
occasion, and I would show him that too another time ; but at present our 
business was to consider how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as 
to that ; but told me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for 



232 ADYBNTUKSS OF 

that there were still Bix-and-tweiity hands on board, who haTing entered 
into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the 
law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, 
knowing that, if they were subdned, they would be brought to the 
gallows, as soon as they came to England, or to any of the Eng^ 
colonies ; and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with bo 
small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upoa what he htd said, and found it was ayeiy 
rational conclusion, and that, therefore, something was to be resolved on 
speedily, as well to draw tiie men on board into some snare for their 
surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon 
this, it presently occurred to me that, in a little while, the ship's aerr, 
wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat, wonld 
certainly come on shore in their other boat, to look for them ; and that 
then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong fbr us: this he 
allowed was rational. 

Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to stave ihfi 
boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they mi^t not earry her off; and 
taking every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to 
swim : accordingly we went on board, took the arms which were left ofl 
board out of her, and whatever else we found there, which was a bottld 
of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a hoxii of powder, and 
a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar was five or six 
pounds), all which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy and 
sugar, of which I had had none left for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, atil 
and rudder of the boat were carried away before, as above), we knocked a 
great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master 
us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in n; 
thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship ; but my view waSt 
that if they went away without the boat, I did not much question to 
make her fit again to cairy us to the Leeward IslandSf and call upon onr 
friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main 
strength, heaved the boat upon the beach so high that the tide would not 
float her off at high-water mark, and besides had broken a hole in her 
bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we 
should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with 



ROBIHBON CBUBOB. 233 

W ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board ; bnt no boat stirred^ 
ad they fired several times, making other signals for the boat. 

At last, when all their signals and firing prored fruitless, and they 
fimnd the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the help of my glasses) 
hoist another boat ont, and row towards the shore ; and we found, as they 
^iproached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they 
had fire«arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagaes from the shore, we had a fuiU. view 
of tliem as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces, because the 
tide haying set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rewed 
Dp under shore, to come to the same place where the other had landed, 
•ad where the boat lay. 

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain 
knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he 
said, that there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led 
into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered and frighted ; but 
that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief officer among them, 
aod all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and 
Were no doubt made desperate in their new enterprise ; and terribly ap- 
(ttehensive he was that they would be too powerful for us. 

I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances were 
M»t the operation of fear,-~that, considering every condition that could be 
wns better than that we were supposed to be in, we ought to expect that the 
Mxnaequence, whether death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I 
hsked him what he thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether 
i deliverance were not worth venturing for ? **And where, sir," said I, '*is 
rour belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life, which 
devoted you a little while ago ? Eor my part," said I, *' there seems to 
oe but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it*" "What is that?" 
ays he. ''Why," said I, '4t is, that as you say there are three or four 
lonest fSallowB among them, which should be spared ; had they been all of 
he wicked part of the crew I should have thought God's providence had 
angled them out to deliver them into your hands ; for, depend upon it, 
nrery man of them that oomes ashore are our own, and shall die or live as 
they behave to us." 

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerftQ countenance, I found 
it greatly encouraged him ; so we set vigorously to our business* We 
lad, upon the first appearance of the boaf s coming from the ship, con* 



234 ADYBNTUBBS 07 

sidered of separatmg onr prisoners, and had, indeed, secured them effec- 
tually. Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than ordinaiyt 
I sent with Priday and one of the three delivered men to my cave, where 
they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or discoTeredf 
or of finding .their way out of the woods if they could have delivered 
themselves : here they left them bound, but gave them provisions ; and 
promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty 
in a day or two, but that if they attempted their escape, they should be pnt 
to death without mercy. They promised faithfally to bear their confine- 
ment with patience, and were very thankful that they had such good 
usage as to have provisions and a light left them, for Friday gave them 
candles (such as we made ourselves) for^eir comfort, and they did not 
know but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage : two of them were kept pinioned, 
indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them ; but the other two 
were taken into my service, upon the captain's recommendation, and 
upon their solemnly engaging to live and die nvith us. So with them and 
the three honest men we were seven men well armed, and I made no 
doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the ten that vere 
coming, considering that the captain had said there were three or fonr 
honest men among them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran 
their boat into the beach, and came all on shore, haling the boat up 
after them, which I was glad to see ; for I was afraid they would rather 
have left the boat at an anchor, some distance from the shore, with some 
hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat 

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to their other 
boat, and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise to find her 
stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. 

After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or three great 
shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they could make their 
companions hear ; but all was to no purpose : then they came all dose in 
a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, 
and the echoes made the woods ring. But it was all one : those in the 
cave we were sure could not hear ; and those in our keeping, thou^ thej 
heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them. 

They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us 
afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to their ship, and let 






ROBINSON CBUSOB. 235 

;hem know there that the men were all murdered, and the long-hoat 
staved : accordingly, they immediately launched their boat again, and got 
ill of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed and even confonnded at this, believ- 
ing they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their 
Domrades up for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in 
hopes we should have recovered ; but he was quickly as much Mghted 
the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, but we perceived them 
all coming on shore again ; but with this new measure in their conduct, 
which it seems they consulted together upon, viz., to leave three men in 
the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look 
for their fellows. 

This was a* great disappointment to us, for we were now at a loss what 
to do ; for our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to 
XLS, if we le{ the boat escape, because they would then row away to the 
ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and 
so our recovery of the ship would be lost. 

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of 
things might present. The seven men came on shore, and the three who 
remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore, and 
came to an anchor to wait for them ; so that it was impossible for us to 
come at them in the boat. 

Those that came on shore kept close together, marching towards the 
top of the little hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could see 
them plainly, though they could not perceive us: we could have been 
very glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might have fired 
at them, or that they would have gone feuiher off, that we might have 
come abroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they could see 
a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east 
part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they 
were weary ; and not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far 
from one another, they sat down together under a tree, to consider of it. 
Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of 
them had done, they had done the job for us ; but they were too full of 
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not 
tell what the danger was they had to fear neither. 



236 A.DTBNTUBBS 0? 

The captain made a Tery just proposal to me upon this consoltfltioiL of 
theirs, viz., that perhaps thej would all fire a volley agaiiiy to endeayonr 
to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon themy jmt 
at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they wonld 
certainly yield, and we should have them without hloodahed. I lilud 
this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to coma 
up to them hefore they could load their pieces again^ 

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time, verj 
irresolute what course to take. At length I told him there would be 
nothing done, in my opinion^ till night ; and then, if they did not retain 
to the boat, perhaps we mi^t find a way to get between them and the 
shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get 
them on shore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient for their remoTing, 
and were very imeasy, when, after long consultations, we saw them ell 
start up, and march down towards the sea : it seems they had such dread* 
ful apprehensions upon them of the danger of the place, that they reedTed 
to go on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so 
go on with their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them to go towards the shore, I imagined it to 
be, as it really was, that they had given over their search, and were ix 
going back again ; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thougbiS) 
was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it ; but I presently thou^t of 
a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a 
tittle. 

I ordered Friday and the ci^tain's mate to go over the little aeek 
westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore wbe& 
Friday was rescued, and as soon as they came to a little tiaULg ground, flt 
about half a mile's distance, I bade them halloo as loud as they could, and 
wait till they found the seamen heard them ; that as soon as ever they 
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it; again, and thefli 
keeping out of sight, take a round, alwa3rs answering them when ^ 
others hallooed, to draw them as £Eff into the island, and among the 
woods, as possible, and then wheel about again to me, by midi ways as I 
directed. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate 

.hallooed ; and they presently heard thcon, and answering, ran along tba 

shore westward, towards the voice they heard, when they were presently 



.B0BIK80N CBTJSOB. 237 

citopped by Hie creek, where, the water being np, they conld not get over, 
and called for the boat to come np and set them over, — as, indeed, I 
expected. 

When they had set themselyes oyer, I obseired that the boat being 
9one a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the 
land, they took one of the three men ont of her to go along with them, 
cmd left only two in the boat, having fastened her to the stomp of a little 
tree on the shore. 

This was what I wished for ; and immediately leaving Friday aad the 
captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me, and crossing the 
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware, 
-—one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat : the 
fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and, going to start up, 
the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down, 
and ^hen. called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. 

There needed very few ai^uments to persuade a single man to yield, 
when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade knocked down ; besides, 
this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny 
as the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not only to 
yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. 

In the meantbne, Friday and the captain's mate so well managed their 
imiiness with the rest, that they drew them, by hallooing and answering, 
from one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till they not only 
heartily tired them, but left them where they were very sore they could 
not reach back to the boat before it was dark ; and, indeed, they were 
heartily tired themselves also by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to 
fall upon them, so as to. make sure work with them. 

It was several hours after Friday came 1)iu^ to me before they came 
back to their boat, and we could hear the foremost of them, long before 
they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could also 
hear them answer, and complain how lame and tired they were, and not 
able to oome any faster, which was very welcome news to us. 

At length they came up to the boat ; but it is impossible to express 
their conf^ision when they found the boat fast aground in the creek, the 
tide ebbed ont, and their two men gone. We could hear them call to one 
MMTth^ in a most lamentable manner, telling odb another they were 
gotten into an enchanted island ; that either there were iiihabit>ant.8 in it, 



238 ADYBNTURBS OF 

and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils or spirits in it, 
and they should be all carried away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names a 
great many times ; but no answer : after some time, we could see them 
by the little light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men in 
despair, and that sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat, 
to rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk about again, and 
so the same thing over again. 

My men would fSain have had me give them leave to fall upon them in 
the dark ; but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so to spare 
them, and kill as few of them as I could : and especially I was unwilling 
to hazard the killing any of our men, knowing the others were very well 
armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not separate ; and, there- 
fore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and ordered 
Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet as close to the 
ground as they could, that they might not be discovered, and get as near 
them as they could possibly, before they offered to fire. 

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who was 
the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the 
most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them 
with two more of the crew : the captain was so eager at having the principal 
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him 
come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before : 
but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their 
feet, let fly at them. 

The boatswain was killed upon the spot ; the next man was shot i& 
the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two 
after ; and the third ran for it. 

At the noise of the fire, X immediately advanced with my whole army, 
which was now eight men, viz., myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieu- 
tenant-general ; the capt^ and his two men, and the three prisoners of 
war, whom we had trusted with arms. 

We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see 
our number ; and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now 
one of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, 
and so might perhaps reduce them to terms, which fell out just as we 
desired, for, indeed, it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they 
would be very willing to capitulate. So he calls out, as loud as he coxdd, 



BOBINSON CBUSOB. 239 

to one of them, '' Tom Smith ! Tom Smith ! " Tom Smith answered 
immediately, '' Who 's that ? Eobinson ?" For it seems he knew the voice. 
The other answered, ** Ay, ay ; for Gkxl's sake, Tom Smith, throw down 
your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this moment." 

"Who must we yield to? Where are* they?" says Smith again. 
"Here they are," says he, " here's our captain and fifty men with him, 
have been hunting you these two hours : the boatswain is kUled, Will Fry 
is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; and if you do not yield, you are all lost." 
" Will they give us quarter then ?" says Tom Smith, " and we will 
yield." " I will go ask, if you promise to yield," says Eobioson. So he 
aaked the captain ; and the captain himself then calls out, " You, Smith, 
you know my voice ; if you lay down your arms immediately, and submit, 
you shall have yoiyr lives, all but Will Atkins." 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, "For Gkxl's sake, captain, give me 
quarter ; what have I done ? they have all been as bad as I," — ^which by 
the way, was not true neither, for, it seems, this Will Atkins was the 
^ man that laid hold of the captain, when they first mutinied, and used 
bim barbarously, in tying his hands, and giving him injurious language. 
However, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, 
and trust to the governor's mercy, by which he meant me, for they all 
<^6d me governor. 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their lives ; and 
I sent the man who had parleyed with them, and two more, who bound 
them all : and then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly with 
those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them all, and 
^pon their boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of sight for 
teasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing the 
ihip ; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he 
expostulated with them upon the villany of their practices with him, and 
at length upon the farther wickedness of their design, and how certainly 
it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to 
the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As 
for that, he told them they were none of his prisoners, but the com- 
Doander's of the island ; that they thought they had set him on shore in a 
barren, uninhabited island, but it had pleased God so to direct them, that 
the island was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman ; that 



240 ADTBIITUBBB 09 

be might hang them all there, if he pleased ; bat, as he had given them 
all quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with 
there as justioe required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded hj tk 
governor to advise to prepare for death, far that he would be hanged in 
the morning. 

Though all this was but a fiction of his own, yet it had its deeiied 
effect : Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede wiUi 
the governor for his life ; and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake, 
that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me that ihe time of our deliverance was come, and 
that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be heaily 
in getting possession of the ship ; so I retired in the dark from them, tbat 
they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the cap- 
tain to me; when I called, as at a good distance, one of the men was 
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, *^ Captain, the oommaodsr 
calls for you ;" and presently the captain replied, '^ Tell his excellency I 
am just a-coming." This more perfectly amused them, and they all 
believed that the commander was just by with his fifty men. 

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project for seiong 
the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved to put it is 
execution the next morning. 

But in order to execute it with more heart, and to be secure of saocess, 
I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take 
Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and eend them pinioned to 
the cave where the others lay. This was committed to Friday and the 
two men who came on shore with the captain. 

They conveyed them to the cave as to a prison ; and it was, indeed, a 
dismal place, especially to men in their conditicm. 

The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I hsre 
given a fcdl description ; and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the 
place was secure enough, considering they were upon their behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a 
parley with them, — in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he 
thought they might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship. 
He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they wen 
brought to, and that though the governor had given them quarter for 
their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to England, 
they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure ; but that if they would 



BOBINBON CBU60B. 241 

join in such an attempt as to recover the ship, he would haye the gover- 
nor's engagement for their jMurdon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by 
men in their condition ; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and 
promised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithM to 
him to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and 
would go with him all over the world ; that they would own him for a 
&ther as long as they lived. ** Well," says the captain, '' I must go and 
teU the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to 
consent to it." So he brought me an account of the temper he found 
them in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful. 

However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back 
again and choose out five, and tell them that they might see he did not 
want men, but that he would take out those five to be his assistants, 
and that the governor would keep the other two, and the three that were 
sent prisoners to the castle (my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those 
five ; and that, if they proved unfaithM in the execution, the five hostages 
should be hanged in chains alive on the shore. 

This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor was in 
earnest: however, they had no way left them but to accept it; and it 
was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain, to 
persuade the other five to do their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: — 1. The 
captain, his mate, and passenger. — 2. Then the two prisoners of the first 
gang, to whom, having their characters from the captain, I had given 
their liberty, and trusted them with arms. — 3. The other two that I had 
kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, upon the captain's motion, had 
now released. — 4. These five released at last ; so that they were twelve 
in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on 
board the ship ; but as for me and my man Priday, I did not think it was 
proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind : and it was employ- 
ment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with victuals. 

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but Friday 
went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries ; and I 
made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday 
was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, 

16 



242 ADYBNTT7BB6 OF 

who told them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after 
them, and that it was the govemor's pleasure they should not stir any 
where but by my direction ; that if they did, they should be fetched into 
the castle, and be laid in irons : so that, as we never suffered them to see 
me as a governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the 
governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two 
boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger 
captain of one, with four of the men ; and himself, his mate, and fire 
more, went in the other : and they contrived their business very well, for 
they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came within 
call of the ship, he made Eobinson hail them, and tell them thej had 
brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they 
had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they came to 
the ship's side ; when the captain and the mate enteriiig first, with their 
arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the 
butt end of their muskets. Being very faithftdly seconded by their men, 
they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks, and 
began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below ; when 
the other boat and their men, entering at the fore-chains, secured the 
forecastle of the ship and the scuttle which went down into the cock- 
room, making three men they found there prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the 
mate, with three men, to break into the round house, where the new 
rebel captain lay, who having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two 
men and a boy had gotten fire-arms in their hands ; and when the mate, 
with a crow, split open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly 
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which broke his 
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. 

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-honse, 
wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new captain through the 
head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of 
hi.s ears, so that he never spoke a word : upon which the rest yielded, and 
the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven gons 
to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice 
of bis success, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having 
sat watching upon the shore for it till near two o'clock in the morning. 



BOBINSON CBUBOB. 243 

Haying thus heaid the signal plainly, I laid me down ; and it liaving 
leen a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something 
orprised at the noise of a gun : and presently starting up, I heard a man 
all me by the name of ** Governor, Goyemor," and presently I knew the 
aptain's yoice, — when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and 
Minting to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. *' My dear Mend and 
kliyerer," says he, *' there's your ship, for she is all yours, and so are 
re, and all that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there 
the rode within little more than half a mile of the shore ; for they had 
ireig^ed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and the weather 
:»eing fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of a 
little creek ; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace 
in near the place where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at 
tny door. 

I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise ; for I saw my 
leliyerance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large 
ihip just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for 
Borne time, I was not able to answer him one word ; but as he had taken 
me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. 

He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle out of his 
pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose 
for me. After I drank it, I sat down on the ground ; and though it 
hrou^t me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word 
to him. 

All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not 
Under'* any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender 
things to me, to compose and bring me to myself: but such was the flood 
df joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion ; at last it 
broke out into tears, and in a little while after I recovered my speech. 

Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my d^verer, and we 
rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent from 
Seaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a 
2hain of wonders ; that such things as these were the testimonies we had 
of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that 
tlie eyes of an Infinite Power could search into the remotest comer of the 
world, and send help to the miserable whenever he pleased. 

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven ; and what 
heart could forbear to bless Him who had not only in a miraculous 



244 ADYBNTI7BES 0? 

manner proyided for me in sach a wilderness, and in such a desolate 
condition, but from whom ererj deliveranoe must always be acknowledged 
to proceed? 

Wben we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brou^t me 
some little refireshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretcfaa 
that had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. XJpoii this 
he caUed aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that 
were for the goyemor ; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been one 
that was not to be earned awaj with them, but as if I had been to dwell 
upon the island stilL 

First, he brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial witen; 
six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two 
pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelre good pieces of the ship's beef, 
and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a hundred wei^t o^ 
biscuit : he brought also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, 
and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance of other things. Bnt) 
besides these, and what was a thousand times more useM to me, he 
brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair d 
gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a Tery 
good suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but yery little; 
in a word, he clothed me from head to foot. 

It was a yery kind and agreeable present, as any one may imagine, to 
one in my circumstances ; but never was any thing in the world of thit 
kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to me to wear sack 
clothes at their first putting on. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were 
brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to he 
done with the prisoners we had : for it was worth considering whether 
we might venture to take them away with us or no, — especially two of 
them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; 
and the captain said he knew they were such rogues, that there was bo 
obliging them, and if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as nak- 
factors, to be delivered over to justice at the first English colony he oonU 
come at ; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about it 

Upon this I told him, that if he desired it, I durst undertake to bnsg 
the two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he shoiiM 
leave them upon the island. " I should be very glad of that," says the 
captain, " with all my heart." 



B0BIN80N CBX760B. 245 

^* Well," says I, *^ I will send for them up, and talk with tiiem for 
you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now 
disdiarged, their comrades having pexformed their promise, — ^I say, I 
caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as 
they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. 

After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit ; and now I 
was called governor again. Being all met, and the captain with me, I 
caused the men to be brought before me, and I told them I had had a fall 
aocoont of their villanous behaviour to the captain, and how they had run 
away with the ship, and were preparing to commit farther robberies, but 
that Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they 
were fallen into the pit which they had digged for others. 

I let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized, that 
she lay now in the road, and they might see, by and by, that their new 
captain had received the reward of his villany, for that they would see 
him hanging at the yard-arm : that as to them, I wanted to know what 
they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates taken in the 
fajdy as by my conunission they could not doubt I had authority to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing 
to say but this, that when they were taken, the captain promised them 
their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy; but I told them I 
knew not what mercy to show them, for, as for myself, I had resolved to 
quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain 
to go for England ; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to 
"RnglflTif^^ other than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and 
running away with the ship — ^the consequence of which they must needs 
know would be the gallows ; so that I could not tell what was best for 
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island : if they 
desired that, as I had liberty to leave it, I had some inclination to give 
them their lives, if they thought they could shift on shore. 

They seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much rather 
venture to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged : so I left 
it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he 
durst not leave them there. TJpon this I seemed a little angry with the 
captain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his ; that, seeing 
I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my word ; and 
that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty as 



246 ADYBNTUBBS 0? 

I found them ; and if lie did not like that, he might take them again if 
he conld catch them. 

Upon this they appeared very thankM, and I accordingly set them at 
liberty, and bade them retire into the woods to the place whence thej 
came, and I would leave them some fire-arms, some ammnnition, and 
some directions how they should live very well, if they thought fit. 

Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship, but told the captam 
that I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to go 
on board in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send the 
boat on shore the next day for me, — ordering him in the meantime to 
cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, 
that these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men* up to me to my apart- 
ment, and entered seriously into discourse with them of their circun- 
stances. I told them I thought they had made a right choice ; that if 
the captain carried them away, they would certainly be hanged. I 
showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and 
told them they had nothing less to expect. 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told 
them I would let them into the story of my living there, and put them 
into the way of making it easy to them : accordingly, I gave them the 
whole history of the place, and of my coming to it ; showed them mj 
fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my com, cured mj 
grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. 1 
told them the story also of the fifteen Spaniards that were to be expeeted, 
for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common 
with themselves. 

I left them my fire-arms, viz., five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and 
three swords. I had about a barrel and a half of powder left ; for after 
the first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a 
description of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and 
fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese: in a word, I gate 
them every part of my own story, and I told them I should prevail with 
the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some 
garden seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of : also 1 
gave them the bag of peas which the captain h^d brought me to eat, and 
bade them be sure to sow and increase them. 

Having done' all this, I left them the next day, and went on board 



BOBINBON CETIBOB. 247 

tlie ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh tliat night. 
The next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship's 
aide, and making a most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged 
to be taken into the ship, for God'a aake, for tJiey Hhonld be mtudercd, 
and be^ed the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them 
immediately. 

Upon this, the captain pretended to hare no power without me ; bnt 
after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, they 
were taken on board, and were some time after soundly whipped and 
piclded, after which they preved very honest and qniet fellows. 

Some time after this the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being np, 
with the things promised to the men, to which the captain, at my inter- 
cession, caused tlieir chesto and clothea to be added, which they took, and 
were Tery thankful for. I also encouraged them, by tilling them that if 
it lay in my way to send any vessel to take them in, I would not forget

PVHEN I took leave of this island, I carried on board, fbr

the money I fonneily mentioned, vhich had lain by me 
so long useless, that it was grown rusty or tamisheni, and could hardly 
pass for eilTer, till it had been a little nibbed and handled ; as also tlte 
money I fonnd in the wreck trf the Spanish ship. 




E0BIN80N CRUfiOlt. 249 

And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the 
bip's aoconnt, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and- 
irenty years, two months, and nineteen days ; being delivered from the 
Mond captiyity the same day of the month that I first made my escape 
1 the barcolongo, firom among the Moors of Sallee. 

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I anived in England the 1 1th of 
me, in the year 1687, having been thirty and five years absent. 

When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the world 
I if I had never been known there. Mj benefactor and faithful steward, 
horn I had left in trust with my money, was alive, but had had great 
isfortunes in the world — was become a widow the second time, and very 
w^ in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assur- 
% her I would give her no trouble ; but, on the contrary, in gratitude 
r her former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little 
ock would afford, which at that time would indeed allow me to do but 
ttle for her : but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness 
) me, — nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be 
beerved in its proper place. 

I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but my father was dead, and 
\y mother and all the family extinct, except that I found two sisters, 
ttd two of the children of one of my brothers ; and as I had been long 
SO given over for dead, there had been no provision made for me : so 
uit, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that little 
umey I had would not do much for me as to settling in the world. 

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect ; 
id this was, that the master of the ship whom I had so happily de- 
rered, and by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a 
ry handsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the 
res of the men, and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some 
her merchants concerned, and altogether made me a very handsome 
mpliment upon that subject, and a present of almost two hundred pounds 
srling. 

But aft^ making several reflections upon the circumstances of my 
3, and how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, 
'esolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some informa- 
n of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become 
my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years now given 
I over for dead. - 



250 ADVBNTTJBES OF 

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in April 
following ; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all these 
ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon aU occasions. 

When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particulir 
satisfaction, my old friend the captain of the ship ,who first took me up at 
sea off the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off the 
sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man, into his ship} 
and who still used the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me, and, 
indeed, I hardly knew him ; but I soon brought him to my remembrance, 
and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him who I 
was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance, I inquired, 
you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. The old man told 
me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years ; but that he could 
assure me that, when he came away, my partner was living, but the 
trustees whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my part, were 
both dead ; that, however, he believed I would have a very good account 
of the improvement of the plantation, for that upon the general belief of 
my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account 
of the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, vho 
had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one-third to the 
king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended 
for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the 
Catholic faith ; but that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the 
inheritance, it would be restored, — only that the improvement, or annual 
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restorei 
But he assured me that the steward of the king's revenue from lands, and 
the provedore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all along 
that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every year a faithfnl 
account of the produce, of which they received duly my moiety. 

I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had brougjbt 
the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth looking after, 
or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with no obstruction to 
my possessing my just right in the moiety ? 

He told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation 
was improved ; but this he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding 
rich upon the enjoying but one half of it, and that, to the best of his 
remembrance, he had heard that the king's third of my part, which was. 



B0BIN80N CBTJBOB. 251 

it seems, granted away to some other monastery or religions honse, 
amounted to above two hundred moidores a-year : that, as to my being 
Testored to a qniet possession of it, there was no question to be made of 
that, my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name being also 
enrolled in the register of the country. Also he told me that the sur- 
Tivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy ; 
and he helieved I would, not only have their assistance for putting me in 
possession, but would find a very considerable sum of money in their 
liands for my account, being the produce of the farm while their fathers 
Iield the trust, and hefore it was given up, as above,— which, as he 
remembered, was for about twelve years. 

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and 
inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should 
thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and 
had made him, the Portuguese captain, my tmiversal heir, etc. 

He told me that was true, but that, as there was no proof of my Being 
dead, he could not act as executor, until some certain account should 
come of my death ; and that, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle 
with a thing so remote ; that it was true he had registered my will, and 
put in his claim, and, could he have given any account of my being dead 
or alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the 
ingenio (so they called the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was 
now at the Brazils, order to do it. '' But," says the old man, '< I have 
one piece of news to tell you, which, perhaps, may not be so acceptable 
to you as the rest ; and that is, that, believing you were lost, and all the 
world believing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account 
to me in your name for six or eight of the first years of profit, which I 
received ; but there being at that time," says he, ** great disbursements 
for increasing the works, building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did 
not amount to near so much as afterwards it produced. However," says 
the old man, '' I shall give you a true account of what I have received in 
all, and how I have disposed of it." 

After a few days' farther conference with this ancient fHend, he 
brought me an account of the first six years' income of my plantation, 
signed by my partner and the merchant trustees, being always delivered 
in goods, viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, 
etc., which is the consequence of a sugar-work: and I found by this 
account, that every year the income considerably increased; but, as 



252 ADYBNTUBBB OF 

above, the disbursements being large, the sum at first was small. How- 
ever, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and 
seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double 
rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked 
coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the place. 

The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and how h 
had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy 
him a share in a new ship. <' However, my old Mend," says he, "yon 
shall not want a supply in your necessity ; and as soon as my son retunu, 
you shall be fully satisfied." Upon this, he pulls out an old pouch, and 
gives me one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold, and giving loe 
the writings of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils 
in, of which he was a quarter part owner, and his son another, he puts 
them both into my hands, for security of the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor 
man to be able to bear this ; and, remembering what he had done for me, 
how he had taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me an 
all occasions, and particularly how sincere a Mend he was now to me, 1 
could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me ; therefore fint 
I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at 
that time, and if it would not straiten hiib ? He told me he could not 
say but it might straiten him a little; but,: however, it was my money, 
and I might want it more than he. 

Every thing the good man said was full of affection, and I could 
hardly reMdn from tears while he spoke ; in short, I took one hundred 
of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt far 
them : then I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possessioii 
of the plantation, I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, 1 
afterwards did) ; and that, as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's 
ship, I would not take it by any means, but that if I wanted the money, 
I found he was honest enouig^ to pay me ; and, if I did not, but came to 
receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a peony 
more from him. 

When this was past, the old man began to ask me if he should pnt 
me on a method to make my claim to my plantation? I told him 1 
thought to go over to it myself. He said I mig^t do so, if I pleased, but 
that, if I did not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and imme- 
diately to appropriate the profits to my use ; and as there were ships in 



BOBIKSON CRU80B. 253 

he liver of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my 
lame in a public register, with this affidavit, affirming upon oath that I 
iras alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the 
planting the said plantation at finrt. This being regularly attested by a 
notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter 
Off his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place, and then 
pfoposed my staying with him till an account came of the return. 

Never anything was more honourable than the proceedings upon this 
procuration ; far in less than seven months I received a large packet from. 
tile 8urviv<H« of my trustees, the merchants, on whose account I went to 
tea, in which where the foUowing particular letters and papers enclosed :— 

First, There was the account-cuirent of the produce of my farm or 
plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old 
Portugal captain, being for six years: the balance appeared to be one 
I^OQsand (me hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, There was the account of four years more, while they kept 
tiie effects in their hands, before the government daimed the adminis- 
tration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which they called 
ciyil death ; and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing, 
tmounted to nineteen thousand foxa hundred crusadoes, being about three 
thousand two hundred and forty-one moidores. 

Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustine's account, who had 
teoeived the profits for above fourteen years ; but not being able to account 
for what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight 
hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknow- 
ledged to my account : as to the king's part, that refanded nothing. 

There was also a letter of my partner's congratulating me very affec- 
tionately upon my being aHve, giving me an account how the estate was 
improved, and what it produced a year : with a particular of the number 
of squares or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there 
were upon it, and making two and twenty crosses for blessings*, told me 
he had said so many <' Ave Marias" to thank the blessed Virgin that I 
was alive ; inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession 
of my own ; and in the mean time, to give him orders to whom he should 
deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty 
tender of his friendship, and that of his family : and sent me, as a present, 
seven fine leopard's skins ; which he had, it seems, received from Africa, 
by some other ship that he had sent thither, and who, it seems, had made 



254 ADYBNTTJRBB OF 

a better voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent sweet- 
meats, and a hundred pieces of gold nncoined, not quite so large as 
moidores. 

By the same fleet, my merchant trustees shipped me twelve hmidred 
chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole 
account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better 
than the beginning. It is impossible to express the fluttenngs of my yerj 
heart, when I looked over these letters, and especially when I found all 
my wealth about me ; for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the same 
ships which brought my letters brought my goods, and the effects wen 
safe in the river before the letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned 
pale, and grew sick; and had not the old man run and fetched me a 
cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had 
died upon the spot. Kay, after that I continued very ill, and was so 
some hours, till, a physician being sent for and something of the real cause 
of my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood, after which I 
had relief, and grew well ; but I verily believe, if it had not been eased 
by the vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above fifty thousand pounds 
sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the 
Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a-year, as sure as an estate of lands 
in England ; and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew 
how to understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment ol 
The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good 
old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to 
me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him all 
that was sent to me ; I told him that next to the Providence of Heaven, 
which disposes all things, it was owing to him ; and that it now lay on 
me to reward him, which I would do an hundred-fold : so I first retuined 
to him the hundred moidores I had received of him ; then I sent for a 
notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge for 
the four hundred and seventy moidores which he had acknowledged he 
owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner possible. After which 1 
caused a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of 
the annual profits of my plantation, and appointing my partner to account 
to him, and make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my name; 
and a clause in the end, being a grant of one hundred moidores a-year to 



B0BIN80N CBUBOB. 255 

luin during his life, ont of the effects, and fifty moidores a year to his son 
after him, for his life ; and thus I reqnited my old man. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what 
to do with the estate .that Providence had thus put into my hands ; and, 
indeed, I had more care upon my head now th^ I had in my silent state 
of life in the island, where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had 
nothing but what I wanted ; whereas, I had now a great charge upon me, 
and my business was how to secure it. I had never a cave now to hide 
my money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it 
grew mouldy and tarnished before any body would meddle with it ; on 
the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My 
old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only re^ge 
Ihad. 

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me 
thither ; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I had 
settled my afiiEurs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. At 
first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and 
would be just to me ; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for 
aught I knew, might be in debt : so that, in a word, I had no way but 

m 

to go back to England myself, and take my effects with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and« 
therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, 
who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor 
widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it 
was in her power, my faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing 
I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, 
not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in money 
a hundred pounds from me, and to talk vrith her, and comfort her in her 
poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply : at 
the same time I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds 
each, they being, though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances 
— one having been married and left a widow, and the other having a hus- 
band not BO kind to her as he should be. 

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet pitch 
upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might go 
away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me ; and this greatly 
perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled my- 



666 ADYBNTUBEfi 07 

self there, — ^for I was, as it were, naturalized to the place ; but I had some 
little scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me back 
However, it was not religion that kept me from going thither for the pre- 
sent ; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of the 
country all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet ; only th4 
now and then, having of late thought more of it than formerly, when 1 
began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret mj 
having professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the belt 
religion to die in. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me firon 
going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leare 
my effects behind me : so I resolved, at last, to go to England with thentt 
where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or find 
some relations that would be faithful to me ; and, accordingly, I prepared 
to go to England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first — ^the Brazil fleet 
being just going away — ^resolved to give answers suitable to the just and 
faithful account of things I had from thence ; and, first, to the prior of 
St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, and 
the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were un- 
disposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the monas- 
tery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior should 
direct ; desiring the good padre's prayers for me, and the like. 

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the 
acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for; as for 
sending them any present, they were far above having any occasion of it 

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in &e im- 
proving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of the 
wcn-ks ; giving him instructions for his future government of my pait, 
according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired 
him to send whatever came due to me, till he should hear from me more 
partici^larly ; assuring him that it was my intention not only to c<Hne to 
him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this 1 
added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two 
daughters, for such the captain's son informed me he had ; with two 
pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get in lisbon, five 
pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good value. 

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all mj 



B0BIN60N CBUBOB. 257 

eflbets into good bills of ezchaiigey my next difficulty was, which way to 
go to England : I had been accustomed enough to the sea^ and yet I had 
m strange ayersion to go to England by sea at that time ; and though I 
Donld give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, 
Qiat, though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go,, yet I altered 
my mind, and that not once, but two or three times* 

It is true I had been very unfortunate by s^a,. and this might be one 
of the reasons ; but let no man alight the strong impulses of his own 
Uioughts in cases of such moment : two of the ships which I had singled 
opot to go in, — ^I mean more particularly singled out than any other, having 
put my things on board one of them, and, in the other, agreed with 
the captain ; I say, two of these ships miscarried, viz., one was taken by 
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, 
aaid all the people drowned, except three ; so that in either of those yessels 
I had been made miserable, and in which most, it was hard to say. 

Haying been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I 
communicated eyery thing, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but 
eitiier to go by land to the Groyne (Corunna), and cross oyer the Bay of 
Biscay to Eochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by 
land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and so 
all the way by land through Erance. 

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except 
ftom Calais to Dover, that I resolved to travel all the way by land; 
which, as I was not in haste,, and did not value the charge, was by much 
the pleasanter way : and to make it more so,, my old captain brought an 
]*higlish gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to 
travel with me; afber which we picked up two English merchants 
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only; 
80 that in alL there were six of us, and five servants, — the two merdiants 
and the two Portuguese contenting themselves with one servant between 
two, to save the charge. As for me, I got an English sailor to travel with 
me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to 
be capable of supplying the place of a servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company being veoy 
well mounted and armed, we made a little troop,, whereof they did. me the 
honour to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as 
because I had two servants, and, indeed, was the original of the whole 
journey.

258 ADYENTUBES OF 

Ab I haye troubled you witii none of my sea journals, so I shall 
trouble you now with none of my land journals ; but some adventuw h-^ 
that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit | ^ 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to Spain, wen 
willing to stay some time to see the court. of Spain, and to see whatvu 
worth observing ; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened 
away, and set out fix)m Madrid about the middle of October. Butirben 
we came to the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towni 
on the way, vrith an account that so much snow was fiEdlen on the French 
side of the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come Iwck 
to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so, indeed ; and to 
me, that had been always used to a hot dimate, and to countries where 1 
could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable : nor, indeed, 
was it more painful than surprising, to come but ten days before out of 
Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and 
immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, 
60 severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger the benumbing and 
perishing of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the mountains all 
covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt 
before in his life. 

To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued snow- 
ing with so much violence, and so long, that the people said winter was ^ 
come before its time ; and the roads, which were difficult before, were now 
quite impassable : for, in a word, the snow lay in some places too thick 
for us to travel, and being not hard frx)zen, as is the case in the northern 
coimtries, there was no going without being in danger of being buried 
alive every step. We staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; 1 
when, seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, 
for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had been known in 
the memory of man, I proposed that we should all go away to Fontarabia, 
and there take shipping for Bourdeaux, which was a very little voyage. 

But while wc were considering this, there came in four French gen- 
tlemen, who having been stopped on the French side of the passes, as we 
were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the country 
near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains by 
such ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow, and, 



BOBINBON CBUSQB. 259 

sxe they met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard 

ogh to bear them and their horses. 

^e sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to caity us 

eame way with no hazard from the snow, provided we were armed 
Iciently to protect ourselves frx)m wild beasts ; for, he said, upon these 
Bit snows it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the 
b of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the ground 
ag covered with snow. We told him we were well enough prepared 
such creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two- 
Iged wolves, which, we were told, we were in most danger frx}m, 
tecially on the French side of the mountains. 

He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way that we 
ere to go ; » so we readily agreed to [follow him, as did also twelve 
hsT gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, 
s I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged.to come back again. 

Accordingly, we all set out from Pampeluna, with our guide, on the 
lith of November ; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of going 
irwaid, he came directly back with us on the same road that we came 
om Madrid, above twenty miles, when, having passed two rivers, and 
me into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, 
biere the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen ; but on a sudden, 
ming to his left, he approached the mountains another way, and though 
is true the hills and precipices looked dreadM, yet he made so many 
ITS, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, we insensibly 
ssed the height of the mountains without being much incimibered with 
3 snow ; and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant frxiitfiil pro- 
ices of Languedoc and G^coigne, all green and flourishing, though, 
leed, at a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass yet. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one 
lole day and a night so fast that we could not travel ; but he bade us 
easy, we should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that we began 

descend every day, and to come more north than before; and so, 
pending upon our guide, we went on. 

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being something 
fore us and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and 
;er them a bear, out of a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood. Two 
the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he been half-a-mile before us 

had been devoured, indeed, before we could have helped him : one of 



260 ibDYBNTURBS OF 

them fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with 
violence, that he had not time, or not presence of mind enou^ to 
his pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man 
being next me, I bade him lide up, and see what was the matter. Ai 
soon as Priday came in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud uV 
other, <'0 master! master!" but, like a bold fellow, rode up direetif 
to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him in 
head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; far be, 
having been used to such creatures in his country, had no fear upon bin, 
but went close up to him and shot him, as above : whereas, any other of 
us would have fired at a greater distance, and have perhaps either mined 
the wolf, or endangered shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I, and, indeed, 
it alarmed all our compgny, when, with the noise of Friday's jnstol, ire 
heard on both sides the dismalest bowlings of wolves, and the noiee I^ 
doubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was to us as if there bid 
been a prodigious multitude of them ; and, perhaps, indeed, there wasiot 
such a few as that we had no cause of apprehension. 

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened 
upon the horse left him immediately, and fled, having happily Dutened 
upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle stuck in his teeth, so tbet 
he had not done him much hurt : the man, indeed, was most hurt, fitr 
the raging creature had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the otber 
time a little above his knee, and he was just as it were tumbling down Vj 
the disorder of the horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that, at the noise of Friday's pistol, we all 
mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very diffi- 
cult, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as ire 
came dear of the trees which blinded us before, we saw clearly what hd 
' been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we 
did not presently discern what*!ldnd of creature it was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a snrprisiiig 
manner, as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gsre 
us all (though at first we were surprised and a&aid for him) the greatest 
diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does 
not gallop as the wolf does, which is swift and light, so he has two pszii* 
cular qualities which generally are the rule of his actions : first, as to 






S0BIN60N CBD60B. 




men, vho are not his proper prey — ^I eay not hia proper prey, because, 
thongh I can't eay what exccBUTe hunger nii^t do, which was now their 
case, the ground heing all covered with snow, yet as to men, he does not 
vmally attem|A them, unlets they fint attack him ; on the contraiy, if 



262 ADYSMTURES OF 

you meet him in the woods, if you don't meddle with him, he won't 
meddle with you : but then you must take care to be very civil, to him, 
and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman ; he won't go a 
step out of his way for a prince — ^nay, if you are really afraid, your best 
way is to look another way, and keep going on, for sometimes, if yon 
stop and stand still, and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affiront, 
and if you throw or toss anything at him, and it hits him, though it weie 
but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it for an afi&ont, and sets 
all other business aside to pursue his revenge, for he will have satisfiBurtioii 
in point of honour, and this is his first quality : the next is, that if lie 
be once affironted, he will never leave you, night nor day, till he has his 
revenge, but follow at a good round rate till he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to 
him, he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and 
frighted — and, indeed, the last more than the first — when, on a sudden, 
we espied the bear come out of the wood, and a vast monstrous one it 
was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little surprised 
when we saw him ; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and 
courage in the fellow's countenance. "0! 0! 0!" says Friday, three 
times, pointing to him ; '' master ! you give me te leave, me shakee te 
hand with him ; me makee you good laugh." 

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased. " You fool," says I, 
"he will eat you up." "Eatee me up! eatee me up!" says Friday, 
twice over again ; " me eatee him up ; me makee you good laugh. Yon 
all stay here, me show you good laugh." So down he sits, and gets 
his boots off in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps (as we call the 
flat shoes they wear), which he had in his pocket, gives my other serrant 
his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobody, 
till Friday, coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could under- 
stand him, "Hvk ye, hark ye," says Friday, "me speakee wit pu." 
We followed at a distance, for now being come down on the Grascoigne 
side of the mountains, we were entered a vast great forest, where the 
country was plain and pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here 
and there. 

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with him 
quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws at him, and hit him just 
on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 263 

a wall ; but it answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear 
Hiat he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us some 
lan^ as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, 
lie toms about, and comes after him, taking devilish long strides, and 
shuffling along at a strange rate, so as would put a horse to a middling 
gallop : away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he run towards us 
for help ; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my 
man — though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back 
upon us, when he was going about his own business another way ; and 
especially I was an^y that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run 
away, and I called out, '' You dog, is this your making us laugh ? Come 
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creature." He hears 
me, and cries out, '^ Ko shoot, no shoot ; stand still, and you get much 
lang^ ;" and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one, he 
turned on a sudden on one side of us, and seeing a great oak tree fit for 
his purpose, he beckoned us to follow, and, doubling his pace, he gets 
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground at about five 
or ax yards from the bottom of the tree. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance : the 
first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up 
he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrously 
heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could 
not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till, seeing the bear get up 
the tree, we all rode nearer to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was IViday got out to the small of a 
large limb of the tree, and the bear got about half way to him. As soon 
as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, 
'< Ha !" says he to us, '' now you see me teachee the bear dance ;" so he 
CeJIs a jumping and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, 
but stood still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get 
back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done 
with him by a great deal : when he sees him stand still, he calls out to 
him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, '' What, 
you come no farther? pray you come farther;" so he left jumping and 
ahaking the bough, and the bear, just as if he had understood what he 
aaid, did come a little fiEirther ; then he fell a jumping again, and the bear 
atopped again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him on the head, and 



264 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

called to IViday to stand still, and we woald shoot the bear ; but be cried 
out eamestlyy " pray ! pray ! no shoot, me shoot by and then ;"— be 
would hare said, by and by. However, to shorten the story, Friday 
danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laug^ 
enough indeed, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do ; for 
first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off, and we found tk 
bear was too cunning for that too, for he would not go out far enon^to 
be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad daws and feet, bo 
that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and where tk 
jest would be at last. 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly ; for, seeing the bear ding 
fast to the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come any 
farther, "Well, well," says Friday, ^*you no come farther, me go, mt 
go ; you no come to me, me come to you," and upon this, he goes out to 
the smallest end of the bough, where it would bend with his weight, and 
gently lets himself down by it, sliding down the bough, till he came near 
enough to jump down on his feet, and away he runs to his gun, takes it 
up, and stands still. 

"Well," said I to him, "Friday, what will you do now? "Why 
don't you shoot him?" "No shoot," says IViday, "no yet; me shoot 
now me no kiU ; me stay, give you one more laugh." And, indeed, so he 
did, as you will see presently : for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he 
comes back from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty leisurdy, 
looking behind him at every step, and coming backward till he got into 
the body of the tree ; then, with the same hinder end foremost, he came 
down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, 
very leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hind 
feet on the ground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muxzle 
of his piece into his ear, and shot him dead as a stone. 

Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh ; and when 
he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he falls a laughing himself very 
loud. " So we kiU bear in my country," says Friday. " So you kill 
them?" says I; "why you have no guns." "JS"©," says he, "nogon, 
but shoot great mueh long arrow." 

This was a good diversion to us ; but we were -still in a wild place, 
and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew : the 
howling of wolves run much in my head; and, indeed, except the 
noise I once heard on the fi&ore of AMca, of whidi I have said some- 



BOBINSON OBUSOB. 265 

^Qiing already, I neyer heard any thing that filled me with bo much 
^^onor. 

These things, and the approach of night, called ns off, or else, as 
Itiday wonld have had ns, we should certainly have taken the skin of this 
^Qonstrons creature off, which was worth saving ; but we had near three 
leagues to go, and our guide hastened us, so we left him, and went forward 
fm our journey. 

The ground was still corered with snow, though not so deep and 
dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard 
nfterwards, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by 
himger, to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the 
villages, where they surprised the country people, killed a great many of 
their sheep and horses, and some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our guide told us, if 
there were more wolves in the country we should find them there ; and 
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long 
narrow defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, 
and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge. 

•It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first wood, 
and a little after sunset when we came into the plain. We met with 
nothing in the first wood, except that, in a little plain within the wood 
which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves cross 
the road, full speed, one after another, as if they had been in chase of 
some prey, and had it in view ; they took no notice of us, and were gone 
out of sight in a few moments. 

Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was but a faint-hearted fellow, 
bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves 
a-comiug. 

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw no 
more wolves till we came through that wood, which was near half a 
league, and entered the plain. As soon as we came into the plain, we had 
oooasion enough to look about us : the first object we met with was a 
dead horse, that is to «ay, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and 
at least a dozen of them at work,— we could not say eating of him, but 
picking of his bones rather, for they had eaten up all the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast ; neither did they 
take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at them, but I would 
not iufier him by any means ; for I found we were like to have more 



266 ADYSNTUBBS OF 

business upon our hands than we were aware of. We were not gone half 
over the plain, when we began to hear the wolves howl on our left in a 
frightful manner, and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on 
directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a Hue, as regolaily 
as an army drawn up by an experienced oficer. I scarce knew in what 
manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close line was 
the only way : so we formed in a, moment. But that we might not hare 
too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and 
that the others who had not fired should stand ready to give them a second 
volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us ; and then that 
those who had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusils again, 
but stand ready every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fosil 
and a pair of pistols each man ; so we were by this method able to fire 
six volleys, half of us at a time. However, at present we had no neces- 
sity ; for upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being 
terrified as well with the noise as with the fire ; four of them, being shot 
in the head, dropped ; several others were wounded, and went bleeding 
off, as we could see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not 
immediately retreat ; whereupon, remembering that I had been told that 
the fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all our 
company to halloo as loud as they could : and I found the notion was not 
altogether mistaken ; for, upon our shout, they began to retire, and ton 
about. I then ordered a second volley to be fired in their rear, which pat 
them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods. 

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again ; and that we mi^ 
lose no time, we kept going : but we had but little more than loaded our 
fusils, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in 
the same wood, on our left, only that it was farther onward, the same way 
we were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the light began to be du^y, which 
made it worse on our side ; but the noise increasing, we could easily 
perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; 
and on a sudden, we perceived two or three troops of wolves,, one on our 
left, one behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be sur- 
rounded with them : however^ as they did not fall upon us, we kept our 
way forward, as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way 
being very rough, was only a good hard trot. In this manner we came in 
view of the entrance of the wood, through which we were to pass, at the 



ROBINSON CBUSOB. 267 

&rther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised, when, coming 
nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing 
jnBt at the entrance. 

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the noise of a 
gun; and, looking that way, out rushed a horse, with a saddle and bridle 
on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves after him, 
frill speed ; indeed, the horse had the heels of them, but as we supposed 
that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get 
up with him at last, — and no question but they did. 

Here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance 
where the horse came out, we found the carcass of another horse and of 
two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures. One of them was no 
doubt the same whom we heard Are a gun, for there lay a gun jiist by him 
fired off; but as to the man, his head and upper part of his body were 
eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to take, but 
the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in 
hopes of prey ; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. 
It happened very much to our advantage, that, at the entrance into the 
wood, but at a little way from it, there lay some large timber trees, which 
had been cut down the summer before, and I supppse lay there for carriage. 
I drew my little troop in among these trees, and placing ourselves in a line 
behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree 
before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three fronts, enclosing 
our horses in the centre. 

We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more furious 
charge than the creatures made upon us in this place. They came on 
with a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, 
IS I said, was 'our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their 
[yrey ; and this ^iry of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their 
seeing our horses behind us, which was the prey they aimed at. I 
)rdered our men to fire as before, every other man ; and they took their 
dm so sure, that they killed several of the wolves at the first volley : l)ut 
here was a necessity to keep a continual firing, for they came on like 
levils, those behind pushing on those before. 

When we had fired a second volley of fusils, we thought they stopped 
i little, and I hoped they would have gone off; but it was but a moment, 
!br others came forward again : so we fired two volleys of pistols ; and I 



268 ADYBNTTTBBS OF 

believe in these four firings we killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and 
lamed twice as many, — ^yet they came on again. 

I was loath to spend onr shot too hastily ; so I called my servant,^iiot 
my man Friday, for he was better employed, — ^for, with the greatest dex- 
terity imaginable, he charged my fusil and his own while we were 
engaged,— but as I said, I called my other man, and, giving him a horn of 
powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it be 
a large train. He did so ; and had just time to get away, when tiie 
wolves came up to it, and some were got upon it, when I, snapping an 
uncharged pistol dose to the powder, set it on fire, and those that were 
upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or 
rather jumped in among us, with the force and Mght of the fire : we 
dispatched these in an instant, and the rest were so frighted wiUi the 
light, which the night, for it was now very near dark, made more terrible, 
that they drew back a little. Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be 
fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a shout : upon this the 
wolves turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty 
lame ones, which we found struggling on the ground, and fell a-cutting 
them with our swords, which answered our expectation ; for the crying 
and howling they made was better understood by their fellows, so that 
they all fled and left us. , 

We had, first and last, kiUed about three score of them ; and had it 
been daylight, we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus 
cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go. 
"We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods, as we went, 
several times ; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but the 
snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain. So in about an hour more 
we came to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a 
terrible fright, and all in arms ; for it seems that the night before, the 
wolves and some bears had broke into that village, and put them in a 
terrible fright, and they were obliged to keep guard night and day, 
but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed, their 
people. 

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much 
with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we 
were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Tholouse, where we 
found a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, 
or any thing like them ; but when we told our story at Tholouse, they 



ROBINSON CBUBOB. 269 

told TU it was nothijig but what was oidinary in the great forest at the 

foot of the mountainB, especially when the snow lay on the ground ; but 

they inquired much what kind of a guide we had gotten, that would 

Tentnre to bring us that way in such a severe season, and told us it was 

Tery strange we were not all devoured. When we told them how we 

placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, 

and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed, for it was 

the sight of the horses that made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey, 

and that, at other times, they are really afraid of a gun ; but they, being 

excessive hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come at 

the horses had made them senseless of danger, — and if we had not, by the 

continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of powder, 

mastered them, it had been great odds but that we had been torn to 

pieces r whereas, had we been content to have sat still on horseback, and 

fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so much for their 

own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise : and withal they told 

08, that, at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they 

would have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have 

come off safe, especially having our fire arms in our hands, and being so 

many in number. 

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life ; for seeing 
above three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, 
and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost ; 
and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again : 
I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was 
sure to meet with a storm once a week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through 
France, nothing but what other travellers have given an account of^ with 
much more advantage than I can. I travelled from Tholouse to Paris, and 
without any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, 
the 14th of January, after having had a severe cold season to travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time 
all my new discovered estate safe about me ; the bills of exchange which 
I brought with me having been very currently paid. 

Ky principal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient widow, 
who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much, 
or care too great, to employ for me ; and I trusted her so entirely with 
every thing, that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects : 



270 ADYBNTUBBB OF 

and, indeed, I was very happy from the beginning, and now to the 
in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my effects with this woman, and 
setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brazils. But now another «m^ 
came in the way, and that was religion ; for as I had entertained some 
doubts about the Boman religion, even while I was abroad, especially in 
my state of solitude, so I knew there was no going to the Brazils for me, 
much less going to settle there, tmless I resolved to embrace the Boman 
Catholic religion, without any reserve ; — ^unless, on the other hand, 1 
resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for religion, and 
die in the !(nquisition. So I resolved to stay at home, and, if I could find 
means for it, to dispose of my plantation. 

To this purpose I wrote to my old Mend at Lisbon, who, in retain 
gave me notice that he could easily dispose of it there ; but that if 1 
thought fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants, 
the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the Brazils^ who must fiillj . 
understand the value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and whoml 
knew to be very rich, so that he believed they would be fond of buying it, 
he did not doubt but I should make four or five thousand pieces of ei^t 
the more of it. 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it to them, and he did 
so ; and in about eight months more, the ship being then returned, he sent 
me an account that they had accepted the offer, and had remitted thirty- 
three thousand pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to 
pay for it. In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the fonn which 
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the hills 
of exchange for thirty-three thousand pieces of eight for the estate; 
reserving the payment of one hundred moiddres a-year to him (the old 
man) during his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life, 
which I had promised them, and which the plantation was to make good 
as a rent-charge. 

And thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune and adven- 
ture, a life of Providence's chequer-work, and of a variety which the 
world will seldom be able to show the like of: beginning foolishly, but 
closing much more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so 
much as to hope for. 

Any one would think, that in this state of complicated good fortune, I 
was past miming any more hazards, and so indeed I had been, if othei 



BOBIKSON CBU80X. 271 

(arcmnHtances had concurred : but I was innred to a wandering life, had 
no family, nor many relationB, nor, however rich, had I contracted much 
■cqaaintance ; and thongh I had Bold my estate in the Brazils, yet I 
conld not keep that country ont of my head, and had a great mind to bo 
upon the wing again ; especially I could not resist the strong inclination 
I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Bpaniaids were in being 
Uieie ; and how the rognes I left there had used them. 

My trae friend, the widow, earnestly dissaaded me from it^ and so for 
pievailed with me, that almost for eeren years she prevented my mnning 
abroad, during which time I took my two nephews, the children of one of 
my brothers, into my care : the eldest having something of his own, I 
bred up as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some addition to his 
ettate, after my decease ; the other I pnt out to a captain of a ahip : and 
alter five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young follow, I 
put bJTp into a good ship, and sent him to sea; and this young fellow 
aiterwards drew m6 in, as old as I was, to farther adventores myself. 

In the meantime, I in part settled myself here ; for, first of all, I 
mairied, and that not either to my disadvantage or diBsatisfoction,— and 
had three children, two sons and one daughter.

[HAT homely proverb used on so many occasions in !&i^land, 
Tiz. '* That what is bred in the bone will not go out ef the 
flesh," was never more verified than in the story of my life. 
Any one would think that, after thirty-flve years' afflictioDi 
and a variety of unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, eror 
' went through before, and after near seven years of peace and enj63rment in 
the fulness of all things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed 
me to have had experience of ^very state of middle life, and to know 
which was most adapted to make a man completely happy, — I say, after 
all this, any one would have thought that the native pix)pensit7 to 
rambling, which I gave an account of in my first setting out in the world 
to have been so predominant in my thoughts, should be wom^ out, the 
volatile part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, at 
sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home, and 
have done venturing life and fortune any more. 

Kay, farther, tbe common motive of foreign adventures was taken 
away in me ; for I had no fortune to make — I had nothing to seek: if 1 
had gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer, for I had already 
sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to ; and that I had was 
visibly increasing, for, having no great family, I could not spend the 
income of what I had, unless I would set up for an expensive way of 
living, such as a great family, servants, equipage^ gaiety, and the like, 
which were things I had no notion of; or inclination to : bo that Ihad 



rf> 



ROBINBON CRUSOB. 275 

makes it your duty to go, He will make it also mine to go with you, or 
otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it." 

This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me a little out of the 
vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing : I corrected my wan- 
dering fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately what business I 
l^ad, after threescore years, and after such a life of tedious sufferings and 
^Hsasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner, — I say, what business 
kad I to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures fit only 
for youth and poverty to run into ? 

With those thoughts, I considered my new engagement — that I had a 

''^e, one child bom, and my wife then great with child of another — that 

I had all the world could give me, and had no need to seek hazards for gain 

^^that I was declining in years, and ought to think rather of leaving what 

1 had gained than of seeking to increase it — that, as to what my wife had 

^d, of its being a secret impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my 

4aty to go, I had no notion of that : so, after many of these cogitations, I 

straggled with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as 

I believe people may always do in like cases,, if they will ; and^ in a 

Vord, I conquered it ; composed myself with such arguments as occurred 

to my thoughts, and which my present condition famished me plentifriUy 

with ; and, particularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to divert 

myself with other things, and to engage in some business that might 

effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this kind ; for I found 

the thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or 

any thing of moment immediately before me. 

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford, 
and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little convenient house 
upon it, and the land about it I found was capable of great improve- 
ment, and that it was many ways suited to my inclination, which de- 
lighted in cultivating, managing, planting,, and improving of land ; 
and, particularly, being an inland county, I was removed from con- 
versing among ships, sailors, and things relating to the remote part ot 
the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm^ settled my family, bought mo 
ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows, sheep, and, setting seri- 
ously to work, became in one half year a mere country gentleman. My 
thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants, cultivating the 
ground, enclosing, planting, etc. ; and I lived, as I thought, the most 



276 ADYENTURBS OF 

agreeable life that nature was capable of directing, or that a man always 
bred to misfortunes was capable of being retreated to. 

I farmed upon my own land — I had no rent to pay — ^waa limited by 
no articles — I could pull up or cut down as I pleased — ^what I planted _ 
was for myself^ and what I improved was for my family ; and, hamg 
thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least discomfort in 
any part of my life as to this world. Now, I thought, indeed, that I 
enjoyed the middle state of life, which my father so earnestly recom- 
mended to me — a kind of heavenly life, something like what is described 
by the poet upon the subject of a country life : — 

" Free firom yices, free from care, 
Age has no pains, and youth no snare/' 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unforeseen Proyi- 
deuce unhinged me at once, and not only made a breach upon me, inevit- 
able and incurable, but drove me, by its consequence, upon a deep relapse 
into the wandering disposition, which, as I may say, being bom in my 
very blood, soon recovered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a 
violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force upon me, so that 
nothing could make any more impression upon me. This blow was the 
loss of my wife. 

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife, to give a 
character of her particular virtues, and make my court to the sex by the 
flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of aU my 
affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, the engine that, by her prudence, 
reduced me to that happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant 
and ruinous project that fluttered in my head, as above, and did more to 
guide my rambling genius than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, a 
friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning powers, could do. I was happy 
in listening to her tears, and in being moved by her entreaties, and, to 
the last degree, desolate and dislocated in the world, by the loss of her. 

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me ; I was 
as much a stranger in it in my thoughts as I was in the Brazils when 1 
went first on shore, and as much alone, except as to the assistance of ser- 
vants, as I was in my island. I knew neither what to do, or what not to 
do ; I saw the world busy round me, one part labouring for biead, and 
the other part squandering in vile excesses, or empty pleasures equally 
miserable, because the end they proposed still fled frt)m them ; for the 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 277 

men of pleasure every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped up work for 
sorrow and repentance, and the men of labour spent their strength in 
daily strugglings for bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured 
with ; 80 living in a daily circulation of sorrow — ^living but to work, and 
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only end of a wearisome 
life, and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the island, 
where I suffered no more com to grow, because I did not want it, and 
bred no more goats, because I had no more use for them — where the 
money lay in the drawer till it grew mildewed, and had scarce the favour 
to be looked upon in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have done, and 
as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to search 
farther than human enjoyments for a full felicity, and that there was 
something which certainly was the reason and end of life, superior to all 
these things, and which was either to be possessed, or, at least, hoped for, 
on this side of the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone ; I was like a ship without a pilot, 
that could only run before the wind ; my thoughts ran all away again 
into the old affair — my head was quite turned with the whimsies of 
foreign adventures ; and all the pleasing innocent amusements of my farm 
and my garden, my cattle and my family, which before entirely possessed 
me, were nothing to me, — ^had no relish, and were like music to one that 
has no ear, or food to one that has no taste : in a word, I resolved to 
leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London ; and in a few 
months after I did so. 

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as before; I had no 
relish to the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to saunter 
about like an idle person, of whom it may be said, he is perfectly useless 
in Gk>d's creation, and it is not one farthing matter to the rest of his kind 
whether he be dead or alive. This also was the thing which, of all cir- 
cumstances of life, was the most my aversion, who had been all my days 
used to an active Hfe ; and I would often say to myself, ** A state of idle- 
ness is the very dregs of Hfe : '' and,, indeed, I thought I was much more 
suitably employed, when I was twenty-six days making me a deal board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom, 
as I observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and had made him 
commands of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa, 



^7S ADVENTUBES OF 

being the first he had made. He came to me, and told me, that some 
merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a yoyage 
for them to the East Indies and to China, as private traders. '^ And now, 
nncle," says he, ''if you will go to sea with me, I'll engage to lasd 
you u{>on your old habitation in the island, for we are to touch at the 
Br&zik.'' 

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of the 
existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second caases 
with the ideas of things which we form in t)ur minds, perfectly reserved, 
and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was 
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thoughts to 
say, when that very morning, before he came to me, I had, in a great 
deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circum- 
stances in my mind, come to this resolution, namely, that I would go to 
Lisbon and consult with my old sea-captain ; and so, if it was rational 
and practicable, I would go and see the island again, and see what was 
become of my people there. I had pleased myseK also with the thoughts 
of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a 
patent for the possession, and I know not what ; when, in the middle of 
all this, in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project of canying 
me thither, in his way to the East Indies. 

I paused a while at his words, and, looking steadily at him, " What 
devil," said I, '' sent you this unlucky errand ?" My nephew started, as 
if he had been Mghted, at first ; but perceiving I was not much displeaaed 
with the proposal, he recovered himself. '' I hope it may not be an 
unlucky proposal, sir," says he ; ''I dare say you would be pleased to see 
your new colony there, where you once reigned with more felicity than 
most of your brother monarchs in the world." ' 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to say, 
with the prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so much, 
that I told him in a few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I would 
go with him ; but I told him I would not promise to go any fiEurther than 
my own island. " Wby, sir," says he, " you don't want to be left there 
again, I hope?" "Wby," said I, "can you not take me up again in 
your return ?" He told me, it could not be possible that the merchants 
would allow him to come that way with a loaden ship of such value, it 
being a month's sail out of his way, and might be three or four : '' besides, 



BOBINSON CRU80B. 279 

r, if I Bhonld miscarry," said he, " and not return at all, then you wouldj, 
e just reduced to the condition you were in before." 

Thifl waa very rational : but we both found out a remedy for it, which 
vsB, to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, being taken in 
>iecc8 and shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of some car- 
penters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the island 
ind finished, fit to go to sea in a few days. 

I was not long resolving ; for indeed the importunities of my nephew 
joined in so effectually with my inclination, that nothing could oppose me ; 
Dn the other hand, my wife being dead, I had no body concerned them- 
lelvcs so much for me as to persuade me one way or other, except my 
incient good friend, the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to con- 
sider my years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazard of a long 
royage, and, above all, my young children : but it was all to no purpose ; 
[ had an irresistible desire to the voyage, and I told her I thought there 
iras something so unconmion in the impressions I had upon my mind for 
;he voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence if I should 
ittempt to stay at home ; after which she ceased her expostulations, and 
oined with me, not only in making provision for my voyage, but also in 
lettling my family affairs in my absence, and providing for the education 
>f my children. 

In order to this I made my will, and settled the estate I had .in such 
% manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that I was per- 
fectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them, whatever 
might befal me ; and for their education, I left it wholly to my widow, 
with a suficient maintenance to herseK for her ciqre ; all which she richly 
deserved^ for no mother could have taken more care in their education, or 
understood it better : and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to 
thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January 1694-5, 
and I, with my man Friday, went on board in the Downs the 8th, having, 
besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of 
all kinds of necessary things for my colony, which, if I did not find in 
good condition, I resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed to place 
there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon my own account 
while I staid, and either to leave them there, or carry them forward, m 
they should appear willing ; particularly, I carried two carpenters, and a 



i 



280 ADYBNTURE8 OF 

Bmith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, 
but was also a general mechanic ; for he was dexterous at making wheels 
and hand-mills to grind com, was a good turner, and a good pot-maka; 
he also made any thing that was proper to make of earth or of wood : in 
a word, we called him our '' Jack-of-all-trades." 

With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himself to go passenger 
to the East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on 
our new plantation, and preyed a most necessary handy fellow as could be 
desired, in many other businesses besides that of his trade; for, as I 
observed formerly, necessity arms us for all employments. 

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept an account of 
the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and some thin 
English stuffs for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find there, and 
enough of them as, by my calculation, might comfortably supply them for 
seven years. If I remember right, the materials which I carried fa 
clothing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as 
they could want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred pounds, 
including some beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen 
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, etc., besides, near a hundred 
pounds more in ironwork, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, 
and every necessary thing I could think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusils, besides some 
pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of 
lead, and two pieces of brass cannon ; and because I knew not what time 
and what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred barrels of 
powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and 
halberts ; so that, in short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of stores ; 
and I made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he 
wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there was occasion, — ^that when 
they came Ihere we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts of 
enemies ; and indeed I at first thought that there would be need enough 
of it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the 
island, as shall be seen in the course of the story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet 
with : and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the reader, 
who, perhaps, may be impatient to hear how matters went with my colony ; 
yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad weather, happened on this 
first setting out, which made the voyage longer than I expected it at first; 



KOBINBOM CHVaOB. 281 

and I, who had never made but one voyage, namely, my flist voyage to 
Gninea, in which I might be said to come back again as the voyage was 
first designed, began to think the same ill fate still attended me, — that I 
Tras bom never to be contented with being on shore, and yet to be always 
unfortunate at sea. 




Contrary wmds first put us te the northward, and we were obliged to 
put in at Galway in Ireland, wheK we lay wmd bound two and thirty 
days ; bat we had this satisfaction with the disaster that provisioDS were 
here exceedingly cheap and in the utmost plenty so that while we lay 
here wo never touched the ship s steros, but rather added to them Here 
also I took several hogs, and two cows with their calves, which I resolved, 
if I had a good passage, to put on shore in my island, but we found occa- 
sioD to dispose otherwise of them. 

We set out on the Sth of February front Ireland, and had a very fair 
gale of wind for some days ; as I remember, it might be about the 20th 
of February, in the evening late, when the mate having the wateh, came 
into the round honse, and told us he saw a flash of fire, and hoard a gun 
fired ; and while he was telling us of it^ a boy came in, and told us the 
boatewain heard another. This mode us all run out upon the quarter- 
deck, where for a while we heard nothing, but in a few minutes we saw a 



282 ADYENTURB8 OF 

very great light, and found that there was Bome very terrihle fire at a di« 
tance. Immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all |:ii 
agreed that there could be no land that way in which the fire showed 
itself — no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at west-north-wat 
Upon this, we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea ; and, as bj I-: 
our hearing the noise of the guns just before we concluded it could not be 
far off, we stood directly towards it, and were presently satisfied we should 
discover it, because the farther we sailed the greater the light appeared, 
though the weather being hazy, we could not perceive any thing but the 
light for a while. In about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair for 
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, we could 
plainly discern it was a great ship on fire in the middle of the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all ac- 
quainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently recollected my 
former circumstances, in what condition I was in when taken up by the 
Portuguese captain:; and how much more deplorable the circumstances of 
the poor creatures belonging to this ship must be if they had no other 
ship in company with them : upon this, I immediately ordered that five 
guns should be fired, one soon after another, that, if possible, we mig^t 
give notice to them that there was help for them at hand, and that they 
might endeavour to save themselves in their boat ; for though we could 
see the flame in the ship, yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us. 

"We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship 
drove, waiting for daylight ; when on a sudden, to our great terror, though 
we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air, and immediatelj 
sunk. This was terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of 
the poor men, who, I concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, 
or be in the utmost distress in their boats in the middle of the ocean, 
which at present, by reason it was dark, I could not see : however, to 
direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all the 
parts of the ship where we could, and which we had lanterns for, and kept 
firing guns all the night long : letting them know by this, that there was 
a ship not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's boats bj 
the help of our perspective glasses ; and found there were two of them, 
both thronged with people, and deep in the water : we perceived thej 
rowed, the wind being against them — ^that they saw our ship, and did the 
utmost to make us see them. 



BOBINSON CBU80B. 283 

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them, 
od Imng a waft out, as a signal for them to come on board ; and then 
[lade more sail, standing directly to them. In a little more than half an 
lonr we came up with thom, and, in a word, took them all in, being no 
e88 than sixty-four men, women, and children ; for there were a great 
nany passengers. 

Upon the whole, we foimd it was a French merchant ship, of three 
hundred tons, homeward bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. 
rhe master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship, how the firo 
began in the steerage by the negligence of the steersman ; but, on his 
crying out for help, was, as every body thought, entirely got out^ but 
they soon found that some of the sparks of the first fire had gotten into 
Some part of the ship, so difficult to come at, that they could not effeo- 
taally quench it ; and afterwards getting in between the timbers, and 
within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, a{id mastered all 
bhe skill and all the application they were able to exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, which, to 
their great comfort, were pretty large ; being their long-boat, and a great 
fthallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no great service to them, other 
than to get some fresh water and provisions into her, after they had 
secured themselves from the fire. They had indeed small hope of their 
Lives by getting into these boats at that distance from any land ; only, as 
they. said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and had a possibility 
that some ship might happen to be at sea, and might take them in. They 
had sails, oars, and a compass ; and were preparing to make the best of 
their way to Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an 
easy at south-east-by-east. They had as much provisions and water as, 
with sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might support them 
about twelve days ; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con- 
trary winds, the captain said, he hoped he might get to the banks of 
Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish to sustain theln till they 
might go on shore. But there were so many chances against them in all 
these cases — such as storms to overset and founder them, rains and cold to 
benumb and perish their limbs, contrary winds to keep them out and 
starve them — that it must have been next to miraculous if they had 
escaped. 

In the midst of their consultations, every one being hopeless, and 
ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me, they were 



284 ADVENTURES OF 

on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after tiiat 
four more ; these were the five guns which I caused to be fired at first 
seeing the light: this revived their hearts, and gave them the notice 
which, as above, I designed it should, namely, that there was a ship at 
hand for their help. 

It was upon the hearing these gun?,* that they took down their masts 
and sails ; and the sound coming from windward, they resolved to lie bj 
till morning. Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired 
three muskets, one a considerable while after another ; but these, the 
wind being contrary, we never heard. 

Some time after that again, they were still more agreeably surprised 
with seeing our lights, and hearing our guns, which, as I have said,! 
caused to be fired all the rest of the night : this set them to work w/Sli 
their oars to keep their boats ahead, at least that we might the sooner 
come up with them ; and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we 
saw them. 

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the sbnnge 
ecstacies, the variety of postures, which these "pooT delivered people ran 
into, to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance. 
Grief and fear are easily described — sighs, tears, groans, and a very fev 
motions of head and hands, make up the sum of its variety : but an 
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it; 
there were some in tears, some raging and tearing themselves, as if they 
had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow ; some stark raving and down- 
right lunatic ; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others 
wringing their hands; some were dancing, several singing, some laughing, 
more crying ; many quite dumb, not able to speak a word ; others sick 
and vomiting, several swooning, and ready to fjEiint ; and a few were 
crossing themselves and giving God thanks. 

I would not wrong them neither — there might be many that were 
thankful afterward ; but the passion was too strong for them at first, and 
they were not able to master it — they were thrown into ecstacies and a 
kind of frenzy, and so there were but a very few who were composed and 
serious in their joy. 

Perhaps also the case may have some addition to it, from the particu- 
lar circumstance of the nation they belonged to — I mean the Frendi, 
whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and more 
sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than of other nations. I am not a 



R0BIN80N CBU80B. 285 

iiHosopIier to determine the cause, but nothing I had ever seen before 
une up to it ; the ecstacies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when 
e found his father in the boat, came the nearest to it ; and the surprise 
r the master, and his two companions, whom I delivered from the villains 
lat set them on shore on the island, came a little way towards it ; but 
othing was to compare to this, either that I saw in Priday, or any where 
Lbs in my life. 

It is farther observable, that these extravagances did not show them- 
olves in that different manner 'I have mentioned, in different persons 
nly ; but all the variety would appear in a short succession of moments, 
ti one and the same person. A man that we saw this minute dumb, and, 
s it were, stupid and confounded, should the next minute be dancing and 
allooing like an antic ; and the next moment a-tearing his hair, or 
ulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a 
madman ; a few minutes after that, we should have him fall into tears, 
hen sick, then swooning ; and, had not immediate help been had, would 
1 a few moments more have been dead : and thus it was, not with one 
r two, or ten, or twenty, but with the greatest part of them ; and, if I 
smember right, our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty of them 
lood. 

There were two priests among them, one an old man, and the other a 
oung man ; and that which was strangest was, that the oldest man was 
le worst. 

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself safe, he 
ropx>ed down stone dead to all appearance— not the least sign of life 
^nld be perceived in him. Our surgeon immediately applied proper 
^medics to recover him, and was the only man in the ship that believed 
e was not dead ; and at length he opened a vein in his arm, having first 
hafed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possible : upon 
tiifl, the blood, which only dropped at first, flowed something freely : in 
iiree minutes after, the man opened his eyes ; and, about a quarter of an 
our after that, he spoke, grew better, and, in a little time, quite well, 
liter the blood was stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly 
rell, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him, and was, what 
re called, come to himself. About a quarter of an hour after this they 
ame running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French 
roman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad. It 
3ems he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his 



286 ADVENTURES OP 

mind, and this put him into an ecstacy of joy ; his spirits whirled about 
faster than the vessels could convey them ; the blood grew hot and ferer- 
ish, and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in 
it : the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him 
something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after some time, operated 
upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly composed and well 

The younger priest behaved himself with great command of his passioD, 
and was really an example of a serious, well^ governed mind. At his fiist 
coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, prostratiflg 
himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, — in which I unhappily and 
unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon : but 
he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for his 
deliverance, begged me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to his 
Maker, he would give me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left; him, but 
kept others from interrupting him also ; he continued in that posture 
about three minutes, or a little more, after I left him, then came to me, 
as he had said he would, and with a great deal of seriousness and affec- 
tion, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me that had, under God, giTen 
him and so many miserable creatures their lives. I told him I had no 
room to move him to thank God for it rather than me ; for I had seen 
that he had done that already : but I added, that it was nothing but what 
reason and humanity dictated to all men, and that we had as much reason 
as he to give thanks to God, who had blessed us so far as to make us the 
instruments of his mercy to many of his creatures. 

After this, the young priest applied himself to his country folk»— 
laboured to compose them, persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with 
them, and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their 
reason ; and with some he had success, though others were, for a time, 
out of all govenmient of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, and perhaps it may be 
useM to those into whose hands it may fall, in the guiding themselves m 
all the extravagances of their passions ; for, if an excess of joy can cairj 
men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what will not 
the extravagances of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to? 
And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our 
passions of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of 
sorrow and anger. 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 287 

We were sometimes disordered by these extrayagonces among our new 
gaests for tlie first day ; but when, they had been retired, lodgings pro- 
vided for them all as well as our ship wonld allow, and they had slept 
heartily, as most of them did, being fatigued and Mghted, they were 
quite another sort of people the next day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the kindness 
shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally apt 
eaiough to exceed that way. The captain and one of the priests came to 
xne the next day, and, desiring to speak with me and my nephew, the 
commander, began to consult with us what should be done with them ; 
and, first, they told us, that as we had saved their lives, so all they had 
^as littie enough for a return to us for the kindness received. The 
captain said they had saved some money, and some things of value in 
their boats, catched hastily out of the flames ; and if we would accept 
of it, they were ordered to make an offer of it all to us ; they only desired 
to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might 
get a passage to France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at first word, and to con- 
sider what to do with them afterwards, but I overruled him in that part : 
for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange country ; and if 
the Portuguese captain that took me up at sea had served me so, and took 
all that I had for my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been as 
much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary, the being sold to a 
Mahometan only excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much 
better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in 
their distress, it was true ; but that it was our duty to do so, as we were 
fellow creatures, and as we would desire to be so delivered, if we were in 
the like or any other extremity ; that we had done nothing for them but 
what we believed they would have done for us, if we had been in their 
case, and they in ours ; but that we took them up to serve them, not to 
plunder them ; and that it would be a most barbarous thing to take that 
little from them which they had saved out of the fire, and then set them 
on shore and leave them; that this would be first to saYe them from 
death, and then kill them ourselves->-save them frx)m drowning, and then 
abandon them to starving : and therefore I would not let the least thing 
be taken frt)m them. As to setting them on shore, I told them, indeed, 
that was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the 



288 ADVENTURES OF ■ 

East Indies ; and though we were driven out of our course to the vest- ■ 
ward a very great way, which perhaps was directed by Heaven on pur- ■ 
pose for their dcliverancOi yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change I 
our voyage on this particular account ; nor could my nephew, the captain, I 
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to ■ 
pursue his voyage by way of Brazil ; and all I knew he could do for them I 
was, to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships homeward I 
bound from the West Indies, and get them passage, if possible, to Eng- I 
land or France. 1 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they could I 
not but be very thankful for it ; but they were in a great consternation, I 
especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the East I 
Indies : they then entreated me, that seeing I was driven so far to the | 
westward before I met with them, I would at least keep on the same I 
course to the banks of Newfoundland, where it was possible I might meet 
with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to 
Canada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and there- 
fore I inclined to agree to it ; for indeed I considered, that to carry this 
whole company to the East Indies would not only be an intolerahle 
severity to the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage, by 
devouring all our provisions ; so I thought it no breach of charter-party, 
but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in 
which no one could say we were to blame: for the laws of God and 
nature would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats foil 
of people in such a distressed condition ; and the nature of the thing, as 
well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to see them on 
shore somewhere or other, for their deliverance. So I consented that ve 
would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit; 
and, if not, that I would carry them to Martinico, in the "West Indies. 

The wind continued fi«sh easterly, but the weather pretty good ; and 
as it had blowed continually in the points between north-east and south- 
east a long time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to 
France ; for we met several ships bound to Europe,' whereof two were 
French, from St. Christopher's ; but they had been so long beating up 
against the wind, that they durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting 
provisions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should 
take in ; so wc were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this, 



ROBINSON CBUSOB. 298 

3^ we made the banks of Newfoundlandy where, to shorten my story, 
^^ pnt all our French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea 
2^ere, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if 
■bey could get provisions to victual themselves with. When I say all 
^e French went on shore, I should remember that the young priest I 
^poke of, hearing we were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the 
Voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel: I 
^^eadily agreed to that, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very 
^ood reason, as will appear afterwards ; also four of the seamen entered 
^mselves in our ship, and proved very useM fellows. 

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away 
kouth and south-by-east, for about twenty days together, sometimes little 
*r no wind at all, when we met another subject for our humanity to work 
rpon, almost as< deplorable as that before. 

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees five minutes north, and 
tlie 19th day of March, 1694-5, when we espied a sail, our course south- 
^ast-and-by-sottth. We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she 
bore up to us ; but could not at first know what to make of her, till, after 
doming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-topmast, foremast, 
ind bowsprit, and presently she fires a gun as a signal of distress. The 
Breather was pretty good, wind at north-north-west, a fresh gale, and we 
loon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from Barbadoes, but had 
t>een blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready 
x> sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were 
both gone on shore ; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were 
jfat in an iidifferent ease for good artists to bring the ship home. They 
[lad been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible 
itorm after the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of 
their knowledge to the westwaid, and in which they had lost their masts, 
18 above : they told us they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, 
tmt were then driven away again to the south-east by a strong gale of 
wind at north-north-west, the same that blew now, and having no sails to 
work the ship with, but a main-course and a kind of square sail upon a 
jury-foremast, which they had set up, they could not lie- near the wind, 
but were endeavouring to stand away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost starved 
for want of provisions, besides the fatigues tkey had undergone ; their 

19 



290 ADYBNTTJRB8 Of 

bread and flesh was quite gone, they had not an ounce left in the fthip, 
and had had none for eleven days : the only relief they had was, thdi 
water was not all spent, and they had about half a barrel of flour left; 
they had sugar enough ; some succades, or sweatmeats, they had at fiist^ 
out they were devoured ; and they had seven casks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant on board, wbo 
were going passengers, and, thinking the ship was ready to sail, unli^ m^ 
pily came on board the evening before the hurricane began : and, haTiog l^ 
no proviidons of their own left, they were in a more deplorable conditum ^ 
than the rest ; for the seamen being reduced to such an extreme neoeaotf .^ 
themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengen; ^ 
and they were indeed in a condition that their misery is very hard to 
describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led ne, 
the weather being fair, and the wind abated, to go on board the ship : the 
second mate, who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had been on 
board our ship ; and he told me, indeed, that they had three passengen in 
the great cabin, and that they were in a deplorable condition. '^ Kay/' 
says he, ''I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for 
above two days ; and I was aJ&aid to inquire after them," said ho, ''fori 
had nothing to relieve them with." 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could 
spare ; and, indeed, I had so far overruled things with my nephew, that I 
would have victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia, or any 
part of the ooast of America, to have supplied ourselves ; but there iru 
no necessity for that. 

But now they were in a new danger, for they were afraid of eating too 
much, even of that little we gave them. The mate, or commander, 
brought six men with him in his boat, but these poor wretches looked 
like skeletons, and were so weak they could hardly sit to their oars ; the 
mate himself was very ill, and half-starved, for he declared he had re- 
served nothing from the men, and went share and share alike with them 
in every bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him immediately; 
and he had not eaten three mouthfals before he began to be sick and oat 
of order : so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something 
with some broth, which he said would be to him both food and physic, 
and after he had taken it he grew better. In the meantime, I forgot not 



ROBINSON CBUBOB. 291 

le men — I ordered Tictuals to be given them, and the poor creatures 
ither devonred than eat it : they were bo exceedingly himgry that they 
ere in a manner ravenous, and had no command of themselves ; and two 
^ them eat with so mnch greediness, that they were in danger of their 
res the next morning. 

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me, and 
rong^t to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming on 
lore in my island, where I had not the least monthM of food, or any 
ypes of procuring it, — ^besides the hourly apprehension I had of being 
ade the food of other creatures. But all the while the mate was thus 
lating to me the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not 
it out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor crea- 
ures in the great cabin — namely, the mother, her son, and the maid- 
Tvant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom 
3 -seemed to confess they had wholly neglected, their own extremities 
sing 80 great ; by which I understood that they had really given them 
3 food at all, and that therefore they must be perished, and be all lying 
Bad perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board 
ith his men to refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that 
rere left on board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and, 
rith my mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of bread and four or 
ve pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the 
leat to be boiled while they staid, and to keep guard in the cook-room, 
3 prevent the men's taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot 
ofore it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a little at a 
ime ; and by this caution he preserved the men, who would otherwise 
ave killed themselves with that very food that was given them on 
turpose to save their lives. 

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin, and 
ee what condition the poor passengers were in, and, if they were aHve, to 
omfort them and give them what refreshment was proper ; and the sur- 
leon gave a large pitcher with some of the prepared broth which he had 
;ivcn the mate that was on board, and which he did not question would 
estore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above, having a great 
lind to see the scene of misery, which I knew the ship itself would 
resent me with in a more lively manner than I could have it by report, 



292 ADYBNTUBBS 07 

I took the captain of the sliip, as we now called hiniy with me, and went |i 
myself a little after in their boat. m 

I fonnd the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the yictoals 
oat of the boiler before it was ready ; but my mate observed his order, and Is 
kept a good guard at the cook-room door, and the men he placed there, Ic 
after using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept them off by force: p 
however, he caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, and |g 
softened them with the liquor of the meat, which they call brewis, and 
gave every one, one to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their 
own safety that he was obliged to give them but a little at a time. Bnt 
it was all in vain ; and had not I come on board, and their own com- 
mander and officers with me, and with good words, and some threats also 
of giving them no more, I believe they would have broken into the cook- 
room by force, and torn the meat out of the fiimace — ^for words indeed are 
of a very small force to an hungry belly. However, we pacified them, and 
fed them gradually and cautiously for the first time, and the next time 
gave £hem more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men did well 
enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another 
nature, and feu: beyond the rest : for as, first, the ship's company had w 
little for themselves, it was but too true that they had at first kept them 
very low, and at last totally neglected them ; so that, for six or seven 
days, it might be said, they had really had no food at all, and, for several 
days before, very little. 

The poor mother, who, as the first mate reported, was a woman of 
good sense and good breeding, had spared all she could get so affection- 
ately for her son, that at last she entirely sank under it ; and when the 
mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her back 
up against the sides, between two chairs which were lashed fast, and her 
head sunk in between her shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. 
My mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and, with a 
spoon, put some broth into her mouth : she opened her lips, and lifted 
up one hand, but could not speak; yet she understood what he said, 
and made signs to him, intimating that it was too late for her, but 
pointed to her child, as if she would have said they should take care of 
him. 

However, the mate, who was exceedingly moved with the sight, en- 
deavoured to get some of the broth into her mouth ; and, as he said, got 



B0BIN80N CBUSOB. 293 

two or three spoonfnlB^ down, though I question whether he could be sure 
<tf it or not ; but it was too late, and she died the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate 
mother's life, was not so fSeur gone ; yet he lay in a cabin bed as one 
stretched out, with hardly any life left in him : he had a piece of an old 
^OTO in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it. However, being young, 
and having more strength than his mother, the mate got something down 
Ilia throat, and he began sensibly to revive, though, by giving him some 
tame after but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, 
and brought it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid ; she lay all along upon the deck 
bard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down with apo- 
plexy, and struggled for life : her limbs were distorted, one of her hands 
was clasped round the frame of a chair, and she griped it so hard that 
we could not easily make her let it go ; her other arm lay over her head, 
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the frame of the cabin 
table : in short, she lay just Hke one in the last agonies of death, and yet 
fihe was alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and terrified with 
the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us afterwards, was broken- 
hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying two or thiee days before, 
and whom she loved most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor giii ; for, when our surgeon, 
who was a man of very great knowledge and experience, and, with great 
Implication, recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hand as to her 
senses : for she was little less than distracted for a considerable time after, 
aa shall appear presently. 

Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be desired to consider 
that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, where sometimes 
people stay a week or a fortnight at a place. Our business was to relieve 
this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them ; and though they were 
willing to steer the same course with us for some days, yet we could carry 
no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts. However, as their 
captain begged of us to help him to set up a main-topmast, and a kind 
of topmast to his jury-foremast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three 
or four days, and then, having given him five barrels of beef and pork, 
two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, flour, and what other 
things wo could spare, and taking three casks of sugar, and some rum, 



294 ADYBNTUBBS Of 

and some pieces of eight of them for satiflfieu^tion, we left them, taking on 
board with us, at their own earnest request, the youth, and the maid, aiid 
all their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a pretty, well-biedf 
modest, and sensible youth, — greatly dejected with the loss of his mother, 
and, as it seems, had lost his father but a few months before at Barbodoes. 
He begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship, for 
he said the cruel fellows had murdered his mother : and, indeed, so thej 
had, that is to say, passively ; for they might have spared a small snsten- 
ance to the poor helpless widow, that might have preserved her life, 
though it had been just to keep her alive. But hunger knows no friend, 
no relation, no justice, no right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable 
of no compassion. 

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it would cairj 
him away from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as bad circom- 
stances almost as we found them — that is so say, starving in the wodi 
He said it mattered not whither he went, if he was but delivered from 
the terrible crew that he was among^that the captain (by which he 
meant me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved hb life, 
and he was sure would not hurt him : and, as for the maid, he was sore, 
if she came to herself, she would be very thankfril for it, let us carry them 
whither we would. The surgeon representod the case so affectionately to 
me, that I yielded, and we took them both on board, with all their goods, 
except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed or con[^ at; 
and as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I made his commander 
sign a writing obliging him to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one 
Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was related, 
and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he had 
belonging to the deceased widow, — which, I suppose, was not done, for 1 
could never leam that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as ia most jnt;- 
bable, lost at sea, being in so disabled a condition, and so feur fr^m any 
land, that I am of opinion the first storm she met with afterwards she 
mi^t foimder in the sea ; for she was leaky, and had damage in her hold 
when I met with her.

WAS now in the latitude of nineteen degrees thirty-two minutes, 
and had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather, though 
at first the winds had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody 
with the little incidents of wind, weather, currents, etc., on the 
rest of our voyage ; but, shortenijig my story for the sake of what is to 
follow, shall observe that I came to my old habitation, the island, on the 
10th of April, 1695. It was with no small difficulty that I found the 
place : for as I came to it and went from it before on the south and east 
side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so now, coming in between 
the^jwn and the island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any land- 
mark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I saw it or 
not. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands in 
the mouth of the great river Oroonoque, but none for my purpose : only 
this I learnt by my coasting the shore, that I was under one great mis- 
take before, namely, that the continent which I thought I saw from the 
island I lived in, was really no continent, but a long island, or rather a 
ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side of the extended 
mouth of that great river ; and that the savages who came to my island 
were not properly those which we call Caribbees, but islanders, and other 
barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited something nearer to our side 
than the rest. 

In short, I visited several of the islands to no purpose : some I found 
were inhabited, and some were not. On one of them I found some 



296 ADYBNTURBS OF 

Spaniards, and thought they had lived there ; bnt, speaking with them, 
I found they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by, and that they came 
thither to make salt, and catch some pearl mussels, if they could: but 
they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay farther north, in tlie 
latitude of ten and eleven degrees. 

Thus, coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship, 
sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop (which we had found a convenient 
boat, and therefore kept her with their very good will), at length I came 
fair on the soath side of my island, and I presently knew the very coun- 
tenance of tibe place : so I brought the ship safe to an anchor broadside 
with the little creek, where was my old habitation. 

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked him if he 
knew where he was ? He looked about a little, and presently clapping 
his hands, cried, "Oh, yes! Oh, there! Oh, yes! Oh, there!" pointing 
to our old habitation, and fell a-dancing and capering like a mad fellow; 
and I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to swim 
ashore to the place. 

" Well, Friday," said I, " do you think we shall find any body here 
or no? and what do you think, shall we see your father?" The fellow 
stood mute as a stock a good while ; but when I named his father, the 
poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears nm 
down his face very plentifrilly. " "What is the matter, Friday ?" said I ; 
" are you troubled because you may see your father ?" — "No, no !" says 
he, shaking his head, "no see him more, no ever more see agaii^"— 
" Why so," said I, " Friday ? how do you know that ?"— " Oh, no ! oh, 
no!" says Friday, "he long ago die, long ago, he much old man."— 
" Well, well," said I, " Friday, you don't know ; but shall we see any 
body else then ?" The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he 
points just to the hiU above my old house ; and though we lay half a 
league off, he cries out, " Me see ! me see ! yes, yes ; me see much man 
there, and there, and there." I looked, but I could see nobody — no, not 
with a perspective glass; which was, I suppose, because I could not hit 
the place ; for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the next day, 
and there were five or six men all together stood to look at the ship, not 
knowing what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused the En^ish 
ancient to be spread, and fired three guns to give them notice we were 
friends ; and about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a smoke 



ROBINBON CRUBOB. 297 

liae from the side of the creek : bo I immediately ordered a boat out, 
taking Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce, 
I went directly on shore, taking with me the young Mar I mentioned, to 
irkom I had told the whole story of my living there, and the manner 
of it, and every particular both of myself and those that I left there, 
and who was on that account extremely desirous to go with me. We 
liad besides about sixteen men very well armed, if we had found any 
new guest there which we did not know of; but we had no need of 
Weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near high water, we 
^wed directly into the creek ; and the first man I fixed my eye upon was 
the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face 
perfectly well : as to his habit I shall describe it afterwards. I ordered 
nobody to go on shore at first but myself: but there was no keeping 
^day in the boat, for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a 
distance, a good way off the Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of 
iim ; and if they had not let him go on shore, he would have jumped into 
fte sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to his father like 
an arrow out of a bow. It would have made any man shed tears, in spite 
of the firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of this poor 
fellow's joy when he came to his father — how he embraced him, kissed 
him, stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, 
and lay down by him ; then stood and looked at him, as any one would 
look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour together ; then lay 
down upon the groimd, and stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then 
got up again, and stared at him : one would have thought the fellow 
bewitched. But it would have made a dog laugh to see how the next day 
his passion ran out another way : in the morning he walked along the 
shore, to and again, with his father, several hours, — always leading him by 
the hand as if he had been a lady ; and every now and then would come 
to fetch something or other for him from the boat, either a lump of sugar, 
9r a dram, or biscuit, or something or other that was good. In the after- 
noon his frolics ran another way, for then he would set the old man 
lown upon the ground, and dance about him, and make a thousand antic 
postures and gestures ; and aU the while he did this he would be talking 
to him, and telling him one story or another of his travels, and of what 
[lappened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial affec- 
tion was to be found in Christians to their parents in our parts of the 



298 ADYBNTURBB 07 

world, one would be tempted to say there hardly would have been anj 
need of the fifth commandment. 

But this is a digression ; I return to my landing. It would be endlefl 
to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that the Spaniards 
received me with. The first Spaniard, whom, as I said, I knew vezy 
well, was he whose life I saved — he came towards the boat, attended bj 
one more, carrying a fiag of truce also ; and he did not only not know me 
at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was come, 
tUl I spoke to him. " Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, '' do you not knoir 
me ? " At which he spoke not a word ; but giving his musket to the man 
that was with him, threw his arms abroad, and, saying something in 
Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, 
telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that he had 
once seen, as of an angel from Heaven sent to save his life: he said 
abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows t 

I 

how — and then, beckoning to the person that attended him, bade him go 
and call out his comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old 
habitation, where he would give me possession of my own house again, 
and where I should see there had been but mean inprovements. So 1 
walked along with him. But, alas ! I could no more find the place again 
than if I had never been there ; for they had planted so many trees, and 
placed them in such a. posture, so thick and dose to one another, and in 
ten years time they were grown so big, that, in short, the place was in- 
accessible, except by such winding and blind ways as they themselves 
only who made them could find. 

I asked them what put them upon aU these fortifications? He told 
me, I would say there was need enough of it when they had given an 
account how they had passed their time since their arriving in the island, 
especially after they had the misfortune to find that I was gone : he told 
me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he 
heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction ; and that he 
had oftentimes a strong persuasion that, one time or other, he should see 
me again : but nothing that ever befel him in his life, he said, was so 
surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the disappointment he was 
under when he came back to the island, and found I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left behind, 
and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all 
thought themselves much better among the savages, only that their number 



ROBINSON CBUSOE. 299 

was 00 smalL ''And," says be, ''had they been strong enough, we had 
been long ago in purgatory ;" and with that he crossed himself upon the 
breast. " But, sir," says he, " I hope you will not be displeased when I 
shall tell you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for otlr own 
preaervation, to disarm them, and make them our subjects who would not 
be content with being moderately our masters, but would be our mur- 
derers." I answered, "I was heartily afraid of it when I left them 
there ; and nothing troubled me A my parting from the island, but that 
they were not come back, that I might have put them in possession of 
erery thing first, and left the others in a state of subjection, as they 
deseired : but if they had reduced them to it, I was yery glad, and should 
be very far fr^m finding any fault with it, for I knew they were a parcel of 
refractory, ungovernable villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief." 

While I was saying this, came the man whom he had sent back, and 
with him eleven men more. In the dress they were in, it was impossible 
to guess what nation they were of; but he made aU clear, both to them 
and to me. Pirst he turned to me, and pointing to them, said, " These, 
sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;" and then 
taming to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who I was ; upon 
which they all came up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and 
ordinary fellows, and I the Hke, but really as if they had been ambas- 
sadors, or noblemen, and I a monarch or a great conqueror: their behaviour 
was to the last degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, 
majestic gravity, which very well became them ; and, in short, they had 
BO much more manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their 
civilities, much less how to return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island after my 
going away, is so remarkable, and has so many incidents which the 
former part of my relation will help to understand, and which will in most 
of the particulars refer to that accoimt I have already given, that I cannot 
but commit them with great delight to the reading of those that come 
after me. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first person, 
which will put me to the expense of ten thousand " said I's," and " said 
he's," and "he told me's," and "I told him's," and the like; but I shaU 
collect the facts historically, as near as I can gather them out of my 
memory from what they related to me, and from what I met with in my 
conversing with them, and with the place. 



300 ADYBNTURBS OF 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I most go 
back to the circumstances in which I left the island, and which the persons 
were in of whom I am to speak. At first, it is necessary to repeat, that 1 
I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard, the two whose lives I ! 
had rescued from the savages — ^I say, I had sent them away in a large 
canoe to the main, as I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's com- 
panions whom he had left behind him, in order to save them from the like 
calamity that he had been in, and in or&er to succour them for the present^ 
and that, if possible, we might together find some way for our delivenmce 
afterward. 

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or the least 
room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more than I had twenty yean 
before ; much less had I any foreknowledge of what after happened,— 
I mean of an English ship coming on shore there to fetch me off: and it 
could liot but be a very great surprise to them when they came back, not 
only to find that I was gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot, 
possessed of all that I had loft behind me, which would otherwise have 
been their own. 

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might begin 
where I left off, was of their own part ; and I desired he would give me 
a particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat, 
when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was little varietj 
in that part, for nothing remarkable happened to them on their way, 
they having very calm weather, and a smooth sea ; for his countrymen, it 
could not be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him 
(it seems he was the principal man among them, the captain of the vessd 
they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time) : they were, 
he said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew tiiat he was 
fallen into the hands of the savages, who they were satisfied would 
devour him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that when he tdd 
them the story of his deliverance, and in what maimer he was furnished 
for carrying them away, it was like a dream to them, and their astonish- 
ment, he said, was something like that of Joseph's brethren, when he 
told them who he was, and told them the story of his exaltation in 
Pharaoh's court ; but when he showed them the arms, the powder, the 
ball, and the provisions that he brought them for their journey, or voyage, 
they were restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of their 
deliverance, and prepared to come away with him. 



ROBINBON CRUBOB. 301 

The first busmess was to get canoes ; and in this they were obliged 
not to stick so much to the honest part of it, but to trespass upon their 
Mendly savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguas, on pretence 
of going out a-fishing or for pleasure. 

In these they came away the next morning : it seems they wanted no 
time to get themselves ready, for they had no baggage, — neither clothes, 
nor provisions, nor any other thing in the world but what they had on 
them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent ; and in that time, unluckily for 
them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I mentioned in my 
other part, and to get off from the island, leaving three of the most im- 
pudent, hardened, ungovemed, disagreeable villains behind me that any 
man could desire to meet with, to the poor Spaniards' great grief and dis- 
appointment, you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spaniards 
came on shore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions 
and other relief as I had ordered them to do ; also they gave them the 
long paper of directions, which I had left with them, containing the par- 
ticular method which I took for managing every part of my life there — 
the way how I baked my bread, bred up my tame goats, and planted my 
com — ^how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, every thing 
I did : all this being written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of 
whom understood English well enough ; nor did they refuse to accommo- 
date the Spaniards with any thing else, for they agreed very wdl for some 
time. They gave them an equal admission into the house, or cave, and 
they began to live very sociably ; and the head Spaniard, who had seen 
pretty much of my method, and Friday's father together, managed all 
their afiiairs ; for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble 
about the island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises, and when they came 
home at night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, would the others 
but have left them alone, which, however, they could not find in their 
hearts to do long ; but, like the dog in the manger, they would not eat 
themselves, and would not let others eat neither. The differences, never- 
theless, were at first but trivial, and such as are not worth relating : but 
at last it broke out into open war, and it began with all the rudeness and 
insolence that can be imagined, without reason, without provocation, con- 
trary to nature, and indeed to common sense ; and though, it is true, the 



302 ADYEKTURES OF 

first relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call 
the accusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows, they could not 
deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply a 
defect in my former relation ; and this was, that I forgot to set down 
among the rest, that just as we were weighing anchor to set sail, thefe 
happened a little quarrel on board our ship, which I was afraid once 
would turn out to a second mutiny ; nor was it appeased till the captain, 
rousing up his courage, and taking us all to his assistance, parted them bj 
force, and making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid 
them in irons : and as they had been active in the former disorders, and 
let fall some ugly dangerous words the second time, he threatened to carry 
them in irons to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny, and 
running^ away with the ship. 

This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it, frighted 
some other men in the ship ; and some of them had put it in the heada of 
the rest that the captain only gave them good words for the present tOl 
they should come to some English port, and that then they should be all 
put into a jail and tried for their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it ; upon 
which it was desired that I, who still passed for a great man among them, 
should go down with the mate and satisfy the men, and tell them, that 
they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of the voyage, all 
they had done for the time past should be pardoned. So I went, and 
after passing my honour's word to them, they appeared easy, and the 
more so, when I caused the two men who were in irons to be released and 
forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night, the wind 
also falling calm. Next morning we found that our two men, who had 
been laid in irons, had stole each of them a musket and some other wea- 
pons — what powder or shot they had we knew not — and had taken the 
ship's pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run away with her to 
their companions in roguery on shore. 

As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, witii 
twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek the rogues ; but 
they could neither find them, nor any of the rest, for they all fled into 
the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate was onoe 
resolved, in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their plantationa, 



BOBINBON CRUBOB. 303 

Immt all their household stuff and famiture, and left them to shift with- 
out it ; but having no order, he left all alone, left every thing as he 
found it, and, bringing the pinnace away, came on board without them. 

These two men made their number five : but the other three villains 
were bo much wickeder than these, that, after they had been two or th)ree 
days together, they turned their two new comers out of doors to shift for 
themselves, and would have nothing to do with them ; nor could they, for 
a good while, be persuaded to give them any food : as for the Spaniards, 
fhey were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to go 
forward : the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English brutes 
to have taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they said, they 
might be all one family ; but they would not hear of it : so the two poor 
fellows lived by themselves, and finding that nothing but industry and 
application would make them live comfortable, they pitohed their tents on 
the north shore of the island, but a little more to the west, to be out of 
the danger of the savages, who always landed on the east parts of the 
island. 

Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay up 
their magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards having given them some 
com for seed, and especially some of the peas which I had left them, they 
dug, and planted, and enclosed, after the pattern I had set for them all, 
and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of com was on the ground, 
and thou^ it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at first, 
having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and find 
them with bread or other eatables : and one of the fellows, being the 
cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at making soup, puddings, and 
such other preparations as the rice and the milk, and such little fiesh as 
they got, furnished him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the three un- 
natural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humour, and to insult 
them, came and bullied them, and told them the island was theirs ; that 
the governor, meaning me, had given them possession of it, and nobody 
else had any right to it ; and that they should build no houses upon 
their ground, unices they would pay them rent for them. 

The two men thought they had jested at first, and asked them to come 
and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they had built, and 
tell them what rent they demanded : and one of them merrily told them, 



304 ADYBNTURBS OF 

if they were ground landlords, he hoped, if they built tenemeni^ upon the 
land, and made improvements, they would, according to the custom of all 
landlords, grant them a long lease, and bade them go fetch a scriyener 
to draw writings. One of the three, damning and raging, told them they 
should see they were not in jest ; and, going to a little place at a distance, 
where the honest men had made a fire to dress their victuals, he takes a 
firebrand and claps it to the outside of their huf, and very fairly sets it on 
fire ; and it would have been all burnt down in a few minutes, if one of 
the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire ont 
with his feet, and that not without some difficulty tpo. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting him 
away, that he turned upon him with a pole he had in his hand ; and had 
not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had 
ended his days at once. His comrade, seeing the danger they were both 
in, ran in after him, and immediately they came both out with their 
muskets ; and the man that was first struck at with the pole knocked the 
fellow down who began the quarrel with the stock of his musket, and 
that before the other two could come to help him ; and then seeing the rest 
come, they stood together, and, presenting the other ends of their pieces 
to them, bade them to stand off. 

The others had fire-arms with them, too ; but one of the two honest 
men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his danger, told 
them if they offered to move hand or foot they were all dead men, and 
boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. They did not, indeed, 
lay down their arms ; but, seeing him resolute, it brought them to a 
parley, and they consented to take their wounded man with them and 
begone : and, indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with 
the blow. However, they were much in the wrong, since they had the 
advantage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as ihey might have 
done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them an 
account how the rogues had treated them ; for the three villains studied 
nothing but revenge, and every day gave them some intimation that they 
did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of their 
rogueries, such as treading down their com, shooting three young kids and 
a she-goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store, 
and, in a word, plaguing them night and day in this manner, it forced the 
two men to such a desperation, that they resolved to fight them all tiiree 



ROBINSON CRUBOB. 305 

irst time they had a fair opportunity. In order to this, they resolved 
> to the castle, as they called it, that ^as my old dwelling, where the 
d rogaes and the Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending 
sive a fair hattle, and the Spaniards should stand hy to see fair play. 
hefj got up in the morning before day, and came to the place, and 
d the Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that answered, 
they wanted to speak with them. 

[t happened that, the day before, two of the Spaniards having been in 
woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I 
the honest men ; and he had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards 
he barbarous usage they had met with from their three countrymen, 
how they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their com that 
' had laboured so hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat, 
their three kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance 
id that, if he and his Mends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist 
1 again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards came home at 
it, and they were all at supper, he took the freedom to reprove the 
e Englishmen, though in gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them 

they could be so cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows, and 

they were putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and 
. it had cost them a great deal to bring things to such perfection as 
r had. 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, " What had they to do 
■e ? That they came on shore without leave, and that they should not 
it or build upon the island; it was none of their ground." " Why,*' 
\ the Spaniard, very calmly, '' Seignior Inglese, they must not starve.'' 

Englishman replied, like a true rough-hewn tarpaulin, '' They might 
ve, if they chose ; they should not plant nor build in that place." 
lit what must they do, then. Seignior ?" says the Spaniard. Another 
he brutes returned, " Do ! why, they should be servants, and work for 
n." "But how can you expect that of them? They are not bought with 
r money ; you have no right to make them servants." The English- 
L answered, " The island was theirs, the governor had given it to them, 

no man had any thing to do there but themselves ;" and, with that, 
re by his Maker that he would go and bum all their new huts — they 
lid build none upon their land. 

" Why, Seignior," said the Spaniards, " by the same rule, we must 
TOUT servants too." "Ay," says the bold dog, " and so you shall too, 

20 



306 ADYSNTURBS OF 

before we have done with you ;" mixmg two or three oaths in the proper 
intervals of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him 
no answer. However, this little discourse had heated them ; and startiiig 
up, one says to the other — I think it was he they called Will AtldiiB— 
''Come, Jack, let us go and have the other brush with them; we will 
demolish their castle^ I will warrant you ; they shall plant no colonj in 
our dominions." 

Upon this, they were all trooping away, with every man a gon, a 
pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among themselveB, 
of what they would do to the Spaniards, too, when opportunity offered; 
but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly understand them as to 
know all the particulars, — only that, in general, they threatened them 
hard for taking the two Englishmen's part. 

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that evemng, 
the Spaniards said they did not know, but it seems they wandered about 
the country part of the night ; and then, lying down in the place which 1 
used to call my bower, they were weary, and overslept themselves. The 
case was this : — ^They had resolved to stay till midnight, so to take the 
poor men when they were asleep ; and they acknowledged it afitenraidB, 
intending to set fire to their huts while they were in them, and either 
bum them in them, or murder them as they came out : and, as malice 
seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should not have beoi 
kept waking. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I have 
said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, it 
happened, and very luckily for them all, that they were up and gone 
abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to tiieir huts. 

When they came thither, and found the men gone, Atkins, who, it 
seems, was the forwardest man, called out to his companions, "Ha' 
Jack, here's the nest; but, the birds are flown!" They mused a 
a while to think what should be the occasion of their going abroad so 
soon, and suggested presently that the Spaniards had given them notice 
of it : and with that they shook hands and swore to one another that 
they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made 
this bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor men's habitation— 
they did not set fire indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both their 
houses, and pulled them so Hmb from limb that they left not the least 
stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood : they 



BOBINBON CBUBOE. 307 

tore all their little collected household stuff in pieces, and threw every 
thing about in such a manner, that the poor men found afterwards some 
of their things a mile off from their habitation. 

When they had done this they pulled up all the young trees which 
the poor men had planted — ^pulling up the enclosure they had made to 
secure their cattle and their com: and, in a word, sacked and plun- 
dered every thing, as completely as a herd of Tartars would have 
done. 

The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out, and had 
resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but 
two to three — so that, had they met,* there certainly would have been 
bloodshed among them ; for they were all very stout, resolute fellows, to 
give them their due.. 

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder, than they them- 
selves could do to meet — for, as they had dogged one another, when the 
three were gone thither, the two were here — and afterwards, when the 
two went to find them, the three were come to the old habitation again : 
we shall see their differing conduct presently. When the three came 
back like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they 
had been about put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told 
them what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado ; and one of them, 
stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of boys 
at play, takes hold of his hat, as it was upon his head, and, giving it a 
twirl about, fleering in his face, says to him, ''And you. Seignior Jack 
Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners." 
The Spaniard, who, though quite a civil man, was as brave as a man 
could desire to be, and withal a strong well-made man, looked steadily at 
him for a good while ; and then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped 
gravely up to him, and with one blow of his fist knocked him down, as an 
ox is felled with a pole-axe ; at which one of the rogues, insolent as the 
first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately : he missed his l^ody 
indeed, for the bullets went through his hair, but one of them touched 
the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard 
believe he was more hurt than he really was, and that put him into some 
heat ; for before he acted all in a perfect calm, but now, resolving to go 
through with his work, he stooped and took the fellow's musket whom he 
had knocked down, and was just going to shoot the man who had fired at 
him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and 



308 ADYBNTURBS OF 

calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the other two, and 
took their arms from them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the 
Spaniards their enemies, .as well as their own countrymen, they began to 
cool, and, giving the Spaniards better words, would have had their arms 
again ; but the Spaniards considering the feud that was between them and 
the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best method thej 
could take to keep them from one another, told them they would do them 
no harm,— and, if they would live peaceably, they would be very wiUing 
'to assist and associate with them as they did before, but that they could 
not think of giving them their arms again, while they apx>eared so resolved 
to do mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had even threa^ 
ened them all to make them their servants. 

The rogues were not more capable to hear reason than to act reason ; 
but being refused their arms, they went raving away, and raging VHe 
madmen, threatening what they would do, though they had no fire-arms: 
but the Spaniards, despising their threatening, told them they shoidd take 
care how they offered an injury to their plantation or cattle ; for if thej 
did, they would shoot them as they would do ravenous beasts, whererer 
they found them, and if they fell into their hands alive, they shonld 
certainly be hanged. However, this was far from cooling them : but 
away they went, swearing and raging like furies of hell. As soon as they 
were gone, came back the two men in passion and rage enough also, 
though of another kind ; for, having been at their plantation, and finding 
it all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed that 
they had provocation enough : they could scarce have room to tell their 
tale, the Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs ; and it was strange 
enough to find that three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no 
punishment at all. 

The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially having thus dis- 
armed them, made light of their threatenings ; but the two Englishmen 
resolved to have their remedy against them, what pain soever it cost to 
find them out. 

But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them they were 
already disarmed : they could not consent that they (the two) should 
pursue them with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them. ''But," said the 
grave Spaniard, who was their governor, "we will endeavour to make 
them do you justice, if you will leave it to us ; for as there is no doabt 



EOBINBON CRUSOE. 309 

bnt they will come to us again when their passion is over, being not able 
to subsist without our assistance, we promise you to make no peace with 
them, without haying a full satisfaction for you : and upon this condition 
we hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than in 
your defence." 

The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and with great 
reluctance, but the Spaniards protested they did it only to keep them 
from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last; for, said they, we are not 
so many of us — here is room enou^ for us all, and it is a great pity we 
should not be all good friends. At length they did consent, and waited 
for the issue of the thing, liying for some days with the Spaniards ; for 
their own habitation was destroyed. 

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with wandering, 
and almost starved with hunger, came back to the grove ; and finding my 
Spaniard and two more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they 
came up in a very submissive humble manner, and begged to be received 
again into the family. The Spaniards used them very civilly, but told them 
they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and so very grossly 
by them (the Spaniards), that they could not come to any conclusion 
without consulting the two Englishmen, and the rest ; but, however, they 
would go to them, and discourse about it, and they should know in half 
an hour. 

After half an hour's consultation, they were called in, and a long 
debate had about them, their two countrymen charging them with the 
ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder them ; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now. Upon the whole, the 
Spaniards acted as moderators between them; and as they had obliged 
the two Englishmen not to hurt the three, while they were naked and 
unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their fellows' 
two huts, one to be of the same dimensions, and the other larger than 
they were before ; also to fence their ground again, where they had pulled 
up the fences ; plant trees in the room of those pulled up ; dig up the 
land again for planting com, where they had spoiled it ; and, in a word, 
to restore every thing in the same state as they found it, as near as they 
could, — ^for entirely it could not be, the season for the com, and the 
growth of the trees and hedges, not being possible to be recovered. 

Well, they all submitted to this ; and as they had plenty of provisions 
given them all the while, they grew very orderly, only that these three 



310 ADVENTURBB OF 

fellows could never be persuaded to work for themselves, except now and 
then a little, just as they pleased. Thus, having lived pretty well to- 
gether for a month or two, the Spaniards gave them their arms again, and 
gave them liberty to go abroad with them as before. It was not above a 
week after they had these arms, and went abroad, but the ungratefal 
creatures began to be as insolent as before ; but, however, an accident 
happened presently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all : 
they were obliged to lay by all private resentment, and look to the pre- 
servation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spaniard governor, as I call him — that 
is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who was now the captain, 
or leader, or governor of the rest — ^found himself very uneasy in the nig^t, 
and could by no means get any sleep : he was perfectly well in body, only 
found his thoughts tumultuous, and his mind run upon men fighting, and 
killing one another ; and, growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to 
rise. Being thus gotten up, he looked out ; but, being dark, he could sec 
little or nothing : and besides, the trees which I had planted, as in my 
former account is described, and which were now grown tall, intercepted 
his sight, so that he could only look up and see that it was a clear star- 
light night ; and, hearing no noise, he returned and laid him down again. 
But it was all one ; he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to 
any thing like rest, but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and 
yet he knew not for what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going out and 
coming in, another of them waked, and, calling, asked who it was that 
was up ? The governor told him how it had been with him. " Say you 
so ! " says the other Spaniard ; '' such things are not to be slighted, 1 
assure you: there is certainly some mischief working," says he, "near 
us ; " and presently he asked him, " "Where are the Englishmen ?" " They 
are all in their huts," says he, " safe enough." It seems, the Spaniards 
had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a place where 
the three Englishmen, since their last mutiny, always quartered by them- 
selves, and could not come at the rest. " Well," says the Spaniard, 
" there is something in it, I am persuaded from my own experience ; I 
am certain our spirits embodied have converse with, and receive intelli- 
gence from, the spirits unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible world ; 
and this friendly notice is given for our advantage, if we know how to 
make use of it. Come," says he, " let us go out and look abroad; and 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 311 

if we find nothing at all in it to justify our trouble, I'U tell you a story 
to the purpose, that shall conyince you of the justice of my proposing it." 

In a word, they went out to go to the top of the hill, where I used to 
go ; but they, being strong, and in good company, nor alone, as I was, 
used none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and then, pulling it up 
after them, to go up a second stage to the top, but were going round 
througji the grove unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised 
with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way off firom them, and hearing 
the Toices of men, not of one or two, but of a great number. 

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of the throe savages 
in our last encounter, who jumped into the boat, and of whom I mentioned 
that I was afraid they should go home and briog more help, that so 
great a number came now together ; or whether they came ignorantly, 
and by accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not, it 
seems, understand : but whatever it was, it had been their business to 
have concealed themselves, and to have fallen upon them so effectually, as 
that not a man of them should have escaped, which could only have been 
by getting in between them and their boats : but this presence of mind 
was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great 
while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor, and the man with him, 
surprised with this sight, ran back immediately, and raised their fellows, 
giving them an account of the imminent danger they were all in, and they 
again as readily took the alarm ; but it was impossible to persuade thesn 
to stay close within where they were, but that they must aU run out to 
see how things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they had op- 
portunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the light of three fires 
they had made at some distance from one another. What they were doing 
they knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not ; for, first, the 
enemy were too many ; and, secondly, they did not keep together, but 
were divided into several parties, and were on shore in several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight ; and as 
they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the shore, they made 
no doubt but some of them would chop in upon their habitation, or upon 
some ot^er place where they would see the tokens of inhabitants ; and 
they were in great perplexity also for fear of their fiock of goats, which 
would have been little less than starving them, if they should have been 



312 ADYBNTURBS OF 

destroyed. Could they have seen the savages aU together in one body, 
and at a distance from their canoes, they resolved, if there had been an 
hundred of them, to have attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, 
for there were some of them two miles off from the other, and, as it ap- 
peared afterwards, were of two different nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course they should take, and 
exerted themselves in considering their present circumstances, they re- 
solved at last, while it was dark, to send the old savage (Friday's father) 
out as a spy to learn, if possible, something concerning them, as to what 
they came for, and what they intended to do, and the like. The old man 
undertook it without hesitation, and, stripping himself quite naked, as 
most of the savages were, away he went. After he had be^i gone an 
hour or two, he brings word that he had been among them undiscovered, 
that he found they were two parties, and of two several nations, who had 
war with one another, and had had a great battle in their own country ; 
and that both sides, having had several prisoners taken in the fight, thej 
were, by mere chance, landed on the same island for the devouring their 
prisoners, and making merry ; but their coming so by chance to the same 
place had spoiled all their mirth : that they were in a great rage at one 
another, and were so near, that he believed they would fight again as soon 
as daylight began to appear ; but he did not perceive that they had any 
notion of any body's being on the island but themselves. He had hardly 
made an end of telling the story, when they could perceive, by the un- 
usual noise they made, that the two little armies were engaged in a 
bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade our people 
to lie close, and not to be seen ; but it was impossible to prevail, espe- 
cially upon the Englishmen — their curiosity was so importunate upon 
their prudentials, that they must run out and see the battle : however, 
they used some caution, namely, they did not go openly just by their own 
dwelling, but went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to ad- 
vantage, .where they might securely see them manage the fight, and, as 
they thought, not be seen by them ; but it seems the savages did see 
them, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe the FiUglishmen, one 
of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of grea( bravery, 
of invincible spirits, and great poHoy in guiding the fight. The battle, 
they said, held two hours, before they could guess which party would be 



ROBINBON CRUBOB. . 813 

beaten; but then that party which was nearest onr people's habitation 
began to appear weakest, and after some time more, some of them began 
to fly : and this put our men again into a great consternation, lest any of 
those that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, 
and thereby inyoluntarily discover the place, and that, by consequence, the 
pursuers should do the like in search of them. Upon this they resolved 
that they would stand armed within the wall, and, whoever came into the 
grove, they should sally out over the wall and kill them — so that, if pos- 
sible, not one should return to give an account of it. They ordered also, 
that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking them down with 
the stock of the musket, not by shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm 
by the noise. 

As they expected, it fell out : three of the routed army fled for Ufe, 
and, crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least know- 
ing whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter. 
The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this within — ^with this 
addition, to our men's great satisfaction, namely, that the conquerors 
had not pursued them, or seen which way they were gone. Upon this, 
the Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill 
the fugitives ; but sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered 
them to go round and come in behind them, surprise, and take them 
prisoners ; which was done. The residue of the conquered people fled 
to their canoes and got off to sea ; the victors retired, and made no pursuit, 
or very little, but, drawing themselves into a body together, gave two 
great screaming shouts, which they supposed were by way of triumph, 
and so the fight ended : and the same day, about three o'clock in the after- 
noon, they also marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had 
their island again free to themselves, the fight was over, and they saw 
no savages in several years after. 

After they were aU gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and, 
viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty dead men 
upon the spot. They found not one wounded man that was not stone 
dead ; for either these savages stay by their enemy till they have quite 
killed them, or they carry all the wounded men, that are not quite dead, 
away with them* 

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while : the sight 
had filled them with horror, and the consequence appeared terrible to the 
last degree, especially upon supposing that some time or other they should 



814 ADYBNTUREB OP 

fall into the hands of those creatures, who would not only kill them a» 
enemies, but kill them for food, as we kill our cattle. This, as I said, 
tamed even the three English brutes I have been speaking of, and, for a 
great while after, they were very tractable, and went about the common 
business of the whole society well enough — planted, sowed, reaped, aod 
began to be all naturalised to the country ; but sometime after this, thej 
fell all into such simple measures again as brought them into a deal of 
trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed ; and these three 
being lusty, stout young fellows, they made them servants, and tangjit 
them to work for them : and as slaves they did well enough ; but they 
did not take their measures with them as I did with my man Friday, 
namely, to begin with them upon the principle of having saved their hves, 
and then instructed them in the rational principles of life,. much less of 
religion, civilising and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate 
arguings ; but as they gave them their food every day, so they gave them 
their work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough : bnt 
they failed in this by it, that they never had them to assist them and 
fight for them, as I had my man Priday, who was as true to me as the 
very flesh upon my bones. 

But to come to the family part* Being all now good Mends (for com- 
mon danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled them), they began 
to consider their general circumstances ; and the first thing that came 
under their consideration was, whether, seeing the savages particularly 
haunted that side of the island, and that there were more remote and 
retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, they should not 
rather remove their habitation. 

After long debate, it was conceived that they should not remove 
their habitation, because they thought they might hear from their gove^ 
nor again, meaning me ; and if I should send any one to seek them, I 
would be sure to direct them on that side, where, if they should find the 
place demolished, they would conclude the savages had killed them all, and 
they were gone, and so their supply would go away too. But as to their 
com and cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley where my 
cave was, where the land was as proper to both, and where indeed there 
was land enough : however, upon second thoughts, they altered one part 
of that resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of their cattle 
thither, and plant part of their com there ; and so, if one part was de- 



ROBINSON CRUBOE. 315 

«troyed, the other might be saved : and one piece of prudence they used, 

which it was very well they did, namely, that they never trusted these 

three savages which they had taken prisoners with knowing any thing of 

the plantation they had made in that vaUey, or of any cattle they had 

tiiere, much less of the cave there, which they kept in case of necessity 

aa a safe retreat ; and thither they carried also the two barrels of powder 

which I had left them at my coming away. 

, But, however, they resolved not to change their habitation ; yet they 

agreed that, as I had carefully covered it first with a wall and fortification 

and then with a grove of trees, so, seeing their safety consisted entirely in 

their being concealed, of which they were now fully convinced, they sot 

to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than before. 

I return to the story. They lived two years after this in perfect 
retirement, and had no more visits from the savages. They had indeed an 
alarm given them one morning, which put them in a great consternation ; 
for some of the Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side, or 
rather end, of the island — which by the way was that end where I never 
went, for fear of being discovered — they were surprised by seeing above 
twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. 

They made the best of their way home in hurry enough, and giving 
the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that day and the next, 
going out only at night to make observations ; but they had the good luck 
to be mistaken, for wherever the savages went, they did not land at that 
time on the island, but pursued some other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen, one of 
which, a most turbulent fellow, being in a tage at one of the three slaves 
which I mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had not done 
something right ^hiclji he bade him do, and seemed a little untractable in 
his showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frogbelt in which he bore it by 
his side, and fell upon him, the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill 
him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow a 
barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but struck 
into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut the poor creature's arm 
off, ran to him, and, entreating him not to murder the poor man, clapped 
in between him and the savage to prevent the mischief. 

The fellow, being enraged the more at this, struck at the Spaniard with 
his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as he intended to serve the 
savage ; which the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a 



316 



ASTENTDKBS OT 



BhoTel which he had in hia hand (for they were workiiig in the field about 
the corn-land) knocked the brate down : another of the Englishmen, 
ruimii^ at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard 
down, and then two Sp&niorda mora came to help their man, and a third 
Englishmau fell upon tiiem. They had none of them any fire-aira^ « 
any other weapon but hatchets and other tools, except the third En^iah- 




maa : he had one of my old nuty cntlaasee, with which he made at Qu 
last Spaniards, and wounded them both. This fray set the whole fondly 
in an uproar, and, more help coming in, they took the three En^iahmen 
prisoners. The next question was, what e^oold be done with themf 
They had been ao often mutinous, and were so forioua, so desperate, and 
so idle', withal, that they knew not what course to take with them, for 
they were mischieTous to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt 
they did any man ; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them. 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 317 

The Spaniard who was goyemor, told them, in so many words, that if 
they had been his own coontrymen he would have hanged them all — for 
all laws and all governors were to preserve society, and those who were 
dangerous to society ought to be expelled out of it ; but, as thby were 
Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman 
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would use them 
with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of the 
other two Englishmen, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen then stood up, and said they 
desired it might not be left to them : " For," says he, " I am sure we ought 
to sentence them to the gallows ;" and with that gives an account how 
Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to have all the iBive Englishmen 
join together, and murder all the Spaniards when they were in their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins: 
" How ! Seignior Atkins," says he, " will you murder us all ? What have 
yon to say to that?" That hardened villain was so far from denying it, 
that he said it was true, and declared they would do it still before 
they had done with them. ''Well, but Seignior Atkins," said the 
Spaniard, " what have we done to you that you would kill us ? And 
what would you get by killing us ? And what must we do to prevent you 
killing us ? Must we kill you, or will you kill us ? Why will you put us 
to the necessity of this. Seignior Atkins?" asks the Spaniard very calmly 
and smiling. 

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making a jest of 
it, that had he not been held by three men, and withal had no weapons 
with him, it was thought he would have attempted to have killed the 
Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

This hairbrained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was 
to be done. After a long debate, it was agreed, first, that they should be 
disarmed, and not permitted to have either a gun, or powder, or shot, or 
sword, or any weapon, and should be turned out of the society, and left 
to live where they would, and how they could, by themselves ; but that 
none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should converse with them, 
speak with them, or have any thing to do with them ; that they should be 
forbid to come within a certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt ; 
and that, if they o£fered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, bum, kill^ 
or destroy any of the com, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging 
to the society, they should die without mercy. 



318 ADVBNTURBS OF 

The goyemor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the sentence, 
considered a little upon it, and, turning to the two honest Englishmea, 
said, '' Hold, you must reflect that it will be long ere they can raise com 
and cattle of their own, and they must not starre — we must therefore 
allow 'them proyisions." So he caused to be added, that they should hare 
a proportion of com given them to last them eight months, and for seed 
to sow, by which time they might be supposed to ndse some of their own; 
that they should have six milch-goats, four he goats, and six kids, giTen 
them, as well for present subsistence as for a store ; and that they should 
have tools given them for their work in the field — such as six hatchets, 
an axe, a saw, and the like; but they should have none of these tools 
or provisions unless they would swear solemnly that they would not 
hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them^ or their fellow English- 
men. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift 
for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as neither con- 
tented to go away or to stay ; but as there was no remedy, they went pre- 
tending to go and choose a place where they should settle themselves, to 
plant and live by themselves, and some provisions were given them, but 
no weapons. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had got in 
their first harvest, but when the rainy season came on, for want of a cave 
in the earth, they could not keep their grain dry : so they came and 
begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did, and in 
four days worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough 
to secure their com and other things from the rain. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic took 
these rogues, which, together with the former villany they had committed, 
brought mischief enough upon them, and had very near been the ruin of 
the whole colony. 

The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and, in 
very humble terms, desired to be admitted to speak with them: the 
Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was this — ^that 
they were tired of living in the manner they did, that they were not 
handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and that, having no 
help, they found they should be starved ; but, if the Spaniards would giTC 
them leave to take one of the canoes which they came over in, and give 
them arms and ammunition proportioned to their defence, they would go 






I 



ROBINSON CRU80B. 319 

orer to the main^ and seek their fortane, and so deliver them from the 
tiouhle of supplying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards told them^ with great kindness, that, if they were re- 
solved to go, they should not go like naked men, and he in no condition 
to defend themselves ; and that, though they could ill spare their fire- 
arms, having not enough for themselves, yet they would let them have 
two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, which 
they thou^t sufficient for them. 

In a word, they accepted the offer; and, having haked them hread 
Giough to serve them a month, and given, them as much goat's flesh as 
ihey could eat while it was sweet, and a great hasket full of dried grapes, 
a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid alive to kill, they holdly set 
out in a canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles 
btuid. The hoat Was, indeed, a large one, and would have very well car- 
ried fifteen or twenty men, and, therefore, was rather too hig for them to 
Qumage ; hut, as they had a fair hreeze, and the flood-tide with them, 
they did well enough. They had made a mast of a long pole, and a sail 
of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together, 
and away they went merrily enough: the Spaniards called after them, 
<< Bon veajo," and no man ever thought of seeing them any more. 

After twenty-two days' ahsence, one of the two honest Englishmen 
being abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange men coming to- 
wards him, two of them with guns upon their shoulders. Away runs the 
TgngiiRhynan^ as if he was bewitched, and came, frighted and amazed, to 
the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone, for there were 
strangers landed upon the island, he could not tell who. The Spaniard, 
pausing awhile, says to him, '' How do you mean, you cannot tell who ? 
They are savages, to be sure." ''Ko, no," says the Englishman, ''they 
are men in clothes, with arms." " Nay, then," says the Spaniard, " why 
are you concerned ? If they are not savages, they must be friends ; for 
there is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than 
harm." 

While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and, 
standing without the wood which was new planted, hallooed to them; 
they presently knew their voices, so all the wonder of that kind ceased. 
But now the admiration was turned upon another question, namely, what 
could be the matter, and what made them come back again. 

It was not long before they brought the men in : and, inquiring where 



-2

320 ADVENTURES OP 

they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them a M 
account of their voyage in a few words — namely, that they reached the 
land in two days, or something less ; but, finding the people alarmed at 
their coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, thej 
durst not go on shore, but sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, 
till they came to a great opening, by which they perceived that the land 
they saw from our island was not the main, but an island ; that, entering 
that opening of the sea, they saw another island on the right hand norths 
and several more west, and, being resolved to land somewhere, they put 
over to one of the islands which lay west, and went boldly on shore ; that 
they found the people very courteous and friendly to them, and they gave 
them several roots, and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable ; and 
the women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply them with J- 
any thing they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a great 
way upon their heads. 

They continued here for four days, and inquired, as well as they could 
of them by signs, what nations were this way and that way, and w^ 
told of several fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way, who, 
as they made known by signs to them, used to eat men ; but, as for them- 
selves, they said that they never eat men or women, except only such as 
they took in the wars, and then they owned that they made a great feast, 
and eat their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of that kind, and 
they told them two moons ago, pointing to the moon, and then to two 
fingers ; and that their great king had two hundred prisoners now, whidi 
he had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat 
for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those 
prisoners, but the others, mistaking them, thought they were desirous to 
have some of them to carry away for their own eating ; so they beckoned 
to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the rising ; which 
was to signify that the next morning, at sim-rising, they would bring some 
for them: and accordingly, the next morning they brought down five 
women and eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen to carry with 
them on their voyage, just as we would bring so nPany cows and oxen 
down to a sea-port town to victual a ship. 

To rei^se the prisoners, would have been the highest affiront to the 
savage gentry that ofifered them, and what to do with them they knew 
not. However, upon some debate, they resolved to accept of them ; and, 



B0BIN80N CBUBOB. 321 

in retam, they gaye the sayages that brought them one of their hatchets, 
an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their bullets, which, though they 
did not understand, they seemed extremely pleased with ; and then, tying 
the poor creatures' hands behind them, they (the people) dragged the 
prisoners into the boat for our men. 

Having taken their leave, with all the respect and thanks that could 
well pass between people, where on either side they understood not one 
word they could say, the Englishmen put off with their boat, and came 
back towards the first island, where, when they arrived, they set eight of 
their prisoners at liberty, there being too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage they endeavoured to have some communication with 
their prisoners, but it was impossible to make them understand any thing ; 
nothing they could say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was 
looked upon as going about to murder them ; they first of all unbound 
them, but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the women, as 
if they had just felt the knife at their throats ; for they immediately con- 
cluded they were imbound on purpose to be killed. If they gave them 
any thing to eat, it was the same thing ; then they concluded it was for 
fear they should sink in flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill ; if they 
looked at one of them more particularly, the party presently concluded it 
was to see whether he or she was fattest or fittest to kill first ; nay, after 
they had brought them quite over, and begun to use them kindly and 
treat them well, still they expected every day to make a dinner or supper 
for their new masters. 

Wben the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or 
journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their new family 
was? and being told that they had brought them on shore, and put 
them into one of their huts, and were come to beg some victuals for them, 
they (the Spaniards) and the two other Englishmen — ^that is to say, the 
wbole colony — ^resolved to go all down to the place and see them, and did 
so, and Friday's father with them. 

* When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound; for when 
they had brought them on shore they boimd their hands, that they might 
not take the boat and make their escape — there, I say, they sat, all of 
them stark naked. First, there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, 
well-shaped, with straight and fair limbs, about thirty or thirty-five years 
of age ; and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty, two 
more not above twenty-four or twenty-five, and the fifth, a tall, comely 

21 



322 ADYBNTUBXS Of 

maiden, about sixteen or seyenteen. The women were weU-fayomed, 
agreeable persons, both in shape and features, only tawny ; and two of 
them, had they been perfect white, would have passed for handiwme 
women even in London itself^ haying yery pleasant, agreeable oomite- 
nances, and of a yery modest behayiour, especially when they came afUf • 
wards to be dothed, and dressed, as they called it^ though that dress yru 
yery indifferent, it must be confessed. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's feUier, 
to go in and see first if he knew any of them, and then if he understood 
any of their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriooslj 
at them, but knew none of them, neither could any of them understand a 
word he said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women. How- 
oyer, this was enough to answer the end, which was to satisfy them that 
the men into whose hands they were fallen were Chnstians, that they 
abhorred the eating of men or women, and that they might be sure thej 
would not be killed. As soon as they were assured of this, they du^ 
coyered such a joy, and by such awkward and seyeral ways, as is hard to 
describe, for it seems they were of seyeral nations. 

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid to ask them if they 
were willing to be seryants, and to work for the men who had brou^t 
them away to saye their liyes ? at which they fell a dancing ; and pre- 
sently one fell to taking up this, and another that — any thing that lay next^ 
to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that they were willing to work. 

The goyemor, who found that the haying women among them would 
presently be attended with some inconyeniency, and might occasion some 
strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intended to do 
with these women, and how they intended to use them, whether as 8e^ 
yants or as wiyes? One of the Englishmen answered yery boldly snd 
readily, that they would use them as both. To which the goyemor said, 
'^ I am not going to restrain you from it, — ^you are your own masters as to 
that ; but this I think is but just, for ayoiding disorders and quairds 
among you, and I desire it of you for that reason only, namely, that jbu 
will all engage that, if any of you take any of these women as a wife, he 
shall take but one." AH this appeared so just, that eyery one agreed to 
it without any difficulty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to take 
■ any of them ? But eyery one answered, No. * Some of them said they had 
wiyes in Spain ; and the others did not like women that were not Chris- 



ROBINSON CBUBOB. 323 

tianB : and all together declared that they would not touch one of them, 
which was an instance of such virtue as I have not met with in all my 
travels. On the other hand, to be short, the five Englishmen took them 
every one a wife ; and so they set np a new form of living, for the 
Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which they had 
enlarged exceedingly within : the three servants, which they had taken in 
the late battle of the savages, lived with them ; and these carried on the 
main part of the colony, supplying all the rest with food, and assisting 
them in any thing as they could, or as they found necessity required. 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such refractory, ill-matched 
fellows, should agree about these women, and that two of them should not 
pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing two or three of them were, 
without comparison, more agreeable than the others : but they took a good 
way enough to prevent quarrelling among themselves ; for they set the 
five women by themselves in one of their huts, and they went all into the 
other hut, and drew lots among them who should choose first. He that 
drew to choose first, went away by himself to the hut where the 'poor 
creatures were, and fetched out her he chose ; and it was worth observing, 
that he that chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliest and the 
oldest of the five, which made mirth enough among the rest ; and even 
the Spaniards laughed at it : but the fellow considered better than any of 
them, that it was application and business that they were to expect as- 
sistance in as much as any thing else ; and she proved the best wife in the 
parcel. 

When they had all chosen their wives, the men went to work, and the 
Spaniards came and helped them ; and in a few hours they had built them 
every one a new hut or tent for their lodging apart. The three wicked 
ones had pitched farthest o£f, and the two honest ones nearer, but both on 
the north shore of the island, so that they continued separate as before : 
and thus my island was peopled in three places, and, as I might say, three 
towns were begun to be planted. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that, as it often happens in 
the world (what the wise ends of God's providence are in such a disposition 
of things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had the two worst wives ; 
and the three reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging, that were fit 
for nothing, and neither seemed bom to do themselves good, nor any one 
else, had three clever, diligent, careftil, and ingenious wives — ^not that the 
two first were ill wives as to their temper or humour, for all the five were 



324 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

most willing, quiet, pasedvei and subjected creatures, rather like slaYes 
than wives ; but my meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenioosy 
or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat. 

As to the three reprobates, aa I justly call them, though they were 
much civilised by their new settlement, compared to what they were 
before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity, yet 
one of the certain companions of a profligate mind never left them, and 
that was their idleness. It is true, they planted com and made fences; 
but Solomon's words were never better verified than in them — " I went 
by the vineyard of the slothful, and it was overgrown with thorns ; " for [ 
when the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could not see it in some 
places for weeds : the hedge had several ga^s in it, where the wild goats 
had gotten in and eaten up the com ; perhaps here and there a dead bush 
was crammed in to stop them out for the present, but it was only shutting 
the stable-door afber the steed was stolen : whereas, when they looked on 
the colony of the other two, there was the very face of industry and sac- 
cess upon all they did ; there was not a weed to be seen in all their com, 
or a gap in any of their hedges ; and they, on the other hand, verified 
Solomon's words in another place : '^ The diligent hand maketh rich ; " 
for everything grow and thrived, and they had plenty within and without ; 
they had more tame cattle than the others, more utensils and necessaries 
within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion too. The diligent lived 
well and comfortably, and the slothful lived hard and beggarly ; and so, I 
believe, generally speaking, it is all over the world. 

But now I come to a scene diiferent from all that had happened before, 
either to them or me ; and the origin of the story was this : — Early one 
•morning there came on shore five or six canoes of Indians, or savages, call 
them which you please ; and there is no room to doubt that they came 
upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves : but that part was now 
so familiar to the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they had nothing to 
do but to give notice to all the three plantations to keep within doors, 
and not to show themselves,— only placing a scout in a proper place, to 
give notice when the boats went off to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right ; but a disaster spoiled all these 
measures, and made it known among the savages that there were inha- 
bitants there, which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole 
colony. After the canoes with the savages were gone off, the Spaniards 
peeped abroad again, and some of them had the curiosity to go to the 



B0BIN80N CRUBOB. 325 

place where they had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to 
their great surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lying fast 
asleep upon the ground. The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this 
sighty and perfectly at a loss what to do. After some consultation, they 
resolved upon this, that they would lie still awhile longer, till, if possible, 
these three men might be gone : but then the governor Spaniard recol- 
lected that the three savages had no boat, and that if they were left to 
rove about the island, they would certainly discover that there were in- 
habitants in it, and so they should be undone that way. Upon this, they 
went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep still; so they 
resolved to awaken them, and take them prisoners ; and they did so, and 
away they carried them, first to the bower, where was the chief of their 
country work, and afterwards to the habitation of the two Englishmen. Here 
they were set to work, though it was not much they had for them to do ; 
and, whether it was by negligence in guarding them, or that they thought 
the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but one of them 
ran away, and, taking into the woods, they could never hear of him 
more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon after in 
some other boats or canoes of savages, who came on shore three or four 
weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their revels as usual, went off 
again in two days time. This thought terrified them exceedingly ; for 
they concluded, and that not without good cause indeed, that if this 
fellow got safe home among his comrades, he would certainly give them 
an account that there were people in the island, as also how weak and 
few they were. The first testimony they had that this fellow had given 
intelligence of them was, that, about two months after this, six canoes 
of savages, with about seven, or eight, or ten men in a canoe, came 
rowing along the north side of the island, where they never used to come 
before, and landed, about an hour after sunrise, at a convenient place 
about a mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this 
escaped man had been kept. 

When the poor frighted men had secured their wives and goods, 
they sent one of the slaves they had of the three who came with the 
women, and who was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards 
with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy help ; and, in 
the meantime, they took their arms and what ammunition they had, 
and retreated towards the place in the wood where their wives were

sent, keeping at a distancei yet bo that they might see, if possible, which 
way the savages took. 

They had not gone far but that, from a rising gronnd, they could see \g^ 
the little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, ^^ 
and in a moment more could see all their huts and household stuf 
flaming up together, to their great grief and mortification ; for they had 
a very great loss, and to them irretrievable, at least for some time. They 
kept their station for a while, tUl they found the savages, like wild 
beasts, spread themselves all over the place, rummaging every place 
they could think of in search for prey, and, in particular, for the people, 
of whom it plainly appeared they had intelligence. 

The two Englishmen, seeing this, thought it proper to make another 
retreat about half a mile further, believing, as it afterwards happ^ed, \^ 
that the farther they strolled, the fewer would be. together. The next 
halt was at the entrance into a very thick grown part of the woods, 
and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and vastly 
large ; and in this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see 
what might o£fer. They had not stood there long, but two of the 
savages c^peared running directly that way, and, a little way farther, 
they espied three more coming after them, and five more beyond them, 
all coming the same way : besides which, they saw seven or eight more 
at a distance, running another way ; for, in a word, they ran every way, 
like sportsmen beating for their game. 

The po(»r men were now in great perplexity, but, after a very short 
debate, they resolved to stand them there, and, if they were too many 
to deal with, then they would get tp the top of the tree, from whence 
they doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted, as long as their 
ammunition lasted. They next considered whether they should fire at 
the two first, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party, hy 
which the two and the five that followed would be separated ; at length 
they resolved to let the two first pass by, unless they should spy them 
in the tree, and come to attack them. The two first savages also con- 
flrmed them in this resolution, by turning a little firom them towards 
another part of the wood ; but the three, and the five after them, came 
forwards directly to the tree, as if they had know|i the. Englishmen were 
there. As the savages came on, they ph^nly saw that oixe of the three 
wfis the runaway savage that had escaped from them, and they resohed 
^tf if possible, he should not escape, though they should both fire ; ao 



ROBINSON CBUBOB. 827 

the other stood ready with his piece, that, if he did not drop at the first 
■hot, lie should be sure to have a second. But the first was too good a 
marksman to miss his aim ; for, as the savages kept near one another a 
little behind in a line, he fired, and hit two of them directly ; the fore- 
most was killed outright, being skot in the head ; the second, which was 
the runaway Indian, was shot through the body and fell, but was not 
quite dead ; and the third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by 
the same ball that went through the body of the second, and being dread- 
fdlly frighted, though not much hurt, sat down upon the ground, scream- 
ing and yelling in a hideous manner. 

The fiye that were behind, more frighted with the noise than sensible 
of tbeir danger, stood still at first ; for the woods made the sound a tliou- 
sand times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling frx>m one side to 
another. However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what 
the matter was, came on unconcerned to the place where their com- 
panions lay ; and here the poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they 
were within reack of the same mischief, stood all of a huddle over the 
wounded man, inquiring, as may be supposed, how he came to be hurt 
Our two men, having them all thus in their power, and the first having 
loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly both together among them, and, 
singling out by agreement which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, 
or very much wounded, four of them ; the fifth, frighted even to death, 
though not hurt. Mi with the rest ; so that our men, seeing them all fall 
together, thought they had killed them all. This belief made our two 
men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns 
again, which was a wrong step, and they were under some surprise when 
they came to the place and found no less than four of the men alive, and 
of them two very little hurt, and one not at all : this obliged them to fall 
upon them with the stocks of their muskets ; and first they made sure of 
the runaway savage that had been the cause of all the mischief, and 
of another that was hurt in his knee, and put them out of their pain. 
Then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them 
with his two hands held up, and made piteous moan to them by gestures 
and signs for his life that they could understand. 

They ngnifled to him to sit down at the foot of a tree thereby ; and 
one of the T^tiglial^Tnflfi, with a piece of rope-twine which he had by chance 
in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and his hands ^>ehind him, and 
there they left him, and made with what speed they could after the other 



828 ADYBNTTJBB6 OF 

two which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of them, should 
find the way to their covered place in the woods, where their wives, and 
the few goods they had left, lay. They came once in sight of the two 
men, but it was at a great distance ; however, they had the satisfactioii to 
see them cross over a valley towards the sea, the qnite contrary way from 
that which led to their retreat ; and, being satisfied with that, they went 
back to the tree where they left their prisoner, but he was gone, and the 
two pieces of rope-yam with which they had bound him lay just at the 
foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great a concern as before, not knowing how near 
the enemy might be, or in what numbers ; so they resolved to go away to 
the place where their wives were, to see if all was well there. When 
they came thither, they found the savages had been in the wood, and very 
near the place, but had not found it ; for indeed it was inaccessible, by 
the trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it had been directed 
•by those that knew it, which these were not. While they were here, 
they had the comfort of seven of the Spaniards coming to their assistance : 
the other ten men, with their servants and Friday's father, were gone in 
a body to defend their bower, and the com and cattle that were kept 
there^ With the seven Spaniards came one of the savages, who, as I said, 
were their prisoners formerly, and with them also came the savage whom 
the Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the tree ; for it seems 
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound 
the eighth, and brought him along with them. 

The two Englishmen were now so encouraged, that they could not 
satisfy themselves to stay any longer there ; but, taking five of the 
Spaniards and themselves, with four muskets and a pistol among them, 
and two stout quarter-staves, away they went in quest of the savages. 
And first they came to the tree where the men lay that had been killed ; 
but it was easy to see that some more of the savages had been there, for 
they had attempted to carry their dead men away, and had dragged two 
of them a good way, but had given it over. From thence they advanced 
to the first rising ground, where they had stood and seen their camp 
destroyed, and where they had the mortification still to see some of the 
smoke. They then resolved to go forward towards their plantation ; but 
a little before they came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they 
plainly saw the savages aU embarking again in their canoes. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruinedi and all their improTe*

ments destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them to rebuild, and 

to assiBt them with needM eupplies. Their three countrymen, who were 

not yet noted for having the least inclination to do any thing good, yet, as 

Boon as they heard of it came and offered their help and assistance, and 

did very friendly work for seyeral days to restore their habitations, and 

make necessaries for them ; and thus, in a little, they were set upon their 

legs again. 

It was five or six months afber this, when, on a sudden, they were 

invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less than twenty-eight canoes, 

full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great dubs, wooden swords, 

and such like engines of war ; and they brought such numbers with them, 

that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost consternation. These 

new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east end of the island, came 

ranging along the shore directly towards the plantation of the two 

Rnglishmen, to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our men 

could judge. Our army was but small indeed ; but, that which was 

worse, they had not arms for all their number neither. The whole 

■cooont, it seems, stood thus : — ^first, as to men — 

17 Spaniards. 
5 Englishmen. 

1 Old Friday, or Friday's father. 

3 Slaves, taken with the women, who proved very fedthful. 
3 Other slaves, who lived with tiie Spaniards. 

"29 

To arm these they had— 

11 Muskets. 
5 Pistols. 
3 Fowling-pieces. 

5 Muskets, or fowling-pieces, which were taken by me from 
the mutinous seamen whom I reduced. 

2 Swords. 

3 Old halberts. 

"29 
To their slaves they did not give either musket or fbril, but they had 
every one a halbert, or a long staff^ like a quarter-staff, with a great spike 
of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet ; also every 
one of our men had hatchets. Two of the women could not be prevailed 
npon, but they would come into the fight, and they had bows and arrows 
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the first action 
happened, where the Indians fought with one another. 



830 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

The Spaniard goyemor commanded the whole ; and William AtkiiUy 
who, though a dreadM fellow for wickedness, was a most daring bdd 
fellow, commanded under him. The savages came forward like lions, and 
our men, which was the worst of their fate, had no advantage in their 
situation, only that Will Atkins, who now proved a most useful fellow, 
with six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of bushes, as an 
advanced guard, with orders to let the first' of them pass by, and then fire 
into the middle of them ; and, as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat 
round a part of the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards where thej 
9tood, having a thicket of trees all before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in 
heaps, out of all manner of order, and WiU Atkins let about fifty of them 
pass by him ; then, seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, lie ordered 
three of his men to fire, having loaded their muskets with six or seyen 
bullets a-piece, about as big as pistol bullets. How many they killed or 
wounded they knew not ; but the consternation and surprise was inex* 
pressible among the savages, who were frighted to the last degree, to hear 
stich a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt, but see 
nobody that did it ; when, in the middle of their Mght, William Atkins 
and his other three let fly again among the thickest of them ; and, in lees 
than a minute, the first thr^i being loaded again, gave them a third 
volley. 

Had William Atkins and his men retired as soon as they had fired, or 
had the rest of the body been at hand to have poured in their shot con- 
tinually, the savages had been effectually routed ; for the terror that was 
among them came principally from this, namely, that they were killed by 
the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that hnit 
them : but William Atkins^ staying to load again, discovered the cheat, 
and some of the savages, spying them, came upon them behind, wounded 
Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow Englishmen with their aiiows, 
as they did afterwards one Spaniard and one of the Indian slaves who 
came with the women. Our men, being thus hard laid at, retreated to a 
rising ground in the wood ; and the Spanioids, after firing three volleys 
up<m them, retreated also : for the number of the savages was so great 
that, though above fifty of them were killed, and more than ao many 
wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our mm, fearless of danger, 
and shot their arrows like a doud. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon 



ROBINBON CBUSOB. 831 

rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have had him 
axch, and charge them all together at onoe : but the Spaniard replied, 
Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight,-^let them aloiie 
U morning ; all these wounded men will be stiff and sore with their 
rounds, and faint with the loss of blood, and so we shall have the fewer 
engage." The adyice was good; but Will Atkins replied merrily, 
' Tliat's true, Seignior, and so shall I too ; and that's the reason I would 
50 on while I am warm." — " "Well, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, 
' you have behaved gallantly, and done your part ; we will fight for you, 
f you cannot come on : but I think it best to stay till morning." So they 
praited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages in 
preat disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a great hurry and 
loise among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fall upon 
hem in the night. One of the two Englishmen, in whose quarter it was 
vhere the fight began, led them roimd between the woods and the sea- 
ide, westward; and, turning short south, they came so near where the 
hickest of them lay, that, before they were seen or heard, eight of them 
[red in among them, and did dreadful execution upon them : in half a 
oinute more eight others fired after them, pouring in their small shot in 
ach a quantity that abundance were killed and wounded ; and all this 
fhile they were not able to see who hurt them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then 
livided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall in among them 
ill together. The savages stood altogether, but were in the utmost con*' 
osion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from three quarters together: 
hey would have fought if they had seen us, but our men gave them no 
ime, but, running up to them, fired among them three ways, and then 
ell in with the butt ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, 
ind hatchets ; and laid about them so weU that, in a word, they set up a 
lismal screaming and howling, flying to save their lives which way soever 
hey could. Our men were tired with the execution, and killed, or mor<f 
ally wounded, in the two fights, about one hundred and eighty of them ; 
he rest, being frighted out of their wits, scoured through the woods and 
ver the hills with all the speed that fear and nimble feet could help 
hem to do, and they got all together to the sea-side, where they landed 
nd where their canoes lay. But it blew a terrible storm of wind that 
vening from the sea-ward, so that it was impossible for them to put off : 



332 ADTBNTURBS Or 

their canoes were most of them driyen hy the surge of the sea so hig^ 
upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to get them off ; and some of 
them were dashed to pieces against the heach, or against one another. 

.Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that night; 
hut, haying refreshed themselyes as well as they could, they resolved to 
march to that part of the island where the savages were fled. When they 
came in view of the place where the remains of the savages' army lay, 
there appeared ahout one hundred still : their posture was generally dt- 
ting upon the ground, with their knees up towards their mouth, and the 
head put between the hands, leaning down upon the knees. The Spaniaid 
governor ordered two muskets to he fired without ball, to alarm them : 
this he did, that by their coxmtenance he might know what to expect- 
namely, whether they were still in heart to fight, or were so heartily 
beaten, as to be dispirited and discouraged, and iso he might manage 
accordingly. 

This stratagem took ; for, as soon as the savages heard the first gnn 
and saw the flash of the second, they started upon their feet in the 
greatest consternation imaginable ; and, as our men advanced, they ran 
screaming and yawling away up the hills into the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and 
they had all gone away to sea. But Will Atkins proved the best counsellor 
in this case. His advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and dap 
in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of 
ever returning any more to plague the island. He told them they had 
better have to do with one hundred men than with one hundred nations ; 
tjiai, as they must destroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or 
be all of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he showed them the 
necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it : so they w^t to 
work immediately with the boats, and, getting some dry wood together 
from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire ; but they were so 
wet, that they would scarce bum. However, the fire so burned the upper 
part, that it soon made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats. 
When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them came ron- 
ning out of the woods, and, coming as near as they could to our men, 
kneeled down, and made pitiM gestures and strange noises, begging to 
have their boats spared, and that they would be gone, and never retain 
thither again. 

But our men were now satisfied that they had no way to preeerre 



I 



ROBINBON CRUBOB. 333 

themselveB, or to save their colony, but effectually to prevent any of these 
people from ever going home again ; so that, letting them know that they 
ahould not have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and de- 
stroyed them every one that the storm had not destroyed before : at the 
sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our 
people heard plain enough, after which they ran about the island like 
iistracted men. 

Kor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider that, while 
they made those people thus desperate, they ought to have kept good 
g;uard at the same time upon their plantations ; for though the Indians 
^d not find their main retreat, yet they foxmd out my plantation at the 
bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting about 
it ; trod all the com under foot ,* tore up the vines and grapes, being just 
then almost ripe ; and did our men an inestimable damage. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet they 
were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down ; for, as 
they were too nimble of foot for our men when they found them single, so 
our men durst not go about single for fear of being surrounded with their 
numbers. The first thing they concluded, when they saw what their 
circumstances were, was that they would, if possible, drive them up to 
the farther part of the island, south-east, that, if any more savages came 
on shore, they might not find one another ; then that they would daily 
hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them as they could come at, till 
they had reduced the number ; and, if they could at last tame them and 
bring them to any thing, they would give them com, and teach them how 
to plant, and live upon their daily labour. In order to this they followed 
them, and so terrified them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of 
them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, he would fall down for 
fear ; and so dreadfully frighted they were, that they kept out of sight 
farther and farther, till at last our men, following them, and every day 
almost killing and wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods 
and hollow places so much that it reduced them to the utmost misery for 
want of food ; and many were afterwards found dead in the woods with- 
out any hurt, but merely starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity moved 
them, especially the Spaniard governor, who was the most generous- 
minded man that ever I met with in my life ; and he proposed, if pos- 
fiible, to take one of them alive, tmd bring him to understand what they 



{ 



334 ADYBNTUBBS 09 

meant, so f aif as to be able to act as interpreter, and to go among theiO 
and see if they mi^t be brought to some conditions that might be de* 
pended upon, to save their lives, and do us no spoil. 

It was some time befoi^ any of them could be taken ; but, being weak 
and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised, and made a prisons. 
They brought old Friday to him, who told him how kind the others 
would be to them all; that they would not only save their lives, but 
would give them a part of the island to live in, and com to plant, and 
bread for their present subsistence, provided they would give satisfisu!ti(m 
that they should keep in their own bounds, and not come beyond them, 
to injure or prejudice others. Old Friday bade the fellow go and talk 
with the rest of his coxmtrymen, and hear what they said to it, assoring 
them that if they did not agree immediately, they should all be destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to 
about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first offer, upon which 
twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, and three Indian 
slaves, and old Friday, marched to the place where they were. The 
three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of bread, and some rice 
boiled up to cakes and dried in- the sun, and three Hve goats ; and they 
were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, eat the pro- 
visions very thank^lly, and were the most faithfdl fellows to their wcfrds 
that could be thought of; for, except when they came to beg victuals and 
directions, they never came out of their bounds, and there they lived 
when I came to the island, and I went to see them. 

They had taught them to plant com, make bread, breed tame goats, 
and milk them ; they wanted nothing but wives, and they would soon 
have been a nation. Our men taught them to make wooden spades, snch 
as I made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets, and three or 
four knives ; and there they lived, the most subjected innocent creatures 
that were ever heard of. After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tran- 
quillity with respect to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was 
in about two years. Not but now and then some canoes of savages* came 
on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts ; but, as they were of several 
nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those that came before, or the 
reason of it, they did not make any search or enquiry after their country- 
men ; and if they had, it would have been very hard for them to have 
found them out.

[HUS, I think, I have given a full acconnt of all that hap- 
pened to my retnm, at least that- was worth notice. My 
coming was a particular relief to these people, because we 
ftimished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick- 
axes, and all things of that kind which they could want. With the help 
of these tools they were so very handy, that they came at last to build up 
their huts, or houses, very handsomely, raddling, or working it up like 
basket-work all the way round, which was a very extraordinary piece o[ 
ingenuity, and looked very odd, but was an exceedingly good fence, as 
well against heat as against all sorts of vermin ; and our men were so 
taken with it, that they got the wild savages to come and do the like for 
them : so that when I came to see the two Englishmen's colonies, they 
looked, at a distance, as if they Hved all like bees in a hive ; and, as for 
Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, necessary, and 
sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket-work as I believe 
was never seen. This fellow showed abundance of ingenuity in several 
things which he had no knowledge of: he made himself a forge, with a 
pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire ; he made himself charcoal for his 
work, andiie formed out of one of the iron crows a middling good anvil 
to hammer upon : in this manner he made many things, but especially 
hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges. 

As for reUgion, I don't know that there was any thing of that kind 



386 ADYENTURBB Or 

among them ; they pretty often, indeed, put one another in mind tfatt 
there was a God, by the very common method of seamen, namely, swefl^ 
ing by His name : nor were their poor, ignorant, savage wiyes, much the 
better for having been married to Christians, as we must call them ; for, 
as they knew vefy little of GKxl themselves, so they were utterly incapable 
of entering into any discourse with their wives about a Grod, or to talk 
any thing to them concerning religion. The utmost of all the improre- 
ment which I can say the wives had made from them was, that they had 
taught them to speak English pretty well ; and all the children they had, 
which were near twenty in all, were taught to speak English, too, from 
their first learning to speak, though they at first spoke it in a very broken 
manner, like their mothers. The mothers were all a good sort of well- 
governed, quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one 
another, mighty observant and subject to their masters — I cannot call 
them husbands — and wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the 
Christian religion, and to be legally married. 

Having thus given an account of |he colony in general, and piettj 
much of my five runagate Englishmen, I must say something of the 
Spaniards, who were the main body of the family, and in whose story 
there are some incidents also remarkable enough. I had a great many 
discourses with them about their circumstances when they were among 
the savages : they told me readily that they had no instances to give of 
their application or ingenuity in that country ; that they were a poor, 
miserable, dejected handful of people ; that, if means had been put into 
their hands, they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair, and so smik 
under the weight of their misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but 
starving. One of them, a grave and very sensible man, told me it was 
remarkable that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in their dis- 
tress than any people that he ever met with — ^that their unhappy nation, 
and the Portuguese, were the worst men in the world to struggle with mis- 
fortunes; for, that their first step in dangers, after common efforts are 
over, was always to despair — ^lie down under it and die, without rousing 
their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape. They gave me dismal 
accounts of the extremities they were driven to ; how sometimes they 
were many days without any food at all, the island they were upon being 
inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent, and for that reason 
were less supplied with the necessaries of life than they had reason to be- 
lieve others were in the same part of the world ; and yet they found that 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. , 337 

ese savages were less rayenous and voracious than those who had better 
ipplies of food. 

Then they gave me an account how the savages, whom they lived 
mong, expected them to go out with them into their wars ; but, being 
rithout powder and shot, when they came on the field of battle, they 
rere in a worse condition than the savages themselves, for they neither 
lad bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the savages gave them, so 
ihat they could do nothing but stand still and be wounded with arrows, 
ill they came up to the teeth of their enemy ; till at last they foxmd the 
iray to make themselves large targets of wood, which they covered with 
ikins of wild beasts, — and these covered them from the arrows of the 
lavages ; that notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great danger, 
ind were once five of them knocked down together with the clubs of the 
Savages, which was the time when one of them was taken prisoner, that 
t8 to say, the Spaniard whom I had relieved ; that at first they thought 
be had been killed, but when afterwards they heard he was taken prisoner, 
Qiey were under the greatest grief imaginable, and would willingly have 
lU ventured their lives to have rescued hiuL 

They described, most affectionately, how they were surprised with joy 
Kt the return of their friend and companion in misery, and how they were 
istonished at the sight of the relief I sent them, and at the appearance of 
loaves of bread, things they had not seen since their coming to that 
miserable place. And, after all, they would have told me something of 
ihe joy they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away 
:o the person and place from whence all these new comforts came ; but it 
was impossible to express it bywords, for their excessive joy driving them 
;o unbecoming extravagances, they had no way to describe them but by 
filing me that they bordered upon lunacy. All these things made me 
nore sensible of the relation of these poor men, and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found them, I 
oust relate the heads of what I did for these people, and the condition in 
rbich I left them. I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, 
irhom I called governor, about their stay in the island. I told them I 
^ame to establish them there, not to remove them ; and then I let them 
Icnow that I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them ; that 
[ had been at a great charge to supply them with all things necessary, as 
well for their convenience as their defence ; and that I had such parti- 
cular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as by 

22

the particular and necessary employments which they were bred to, being 
artificers, to assist them in those things in which at present they were to ^ j 
seek. They were all together when I talked thus to them : and before 
delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one by one, if 
they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had been 
among them, and could shake hands with one another, and engage in a 
strict Mendship and union of interest, so that there might be no more 
misunderstandings or jealousies. William Atkins, with abundance of 
frankness and good humour, said they had met with afflictions enough to 
make them all sober, and enemies enough to make them all Mends ; that, 
for his part, he was very willing and desirous of living on terms of entire 
Mendship and union with them, and would do any thing that lay in bis 
power to convince them of it ; and as for going to England, he cared not 
if he did not go thither these twenty years. 

The Spaniards said they had indeed at first disarmed and excluded 
William Atkins and his two countrymen, for their ill conduct, but that 
Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had with 
the savages, and on several occasions since, and had showed himself so 
faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of them all, that they 
had forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much to be 
trusted with arms, and supplied with necessaries, as any of them ; and that 
they had testified their satisfaction in him, by committing the conmiand 
to him, next to the governor himself : and, as they had an entire confi- 
dence in him and all his coxmtrymen, they most heartily embraced the 
occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would never have any 
interest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we appointed 
the next day to dine altogether ; and, indeed, we made a splendid feast, 
at wfeich we were very innocently merry: I brought out my cargo of goSis, 
wherein, that there might be no dispute about dividing, I showed them 
that there was sufficient for them all. Having distributed these among 
them, I presented to them the people I had brought with me, particularly 
the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them most necessary 
people ; but above all, my general artificer, than whom they could not 
name any thing that was moro needful to them : and the tailor, to show 
his concern for them, went to work immediately, and made them every 
one a shirt the first thing he did ; and, which was still more, he taught 
the women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the deedle, but made 



ROBINBON CBUBOB. 339 

» 

them assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest. 
As for the carpenters, they took in pieces all my clumsy imhandy things, 
and made them clever convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, 
lockers, shelves, and every thing they wanted of that kind. 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man a 
digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, and to every separate place a pick-axe, 
a crow, a broad axe, and a saw ; always appointing that, as often as any 
were broken, or worn out, they should be supplied, without grudging, out 
of the general stores that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, 
chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of tools and iron-work, they had 
without tale, as they required ; and, for the use of the smith, I left two 
tons of unwrought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such, 
even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them ; for now they 
could march, as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if there 
was occasion, and were able to fight a thousand savages, if they had but 
8ome little advantages of situation, which also they could not miss of if 
they had occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved 
to death, and the maid also : she was a sober, well-educated, religious 
young woman, and behaved so inoffensively, that every one gave her 
a good word. After a while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so £ne 
a way of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had neither 
business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, nor reason for taking so long 
a voyage, both of them desired I would give them leave to remain on the 
island, and be entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to 
it readily, and they had a little plot of ground allotted to them, where 
they had three tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, 
palisaded like Atkins's, and adjoining to his plantation. And now the 
other two Englishmen moved their habitation to the same place, and so 
the island was divided into three colonies, and no more ; namely, the 
Spaniards, with old Eriday and the first servants, at my old habitation 
under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city ; and never was 
ihere such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I believe, in any part of the 
world. The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four 
Englishmen I had left there, with their wives and children ; three 
savages that were slaves ; the widow and children of the Englishman that 
was killed, and the young man and the maid ; and, by the way, we made 



340 ABVBNTURBB 09 

a wife of h&t also 'bef<»^ we went away* Thcfte were also the tiro 
carpentetB and the tailof , whom I brought With me for them ; also tk 
smith, and my other man, whom I called '' Jack-(^-all-trades," who im 
himself as good almost as twenty men, for he was not cmly a very b^ 
geiiioas fellow, but a very merry fellow ; and bef(^e 1 went away, we 
married him to t^ honest maid that came with the 3ronth in the ship, 
whom I mentioned before* 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me natnrally to say somethiflg 
of the French ecclesiastic, that I had brought with me out of the ship^i 
crew whom I took at sea. tt is true, this man was a Eoman ; but jnstioe 
demands of me to give him a due character ; and I must say he wv 
a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person ; exact in his life, exten- 
sive in his charity, and exemplary in almost every thing he did. The 
first hour that I began to converse with him, after he had agreed to 
go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in 
his conversation. He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and d 
adventures which had befallen him ; and particularly this was viry 
remarkable, namely, that during the voyage he was now engaged in, he 
had the misfortune to be five limes shipped and ulishipped, and never to 
go to the place whither any of the ships he was iu were at first designei 

But I shall not make digressions into other men's stories, which have 
no relation to my own. I return to what concerns our affairs in the 
island. He came to me one morning and told me, with a very goat 
countenance, that he had for two or three days desired an opi>ortuiiit7 d 
some discourse with me, which he hoped might, in some measure, corres- 
pond with my general design, which was the prosperity of my new colony, 
and perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet thought it was, in the 
way of GFod's blessing. " There are three things," said he, " which, if I am 
right, must stand in the way of God's blessing upon your endeavours here, 
and which I should rejoice to see removed. Pirst, you have here foor 
Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the savages, and have 
taken them as their wives, and yet are not married to them after any 
stated legal manner, as the laws of God and man require ; and therefore 
are yet living in adultery. To this, sir," says he, " I know you will 
object) that there was no clergjrman or priest of any kind, or of any pro- 
fession, to perform the ceremony ; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to wiiie 
down a contract of marriage, and have it signed between them. And 1 
know also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you — I mean of tbo 



ROBINBOIY OBUBOB. 341 

^reement that he ohliged them to make wh^ they took these women, 
unely, that they ahould choose them out by coosent, and keep separately 
\ them; which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no agreement 
ith the women as wives, but only an agreement among themselves, 
> keep them from quarrelling. ITow, sir,'' says he, ''these men may 
hen they please, or when occasion presents, abandon these women, din^ 
mi their chUdren, leave them to perish, and take other women wA 
lairy th^n whilst these are living." And here he added, with some 
vrmth, '' How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawM liberty ? And how 
lall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, however good 
L themselves, and however sincere in your design, while these men, who 
; present are your subjects, under your absolute government and do<» 
inion, are allowed by you to Uve in open adultery ?" 

I thought to have gotten off with my young priest by telling him 
Lat all that part was done when I was not here, and they had lived so 
any years with them now, that it was past remedy. '' Sir," says he, 
asking your pardon for such freedom, you are right in this-^that it 
)ing done in your absence, you could not be charged with that part of the 
ime. But I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you are not therefore 
ider an obligation to do your uttermost now to put an end to it. Let 
le time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt for the friture will 
d entirely upon you. Because it is certainly in your power now to put 
1 end to it, and in nobody's power but yours." 

I imagined that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I should part 
lem, and not suffer them to live togeth^ any longer ; and I said to him 
could not do that by any means, for that it would put the whole island 
I confusion. He seemed surprised that I should so far mistake him. 
No, sir," said he, " I do not mean that you should separate them, but 
gaUy and effectuaUy marry them now. And, sir, as my way of marry* 
ig may not be so easy to reconcile them to, though it will be as effectual 
ren by your own laws, so your way may be as well before Ood, and as 
did among men — I mean by a written contract signed by both man and 
Oman, and by all the witnesses present ; which all the laws of Europe 
ould decree to be valid." 

I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity of seal, 
Mides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his own party or 
lurch, and such a true warmth for the preserving people that he had no 
dowledge of or relation to, from transgressing the laws of God. But 



342 * ADVBNTURBS OF 

recollecting what he had said of marrying them by a written contract, I 
told him I granted all that he had said to be just, and on his part yerj 
kind ; that I would discourse with the men upon the point when I came 
to them, and I knew no reason why they should scruple to let him marry 
them all ; which I knew would be granted to be as authentic and yalid in 
England, as if they were married by one of our own clergymen. He 
then said that, notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he 
called them, had lived with these women for almost seven years, and had 
taught them to speak English, and even to read it, and that they were, as 
he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and capable of instrac- 
tion, yet they had not to this hour taught them any thing of the Christian 
religion ; no, not so much as to know that there was a Ood or a worship, 
or in what manner God was to be served, — or that their own idolatry, and 
worshipping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said, 
was an unaccountable neglect, and what Ood would certainly call them to 
801 account for : and, perhaps, at last take the work out of their hands. 
He spoke this very affectionately and warmly. " I am persuaded," says 
he, "had those men lived in the savage country whence their wives came, 
the savages would have taken more pains to have brought them to be 
idolaters, and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so far as I can 
see, has taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the true God. 
Now, sir," said he, "though I do not acknowledge your religion, orpn 
mine, yet we should be all glad to see 'the devil's servants and the sub- 
jects of his kingdom taught^ to know the general principles of the Chris- 
tian religion, — that they might at least hear of Ood, and of a Eedeemer, 
and of the resurrection, and of a ftiture state — ^things which we all beliere : 
they had at least been so much nearer coming into the bosom of the tnie 
church, than they are now in the public profession of idolatry and deTil- 
worship." 

I could hold no longer ; I took him in my arms, and embraced him 
with an excess of passion. " How far," said I to him, '* have I been 
from understanding the most essential part of a Christian, namely, to loie 
the interest of the Christian church, and the good of other men's souls ! 
I scarce have known what belongs to being a Christian." " Oh, sir, do 
not say so," replied he; "this thing is not your fault." "No," said I; 
" but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you ?" " It is not too 
late yet," said he; "bo not too forward to condemn yourself." "But 
what can be done now ?" said I ; " you see I am going away," " Will 



ROBINBON CRUSOB. 343 

70XL give me leave," said he, "to talk with these poor men about it?" 
* Yes, with aU my heart," said I, " and I will oblige them to give heed 
X) what yon say, too." " As to that," said he, " we mnst leave them to 
;he mercy of Christ ; bnt it is onr business to assist them, encourage 
heniy and instruct them." 

Then he went on to say, "It is a maxim, sir, that is, or ought to be, 
■eceived among all Christians, of what church or pretended church soever, 
lamely, that Christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible 
neans, and on all possible occasions. It is on this principle that on 
church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and that our 
clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous 
iroyage, and the most dangerous residence among murderers and barba- 
rians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them 
>ver to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have an opportunity 
iere to have six or seven-and-thirty poor savages brought over from 
idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I 
vronder how you can pass by such an occasion of doing good, which is 
really worth the expense of a man's whole life." He laid it home upon 
Day conscience, whether the blessing of saving seven-and-thirty souls was 
aot worth my venturing all I had in the world for ? I was not so sen- 
sible of that as he was, and I returned upon him thus : " Why, sir, it is a 
valuable thing indeed to be an instrument in God's hands to convert 
seven-and-thirty heathens to the knowledge of Christ ; but as you are an 
ecclesiastic, and are given over to that work,*so that it seems naturally to 
fall into the way of your profession, how is it then that you do not rather 
offer yourself to undertake it, than press me to it ?" 

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as he walked along, and, 
putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow : "I most heartily 
thank God, and you, sir," says he, " for giving me so evident a call to so 
blessed a work ; and, if you think yourself discharged from it, and desire 
me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a happy re- 
ward for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken, disappointed 
voyage as I have met with, that I have dropped at last into so glorious a 
work. But since you will honour me with putting me into this work, I 
have one humble petition to you besides." "What is that?" said I, 
" Why," says he, "it is that you will leave your man Friday with 
me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me ; for without some 
help I cannot speak to them, or they to me." 



344 ADVBNTURBS 09 

I waB Bensibly touched at his reqaesting Priday, because I could not 
think of parting with him, and that for many reasons. He had been the 
companion of my travels : he was not only faithful to me, but sincerely 
affectionate to the last degree ; and I had resolved to do something coH' 
siderable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable he would. Then 
I knew that as I had bred Priday up to be a Protestant, it would quite 
confound him to bring him to embrace another profession ; that he would 
never, while his eyes were open, believe that his old master was a heretic, 
and would be damned ; and this might in the end ruin the poor fellow's 
principles, and so turn him back again to his £rst idolatry. I therefoie 
told him I could not say that I was willing to part with Pnday on any 
account ; that I had promised I would never put him away, and he had 
promised and engaged to me that he would never leave me unless I put 
him away. He seemed much concerned at this ; for he had no rational 
access to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of 
their language, nor they one word of his. To remove this difficulty, 1 
told him Priday's father had learned Spanish, which I found he also 
understood, and he should serve him for an interpreter. So he was much 
better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him but he woidd stay to 
endeavour to convert them. But Providence gave another and a v^ 
happy turn to all this. 

I sent for the Englishmen all together ; began to talk to them of the 
scandalous life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice the 
clergyman had already taken of it ; and, arguing how unchristian and 
irreligious a life it was, I first asked if they were married men or 
bachelors ? They soon explained their condition to me, and showed me 
that two of them were widowers, and the other three were single men or 
bachelors. I asked them with what conscience they could take these 
women, and call them their wives, and have so many children by them, 
and not be married lawfully to them ? They all gave me the answer that 
I expected — namely, that there was nobody to marry them; that they 
agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives, and they thought, 
as things stood with them, they were as legally married as if they had 
been married by a parson, and with all the formalities in the world. 

I told them, that no doubt they were married in the sight of God, and 
were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives ; but that the laws 
of men being otherwise, they might pretend they were not married, and 
so desert the poor women and children hereafter ; and that unless I was 



ROBINSON CRU60B. 345 

assured of their honest intent, I conld do nothing for them ; and that 
unless they would give some assurances that they would marry the 
^omeuy I could not think it was oonvenient they should continue together 
as man and wife. 

All this passed as I expected; and they told me, especially Will 
Atkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they loved their 
wives as well as if they had been bom in their own native country, and 
would not leave them on any account whatever. The priest was not with 
me at that moment, but was not far off. So, to try him farther, I told 
liim I had a clergyman with me, and if he was sincere, I would have him 
married the next morning, and bade him consider of it, and talk with the 
Test. He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he was 
very ready to do it, and believed they would be all willing also. So we 
parted : I went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk 
with his companions. Before I went from their quarter, they all came to 
me, and told me they had been considering what I had said ; that they 
were very glad to hear that I had a clergyman in my company, and they 
were willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be formally 
married as soon as I pleased, for they were fiEu: from desiring to part from 
their wives, and that they meant nothiag but what was honest when they 
chose them. So I appointed them to meet me the next morning, and that 
in the meantime they should let their wives know the meaning of the 
marriage law, and that it was not only to prevent any scandal, but also to 
oblige them that they should not forsake them whatever might happen. 
The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing, and 
were very well satisfied with it ; so they failed not to attend all together at 
my apartment next morning, where I brought out my clergyman. When 
he came to them, he let them know that I had acquainted him with their 
circumstances, and with the present design ; that he was very willing to 
perform that part of his function, and marry them as I had desired, but 
that, before he could do it, he must take the liberty to talk with them. 
He told them that, in the sight of all different men, and in the sense of 
the laws of society, they had lived all this while in an open adultery ; 
and that it was true that nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectu- 
ally separating them from one another now, could put an end to it ; but 
there was a difficulty in it too, with respect to the laws of Christian 
matrimony, which he was not fUlly satisfied about, namely, that of marry- 
ing one that is a professed Christian to a savage, an idolater, and a 



J 



346 ADVENTURES OF 

heathen, one that is not baptised ; and yet that he did not see that there 
was time left for it to endeavour to persuade the women to be baptised, or 
to profess the name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing 
of, and without which they could not be baptised. He told them he 
doubted they were but indifferent Christians themselves ; that they had 
but little knowledge of God or his ways, and therefore he could not 
expect that they had said much to their wives on that head yet; but 
imless they would promise him to use their endeavours with their wives 
to persuade them to become Christians, and would, as well as they conld, 
instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made them, and to 
worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them. 

They heard all this very attentively, and they told me it was very 
true what the gentleman had said, that they were but very indifferent 
Christians themselves, and that they had never talked to their wives 
about religion. "Oh, sir," says "Will Atkins, "how should we teach 
them religion? Why, we know nothing ourselves; and besides, sir," 
said he, "should we go to talk to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and 
heaven, and hell, it would be to make them laugh at us, and ask us what 
we believe ourselves ; and if we should tell them we believe all the things 
we speak of to them, such as of good people going to heaven, and wicked 
people to the devil, they would ask us where we intended to go ourselves, 
who believe all this, and yet are such wicked fellows, as we indeed are : 
why, sir," said Will, " 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion, at 
first hearing : folks must have some religion themselves, before they pre- 
tend to teach other people." "Why, truly, Atkins," said I, "I am 
afraid thou speakest too much truth ;" and with that I let the clergyman 
know what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. " Oh !" said the 
priest, " tell him there is one thing will make him the best minister in the 
world to his wife, and that is repentance, for none teach repentance like 
true penitents. He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so 
much the better qualified to instruct his wife : he will then be able to 
tell her that there is not only a God, and that he is the just rewarder of 
good and evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and, with infinite goodness 
and long-suffering, forbears to punish those that offend — waiting to be 
gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should 
return and live ; that he often suffers wicked men to go on a long time, 
and even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution ; that it is 
a clear evidence of God and of a fatuie state, that righteous men receive 



ROBINSON CRU80B. 347 

not their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till they come into 
another world ; and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of 
tJie resurrection, and of the last judgment : let him hut repent for him- 
self, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife." 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while, 
and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected with 
it '' I knew all this, master," says he, ** and a great deal more ; but I 
han't the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when Gh)d and my own con- 
science knows, and my wife will be an imdeniable evidence against me, 
that I have lived as if I had never heard of God, or a future state, or any 
thing about it : and to talk of my repenting, alas !" (and with that he 
fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that tears stood in his eyes) '' 'tis past 
all that with me." 

I told the clergyman word for word what he said. The zealous, 
affectionate man, could not refrain tears also : but, recovering himself, he 
said to me, ** Ask him but one question : Is he easy that it is too late, or 
is he troubled, and wishes it were not so ?" I put the question fairly 
to Atkins ; and he answered with a great deal of passion, '^ How could 
any man be easy in a condition that certainly mnrt end in eternal 
destruction ?" 

The clergyman shook his head, with a great concern in his face, when 
I told him all this ; but, turning quick to me upon it, said, '^ If that be 
his case, you may assure him it is not too late ; Christ will give him 
repentance, and we that are Christ's servants are commanded to preach 
mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely 
repent ; so that 'tis never too late to repent." 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness ; but it 
seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest ; for he said to me he 
would go and have some talk with his wife : so he went out a while, and 
we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to 
matters of religion — ^much as I was when I went rambHng away from my 
father, and yet that there were none of them backward to hear what had 
been said ; and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with 
their wives about it, and do their endeavour to persuade them to turn 
Christians. 

Upon this discourse, and the m^en promising to persuade their wives to 
embrace Christianity, he married the three couple ; but Will Atkins and 
his wife were not yet come in. After this, the clergyman waiting a while,

was curiooB to know where AtkinB was gone ; and turning to me, says, 
** I entreat you, sir, let us walk ont here and look ; I dare say we shall 
find this poor man somewhere or other, talking seriously with his wi&, 
and teaching her already something of religion." I h^an to he of the 
same mind ; so we went ont together, and I earned him a way which 
none knew hut myself, and where the trees w&e so thick set, as that it 
was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and &r harder to see in 
than to see out ; when, coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins, and 
his tawny savage wife, sitting under the shade of a hush, very eager in 
discourse. I stopped short till my clergyman came up to me, and then, 
having shown him where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at 
them a good while. We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up 
to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens ; then down to the earth, 
then out to the sea ; then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the 
trees. '* Kow," slys my clergyman, '' you see my words are made good; 
the man preaches to her — mark him— ^now he is telling h^ that our Qod 
has made him, and her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, 
the trees, etc." — '* I believe he is," said I. Immediately we peroeiyed 
Will Atkins start up upon his feet, &11 down upon bis knees, and lift up 
both his hands ; we supposed he said something, but we could not hear 
him — it was too far off for that ; he did not continue kneeling half ft 
minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and talks to her again. 
We perceived then the woman very attentive, .but whether she said any- 
thing or no, we could not tell. While the poor fellow was upon his kneee, 
I could see the tears run plentifhlly down my clergyman's cheeks, and 1 
could hardly forbear myself ; but it was a great affliction to us both that 
we were not near enough to hear any thing that passed between them* 

Well, however, we could come no near^, for fear of disturbing them : 
so we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conversation, and it spok^ 
loud enough to us without the help of voice. Se sat down again, aa 
I have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to her, imd two or 
three times we could see him embrace her passionately ; another time we 
saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her 
again, with a kind of transport very unusual ; and after several of theae 
things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again and lend her his hand to 
help her up, when immediately leading her by the hand a step or two, 
they both kneeled down together, and continued so about two minutes. 

My Mend could bear it nio longer, but eries out aloud» *' St f aul,

St. Paul, behold, he prayeth I" This coHtmued about half a quarter of an 
lionr, and then thej walked away too, so that we could see no more 
of them in that situation. As Will Atkins and his wife were gone, 
cur business there was over ; so we went back our own way ; and when 
we came back, we found them waiting to be called in. I then dis- 
covered that Atkins— whose father, it turned out, was a clergyman — had 
been himself affected by the words of the priest, and that he had brought 
Ids wife to embrace the knowledge of Christ and of redemption by Him, 
with joy, and fidth, and with an affection and a surprising degree of 
understanding scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed ; and, at 
her own request, she was baptised. As soon as this was over, the priest 
married them : and after the marriage was oyer, he turned himself to 
Will Atkins, and, in a very affectionate manner, exhorted him not only 
to persevere in that good disposition 'he was in, but to support the con- 
Tictions that were upon him, by a resolution to reform his life ; told him 
it was in vain to say he repented, if he did not forsake his crimes ; repre- 
sented to him, how God had honoured him with being the instrument of 
bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian religion ; and that he 
should be careful he did not dishonour the grace of God ; and that if he 
did, he would see the heathen a better Christian than himself — ^the savage 
converted, and the instrument cast away. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts hung continually 
upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, and fain he would have 
staid upon the island to have undertaken it : but I convinced him, first, 
that his undertaking was impracticable in itself; and secondly, that, per- 
haps, I could put it into a way of being done in his absence, to his satis- 
&ction ; of which by and bye. 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compass, I 
was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man whom I had 
taken out of the famished ship's company, came to me, and told me he 
understood I had a clergyman with me, and that I had caused the 
En^ishmen to be married to the savages whom they called wives ; that 
he had a match too, which he desired might be finished before I went, 
between two Christians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me. 
I was impatient to know who was the person to be married ; upon which 
he told me it was my '^ Jack-of-all-trades,'' and his maid Susan. I was 
most agreeably surprised when he named the match ; for indeed I had 
thought it very suitable. The character of the man I have given you

ndnal book. 

Bat I retom to my dlspositios of things among the people. I did not 
liiiik fit to let them knov aaj thing of the sloop I had framed, and 
tMcIl I thonght of setting up among them ; for had I set np the aloop, 
ind left it among them, they would, upon very light disgust, have 
cparated, and gone a'way from one another ; or perhaps have tamed 
lintes, and so made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of 
ober and religious people, as I intended it to be ; nor did I leave the two 
lieces of brass cannon that I bad on board, or the two quarter-deck guns, 
K the same reason : I thought they had enough to qualify them for a 
lefennre war, against any that should invade them; but I was not to set 
haa up for an ofiFensive war, or to encourage them to go abroad to attack 
titers. I reserved the eloop and the guns for their service another way. 

I have now done with the island. I left them all in good circum- 
toaces, and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship again 
be Sth day of Uay, having been five-and-twenty days among them.

diacoyer what it was ; but after some time, our chief mate going up the 

inaiD, shrouds a little way, and looking at them by the perspectiye, cried 

^Tit, it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant by an army, 

^nd spoke a little hastily, calling the fellow a fool, or some such word. 

•*Nay, sir," says he, "don't be angry, for it is an army and a fleet 

too ; for I belieye there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them 

paddle along, and they are coming towards us, too, apace, and Ml of 

men." 

I was a little surprised at this, and so, indeed, was my nephew, the 
captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island, that 
he could not tell what to think of it, but said two or three times we 
should all be deyoured. I must confess, considering we were becalmed, 
and the current set strong towards the shore, I liked it the worse. How- 
eyer, I bade him not to be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor, as 
soon as we came so near as to know that we must engage them. 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace towards us ; so 
I gaye orders to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails, — get the boats 
out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and the other by the stem, 
and man them both well, and wait the issue in that posture : this I did 
that the men in the boats might be ready, with sheet and buckets, to put 
out any fire these sayages might endeayour to fix upon the outside of the 
ship. In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came 
up with us : but neyer was such a horrid sight seen by Christians. My 
mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number ; the most we 
could make of them, when they oame up, being about one hundred and 
twenty-six canoes, and some of them had sixteen or seyenteen men in 
them, some more, and the least six or seyen. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder 
and astonishment. They came boldly up, howeyer, yery near to us, and 
seemed to go about ta row round us ; but we called to our men in the 
boats not to let them come too near them. This yery order brought us 
to an engagement with them without our designing it ; for fiye or six of 
their large canoes came so near our long-boat, that our men beckoned with 
their hands to them to keep back, which they understood yery well, and 
went back ; but at their retreat about fiye hundred arrows came on board 
us from those boats, and one of our men in the long-boat was yery much 
wounded. I called to them not to fire by any means ; but we handed 
down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a 

23 



354 ADYBNTURB8 Of 

kind of a fence, like waist boards, to coyer them from the anows of the 
savages, if they should shoot again. 

About half an hour afterwards they oome all up in .a body isten 
of XLS and I ea^y found they were soiae of my old friends, the same eort 
of savages that I had been used to engage with : in a little time mm 
they rowed somewhat farther out to sea, till they came directly broadside 
with us, and then rowed down straight upon us, till they came so near, 
that they could hear us speak. Upon this, I ordered all my men to keep 
close, and make all our guns ready ;' but being so near as to be witliin 
hearing, I made Friday go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them 
in his language, to know what they meant, which accordingly he dii 
Whether they understood him or not, that I know not ; but immediately 
Friday cried out they were going to shoot, and, imhappily for him, they 
let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and to my inexpressible giief 
killed poor Friday, no other man being in their sight. The poor feUow 
was shot with no less than three arrows, and about three more fell Tery 
nigh him ; such imlucky marksmen they were ! 

I was so enraged at the loss of my old servant, the companion of all 
my sorrows and solitudes, that I immediately ordered Ave guns to be 
loaded with small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a broad- 
side as they had never had in their lives before, to be sure. 

They were not above half a cable's length off when we fired. I caa 
neither tell how many we killed, nor how many we wounded ; but sine 
such a Mght and hurry never was seen among such a multitude ; there 
were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all, and the 
men all set a-swimming ; the rest, Mghted out of their wits, scoured 
away as fast as they could, taking but little care to save those whoae 
boats were split or spoiled with our shot ; so I suppose that they were 
many of them lost. Our men took up one poor fellow swinmiing for 
his life, above an hour after they were all gone ; nor did we ever see the 
rest any more, for a breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we 
weighed and set sail for the Brazils. 

Our prisoner was so sullen that he would neither eat nor speak ; and 
we all fancied he would starve himself to death, ^ut I took a way to cure 
him; for I made them take him and turn him into the longboat, and 
make him believe they would toss him into the sea again, and so leaye 
him where they found him, if he would not speak : nor would that doy 
but they really did throw him into the sea, and came away from him; 



ROBINSON CRUSOB. 855 

and then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them 
in his tongue, though they knew, not one word of what he said. How- 
erer, at last they took him in, again, and then he began to be more tract- 
able. In time our men taught him some EngUsh, and he told us that 
tfaey were going with their kings to fight a great battle* "When he said 
kings, we asked him how many kings ? He said, '' There were five 
nation, and that they all joined to go against two nation/' We asked 
him, ** What made them come up to us ?" He said, '' To makee te great 
wonder look." Where it is to be observed, that all those natives, as also 
those of AMca, when they learn English, they also add two 0's at the 
end of the words where we use one, and place the accent upon the last of 
them — as makee^ takee, and the like ; and we could not break them off it, — 
nay, I could hardly make Eriday leave it off, though at last he did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last leave 
of him — poor honest Eriday ! We buried him with all decency and 
solemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin,- and throwing hiia into 
the sea ^ and I caused them to fire eleven guns for him : and so ended the 
life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most affectionate servant 
that ever man had. 

We now went away with a fair wind for Brazil, and, in about twelve 
days' time, we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of the line, 
being the north-eastermost land of all that part of America. We kept on 
south-by 'Cast, in sight of the shore, four days, when we made the Cape 
St Augustine, and in three days came to an anchor off the bay. of All 
Saints, the old place of my deliverance, from whence came both my good 
and evil fate. 

It was with great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least 
correspondence on shore. Kot my partner himself, who was alive, and 
mada a great figure among them, not my two merchant trustees, nor the 
fieune of my wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain me th|it 
favour; but my partner, remembering that I had given five hundred 
moidoKs to the prior of the monastery of the Augustines, and three 
hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, and obliged 
the prior that then was to go to the governor and beg leava for me 
presently, with' the captain, and one more, besides eight seamen,, to come 
on shore, and no more, — and this upon condition absolutely capitulated 
for, that we should not offer to land any goods, out of the ship,^or to carry 
any person away without licence. 



356 ADVBNTURBS Of 

They were so strict with us as to landing any goods, that it was with 
extreme difficnlty that I got on shore three hales of English goods, such 
as fine hroad-cloths, staffs, and some linen, which I had hronght for a 
present to my partner. He was a very generous, hroad-hearted nun, 
though, like me, he came from little at first ; and though he knew not 
that I had the least design of giving him any thing, he sent me on board 
a present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth ahove thirty 
moidores, including some tohacco, and three or four fine medals in goli 
But I was even with him in my present, which, as I have said, consiBted 
of fine hroad-cloths, English stuffis, lace, and fine Hollands. Also, 1 
delivered him ahout the value of one hundred pounds sterling, in the 
same goods, for other uses ; and I ohliged him to set up the sloop which 
I had hrought with me from England, as I have said, for the use of my 
colony, in order to send the refreshments I intended to my plantation. 

Accordingly he got hands and finished the sloop in a very few days, 
for she was already framed ; and I gave the master of her such instmc- 
tions as he could not miss the place ; nor did he miss it, as I had an 
account from my partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with the 
small cargo I had sent them ; and one of our seamen, that had been on 
idiore with me there, offered to go with the sloop, and settle there, upon 
my letter to the governor Spaniard to allot him a sufficient quantity of 
land for a plantation, and giving him some clothes, and tools for his 
planting work, which he said he understood, having been an old planter 
in Maryland, and a buccaneer into the bargain. I encouraged the fellow 
by gnbiting all he desired ; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage 
whom we had taken prisoner of war to be his slave, and ordered the 
governor Spaniard to give him his share of every thing he wanted, with 
the rest. 

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me there was 
a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who 
had fisdlen into the displeasure of the church, and had heen obliged to 
conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition ; that he would be very glad of 
such an opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and two daughters; 
and if I would let them go to the island, and allot them a plantation, 
he would give them a small stock to begin with, — ^for the officers of the 
Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate. I granted this presentlj, 
and joined my Englishman with them ; and we concealed the man and 
his wife and daughters on hoard our ship tiU the sloop put out to go to 



ROBINSON ORUBOB. 357 

lea ; and then (having pnt all their goods on board some time before), 
we put them on board the sloop after she was got out of the bay. 

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner ; and their 
stock, indeed, was much alike rich in tools and in preparations for a farm : 
bnt nothing to begin with, but as aboye. However, they carried over 
with them (which was worth all the rest) some materials for planting 
Bngar-canes, with some plants of canes, which he (I mean the Portugal 
man) understood very well. Among the rest of the supplies for my 
tenants in the island, I sent them, by this sloop, three milch cows and 
five calves, about twenty-two hogs among them, three sows big with pig, 
and two mares and a horse. 

For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged three Portugal 
women to go ; and recommended it to them to marry them, and use them 
kindly. I could have procured more women, but I remembered that the 
poor persecuted man had two daughters, and there were but five of the 
Spaniards that wanted; the rest had wives of their own, though in 
another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, very 
welcomed to my old inhabitants, who were now. (with this addition) be- 
tween sixty and seventy people, besides little children, of which there 
were a great many. I found letters at London from them all, by way of 
Lisbon, when I came back to England, being sent back to the Brazils by 
this sloop. 

I have now done with my iidand, and all manner oi discourse about it ; 
and whoever reads the rest of my memorandnms, would do well to turn 
his thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read only of the follies of an 
old man, not warned by his own harms, much less by those of other men, 
to beware of the like ; not cooled by almost forty years' misery and dis- 
appointments ; not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectations; not 
made cautious by affliction and distress beyond imitation. 

I had no more business to go to the East Indies, than a man at fall 
Liberty, and having committed no crime, has to go to the turnkey at 
Newgate, and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there, and 
starve him. Had I taken a small vessel from England, and gone directly 
to the island — had I loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the 
necessaries for the plantation, and for my peoples-took a patent for the 
government there, to have secured my property, in subjection only to that 
of England, which, to be sure,J[ might have obtained, — ^had I done this. 



858 ADYBNTUBBB OF 

and staid there myself, I had at least acted like a man of common sense : 
hut I was possessed with a wandering spirit, scorned all advantages, 
pleased myself with heing the patron of these people I had placed there, 
and doing for them in a kind of haughty, majestic way, like an old 
patriarchal monarch. But I neyer so much as pretended to plant in the 
name of any government or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to 
C4ill my people suhjects to any one nation more than another, — nay, I 
never so much as gave the place -a name, hut left it as I found it, helong- 
ing to no man, and tiie people under no discipline or government hut my 
own. I ramhled from them and cameHihither no more : the last letters I 
had from any of them were hy my partner's means, who sent me word, 
though I had not the letter till five years after it was written, that thej 
went on hut poorly, were malcontent with their long stay there — that 
Will Atkins was dead — that five of the Spaniards were come away — and 
that they hegged of him to write to me to think of the promise I had 
made to fetch them away, that they might see their own country again 
before they died. 

But I was gone a wild-goose chase, indeed, and they who will haye 
any more of me, must be content to follow me through a new vLiety of 
follies, hardships, and wfld adventures. 

But it is no time now to enlarge any farther upon the reason or 
absurdity of my own conduct. I was embarked for the voyage, and the 
voyage I went. I shall only add here, that my honest and truly pious 
clergyman left me here : a ship being ready to go to Lisbon, he asked me 
leave to go thither ; being still, as he observed, bound never to finish any 
voyage he began. Had I gone with him, I had never had so many things 
to be thankful for, and you had never heard of the second part of the 
Travels and Adventures of Eobinson Crusoe ; so I mtst leave here the 
fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on with my voyage. 

From the Brazils, we made directly away over the Atlantic Sea to the 
Cape of Gk>od Hope, and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally 
south-east ; now and then a storm, and some contrary winds. But my 
disasters at sea were at an end — ^my ftiture rubs and cross events were to 
befal me on Elhore. We made no stay at t^e Cape longer than was 
need5il to take in fresh water, but made the best of our way for the coast 
of Coromandel. We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where we 
fared very well with them a while. It happened one evening when we 
went on shore, that a greater number oi^their people came down than 



ROBINSON CRUBOB. 359 

imal, but all was very friendly and civil, and all was quiet ;. and we 
oade us a little tent, or hut, of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all 
hat night. I was not so well satisfied'to lie on shore as the rest ; and the 
x)at lying at an anchor about a stone's cast fh)m the land, with two men 
n her to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore, and, getting 
tome boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread the sail on the 
)ottom of the boat, and lay on board, under the cover of the branches of 
the trees, all night. About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of 
)ur men make a terrible noise on the shore, calling out for Ood's sake to 
)ring the boat in, and come and. help them, for they were all like to be 
nurdered ; at the same time I heard the firing of five muskets, which was 
;he number of the guns they had, and that three times over. Bousing 
immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be thrust in, 
md resolved, with three fiisils we had on board, to land and assist our 
nen. Our men were but nine in all, and only five had fusils ; the rest, 
indeed, had pistols and swords, but they were of small use to them. We 
book up seven of our men, three of them being very ill wounded ; and 
while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as much 
ianger as they were in on shore; for the people poured their arrows in 
apon us so thick, that we were fain to barricade the side of the boat 
ap with the benches, and two or three loose boards which we had in 
the boat. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our anchor, 
or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the boat, and they 
were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot. 
We made signals of distress to the ship, and my nephew, the captain, 
hearing our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and 
that we fired towards the shore, pretty well understood us ; and, weighing 
anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship, 
and then sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us. One of the 
men, taking the end of a tow line in his hand, swam on board us, and made 
the line fast to the boat, upon which we slipt our little cable, and, leaving 
our anchor behind, they towed us out of the reach of the arrows. As 
soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore, that she could 
lay her side to the shore, we ran along just by them, and we poured in a 
broadsido among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets, 
and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a terrible havock 
among them. 



360 ADYBNTURBB OF 

When we were got on board, our supercargo, who had been often in 
those parts, said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched ns 
if we had not done something to ptoYoke them to it. At length it came 
out, namely, that an old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had 
brought it within our poles, with a young woman with her, who also 
brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old woman was selling us the 
milk, one of our men offered some rudeness to the girl that was with her, 
at which the old woman made a great noise. Howeyer, the seaman would 
not quit his prize, but carried her out of the old woman's sight among the 
trees, it being almost dark. The old woman went away without her, and, 
as we suppose, made an outcry among the people she came from, — who, 
upon notice, raised this great army upon us in three or four hours ; and it 
was great odds but we had been all destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was thrown at him just 
at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent we had made ; 
the rest came off free, all but the fellow who was the occasion of all the 
mischief, who paid dear enough for his black mistress. We could not 
hear what became of him a great while : we lay upon the shore two days 
after, though the wind presented, and made signals for him ; made our 
boat sail up shore and down shore seyeral leagues, but in yain. 

I could not satisfy myself, howeyer, without yenturing on shore once 
more. It was the third night after the action, that I had a great mind to 
learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we had done, and how the 
game stood on the Indian side. We took with us twenty stout fellows ts I 
any in the ship, besides the supercargo, and myself ; and we landed two 
hours before midnight, at the same place where the Indians stood drawn 
up the eyening before. We diyided our men into two companies, and we 
marched up, one body at a distance from the other, to the field of batde. 
At first we could see nothing, it being yery dark ; but by-and-bye oar 
boatswain, that led the first party, stumbled and fell oyer a dead body. 
Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, and then we could 
easily discern the hayoc we had made among them. We told two-and- 
thirty bodies upon the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. When 
we had made, as I thought, a full discoyery of all we could come at the 
knowledge of, I was for going on board again ; but the boatswain and hii 
party sent me word, that they were resolyed to make a yisit to the 
Indian town, where it might be they might find Thomas Jeffrys there— 
that was the man's name we had lost. So away they went, and though 



ROBINBON CRUBOB. 361 

the attempt was desperate, and such as none but madmen would haye 
gone about, yet, to giye them their due, they went about it warily as well 
as boldly. Their chief design was plunder ; but a circumstance, which 
none of them were aware of, set them on fire with reyenge. When they 
came to the few Indian houses, which they thought had been the town, 
they. were under a great disappointment ; for there were not aboye twelye 
or thirteen houses. Howeyer, they resolyed to leaye those houses, and 
look for the town as well as they could. They went on a little way, and 
found a cow tied to a tree, and they untied her, and the cow went 
on before them directly to the town, which consisted of aboye two hun- 
dred houses, or huts. Here they found all profoundly secure as sleep and 
a country that had neyer seen an enemy of that kind could make them. 
Upon this, they resolyed to diyide themselyes into three bodies, and to set 
three houses on fire in three parts of the town, and as the men came out^ 
to seize them and bind them. While they were animating one another ta 
the work, three of them that were a little before the rest, called out aloud, 
and told them they had found Thomas Jeffiys ; they all ran up to the 
place, and so it was indeed, for there they found the poor fellow hanged 
up naked by one arm, and his throat cut. There was an Indian house 
just by the tree, where they found sixteen or seyenteen of the principal 
Indians. The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, that 
they swore to one another they would be leyenged, and to work they 
went immediately. In a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in 
four or fiye places, and as soon as the ^le began to blaze, the poor frighted 
creatures began to rush out to saye their liyes, but met with their fate in 
the attempt. 

My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men, seeing such 
a fire, was yery uneasy, not knowing what the matter was. A thousand 
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the supercargo, what 
should become of us ; and at last he takes another boat, and with thirteen 
men and himself, comes on shore to me. He was surprised to see me and 
the supercargo in the boat with no more than two men, and he was 
impatient to know what was doing, for the noise continued, and the flame 
increased. In a word, the captain told me he would go and help his men, 
let what would come, and so away went he. Not was I any more able to 
stay behind ; so, in short, the captain ordered two men to row back the 
pinnace, and fetch twelye men more from the ship, leaying the long boat 
at an anchor ; and that when they came back, six men should keep the 



362 ADYBNTURB8 OT 

two boats, and siz more come after ub, so that lie left only eixteen men in 
the ship. 

Being now on the march, we felt little of the ground we trod on ; and, 
being guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to the place 
of the flame. If the noise of the gons was surprising to us before, the 
cries of the poor people were now quite of another nature, and filled us 
with horror. However, we weilt on, and at length came to the town, 
though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The first 
object that we met with was the ruins of a hut, or house ; and just before 
it, lay four men and three women killed^ and, as we thought, one or two 
more lay in the heap among the fire. In short, these were euch instances 
of a rage altogether barbarous, and of a fiiry something beyond what was 
human, that we thought it imx>ossible our men could be gmky of it But 
this was not all ; we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry went on 
just as the fire went on, so that we wece in the utmost confusion. We 
adyanced a little way farther, and beheld, to our astonishment, three 
women naked, crying in a most dreadM manner, and flying as if they had 
indeed liad wings, and after them sixteen or seyenteen men, natiyes, in 
the same terror and consteination, with three of our English butchers-' 
for I can call them no better — ^in the rear, who, when they could oyertake 
.them, fired in among them and one that was killed by their shot feU down 
in our sigh^. When the rest saw us, belieying us to be their enemies, and 
that we woidd murder them as well as those that pursued them, they set 
up a most dreadful shriek, especially the women, and two of them fell 
down, as if abeady dead, with the fright. 

My yery soul shrank within me, and my blood ran chill in my yeins, 
when I saw this ; and I believe had the three English sailors that pursued 
them come on, I had made our men kill them all. However, we took 
some ways to let the poor fiying creatures know that we would not hurt 
them, and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with their 
hands lifted up, made piteous lamentations to us to save them, which we 
let them know we would do : whereupon they kept all together in a 
huddle close behind us for protection. I left my men drawn up together- 
charging them to hurt nobody, but if possible to get at some of our people 
and see what devil it was possessed them, and what they intended to do ; 
and, in a word, to command them ofl* — and went among those flying people, 
taking only two of our men with me. And there was indeed a piteona 
spectacle among them : some of them had their feet terribly burnt with

trampling and ronning througli the fire, others their hands burnt ; one of 
the women had fallen down in the fire, and was almost bnmt to death 
before she could get out again ; two or three of the men had cuts in their 
Wks and thighs, from our men pursuing, and another was shot through 
the body, and died while I was there. 

I would fain have learnt what the occasion of all this was, but I could 

not understand one word they said, though by signs I perceiyed that some 

of them knew not what was the occasion themselves. I went back to my 

own men : I told them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me ; 

^hen, in the very moment, came four of our men, with the boatswain at 

their head, covered with blood and dust, when our men hallooed to them 

^ loud as they could halloo, and with much ado one of them made them 

hear. As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo, like a shout of 

triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come. '' Captain," says he, 

'^ noble captain, I am glad you are come ; we have not half done yet ! 

Villains ! hell-hound dogs ! I will kill as many of them as poor Tom has 

^airs upon his head. We have sworn to spare none of them ; we will root 

^nt the very name of them from the earth." Eaising my voice, that 

I might silence him a little, '^ Barbarous dog!" said f, ''what are you 

4oing ? I won't have one creature touched more upon pain of death. I 

charge you upon your life to stop yeur hands, and stand still here, or you 

^i« a dead man this minute." 

" "Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you do, or what they have 
done ? If you want a reason for what we have done, come hither ;" and 
^th that he showed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree with his 
throat cut. 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time should have 
been forward enough ; but I thought *they had carried their rage too far, 
and thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, '' Cursed be 
their anger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, for it was cruel." But I 
had now a new task upon my hands-; for when the men I carried with 
me saw the sight as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain them as 
I should have had with the others ; nay, my nephew himself fell in with 
them, and told me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for fear 
of the men being overpowered. Upon these words away ran eight of my 
men with the boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody work ; 
and I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came away pen* 
sivo and sad, for I could not bear the sight. 



364 ADYXNTUBBS OF 

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two mdi, 
and with these I walked back to the boats. Immediately I took the 
pinnace and went aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in what 
might happen. By the time the men got to the shore again with the 
pinnace, our men began to appear ; they came dropping in some and some, 
not in two bodies, and in form, as they went out, but all in heaps, strag- 
gling here and there in such a manner that a small force of resolute men 
might have cut them all off. But the dread of them was upon the whole 
country. The people were amazed and surprised, and so Mghted, that I 
believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but Ave of our 
men. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and indeed with all 
the men, in my mind, but with him in particular, as prompting rather 
than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. 
The next day we set sail. I always, after that trme, told our men God 
would blast the voyage, for I looked upon the blood they shed that night 
to be murder in them. The boatswain defended this quarrel when we 
were afterwards on board. He said it was true that we seemed to break 
the truce, but really had not, and that the war was begun the night 
before by the natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed one of 
our men without any just provocation ; so that, as we were in a capacity 
to fight them, we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon 
them in an extraordinary manner. 

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and from thence to the 
coast of Coramandel, only to touch at Surat ; but the chief of the super- 
cargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal. The first disaster that befel us 
was in the Gulf of Persia, where five of our men, venturing on shore on 
the Arabian side of the Gulf, were surrounded by the Arabs, and either 
all killed or carried away into slavery. I began to upbraid them with 
the just retribution of Heaven in this case ; but the boatswain very 
warmly told me he thought I went fEirther in my censures than I could 
show any warrant for in Scripture, and referred to the tiiirteenth of St. 
Luke, verse 4th, where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom 
the tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Gralileans : but 
that which indeed put mo to silence in this case was, that none of these 
five men, who were now lost, were of the number of those who went on 
shore to the massacre of Madagascar. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse conse- 



ROBINSON CRUBOE. 365 

qnences than I expected ; and the boatswam, who had been the head of 
the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me that, unless 
I would resolve to have done with it, and also not to concern myself 
farther with him, or any of his affairs, he would leave the ship, for he did 
not think it was safe to sail with me among them. 

I told him that I did confess I had all along opposed the massacre of 
Madagascar, for such I would always call it ; and that I was a consider- 
able owner of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had a right to 
8peak, even farther than I had yet done, and would not be accountable to 
him or any one else. He made but little reply to me at, that time, and I 
thought that affair had been over. We were at this time in the road to 
Bengal; and being willing to see the place, I went on shore with the 
supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself ; and towards evening was 
preparing to go om board, when one of the men came to me, and told me 
he would not have me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they 
had orders not to cany me on board. I immediately went and found out 
the supercargo, and told him the story, and entreated him to go imme- 
diately on board the ship in an Indian boat and acquaint the captain of 
it. But I might have spared this intelligence, for before I had spoken to 
him on shore, the matter was effected on board : the boatswain, the 
gunner, the carpenter, and, in a word, all the inferior officers, as soon as I 
was gone off in the boat, came up to the quarter deck and desired to 
speak with the captain ; and there the boatswain, making a long harangue, 
told the captain in a few words that, as I was now gone peaceably on 
shore, they were loath to use any violence with me, — which, if I had not 
gone on shore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have 
gone. They therefore thought fit to tell him that, as they shipped them- 
eelves to serve in the ship under his command, they would perform it 
faithfully ; but, if I would not quit the ship, or the captain obligef me to 
quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no farther with him. 

When my nephew, the captain, who came to me on shore, told me this, 
I said he should not be concerned at all, for I would stay on shorej I 
only desired he would send me all my necessary things on shore, and leave 
me a sufficient sum of money, and I would find my way to England as 
well as I could. So the matter was over in a very few hours ; the men 
returned to their duty, and I began to consider what course I should steer.

CHAPTER XXIII. 

At Bengal, Onaoe meets with an Bngliah merchant, with whom he enten into partsenhip, vd

—Winters in Siberia— Sails fh>m Archangel to Hamburg— Aniyes in England, after an absence of 
nearly eleyen years, and determines to wander no more. 

WAS now alone in the remotest part of the world, for I was 
near three thousand leagues, by sea, farther off from England 
than I was at my island ; only, it is true, I might travel here, 
by land, over the Great Mogul's country to Surat; might go 
from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and from thence 
might take the way of the carayans, over the deserts of Arabia- to Aleppo 
and Scanderoon, and from thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland 
into France. I had another way before me, which was to wait for some 
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the island of 
Sumatra, and get passage on board them for England. 

Here I. had the particular pleasure, speaking by contrarieties, to see 
the Bl^p set sail without me — a treatment, I think, a man in my circum- 
stances scarce eyer met with, . except from pirates running away with the 
ship, and setting those that would not agree with their viUany on shore. 
Howeyer, my nephew left nue two servants, or rather, one companion and 
one servant : the first was clerk to the purser, whom he engaged to go 
with me ; and. the other was his own servant. I took me also a good 
lodging in the house of an English woman, where several merchants 
lodged, some French, two Italians,, or rather Jews, and one "RngliaKman. 
After a long stay here, the English merchant, who lodged with me, and 
with whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance, came to me one

morning. '^ Countryman," says he, ** I haye a project to commnnicate 
to you, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for au^t I know, suit 
with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it. 

If you will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will 
hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds. You shall be captain, 
m be merchant, and we will go a trading yoyage to China ; for what 
should we stand still for? The whole world is in motion; all the 
cueatures of God, heayenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent : why 
should we be idle ? There are no drones," says he, '^ Hying in the world 
bat men : why should we be of that number ?" I^^ed this proposal 
Tery well ; and the moie because it seemed to be expressed with so much 
good- will, and in so friendly a manner. It was, howeyer, some time 
before we could get a ship to our mind ; and, when we got a yessel, it was 
not easy to. get English sailors. Howeyer, after some time we got a mate, 
a boatswain, and a gunner, English ; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portu- 
guese foremastmen: with these we found we could do well enough, 
haying Indian^ seamen, such as they are^ to make up. 

We made the yoyage to Achin, in the island of Sumatra, first ; and 
from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares for opium, 
and some for arrack, — ^the first a commodity which bears a great price 
among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was yery much wanted there. 
In a word, we went up to Susham, made a yery great yoyage, were eight 
months out,, and returned to Bengal. I got so much money by the first 
adyenture, and such an insight into the method of getting more, that,, had 
I been twenty years younger, I should haye been tempted to haye staid 
here, and sought no farther for making my fortune ; but what was all this 
to a man on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich enough, and came 
abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a 
coyetous desire of getting on in it ? I was come into a part of the world 
which I neyer was in before — and that part, in particular, which. I had 
heard much of — and was resolyed to see as much of it. as I could. 

But my feUow-trayeUer and. I had difierent notions.. My new Mend 
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would, haye been content to 
haye gone, like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn,, backward and 
forward, proyided he could, as he called it, find his account in it : on the 
other hand, mine, as old as I was, was the notion of a mad rambling boy, 
that neyer cares to see a thing twice oyer. But this was not all. I had 
a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer homey and yet the most 



868 ADYBNTURBS Of 

unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go. In the inteiral of 
these consnltations, my Mend, who was always on the search for bnsmess, 
proposed another vayage to me, namely, among the Spice Islands ; and to 
bring home a load of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts. We were 
not long in preparing for this voyage, which we made very sncoessfnllj, 
touching at Borneo, and several islands whose names I do not remember, 
and came home in about five months. We sold our spice, which was 
chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs, to the Persian merchants, who carried 
them away for, the Gulf ; and, making near five of one, we really got a 
great deal of money. 

A little while after this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia ; she 
was a coaster, and of about two hundred tons burden : the men, as thej 
pretended, having been so sickly that the captain had not men enough to 
go to sea, he lay by at Bengal, and gave public notice that he would sell 
his ship. This came to my ears before my new partner heard of it ; and 1 
had a great mind to buy it. So I went home to him, and told him of it: 
he considered a while, for he was no rash man neither ; but, musing some 
time, he replied, •* She is a little too big ; but, however, we will have 
her." Accordingly, we bought tha ship, and took possession ; wh^ ve 
had done so, we resolved, to entertain the men, if we could, to join them 
with those we had, for the pursuing our business; but, on a sudden — thej 
not having received their wages, but their share of the money, as we after- 
wards learnt — ^not one of them was to be found. A few days after, I came 
to know what sort of fellows they were ; for, in short, their history was 
— ^that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not the com- 
mander ; they had been a trading voyage, in which they were attacked on 
shore by some of the Malaccans, who had killed the captain and three of 
his men ; and, after the captain was killed, these men had run away with 
the ship, and had brought her in at the Bay of Bengal, leaving the mate 
and five men more on shore. 

We picked up some En^ish seamen here after this, and some Dotch, 
and we now resolved for a second voyage for cloves, etc., among the 
Philippine and Molucca isles ; and, in short, I spent, frtym first to last, six 
years in this country, trading from port to port, backward and forward, 
and with very good success ; and was now, the last year, with my partno*, 
going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to China, but HAmgnfiig 
first to go to Siam, to buy rice. In this voyage, being by contrary winds 
obliged to beat up and down a great whil« in the straits of Malacca, and 



B0BIN80N CRUBOB. 869 

among the islands, we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas, but 
we found our ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able to find out 
where it was. This forced us to make for some port ; and my partner, 
who knew the country better than I did, directed the captain to put into 
the river of Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr. 
Thomson, captain, not being willing to take the charge of the ship upon 
myselfl 

While we were here, and going often on shore for refreshment, there 
comes to me one day an Englishman, who was, it seems, a gunner's mate 
on board an English East India ship, which rode in the same river. 
" Sir," says he, '^ I have something to teU you that very nearly concerns 
you." — " If it very neaily concerns me," said ly " and not yourself, what 
moves you to tell it me ?" — " I am- moved," said he, ''•by the inmiinent 
danger you are in ; and for aught I see, you have no knowledge of it."— - 
'^I know no danger I am in," said I, '' but that ULy ship is leaky, and I 
cannot find it out ; but I propose to lay her aground to-morsow, to see if 
I can find it." — " But, sir," says he, " leaky or not leaky, find it op not 
find it, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, when 
70U hear what I have to say to you. Tha town of Cambodia lies about 
fifteen leagues up this river, and there are two large English ships about 
fire leagues on this side, and three Dutch ?" — " Well," said I, " and what 
is that to me?" — "Well, sirj" says he, "if you do not put to sea im- 
mediately, you will be attacked by five longboats full of men ; and, 
perhapsj if you are taken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and the 
particulars bo' examined into afterwards. I suppose you know well 
enough that you were with thi& ship at Sumatra ; that there your cap- 
tain was murdered by the Malaccans, with three of his men ; and that you, 
or some of those* that were on board with you, ran away with the ship, 
and are since turned fhultss. This is the sum of the story, and you will 
all be seized as pirates, and executed with very little ceremony, if 'they 
get you in their power. K you have any regard for your life, and the 
lives of all your men, put out to sea, without fail, at high water." — 
"Well," said I, "you have been very kind in this: what shall 1 do 
for you to make you amends?" — "Sir," says he, "I have nineteen 
months' pay due to me on board the ship y. which I came out 

of England in, and the Dutchman that is with me has seven months' 
pay due to him ; if you will make good our pay to us, we will go along 
with you ; if you find nothing more in it, we wiLL desire no more ; but if 

24 



870 ADYBNTUBBS OF 

we do conyince yon that we have saved your life, and the ahip, and the 
lires of all the men in her, we will leave the rest to you.'' 

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and the 
two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side, my partner, wbo 
was on board, came on the quarter-deck, and called to me with a great 
deal of joy, " ho ! ho ! we hare stopped the leak I" — " Say yon bo? ' 
said I ; '^ thank Ood ; but weigh the anchor, then, immediately.'' He 
was surprised ; but called the captain, and he inmiediately ordered the 
anchor to be got up, and we stood out to sea : then I called him into the 
cabin, and told him the story at large. Presently a seaman comes to the 
cabin door, and calls out to us that the captain bade him tell us we irere 
chased. " Chased !" said I, " by whom, and by what ?"— " By five sloops, 
or boats," said the fellow, ''full of men." We made ready for fight, but 
all this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see five laige 
longboats, following us, with all the sail they could make. Two of these 
boats, which we could see were English, had outsailed the rest, and gained 
upon us considerably ; upon which we fired a gun without a shot, and we 
put out a flag of truce as a signal for parley, but they kept crowding after 
us till they came within shot. Upon this we took in our white flag, they 
having made no answer to it, hung out the red flag, and fired at thm 
with shot. It was all one : they crowded after us, and endeavoured to 
come under our stem, so to board us on our quarter; upon which 1 
ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside, when 
immediately we fired five guns at them— one of which carried away the 
stem of the hindermost boat. While this was doing, one of the three boats 
that was behind made up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve 
her, and we could afterwards see her take out the men : we called again 
to the foremost boat, but she crowded dose undar our stem. Upon 
this our gunner ran out his two chase guns, and fired at her ; then we 
wecCred the ship again, and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and, 
firing three guns more, we found the boat was split almost to pieces. 
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace, with orders to pick np 
some of the men. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, and took 
up three men, one of whom was drowning. As soon as they were on board, 
we crowded all the sail we could, and the boats gave over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a danger, I took care that we should change 
our course, and not let any one imagine whither we were going : so we 
stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European ships. 



I 



ROBINSON OBUBOB. 371 

We now began to consult with the two seamen, and inquire what the 

meaning of all this shouM be ? The Dutchman told us that the fellow 

that sold UB the ship, as we said, was no more than a thief that had 

nm away with her ; that the captain was treacherously murdered by the 

natives on the coast of Malacca, with three of his men ; and that he, this 

Datchman, and four more, got into the woods, where they wandered 

about, till at length he made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch 

ship. He then told us that he went to Batayia, where two of the 

seamen belonging to the ship had arrived, having deserted the rest in 

their travels, and gave an account that the fellow who had run away 

with the ship sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, which were gone 

a-cmising in her. 

It was my partner's opinion that we should go directly back to Bengal, 
from whence we came, because there we could give an account of our- 
selves, and could prove where we were when the ship put in, whom we 
bought hir of, and the like. I was some time of that opinion ; but, after 
a little more serious thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great 
hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal, for we should be sure to be 
waylaid. 

This danger a little startled my partner, and we immediately resolved 
to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to CShina. After a tedious 
and irregular course, we came within sight of the coast of Cochin China, 
and resolved to put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough 
of water for us. This happy step was our deliverance ; tot the next morn- 
ing there came into the Bay of Tonquin two Dutch diips ; and a third 
without any colours spread out, but which we believed to be a Dutch- 
man, passed by at two leagues' distance, steering for the coast of China ; 
and in the afternoon went by two Rng^ish ships, steering the same 
course. The place we were in was wild and barbarous, the people 
thieves, even by occupation or profession. 

I have observed above that our ship sprang a leak at sea, and that it 
was stopped unexpectedly ; yet, as we did npt find the ship so perfectly 
tig^t and sound as we desired, we resolved, while we were in this place, 
to lay her on shore, if possible, to find out where the leaks were. Ac- 
cordingly, having lightened the ship, we tried to bring her down, that we 
might come at her bottom. The inhabitants came wondering down to 
the shore to look at us ; and not seeing our men, who were at work 
on her bottom with stages, and with their boats on the off side, they 




preaently concluded that the ship iras cast away. On this euppoaitioii, 
they came all about us, with ten or twelve Urge boats, intending, 
no doubt, to plunder the ship. I caUed to the men who worked npcm 
the stages to get up the dde into the ship, and bade those in the 
boat to row round and come on board ; but, before they could do u the; 
were ordered, the Cochin -Cbineae were upon them, and boarded our long- 



BOBINBON CRUBOB. 373 

boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners. The first man 
they laid hold of was an English seaman, a stout, strong fellow, who, 
haying a musket in his hand, never offered to fire it, but laid it down in 
the boat, like a fool, as I thought. But he understood his business better 
than I could teach him ; for he grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by 
main force out of their own boat into ours, where, taking him by the two 
ears, he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that the fellow died 
instantly in his hands ; and, in the meantime, a Dutchman, who stood 
next, took up the musket, and, with the butt-end of it, so laid about 
him, that he knocked down five who attempted to enter the boat. But 
this was little towards resisting thirty or forty men. An accident, how- 
erer, gave our men a complete victory. Our carpenter, being prepared to 
grave the outside of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he 
caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the 
boat — one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and 
oil ; and the man that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his 
hand : two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where the fellow 
stood, and he immediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff 
boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded them, being half naked, that they 
roared out like two bulls, and, enraged with the fire, leaped both into the 
sea. The carpenter saw it, and, stepping forward himself, takes one of 
their mops, and dipping it in the pitch-poi, he and his man threw it 
among them so plentifully, that, of all the men in three boats, there was 
not one that was not scalded and burnt with it, and made such a howling 
and crying that I never heard a worse noise, and, indeed, nothing like 
it. All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who managed the 
rest of the men on board, had,- with great dexterity, brought the ship 
almost to rights ; and, having got the guns into their places again, the 
gunner called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let 
fly among them. I bade him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do 
the work without him ; but bade him heat another pitch-kettle, which 
our cook, who was on board, took care of. But the enemy was so terrified 
with what they met with in their first attack, that they would not come 
on again ; and some of them that were farthest off, seeing the ship swim, 
as it were, upright, began, as we supposed, to see their mistake, and gave 
over the enterprise, finding it was not as they expected. The next day, 
having finished our work within board, and finding our ship was perfectly 
healed of all her leaks, we set saiL We kept on north-east, as if wc 



374 ABYSNTUBBB 07 

would go to the Manillas or the Philippine lalanda, anid this we did that 
we might not &11 into the way of any European ships; and then we 
steered north again, till we came to the latitude of twenty-two d^iees 
twenty minutes, by which means we made the island of Pormoeo directlj, 
where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and fresh prorisions. 
Prom hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an equal 
distance, till we knew we were beyond all the pcnrts of China where onr 
European ships usually oome. Being now come to the latitude of thiity 
degrees, we resolved to put into the first trading port we should come at; 
and, standing in for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us, with an 
old Portuguese pilot on board, who came to offer his services, which, 
indeed, we were very glad of, and took him on board. 

I had conversation with the pilot, who, it seems, knew the whole 
story of the attack of the Dutchman, and I tdd him it was our ship they 
followed and attacked, believing us to be pirates. Learning from him 
after we came to anchor at the south-west point of the great Gulf of 
Nanquin, whither I had pressed him to carry us, that the two Dutch 
ships had gone to Nanquin, I asked the old pilot if there was no 
creek or harbour which I might put into, and pursue my business with 
the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. He \M 
me, if I would sail to the southward about two-and-forty leagues, there 
was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission 
usually landed from Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian idi- 
gion to the Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in. 

We all agreed to go back to this place, and we weighed the next day» 
having only gone twice on shore, where we were to get fresh water. 'We 
came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till five days ; hot 
it was very much to our satisfaction, and I was joyfcd, and I may say 
thankful, when I set my foot safe on shore, resolving, and my partner too, 
that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and effects any other way 
though not every way to our satisfaction, we would never set foot on 
board that unhappy vessel again. When we came on shore, the old pilot, 
who was now our friend, got us a lodging, and a warehouse for our goods. 
Besides this, he brought us acquainted with three missionary Bomish 
priests, who were in the town, and who had been there some time, con- 
verting the people to Christianity. One of these was a Frenchman, whom 
they called Pather Simon; he was a jolly, well-conditionod man, very 
free in his conversation, not seeming so serious and grave as the other two 



B0BIX80N CBU80B. 375 

did, one of whom was a Portagaese, and the other a Genoese. This 
French priest was appointed, it seems, hy order of the chief of the mis- 
sion, to go np to Pekin, the royal seat of the Chinese Emperor, ^nd waited 
only for another priest, who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to 
go along with him ; and we scarce ever met together bnt he was inviting 
me to go that journey with him, telling me, how he would show me all 
the glorious things of that mighty empire, and amongst the rest, the 
greatest city in the world. 

Dining with the missionary one day, I showed some little inclination 
to go with him ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with 
a great many persuasions, to consent. But we had our ship and our 
merchandise to dispose of. At length our prospects began to dear up a 
little. Our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who 
bought all our opium, and gave us a very good price for it. I proposed 
to him to deal with us for our ship also, and he consented to hire her to 
go to Japan, saying that on his return he would buy the ship. But after 
this, we, on the pzoposition of my partner, made over half the ship to the 
young man whom my nephew had left with me as a companion, and took 
a writing from him obliging him to account to us for the other half. So 
away he went to Japan. 

We were now on shore in China, destitute of all manner of prospect 
of return ! But in aibout four months' time there was to be another fair 
at that place where we were, and then we might possibly find some 
Chinese junks or vessels from Nanquin, that would be to be sold, and 
would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. Upon these hopes we 
resolved to continue here ; but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three 
joumies into the country. Eirst, we went ten days' journey to see the 
city of Nanquin — a city well worth seeing, indeed. I had also a mind 
to see the city of Pekin, which I had heard so much of, and Pather Simon 
importuned me daily to do it. At length his time of going away being 
set, it was necessary that we should resolve either to go, or not to go ; so 
I referred him to my partner, and left it wholly to his choice, who at 
length resolved it in the affirmative, and we prepared for our journey. 
We set out with very good advantage, as to finding the way ; for we got 
leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy, 
or principal magistrate. We were five-and-twenty days travelling to 
Pekin, through a country infinitely populous, but miserably cultivated : 
the husbandry, economy, and the way of living, all very miserable, though 



376 



ADVSNTCKSB or 



they boast so macli of the industry (tf the people. The pride of Ham 
people is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing bnt their poToty, 
which adds to that which I call their misery. 

My Mend, Father Simon, and I, used to be very merry upon tkte 
occanons, to see the beggarly pride of those people. For example, oomiiig 




by the house of a country gentleman, as Father Simon called him, aixtVt 
ten leagues off from the city of Nonquin, we had, first of all, tlie bononr 
to ride wi<h the mast«r of the bouse about two miles : the state he rode in 
was a perfect Don Quixotiem, being a mixture of pomp and porerty. 

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a scanunonch, 
or merryandrew, being a dirty calico, with all the tawdry trappings of a 
fool's cost, SKch as hanging sleeves, tafTety, and cuts and slashes almost on 
every side ; it covered a ricdi taffety vest, as greasy as a butcher, and 
which testified that his honour must needs be a most exquisite slorea. 



BOBINBON CBUBOB. 377 

Hii hoTBe was a poor, lean, starred, hobbling oreatnre, such ofl in Eng* 
lind might sell for about thirty or forty shillinga ; and he had two bIbtcb 
fallowed him on foot, to drive the poor creature along : he had a whip in 
Ui hand, and he belaboured the beast as faet about the head as his alarea 
did about the toil ; and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve ser- 
Tuits, and we were told he was going &om the city to his country seat^ 
■bout half a league before us. "We travelled on gently, but this figure of 
a gentleman rode away before us ; and as we stopped at a vUlage about an 




I, when wo came by the country seat of this great n 
we sawbim in a little place befoie his door, eating his repast ; it was a 
kind of garden, but he was easy to be seen, and we were given to 
■aaderatand that the more we looked on him the better he would be 



He eat under a tree, something like the palmetto tree, which effectually 
shaded him over the head, and on the south aide ; but under the tree also 
was placed a large nmbrella, which made that part look well enough ; he 
sat lolling back in a great elbow chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and 
his meat being brought him by two women slaves : he had two more, , 
whose office, I think, few gentlemen in Europe would accept of their ser- 
vice in, namely, one fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the 



378 AI>T1HTUES8 OF 

didi with one liand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his wocdup's 
heard and taffety Test, with the othor ; while the great tai hrate though 
it below him to employ his own hands in any of those familiar offices 
which kings and monarchs would rather do than be tronhled with the 
olnmsy fingers of their servants. 

I took this time to think what pain men's pride puts them to, and haw 
tronblesome a haughty temper, thus ill-managed, must be to a man of 
eonmion sense ; and, leaving the poor wretch to please himself with ooi 
looking at him, as if we admired his pomp, whereas we really pitied and 
contemned him, we pursued our journey to Pekin. 

At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me but the yonth 
whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as a servant, 
and who proved very trusty and diligent ; and my partner had nobody with 
him but one servant, who was a kiUBman. As for the Portuguese pilo^ 
he being desirous to see the court, we gave him his passage, that is to Bay 
bore his charges, for his company, and to use him as an interprete]>— for he 
understood the language of the country, and spoke good French sod a 
little English; and, indeed, this old man was a most usefhl implementto 
us every where ; for we had not been above a week at Pekin, wh^ he 
came laughiag^ and told us there was a great caravan of Muscovy and 
Polish merchants in the city, and that they were preparing to set <mt 
on their journey, by land, to ICusoovy, withjn four or five weeks. ¥e 
then went to consult together what was to be done, and I and my partner 
agreed, that, if our Portuguese pilot would go with us, we would bear 
his charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased. He received the 
proposal like a man transported, and told us he would go with us over 
the whole world. 

It was the beginning of Eebruary, our style, when we set out from 
Pekin. The company was very great, and, as near as I can remember, 
made between three and four hundred horses and camels, and upwards of 
a hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all events. 
We consisted of people of several nations, such as the Muscovites chiefly,^ 
for there were about sixty of them who were merchants or inhabitants of 
Moscow, though of them some were livonians ; and, to our particular 
satisfaction, five of them were Scots, who appeared also to be men of greet 
experience in business and very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were five 
in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the 



BOBINSON CBUSOB. 379 

poflsengen, except the Benrants, to a great ootmcil, as they termed it. At 
tluB great coimcil, every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a 
oommon stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage on the way, 
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides, 
getting horses, and the like. And here they constituted the journey, 
as they called it, namely, they named captains and officers to draw 
Us all up, and giye the command in case of an attack ; and gave every 
one their turn of command. In two days more we passed the great 
China wall, made for a fortification against the Tartars. And here I 
began to find the necessity of keeping together in a caravan, as we 
teivelled, for we saw several troops of Tartars roving about. Our 
leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a-hunting, as 
they call it : and what was this but hunting of sheep ! However, it 
may be called hunting too ; for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest 
of foot that ever I saw of their kind,— only they will not run a great way ; 
and you are sure of sport when you begin the chase, for they appear 
generally by thirty or forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep 
together when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet with about 
forty Tartars, who, as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of 
horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never heard before 
and, by the way, never care to hear again. We all supposed this was to 
call their Mends about them; and so it was, for in less than half a 
quarter of an hour, a troop of forty or fifty more appeared at about a 
mile distance ; but our work was over first, as it happened. 

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be amongst us ; 
and as soon as he heard the horn, he told us, in short, that we had nothing 
to do but to charge them immediately, without loss of time ; and, drawing 
us up in a line, he asked if we were resolved ? We told him we were 
ready to follow him ; so he rode directly up to them. They stood gazing 
at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order ; but, as soon as they saw 
us advance, they let fly their arrows, — which, however, missed us very 
happily : it seems they mistook not their aim, but their distance ; for their 
arrows all fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim, that had 
we been about twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men 
wounded, if not killed. Immediately we halted ; and, though it was at a 
great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, 
following our shot full gallop, resolving to fall in among them sword in 



380 ABYBNTUBSB 07 

hand — ^for so onr bold Scot that led us directed. As soon as we came up 
to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew ; but they fled 
in the greatest confusion imaginable. We had, however, this misfortone 
namely, that all our mutton that we had in chase got away. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore the 
Tartars were not so bold as afterwards ; but, in about five days, we 
entered a vast great wild desert, which held us three days' and nights' 
march. I asked our guides whose dominion this was in ? and they told 
me this was a kind of border that might be called No Man's Land, being 
part of the great Earakathy, or Grand Tartary, but that, howeyer, it was 
reckoned to China ; that there was no care taken here to preserve it from 
the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in 
the whole march, though we were to go over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at the first view very 
^ghtful to me, we saw two or three times little parties of the Tartars^ 
but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no design upon 
us ; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they had nothing to say to 
us, we had nothing to say to them : we let them go. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways being not so good as 
at first, though still in the dominions of the emperor of China, but lay, 
for the most part, in villages, — some of which were fortified, because of the 
incursions of the Tartars. 

We wanted about two days' journey of the fortified city of Naum, 
when messengers were sent express to every part of the road, to tell 
all travellers and caravans to halt, till they had a guard sent to them; 
for that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all, had 
appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the city. Accordingly, 
two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the 
Chinese on our left, and three hundred more from the city of Naum, and 
with those we advanced boldly. We were entered upon a desert of about 
fiifteen or sixteen miles over, when behold, by a cloud of dust they raised, 
we saw an enemy was at hand. The Tartars came on, and an innume- 
rable company they were. A party of them came on first, and when 
within gunshot, our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly 
and give them a salvo on each wing, which was done ; and, wheeling off 
to the left, they gave over the design. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naum, or Naumn. After 
this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful deserts, one of which 



B0BIN80N CRUBOB. 381 

we were sixteen days passing over ; and, on the Idth of April, we came- 
to the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions. As we entered into the 
Muscovite dominions, we were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar 
of Muscovy has taken to have cities and towns built in as many 
places as are possible to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison 
eomething like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the 
Temotest countries of their empire ; though wherever we came at these 
towns and stations, the garrisons and governor were Russians, and 
professed mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun, 
moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven: and were, of all the 
heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous, ex- 
cept only that they did not eat man's flesh, as our savages of America 
did. In a village near JKTertzinskay, I had the curiosity to go and 
see their way of living, whick is most brutish and insufferable : they 
had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day ; for there stood out upon an old 
stump of a tree an idol made of wood, Mghtful as any thing we can think 
of to represent the devil that can be made. It had a head certainly not 
so much as resembling any creature that the world ever saw— -ears as big 
as goats' horns, and as high—- eyes as big as a crown piece,, and a nose like 
a crooked ram's horn — and a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a 
lion, with horrible teeth,, hooked like a parrot's under bill. It» upper 
garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool outward; a great Tartar 
bonnet on the head, with two horns growing through it : it was about 
eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, or any other proportion of parts. 
This scarecrow was set up at the outside of the village ; and, when I came 
near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures lying flat on 
the ground round this formidable block of shapeless wood. A little 
way off from this monster, and at the door of a tent or hut, stood 
three butchers — I thought they were such ; for when I came nearer 
to them, I found they had long knives in their hands, and in the middle 
of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one young bullock or steer. 
But these, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol ; and the 
three men, priests belonging to it ; and the seventeen prostrated wretches 
were the people who brought the offering, and were making their prayers. 
I confess I was more moved at their stupidity, and this brutish wor- 
ship of a hobgoblin, than ever I was at anything in my life. I rode up to 
the image, or monster— call it what you will — and with my sword cut the 
bonnet that was on its head in two in the middle, so that it hung down 



382 ADYBNTUBBS 07 

b J one of the honiB : and one of onr men, that was with me, took hold «f 
the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it, when, behold, a most 
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village, and two or thiee hon- 
dred people came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour for it, for we 
saw some had bows and aziows. But I resolved, from that moment, to 
visit them again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, so we had some leisure 
here to put my design in execution. I communicated my project to the 
Scots merchant of Moscow. He laughed at me at first, but finding me 
resolute, he told me that he would go with me ; but he would go first and 
bring a stout fellow, one of his ooimtr3rmen, to go also with us. He 
brought me a Tartar's robe, or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a 
bow and arrows, and had provided the same for himself and his country- 
man, that the people, if they saw us, should not be able to determine who 
we were. 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter 
with aquavitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could get; 
and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour after 
night we set out upon our expedition. We came to the place about eleyen 
o'clock at night, and found that the people were at their rest ; only, that 
in the great hut, or tent, as we called it, where we saw the three priests 
whom we mistook for butchers, we saw a light ; and, going up close to the 
door, we heard people talking, as if there were five or six of them. We 
determined on making them our prisoners ; and, tying their hands, com- 
X>elled them to stand and see their idol destroyed, which we accomphflhed 
by means of the combustibles we had brought with us. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow travellers, exceedingly 
busy in getting ready for our journey, and no one could suggest that we 
had been anywhere but in our beds. But it did not end so. Next day 
there came a great multitude of the country people to the town gates, 
demanding satisfaction of the Eussian governor for insulting their priest^ 
and burning their great Cham-Chi-Thaunga, for so they called the mon- 
strous creature they worshipped. The governor gave them all the good 
words imaginable ; and at last, to appease them, told them there was 
a caravan gone to Eussia that morning, and that it was perhaps some of 
this company that had done them the injury. Then he sent after us, inti- 
mating that if any in our caravan had done it, they should make tlieir 
escape ; and that whether we had done it or no, we should make all the 



ROBINSON CBU60B. 383 

haste forward that was poasihle. The captain of the caravan took the 
hint, and we trayelled two days and two nights, without any considerable 
stop, and then we lay at a village called Plothus. Prom thence we 
hastened on towards Jarawena ; but on the second day's march across the 
desert, by the clouds of dust behind us, we began to be sensible we were 
pursued. The third day, when we had encamped, the enemy came upon 
us in great numbers, and we only escaped them through the cunning of a 
Cossack of Jarawena ; who, telling our leader he would send these people 
away to Sibeilka, rode away from our rear, and, taking a great circuit 
about, came to the army of Tartars, as if he had been sent express to them, 
and told them that the people who had burnt their Cham-Chi-Thaunga 
were gone to Sibeilka with a caravan of miscreants, that is to say Chris- 
tians, and that they were resolved to bum the god Seal Isarg, belonging 
to the Tonguses. Upon this, away the Tartars drove in a violent hurry, 
and in less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight. So we 
passed safely on to Jarawena, and from thence through a frightful desert 
to a country pretty well inhabited. 

I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs, till I came to 
Tobolski, the capital of Siberia, where I let the caravan go, and made pro- 
vision to winter. This being the country where the state criminals of 
Muscovy are all banished, the city was fbll of noblemen, princes, and 
gentlemen, with several of whom I made acquaintance. 

About the latter end of Itay I b^gan to make all ready to pack up, and 
proposed to a certain piiAce, — a banished minister of the Czar, — that, as I 
went in the nature of a caravan, and oould encamp every night where 
I would, he might easily pass with me uninterrupted to Archangel, where 
I could secure him on board an English or Dutch ship, and carry him off 
safe along with me. He heard me very attentively, declined my offer, but 
asked me if I had kindness enough to offer the same to another person in 
whom he had a great abate of conc^n. I told him, if he would please to 
name the person to me, I would give him an answer. Thereupon he said 
it was his only son ; I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. 

It was in the beginning of June when I left this remote place, with 
my young lord, and a faithfdl Muscovite, or rather Siberian, servant he 
had with him. On the 18th of July we all arrived safe at Archangel, but 
were obliged to stay at this place five weeks for the arrival of the ships. 
We sailed from Archangel on the 20th of August, in a Hamburgher and 
arrived in the Elbe the 13th of September. Here my partner and I
