Robinson Crusoe, &V.
If] Was born in the Year 1*32, in the,
City of York, of a good Family, tho*
not of that Country, my Father be-
ing a Foreigner of Bremah> who fettled
firft at Hull 1 He got a good Eftate
by Merchandize, and leaving off his
Trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had
married my Mother, whofe Relations, were named
Robinfon, a very good Family in that Country, and
from Whom I was called kob'mjonKremx.naer; but by
theufual Corruption of Words in England^ we are
now called, nay we call our felves, and write our
Na?mcCV'/>',and (0 myCompanionsalways calf d me;

 [x]
I had two elder Brothers, one of which \Xras
Lieutenant Collonel to an Englijh Regiment of Foot
in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous
Coll. Lockhan, and was killed at the Battle near
Dunkirk againft the Spaniards: What became of my
fecond Brother I never knew, any more than my Fa-
ther or Mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred
to any Trade, my Head began to be fill'd very ear-
ly with rambling Thoughts: My Father, who
was very ancient, had given me a competent Share
-of Learning, as far as Houfe-Education, and a
Country Free-School generally goes, and defign'd
me for the Law; but I would be fatisfied with no-
thing but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this
led me fo ftrongly againft the Will, nay, the Com-
mands of my Father, and againft all the Entreaties
and Perfuafions of my Mother and other Friends,
that there feem'd to be fomething fatal in that Pro-
penfion of Nature tending dire&ly towards the
Life of Mifery which was to befalme.
My Father, a wife and grave Man, gave me
ferious and excellent Counfel againft what he fore-
faw was my Befign. He called me one Morning in-
to his Chamber, where he was confined by the
Gout, and expoftulated very warmly with me up-
^ , on this Subjed: He ask'd me what Reafons more
'** than a meer wandring Inclination I had for leaving
my Father's Houfe and my native Country, where
I might be well introduced, and had a Profpect
of raifing my Fortune by Application and Indu-
ftry, with a Life of Eafe and Pleafure. He told
me it was for Men of defperate Fortunes on one
Hand, or of afpiring, fuperior Fortunes on the
other, who went; Abroad upon Adventures, to rife
by Enterprise, and make themfelves famous in Un-
dertakings of a Nature out of the common Road;
that
m
that thefe Things were all either too far abbire me;
or too far below me ; that mine was the middld
State, or what might be called the upper Station
of Low Life', which he had found by long Experi-
ence was the bed State in the World, the mod
fuited to human Happinefs, notexpofed to the Mi-
feries and Hardftiips, the Labour and Sufferings of
the mechanick Part of Mankind, and not emba-
rafs'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and En-
vy of the upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I
might judge of the Happinefs of this State, by this
one thing, viz,. That this was the State of Life
which all other People envied; that Kings have
frequently lamented the miferable Confequences of
being born to great Things, and wifli they had
been placed in the Middle of the two Extremes,
between the Mean and the Great; that the wife
Man gave his Teftimony to this as the juft Stan-
dard of true Felicity, when he prayed to have nei-
ther Poverty or Riches.
He bid me obferve it, and I fhould always find,
that the Calamities of Life were fhared among the
tipper and lower Part of Mankind ,• but that the
middle Station had the feweft Difafters, and was*
not exposed to fo many Viciffitudes as the higher or
lower Part of Mankind ,* nay, they were not fubje-
fted to fo many Diftempers and Uneafineffes either
of Body or Mind, as thofe were, who by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand*
or by hard Labour, want of Neceffaries, and mean
or insufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Di-
ftempers upon themfelves by the natural Confequen-
ces of their Way of Living; T'hat the middle Sta-
tion of Life was calculated for all kind of Virtues
and all kind of Enjoyments; that Peace and J?len*
ty were the Hand-maids of a middle Fortune 5
that Temperance, Moderation, Quietnefs, Health*
B % Society $

Society, all agreeable Diverfions, and all defirabfe
Pleasures were the Bleffings attending the middle
Station of Life; that this Way Men went filently
and fmoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out
of it, nor embarafs'd with the Labours of the
Hands or of the Head, not fold to the Life of Sla-
very for daily Bread, orharafs'd with perplex'd
Circumftances, which rob the Soul of Peace and
the Body of Reft; not enrag'd with the Paffion of
Envy, or fecret burning Luft of Ambition for
great Things j but in eafy Circumftanees Aiding
gently thro the World, and fenfibly taftin<* the
Sweets of living, without the bitter, feeling" that
they are happy, and learning by every Day s Ex-
perience to know it more fenfibly.
After this, he prefs'd me earneftly, and in the'
moil aftedionate Manner, not to play the youn?
Man, not to precipitate myfelf into Miferies which
Nature, and the Station of Life I was born in
feemd to have provided againft ,• that I was under
no Neceffity of feeking my Bread; that he would
do well forme, and endeavour to enter me fairly
into the Station of Life which he had been juft re-
commending to mg,- andthatiflwasnot very ea-
fy and happy in the World, it muft be my mere
Fate or Fault that muft hinder it, and that he
fhould have nothing to anfwer for, having thus dif-
charg d his Duty in warning me againft Meafures
which he knew would be to my Hurt: In a word
that as he would do very kind Things for me if
I would ftay and fettle at Home as he directed
fo he would not have fo much Hand in my Misfor-
tunes, as to give me any Encouragement to go a-
way: And to clofe all, he told me I had my elder
Brother for an Example, to whom he had ufed
thefameearneftPerfuafionsto keep him from go-
ing into the Low Country Wars, but could not pre-
vail
wU his young Defires prompting him to run into
the Army where he was killed; and tho' hp faid
he would not ceafe to pray for me, yet he would
venture to fay to me, that if I did take this foolifii
Step, God would not blefs me, and I would have
Leifure hereafter to refjied upon having negle&ed
his Council when jthere might be none to affift in
my Recovery,
I obferved in this laft Part of his Difcourfe,
which was truly Prophetick, tho51 fuppofe my Fa-
ther did know it to be fo himfelf,• I fay, I obfer-
ved the Tears run down his Face very plentifully,
and efpecially when he fpoke of my Brother who
was kilfd ; and that when he fpoke of my having
Leifure to repent, and none to afTifi: me, he was
fo movM, that he broke off the Difcourfe, and
told me, his Heart was fo full, he could fay no
more to me.
I was fincerely affe&ed with this Difcourfe, as
indeed who could be otherwife ? And Jrefoly'd not
to think of going Abroad any more, but to fettle
at Home according to my Father's Defire* But
alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in fhort, to
prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities,
in a few Weeks after, I refolv'd to run quite away
from him. However, I did not aft fo haftily neither
as my firft Heat of Refolution prompted, but I took
my Mother, at a Time when I thought her a little
pleafanter than ordinary, and told her, that my
Thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeing the
World, that I fliould never fettle to any Thing with
Refolution enough to go through with it, and my
Father had better give me his Confent than force
me to go without it; that I was now eighteen
Years old, which was too late to go Apprentice to
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney; that I was fure,
\t I did, I fliould never ferve out my Time, and I
B 3 fliould
fhould certainly run away from my Mafter before
my Time was out, and go to Sea; and if fhe 'would
fpeak to my Father to let me go one Voyage a-
broad, if I came home again and did not like it, I
would go no more, and I would promife by a dou-
ble Dilligence to recover that Time I had loft.
This put my Mother into a great Paffion : She
told me, fhe knew it would be to no Purpofe to
fpeak to my Father upon any fuch Subjeft, that he
knew too well what was my Intreft to give his Con-
fent to any fuch thing fo much for my Hurt, and that
flic wondered how I could think of any fuch thing af-
ter fuch a Difcourfe as I had had with my Father, and
fuch kind and tender Expreffions as (lie knew my Fa-
ther had us'd to me; and that in fhort, if I would
ruin my felf there was no Help for me; but I might
depend I fhould never have their Confent to it: That
for her Part fhe would not have fo much Hand in my
Deflruftion; and I flhould never have it to fay, that
piy Mother was willing when my Father was not,
Thp' my Mother refufed to move it to my Fa-
ther, yet as I have heard afterwards, fhe reported
all the Difcourfe to hijn, and that my Father af-
ter fhewing a great Concern at it, faid to her with
a Sigh, That Boy might be happy if he would
flay fit home, but if he goes abroad, he will be
the moft niiferableft Wretch that was ever born 11
can give no Conient to it.
It was not till almofta Year after this that I broke
Joofe, tho' in the mean time I contained obftinate-
ly deaf to all Propofals of fettling to Bufmefs, and
frequently expostulating with my Father and Mo-
ther, ^about their being fc podtively determin'd a-
gainft what they knew my Inclinations prompted
me to. But being one Day at Huti, where I went
cafually, and without any Purpofe of making an
Elopement that time i but 1 fay, being there, and
one
[7]
one of my Companions being gone by Sea to Lon-
don, in his Father's Ship, and prompting me to go
with them, with the common Allurement of Seafa-
ring Men, viz*. That it fhould coft me nothing for
my Paffage, I confulted neither Father or Mother
any more, nor fo much as fent them Word of it; but
leaving them to heir of it as they might, without
asking God's Bleffing, or my Father's, without any
Confideration of Circumflances or Confequences,
and in an ill Hour, God knows, on the firft of Sep-
tember 1651, I went on board a Ship bound for Lon-
don; never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I
believe, began fooner, or continued longer than mine.
The Ship was no fooner gotten out of the Humber,
but the Wind began to blow, and the Sea to rife
in a moft frightful manner; and as I had never
been at Sea before, I was moft inexpreffible fick in
Body, and terrify'd in my Mind: I began now fe-
rioufly to refleft uf pn what I had done, and how
juftly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven
for my wicked leaving my Father's Houfe, and a-
bandoning my Duty; all the good Counfel of my
Parents, my Father's Tears and my Mother's En-
treaties came now frefh into my Mind, and my
Confcience, which was not yet come to the Pitch
of Hardnefs to which it has been fince, reproach'd
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach
of my Duty to God and my Father.
All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea,
which I had never been upon before, went very high,
tho' nothing like what I have feen many times
fince; no, nor like what I faw a few Days after :
But it was enough to afteft me then, who was but
a young Sailor, and had never known any thing of
the Matter. I expefted every Wave would have
fwallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell
down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollow
B 4 of
[8]
pfthe Sea, we fliould never rife more; and in this}
Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Refolu-
tions, that if it would pieafe God here to fpare
my Lif$ this que Voyage, if ever I got once my
Foot upoj) dry Land again, I would go diredly
home to my Father, and never fee it into a Ship a-
gain while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice,
and never run my feif into fuch Miferies as thefe
any more. Now I faw plainly the Goodnefs of
his Observations about the middle Station of Life,
how eafy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his
Days, and never had be$n exposed to Tempeftsat
Sea, pr Troubles on Shore ; and I refolv'd that J
would, like a true repenting Prodigal, gp home to
my Father.
Thefe wife and fober Thoughts continued (tfl the
while the Storm continued, and indeed fome time
^fter; but the next Day the Wind was abated
and the Sea calmer,and I began to be a little innur'd
to it: However I was vciy grave for ail that Day,
b^ing alfo a little Sea fick ftJl; but towards Night
the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over,
and a charming fipe Evening Mlow'd; the Sun went
down perfeftly clear, ^nd rofe fo the next Morning;
and having little or no Wind, and a fmooth Sea,
the Sun fliining upon it, the Sight was, as I thought,
the moft delightful that ever I faw.
I had (lept well in the Night, and was now nq
ijior^ Sea fick, but very chearful, looking with
Wonder upon the Sea that was fo rough and terri-
ble the Day before, and could be fo calm and fo
pleafant in fo little time after. And now leaft my
good Refolutions fliould continue, my Companion,
who had indeed cnticd me away, comes tome,
Welh Bob, fays he, clapping me upon the Shoulder,
How do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted,
[Want you lajl Night, when it blew but a Cap full of
1 v Wmil
[91
Wind ? A Cap full d'you call it ? faid I, 9twas a terrh
file Storm: A Storm, you Fool you y replies he, rfoyou
call that a Storm, why it was nothing at ally give us but
a good Ship and Sea-room, and we think nothing offuch
a Squal of Wind m that; but you re but afrefiWater
Sailor, Bob; come let us make a Bowl of Punch and
we'll forgef all that; d'ye fee what charming Weather 'tis
now i To make fhort this fad Part of my Story,
we went the old way of all Sailors, the Punch was
made, and I was made drunk with it, and in that
one Night's Wickednefs I drown'd all my Repen-
tance, all my Reflections upon my paft Conduct,
and all my Refoiutions for my future. In a word,
as the Sea was returned to its Smoothnefs of Sur-
face and fettled Calmnefs by the Abatement of that
Storm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over,
my Fears and Apprehenfions of being fwallow'd up
by the Sea being forgotten, and the Currant of my
fprmer Defires returned, I entirely forgot the Vows
and Promifes that I made in my Diftrefs. I found
indeed fomplntervails ofRefle&ion,andthe ferious
Thoughts did, £s it were, endeavour to return a-
gain fometifnes, but I fhook them off, and rouzM
myfelffrom them as it were from a Difiemper,
and applying myfelf to Drinking and Company^
foon matter cl the Return of thofe Fits, for fo I
call'dthem, and I had in five or fix Days got as;
compleat a Victory over Confciepce as any young
Fellow that refolv'd not to be troubled with it,
could defire : But I was to have another Trial for
it flillj and Providence, as in fuch Cafes generally
it does, refolv'd to leave me entirely without Excufe.
For if I would not take this for a Deliverance, the
next was to be fuch a one the as worft and moft
harden'd Wretch among us would confefs both the
Pfnger and the Mercy.
The
[ io ]
The flxth Day pf our being at.Sea we came in*
to Xarmouth Roads; the Wind having been contra-?
jry, and the Weather calm, we had made but little
Way fince the Storm. Here we were obliged to
come to Anchor, and here we lay, the Wind con^
tinuing contrary, «g/&. at South-weft, for feven or
eight Days, during whifh time a great many Ships
from JNewcaftle came into the fame Roads, as the
common Harbour where the Ships might wait for
2. Wind for the River.
We had not however rid here fo long, but fhould
have Tided it up the River, but that the Wind
blew too frefh ; and after we had lain four or five
Days, blew very hard* However, the Roads be-
ing reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Anchorage
good, gnd our Ground-Tackle very ftrong, our
Men were unconcerned, and not in the leaft appre-
henfive of Danger, bntfpent the Time in Reft and
Mirth, after the manner of the Sea; but the eighth
Day in the Morning, the Wind increafed, and we
had all Hands at Work to ftrike our"Top-Mails,
2nd make every thing fnug and clofe, that the Ship
might ride as eafily as poffible. By Noon the Sea
went very high indeed, and our Ship rid Forecaftle
in, fhipp'd feveral Seas, and we thought once or
twice our Anchor had come home ; upon which
our Mafter order'd out the Sheet Anchor; fo that
we rode with two Anchors a-hqad, and the tables,
vered out to the better End.
By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed,
and now I began to fee Terror and Amazement in
the Faces even of the Seamen themfelves. The Ma-
fter, tho' vigilant in the Bufinefs of preferring the
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabin by
me, I could hear him fofrly to himfelf fay feveral
times. Lord be merciful to us, we [I)all be all hft> w
Jhall be all undone; and the like. During thele firft
Hurries,
Hurries, I was ftupid, lying ftiil in my Cabin,
which was in the Steerage, and cannot defcribe my
Temper: I could ill re-affume the firft Penitence
which I had fo apparently trampled upon, and har-
dened myfelf againft: I thought the Bitternefs of
Death had been paft, and that this would be no-
thing top like the firft. But when the Matter him-
felf came by me, as I faid juft now, and faid we
fliould be all loft, I was dreadfully frighted : I got
up out of my Cabin, and looked out ; but fuch a
difmal Sight I never faw : The Sea went Mountains
high, and broke upon us every three or four Mi-
nutes : When I could look about, I could fee no-
thing but Diftrefs round us : Two Ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their Mafts by the
J3oard, being deep loaden ; and our Men cry'd out,
that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Head of us
was foundered. Two more Ships being driven from
their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea,
at all Adventures, and that with not a Maftftand-
ing. The light Ships fared the beft, as not fo much
labouring in the Sea; but two or three of them
drove, and came clofe by us, running away with
only their Sprit-fail out before the Wind.
Towards Evening the Mate and Boatfwain
begg'd the Mafter of our Ship to let them cut a-
way the Fore-maft, which he Was very unwilling
to: But the Boatfwain protefted to him that if he
did not, the Ship would founder, he confented;
and when they had cut away the Fore-maft, the
Main-maft ftood fo loofe, and ftiook the Ship fo
much, they were obliged to cut heraway alfo, and
make a clear Deck.
Any one may judge what a Condition I muft be
in at ail this, who was but a young Sailor, and
who had been in fuch a Fright before at but a lit-
tle. But if I can exprefs at this Diftance the
Thoughts
[ II}
Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in
tenfold more Horror of Mind upon Account of my
former Convictions, and the having returned from
them to the Refolutions I had wickedly taken at firft,
then I was at Death itfelf; and thefe, added to the
Terror of the Storm, put me in fuch a Condition,
that I can by no words defcribe it. But the worft
was to come yet, the Storm continued with fuch
Fury, that the Seamen themfelves acknowledged
they had never known a worfe. We had a good Ship,
but (he was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea,
that the Seamen every now and then cried out, fhe
would founder. It was my advantage in one refpeft,
that I did not know what they meant by founder,
till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was fo vio-
lent, that I faw what is not often feen, the Matter,
the Boatfwain, and fome others more fenfible than
the reft, at their Prayers*, and expecting every Mo-
ment when the Ship would go to the Bottpm- In
the Middle of the Night, and under all the reft of
qur Diftreffes, one of the Men that had been
down on Purpofe to fee, cried out we had fprung a
Leak ; another faid there was four Foot Water in
the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died
within me, and I fell backwards upon the Side of
my Bed where I fat, into *the Cabin. However,
the Men rouzed me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to
'pump as another,* at which I ftirr'd up, and went
to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this
was doing, the Mafter feeing fome light Colliers,
who not able to ride out the Storm, were oblig'd
to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near
us, ordered to fire a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs. I
who knew nothing what that meant, was fo furpri-
zed, that I thought the Ship had broke* or fome
dread-
dreadful Thing happened. In a word, I was Co Cat*
priz'd, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was
a Time when every Body had his own Life to
think of, no Body minded me, or what: was become
of me ; but another Man ftept up to the Pump, and
thrufting me afide with his Foot, let me lie, thin-
king I had been dead ; and it was a great while
before I came to myfelf.
We work'd on, but the Waiter encreafing in the
Hold, it was apparent that the Ship would founder,
and thd* the Storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not poffible fhe could fwim 'till we might run
into a Port, fo the Matter continu'd firing Guns for
Help; and a light Ship who had rid it out juft a
Head of us, ventured a Boat out to help us. It
Was with the utmoft Hazard the Boat came near
us, but it was impoffible for us to get on Board,
or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, 'till at laft
the Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
Lives to fave ours, our Men caft them a Rope over
the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out
a great Length, which they after great Labour and
Hazard took hold of, and we haul'd them clofe un-
der our Stern, and got all into their Boat. It was
to ne Purpofe forthem or us after we were in the
Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, fo all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in to-
wards Shore, as much as we could, and our Matter
promised them, That if the Boat was fiav'd upon
Shore, he would make it good to their Matter, fo
partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat went
away to the Norweird, floaping towards the Shore*
almoft as far as IVinterton-Nefs.
We were not much more than a quarter of aa
Hour out of our Ship but we faw her fink, and
then I underftcod for the firft Time what was meant
by a Ship foundering in the Seas I mutt acknow-
ledge
ledge I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Sea-
men told me (lie was finking; for from that Mo-
ment they rather put me into the Boat than that I
might be faid to go ill,; my Heart was as it were
dead within me, partly with Fright, partly with
Horror of Mind, and the Thoughts of what was
yet before me.
While we were in this Condition, the Men yet
labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat near the
Shore, we could fee, when our Boat mounting the
Waves, we were able to fee the Shore, a great
many People running along the Stand to affift us
when we ftiould come near, but we made but flow
way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach
the Shore, till being paft the Light-Houfe at Win-
tenon, the Shore falls off to the Weft ward towards
Cromer, and fo the Land broke off a little the Vio-
lence of the Wind: Here we got in, and tho' not
without much Difficulty got all fyfe on Shore, and
walk'd afterwards on Foot to Tamomh, where, as
unfortunate Men, we were ufed with great Huma-
nity, as well by the Magiftrates of the Town, Who
affign'd us good Quarters, as by particular Mer-
chants and Owners of Ships, and had Money gi-
ven us fufficient to carry us either to London, oi
back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the Senfe to have gone back td
Hull, and have gone Home, I had been happy, and
my Father, an Emblem of our blefled Saviour's Pa-
table, had even kill'd the fatted Calf for me; for
hearing the Ship I went away in, was caft away in
Tarmoutb Road, it was a great while before he had
any Affurance that I was not drown'd.
But my ill Fate pufli'd me on now with an Ob-
ftinacy that nothing could refift; and tho* I had fe-
veral times loud Calls from my Reafon and my
more compofed Judgment to go home, yet I had
[I?]
no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nOf
will I urge, that it is a fecret over-ruling Decree
that hurries us on to be the Inftruments of our own
Definition, even tho'it be before us, and that we
pufh upon it with our Eves open. Certainly no-
thing but fome fuch decreed unavoidable Mifery
attending, and which it was impoffible for me to
efcape, could have pufli'd me forward againft the
calm Reafonings and Perfuafions of my moft re-
tired Thoughts, and againft two fuch vifible In-
flations as I had met with in my firft Attempt.
My Comrade, who had help'd to harden mc be-
fore, and who was the Mailer's Son, was now lrfs
forward than I; the firft time he fpoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were feparated in the Town
to feveral Quarters; I fay, the firft time he faw me*
it appeared his Tone was alter'd, and looking very
melancholy, and fhaking his Head, ask'd me how
I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how
I had come this Voyage only for a Tryal, in order
to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me
with a very grave and concerned Tone, Young Many
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought
to take this for a flam and vifible "token that you are
not to be a Seafaring Man. Why, Sir faid I, will you
go to Sea no more? that is another Cafe, faid he,
it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage for a tryal, you fee what a Tajle Heaven has
given you of what you are to expell ifyouperjift; perhaps
this is all bejalien us on your Account, like Jonah in the
Ship of Tarfhifh. Pray, continues he, what are you?
' And on what Account did you go to Sea ? Upon that I
told him fome of my Story ; at the End ot which he
burft out with a ftrange kind of Paffion, What had
Idone, fays he, that fuch an unhappy Wretch fliould
come into my Ship ; I would not fet my Foot in
ith*
the fame Ship with thee again for a thoufandf
Pounds. This ifideed was, as I faid, an Excurfion
of his Spirits, which were yet agitated by the Senfe
of his Lofs, and was farther than he could have
Authority to go. However, he afterwards talk'd
very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my
Father, and not tempt Providence to my Ruin;
told me I might fee a vifible Hand of Heaven a-
gainft me : And young Man, faid he, depend upon ity
if you do not go back, where-ever you go, you will meet
with nothing but Difafters and Difappointments, till your
Father s Words are fulfilled upon you.
Wc parted foon after; for I made him little An-
fwer, and I faw him no more; which way he went;
I know not. As for me, having fome Money in
my Pocket, I travelled to London by Land ; and
there, as well as on the Road, had many Struggles5
with myfelf, what Courfe of Life 1 fliould take,'
and whether I fhould go Home* or go to Sea.
As to going Home, Shame oppofed the beft
Motions that offered to my Thoughts ; and it im-
mediately occur*d to me how I fliould be laugh'd
at among the Neighbours, and fhould be afliam'd
to fee, not my Father and Mother only, but even
every Body elfe ; from whence I have fince often
obferved, how incongruous and irrational the com-
mon Temper of Mankind is efpecially of Youth,
to that Reafon which ought to guide them in fuch
Cafes, viz,. That they are not afliam'd to fin, and
yet are afliam'd to repent; nor afliam'd of the Afti-
on, for which they ought juftly to be efleemed Fools,'
but are aftiam'd of the Returning, which only can
make them be efleemed wife Men.
In this State of Life, however, I remained fome
time, uncertain what Meafures to take, and what
Courfe of Life to lead. An irrefiih'ble Relnftance
continued to going Home; and as I ftay'd a while,-
the
ti7J
the Remembrance of the Diftrefs I had been m
Wore off,- and as that abated, the little Motion I
had in my Defires to a RetOrn wore off with it, till
at laft I quite laid afide the Thoughts of it, and
look'd out for a Voyage.
That evil Influence which carried mc firft away:
from my Father's Houfe, that hurried me into the
wild and indigefted Notion of raifing my Fortune*
and that impreft thofe Conceits fo forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good Advice, and
to the Entreaties, and even Command of my Fa-
ther: I fay* the fame Influence, whatever it was*.
prefented the mod unfortunate of all Enterprizes
to my View ,• and I went on Board a Veffel bound
to the Coaft of Africa, or as our Sailors vulgarly
call it, a Voyage to Guihey.
It was my great Misfortune that in all thefe.
Adventures I did not fhip my felf as a Sailor*
whereby tho* indeed I might have work'd a.little
harder than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had
learn'd the Duty and Office of a Foremaft-man>.
and in Time might have qualify'd my fel|. for a
Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Mafter. ffeut as
it was always my Fate to chufe for the^worfe*
fo I did here, for having Money in my Pocket*
and good Cloaths upon my Back* I would always
go on Board in the Habit of a Gentleman, and fo
I neither had any Bufinefs in the Ship, or learn'd
to do any.
It was my Lot firft of all to fall into pretty good
Company in London, which does not always hap^
pen to fuch loofe and unguided young Fellows as I
then was, the Devil generally not omitting to lay
fome Snare for them very early; but it was hot fo,
With me, I firft fell acquainted with the Matter of
a Ship who had been on the Coaft of Guiney> and
who having had very good Succefs there^ was re-
G folve<£
folved to go again ; and who taking a Fancy to mf
Converfation, which was not all difagreeable at
that time, hearing me fay I had a mind to fee thee
World, told me, if I wou'd go the Voyage with
him, I fhould be at no Expence ; I fhould be his
Mefs-mate and his Companion, and if I could car-
ry any Thing with me, I fhould have all the Ad-
vantage of it that the Trade would admit ,* and
perhaps I might meet with fome Encouragement.
I embraced the Offer, and entring into a flrid
Friendfhip with this Captain, who was an honeft
and plain-dealing Man, I went the Voyage with
him, and carried a (mall Adventure with me, which
by the difiiitetefted Honefty of my Friend the Cap-
tain, I increafed very eonftderably 3 for carried a-
bout 40 Lin fuch Toys abd Trifles as the Captain
direded me to buy. This 40 /. I had muftered to-
gether by the AtBftance of fome of my Relations
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe,
got my Father, or at leaft my Mother, to contri-
bute fo much as that to my firft Adventure.
This was the only Voyage which I may fay was
fuccefshil in all my Adventures, and which I owe to
the Integrity and Honefty of my Friend the Cap-
tain, under whom alfo, I got a competent Know-
ledge of the Mathematics, and the Rules of Na-
vigation, leaned how to. keep an Account of the
Ship's Courfe, take an Obfervation ,• aud in fliort,
to underftand fome Things that were needful to be
underilood by a Sailor: For, as he took Delight to
introduce me, I took Delight to learn ,• and, in a
Word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a
Merchant: For i brought home £.5. 9 Ounces of
Gold Duft for my Adventure, which yielded me.in
London,- at my Return, almoft 300 /. and this ffil'd
me with thofe afpiring Thoughts which have fince
fo compleated my Rmn-
[ 19]
Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes
too ; particularly, that I was continually Tick, be-
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the exceffive
Heat of the Climate ,• our principal Trading being
upon the Coaft, from the Latitude of 15 Degrees,
North even to the Lineitfelf.
I was now fet up for a Guimy Trader; and my
Friend, to mygreat Misfortune, dying fcon after his
Arrival, I refolv'd to go the fame Voyage again*
and I embark'd in the fame Veflel with one who was
his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now got
the Command of the Ship. This was the unhap-
piefl: Voyage that ever Man made ; for tho> I did
not carry quite 100/. of my new gain'd Wealth*
fo that I had 200 /. left, and which I lodg'd with
ttiy Friend's Widow* who was very juftto me, yet
I fell iftto terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage ,• and
the firft was this, viz,. Our Ship making her Courfe
towards the Canary Iflands, or rather between thofei
Iflarids and the African Shore, was furprized in the
Grey in the Morning, by a Turkifb Rover of SaUeey
who gave Chafe to us with all the Sail (he could
make. We crowded alfo as much Canvafs as out
Yards would fpread* or our Mails carry, to have
got clear; but finding the Pirate gain'd upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few
Hours, we prepaid to fight s our Ship having 12
Guns, and the Rogue 18. About three in the Af-
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing too by
Miftake, juft athwart our Quarter, inftead of a-
thwart our Stern, as he intended, we brought 8 of
our Guns to bear on that Side, and pour'd in a
Broadfide upon him, which made him flieer off a-
gain, after returning our Fire, and pouring in alfo
his fmall Shot from near 200 Men which he h^d on
Bo^rd. However, we had not a Man touched, all
. our Men keeping clofe. He prepaid to attack us
C 2 again
again, Ind we to -defend our felves; but layfrfgro
on Board the next time upon our other Quarter,
he enter'd iixty Men upon our Decks, who imme-
diately fell to cutting and hacking the Decks and
Rigging. We ply'd them with Small-Shot, Half-
Pikes, Powder-Chefls, and fuch like, and cleared
our Deck of them twice. However, to cut fliort
this melancholy Part of our Story, our Shipbein£
difabled, and three of our Men kill'd, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car-
ry 'd all Prifoners into SaUee, a Pore belonging to
the Moors.
The Ufage I had there was not fo dreadful as at
firft I apprehended, nor was I carried up the Coun-
try to the Emperor's Court, as the reft of our Men
were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover,
as his proper Prize, and made his Slave, being
young and nimble, and fit for his Bufinefs. At this
fiirprizing Change of my Circumftances from a
Merchant to a miferable Slave, I was perfectly o-
verwhelmed; and now Ilook'd back upon my Fa-
ther's prophetick Difccurfe to me,, that I Ihould be
miferable, and have none to relieve me, which I
thought was now fo effedtually brought to pafs, that
it could not be worfe ; that now the Hand of Hea-
ven had overtaken me, and 1 was undone without
Redemption. But alafs ! this was but a Tafte of
the Miferyl was to go thro', as will appear in the
Sequel of this Story.
As my new Patron or Matter had taken me Home
to his Houfe, fo I was in Hopes that he would take
me with him whsn he went to Sea again, believ-
ing that it would fome time or other be his Fate
to be taken by a Spantfb or Portugal Man of War;
and that then I fliould be fetat Liberty. .But* this
Hope of mine wasfcon taken away; for when he
went to Sea, he left me on Shore to look after his
little
JJttle Garden, and do the common Drudgery of
Slaves about his Houfe ,• and when he came home
again from his Cruife, he ordered me to lie in fhe
Cabin to look after the Ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my Efcape,* and
what Method I might take to effed it, but found no
^ay that had the leaft Probability in it: Nothing
prefentcd to make the Suppofition of it rational >*
for I had no Body to communicate it to, that
would embark with me,; no Fellow-Slave, no Eng-
lish Man, Irijh Man, or Scotch Man there but my
fclf; fo that for two Years, tho'I often pleafedmy
felf with the Imagination, yet I never had thelealt
encouraging Profpedt of putting it in Practice.
After about two Years, an oddCircnmftancepre-
fenteditfelf, which put the old Thought of ma-
king fome Attempt for my Liberty, again in my
Head: My Patron lying at home longer'than ufual,
without fiting out his Ship, which, as I heard,
was for want of Money ; he ufed conftantly, once
or twice a Week, iometimes oftner, if the Wea-
ther was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and go
Qut intp the Road a fifhing ,* and as he always took
me and a young Marefco with him to row the Boat,
we made him very merry, and Iprov'd very dex-
terous in catching Fifli; infomuch that fomen'mes
he would fpnd me with a Mcor, one of his Kinf-
men, and the Youth the Marefco, as they call'd
him, to catch a Difli of Fifii for him.
It happen'd one time, that going a fifhing in a
ftark calm Morning, a Fog rofe fo thick, thattho'
we were not half a League from the Shore we loft
Sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or
which Way, we laboured all Day and all the next
Night, and when the Morning came we found we
had pull'd off to Sea inftead of pulling in for the
S Jiqre; and that we were at leaft two Leagues from
C 3 the
the Shore: However, we got well in again, tho*
with a great deal of Labour, and fome Danger;
for the Wind began to blow pretty frefh in the
Morning; but particularly we were all very hungry.
But our Patron, warn'd by this Difafter, refolved
to take more Care of himfelf for the future; and
having lying by him the Long-Boat of our Englijk
Ship they had taken, he refolved he would not go
a filhing any more without a Compafs and and fome
Provifion; (o he ordered the Carpenter of his
Ship, who alfo was an Englfo Slave, to build a lit-
tle State-Room or Cabin in the middle of the
Long-Boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place to
ftand behind it to fteer and hale home the Main-
fheet; and Room before for a Hand or two to
fland and work the Sails? She faifd with that we
call a Shoulder of Mutton Sail; and the Boom
gib'd over the Top of the Cabin, which lay very
fntig and low, and had Room in it for him to lif,
with a Slave or two, and a Table to eat on, wkh
fome fmall Lockers Co put in fome Bottles of iuch
Liquor as he thought fit to drink ; particularly
his Bread, Rice and Coffee.
We went frequently out with this Boat a fifliing,
and as I was mod dextrous to catch Fifli for him,
he never went without me: It happened that he
had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for
Pleafure or for Fifh, with two or three Moors of
fome Diftindion in that Place, and for whom he
had provided extraordinarily ; and had therefore
lent on Board the Boat over Night, a larger Store
ot Provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me
to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot,
which were on Board his Ship ; for that they de-
figiul fome Sport of Fowling as well as Fifliing.
I got all Things ready as he had directed, and
waited the next Morning with the Boat, wafhed
cleafy
eean, her Antient and Pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his Guefts; when by and
by my Patron came on Board alone, and told me
his Guefts had put off going, upon fome Bufinefs
that fell out, and ordered me with the Man and
Boy, as ufual, to go out with the Boat and catch
them fome Fifh, for that his Friends were to fup
?tt his Houfe, and commanded that as foon asl
had got fome Fifh I fhould bring it home to his
Houfe; all which I prepared to do.
" This Moment my former Notions of Delive-
rance darted into my Thoughts, for now 1 found I
was like to have a little Ship at my Command; and
my Mafter being gone, I prepared to furnifh my
(elf, not for a fifhing Bufinefs, but for a Voyage;
tho' Iknew npt, neither did I fo much as confider
whither I fhould fleer; for any where to get out
pf that Pl^ce was my Way.
My firft Contrivance was to make a Pretence to
fpeak to this Moor, to get fomething for our Sub-*
iiftence on Board; far I told him we muft not pre-*
fume to eat of our Patron's Bread; he faid, that
was true; fq he brought a large Basket of Rusk
or Bisket of their kind, and three Jarrs with frefli
Water into the Boat; J knew where my Patron's
Cafe of Bottles flood, which it was evident by
the Make were taken out of fome Englijh Prize; and
J convey'd them into the Boat while the Moor was
on Shore, as if they had been there before, for our
Mafter: I convey'd a!fo a great Lump of Bees-
Wax into the Boat, which weighed above half a
hundred Weight, with a Parcel of Twine or
Thread, a Hatchet, a S4W, and a Hammer, all
which were of great Ufe to us afterwards, efper
daily the Wax to make Candles. Anojther Trick
I try'd upon him, which he innocently came into
alfo i his Name was Ijmael, who they call Mul)\
C 4 os
[»4]
pr Moely, fol call'd to him, Moely, faid I, our Pat
tron's Guns are on Board the Boat, can you not
get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may
kill fome Akamies (a Fowl like our Culieus) for our
felves, for I know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in
the Ship? Yes, fays he, I'll bring fane; and ac-
cordingly he brought a great Leather Pouch which
held about a Pound and half of Powder, or rather
more ; and anotheivwithShot, that had five or fix
Pound, with fome Bullets; and put all into the
Boat: At the fame time I had found fome Powder
of my Mafters in the great Cabin, with which I
fiil'd one of the large Bottles in the Cafe, which
wa? almoft empty ; pouring what was in it into a-
nother: And thus furnifhed with ever thing need-
ful^ we fail'dout of the Port to fifli : The Caftle,
which is at the Entrance of the Port, knew who we
were, and took no Notice of us'; and we were not-
above a Mile out of the Port before we hal'din our.
Sail, and fet us down to fifti : The Wind blew from
• the N. "NE. which was contrary to my Defire; for.
had it blown Southerly, I had been fure to have
made the Coaft of Spain, and at leaft reached to the
Bay of Cadiz,; but my Refolutiqns were, blow:
which way it woud, I would be gone from that
horrid Place where I was, and leave the reft to Fate,
After we had ii(h?d fome time and catch'd no-
thing, for when I had Fifh on my Hock, I would
not pull them up, that I might not fee them; I faid
to the Moor, this will not do, bur Matter will not
be thus ferv'd, we muft ftand farther off: He think-
ing no Harm agreed, and being in the Head of the
Eoat fet the Sails ; and as I had the Helm I run
the Boat out near a League farther, and then
brought her too as if I'would fifh, when giving
the Boy the Helm, I ft^pt forward to where the
Moor wa:, and making as if I ftqop'd far fome- '
thing
fhing behind him, I took him by furpri?e with py
Arm under his Twift, and toft him clear oyer-
t>oard into the Sea; he rife immediately, for he
jfwam l^e a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd to be
taken in, told me he would go all over the World
with me ; he fwam fo flrongafter the Boat that he
would have reach'd me very quickly, there being
but little Wind; upon which I ftept into the Cabin,
and fetching one of the Fowling-pieces, I prefen-
ted it at him, and told him, I had done him no
hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him
none : But, faid I, you fwim well enough to reach
the Shore, and the Sea is calm, make the beft of
your Way to Shore and I will do you no harm, but
if you corns near the Boat I'll fhoot you thro* the
Head > for I am r^folv'd to have my Liberty ; fo
he turn d himfelf about and fwam for the Shore,
and I make no doubt but he reach'd it with Eafe,
for he was an excellent Swimmer.
I could have been content to ha" taken this Moer
with me, and ha' drown'd the Boy, but there was no
venturing to truft him : When he wasgonel turn'd
to the Boy, who they cdXf&Xury, and faid to him,
Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make you a
great Man, but if you will not ftroak your Faqe
to be true to me, that is, fvmre £j Mahomet and
bis Father's Beard, I muft throw you into the Sea
too ,' the Boy fmil'd in my Face and fpoke fo in-
nocently that I could not miftruft him ; and fwore
to be faithful to me, and go all over the World
with *rhe.
While I was in View of the Moor, that was fwim-
ming, I flood put direftly to Se i with the Boat, ra-
ttier ftretphing to Windward, that they might think
me gone towards th$ Straits-mouth fas indeed any
one that had been in theirWits muft ha'been fuppos'd
to do) for who would ha' fuppos'd we were fail'd
on
onto the Southward to the truly Barbarian Coaft*
where whole Nations of Negroes were (lire to>
furround us with their Canoes, and deftroy us;
where we could ne'er once gone on Shore but we
fhould be dcvour'd by favage Beafts or more mer-
cilefs Savages of human Kind.
But as loon as it grew dusk in the Evening I
changed my Courfc, and fteer'd direfily South and
by Eaft, bending my Courfe a little toward the
Eaft, that I might keep in wich the Shore; and
having a fair frefli Gale of Wind and fmooth quiet
Sea, 1 made fuch Sail that I believe by the next
Day at Three a Clock in the Afternoon, when I
firft made the Land, I could not be lefs than 150
Miles South of Scitlee, quite beyond the Emperor
of Morocco's Dominions, or indeed of any other
King thereabouts, for we faw no People.
Yet fuch was the Fright I had taken at thcMoorsx
and the dreadful Apprehenfions I had of falling in-
to their Hands, that I would not flop, or go on
Shore, or come to an Anchor; the Wind continu-
ing fair, 'till I had faiTd in that manner five Days:
And then the Wind fhifting to the Southward,* I
concluded alfo that if any of our Veflels were in
Chafe of me, they alfo would now give over; fo
I ventur'd to make to the Coaft, and came to au
Anchor in the Month of a little River, I knew not
what, or where ; neither what Latitude, what
Country, what Nation, or what River : 1 neither
faw, or defirM to fee any PcopIe,the principal thing
I wanted was frefli Water: Wc came into,this
Creek in the Evening, refolving to fw.'m on Shore
a- icon as it was dark, and dilcover the Country;
but as foon as it was quite daik we heard fuch
dreadful Noifes of the barking, roaring, and
howling of wild Creatures of we knew not what
Kind;, :hat the poor Boy was ready to die with
Fear,
Fear and begg'd of me not to go on Shqre till
Day ; well Xury, faid I, then I won't, but it may
be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as ba4 tq
us as thofc Lyons; then we give them the fioot Gun>
fays Xury, laughing, make them run wey; fuch Englijh
Xury fpoke by converting among us Slaves, howe-
ver I was glad to fee the Boy fo cheerful, and I
gave him a Dram (out of our Patron's Cafe of Bot-
tles) to chear him up: After all, Xur/s Advice
was good, and 1 took it, we dropped our little An-
chor and lay (till all Night; I fay ftill, for we flept
none ; for in two, or three Hours we faw vaft great
Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of
many forts, come down to the Sea-fhore and run in-
to the Water, wallowing and wafhing themfelves
for the Pleafureof cooling themfelves: and they
made fuch hideous Howlingsand Yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fo was
I too,* but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of thefe mighty Creatures come fwim-
ming towards our Boat, we could not fee him but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
ftrous, huge and furious Bead: ; Xury hid it was a
Lyon, and it might be fo for ought I know; but
poor Xury cried to me to weight the Anchor and
row away; no, faid I, Xury, we can flip our Cable
with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea, they cannot
follow us far; I had no fooner faid fo, butlper-
ceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within two
Oars length, which fomething furpdzed me; how-
ever I immediately ftept to the Cabin-door, and
taking up my Gun firM at him, upon which he im-
mediately turn'd about and fwam towards the
Shore again.
But it is impoffible to defcribe the horrible Noi-
|es, and hideous Cries and Howlings, that were
raifed
raifed as well upon the Edge of the Shore, as high-
er within the Country; upon the Noife or R^
port of the Gun, a Thing I have fome Reafon tq
believe thofe Creatures had never heard before ;
This convinced me that there was no going on
Shore for us in the Night upon that Coafl, and
how to venture on Shore in the Day was. another
Queflion top; for to have fallen into the Hands
of any of the Savages had been . as bad as tp
have fallen into the Hands of Lyons and Ty-
gers; at Ieaft we were equally apprehenfive of th$
.Danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on
Shore fomewherc or other for Water, for we had
not a Pint left in the Boat,* when or where to get to
it was* the Point: Xury faid, if I would let him go
<pn Shore with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any Water and bring fome to me. I aslAi
him why he would go? Why I fhould not go, and
lie flay in the Boat ? The Boy anfwer'd with (q
much AfJe&ion, that made me love him ever
after. Says he, If wild Mans come, they eat me> you
go^wey. Well, Xury, faid I, we will both go, and
if the wild Mans come, we will kill them, they
fliail eat neither of us; fo I gave Xury a piece of
Rusk-bread to eat, and a Dram out of our Pa-
tron's Cafe oi" Bottles which I mentioned before;
and we hal'd the Boat in as near the Shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on Shore,- car-
vying nothing'but our Arms, and two Jarrs for
Water.
I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat,
fearing the coming of Canoes with Savages
down the River J But the Boy feeing a low Place
about a Mile up the Country rambled to it; and
by and by I faw him cc.me running towards mc,
I thought Ik was puthed by fome Savage, or
flighted
t*9]
lighted with fome wild Beaft, and I run forward
toward him to help him, but when I came nearer
to him I faw fomething hanging over his Shoul-
ders, which was a Creature that he had fhot, like
a Hare, but different in Colour, and longer Legs,
however we were very glad of it, and it was very
good Meat ,* but the great Joy that poor Xury
came with, was to tell me he had found good
Water, and (cen no wild Mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
jfuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the
Creek where we where, we found the Water frefli
when the Tide was out, which flowed but a little
way up, fo we filled our Jarrs, and feafted on the
Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
Way, having feen no Foot-fieps of any human
Creature in that Part of the Country.
As I had been one Voyage to this Coaft before,
I knew very well that the Iflands of the Canaries,
and the Cape de Verd Iflands alfo, lay not far off
from the Coaft. But as I had no Inftruments to
take an Obfervation, to know what Latitude we
were in, and not exa&ly know, or at leaft to re-
member what Latitude they were in, 1 knew not
where to look for them, or when to ftand off to Sea
towards them, otherwife I might now eafily have
found fome of thefe Iflands. But my Hopes were
that if 1 flood along this Coaft till I came to that
Part where the Englijh Traded, I fhould find fome
of their Veflels upon their ufual Defign of Trade,
that would relieve and take us in.
By the beft of my Calculation, that Place where
I now was, muft be that Country, which lying be^-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the
Negroes, lies wafte and uninhabited,.except by wild
Bealbs, the Negroes having abandon'd it, and gone
farther South for fear of the Moors; and the Moors
not
C?o]
not thinking it worth inhabiting*, by rfe'afori of its
Barrennefs; and indeed both forfeiting it becaufe
of the prodigious Numbers of Tygers, Lyons,
Leopards, and other furious Creatures which har-
bour there; fo that the Moors ufe it for their Hunt-
ing only, where they go like an Army, two or three
thoufand Men at a time; and indeed for near an
hundred Miles together upon this Coaft we faw
nothing but a wafte uninhabited Country by Day,-,
and heard nothing but Howlings and roaring of
Wild Beafts by Night.
Once or twice in the Day-time I thought I faw
the Pico of Tenerijfe, being the high Top of the
Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by
contrary Winds, the Sea alfo going too high for
itiy little Veflel, fo I refolved to purfue my firft
Defign, and keep along the Shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for frefli Wa*
ter, after we had left this Place; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the Morning, we came to
an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was
pretty high, and the Tide beginning to flow, we
lay ftill to go farther in; Xury, whofe Eyes were
more about him than it feems friirie were,cails foft-
ly to me, and tells me that we had bell go farther
off the Shore; for, fays he, lobk yonder lies a
dreadful Monfter on the fide of that Hillock faft
afleep : I look'd where he pointed, and faw a
dreadful Monfter indeed, for it was a terrible great
Lyon that lay on the fide of the Shore, under the
Shade of a piece of the Hill that hung as it were a
little over him. Xury> faid I, you fhall go on Shore
and kill him : Xury look'd frighted, and faid^
Me kill! be eat me at one Month; one Mouthful he
meant; however, I faid no more to the Boy, but
bad
E*1 3
bad him lye ftill, and I took our biggeft Gun,
which was almoft Musket-bore, and loaded it
with a good Charge of Powder, and with two
Slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another
Gun with two Bullets, and the third, for we had
three Pieces, I loaded with five fmaller Bullets. I
took the beft Aim I could with the firft Piece to
have fhothim into the Head, but he lay fo wth
hisLeg rais'd a little above hisNofe, that the Slugs
hit his Leg about the Knee, and broke the Bone.
He ftarted up growling at firft, but finding his Leg
broke fell down again, and then got up upon three
Legs, and gave the moft hideous Roar that ever I
heard ; I was a little furpriz'd that I had not hit
him on the Head ; however I took up the fecond
Piece immediately, and tho' he began to move off
fir'd again, and fliot him into the Head, and had
the Pleafure to fee him drop, and make but little
Noife, but lay ftruggling for Life. Then Xury
took Heart, and would have me let him go oil
Shore. Well, go, faid I; fo the Boy jump'd into
the Water, and taking a little Gun in one Hand,
fwam to Shore with the other Hand, and coming
clofe to the Creature, put the Muzzle of the Piece
to his Ear, and (hot l^im into the Head again,
which difpatchM him quite.
This w<is Game indeed to us, but this was no
Food, and I was very forry to lofe three Charges
of Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good
for nothing to us. However, Xury faid, he would
have fome of him ; fo he comes on board, ask'd
me togive him the Hatchet; for what, Xury, faid
I ? Me cut off his Head, faid he. However, Xury>
could not cut off his Head, but he cut off a Foot
and brought it with him, and it was a monftrous
great one*
I be-
[3* J
I bethought my felf however, that perhaps t\\k
Skin of him might one way or other be of fome
Value to us; and I refolved to take off his Skin if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him;
but Xury was much the better Workman at it, for 1
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up
both the whole Day, but at laft we got off the
Hide of him* and fpreading it on the top of our
Cabin, the Sun effectually dried it in two Days
time, and it afterwards ferv'd me to lye upon.
After this Stop we made on to the Southward
continually for ten or twelve Days, living very fpa-
ring on our Provifions, which began to abate very
much, and going no oftner into the Shore than
we were oblig'd to for frefti Water; my Defign in
this was to make the River Gambia or Senegal/, that
is to fay, any where about the Cape de Verd, where
I was in hopes to meet with fome European Ship,
and if I did not, I knew not what Coiirfe I had to
take, but to feek for the Iflands, or perifli there
among the Negroes. I knew that all the Ships from
Europe, which fail'd either to the Coaft of Guiney^
ox to Brajil, or to the Eafi Indies, made this Cape,
or thofe Iflands; and in a word, I put the whole,
of my Fortune upon this (ingle Point, either that
I muft meet with fome Ship or muft perifli.
When I had purfned this Refolution about ten
Days longer, as I have faid, I began to fee that:
the Land was inhabited, and in two or three Pla-
ces as we failed by we faw People ftand upon the
Shore to look at us, we could alfo perceive they
were quite black, and ftark naked. I was once
inclina to have gone on fhore to them; but Xury
was my better Councilor, and faid to me, no go,
no go; however I hawl'd in nearer the Shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they run along
the Shore by me a good way$ I obfer/d they had
nd
C 33 ]
m> Weaponsin their Hands, except one, who had 4
Ion* (lender Stick, which Xury (aid was a Lance*
ancfthat they would throw them a great way with
sood Aim; fo I kept at a difiance, but talk'd with
them by Signs as well as I could, and particularly
made Signs for fomeching to eat, they beckon d to
me to flop my Boat, and they would fetch me
fome Meat; upon this I lowered the Top of my
Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the
Country, and in lef, than half an Hour came back,
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flefh,
and fome Corn, fuch as is the Produce of their
Country,but we neither knew what the one or the
other was, however we were willing to accept it,
but how to come at it was our next Difpute, tor
I was not for venturing on Shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us, but they took a
fafe Way for us all, for they, brought it to the
Shore and laid it down, and went and flood a
great way off till we fetch'd it on Board, and
then came elofe to us again;
We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an Opportu-
nity offered that very Inftant to oblige them won-
derfully, for while we were lying by the Shore
came 2 mighty Creatures,one purfuing the other (as
we took it; with great Fury from the Mountains
towards the Sea, whether it was the Male purfuing
the Female,or whether they were in Sport or Rage
we could not tell,any more than we could tell whe-
ther it was ufual or flrange,but I believe it was the
latter, becaufe in the firft place thofe ravenous
Creatures feldom appear but in the Night, and in
the fecond place we found the People terribly
frighted, efpecially the Women. The Man that
had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them.*
but the reft did; however as the tWo Creatures
D tm
tan diredtly into the Water, they did not fcem td
offer to fail upon any of the Negroer, but plunged
themfelves into the Sea, and fwam about as if
they had come for their Diverfion ; .at laft one of
them began to come nearer our Boat than at firft I
expetf ed, but 1 lay ready for him, for I had load-
ed my Gun with alJ pofliblc Expedition, and bad
Xury load both the other; as foon as he came fair-
ly within my reach I hYd, and fhot him dire&ly
into the Head; immediately he funk down into
the Water, but rofe inftantly, and plung'd up and
down as if he was ftrugling for Life, and fo in-
deed he was; he immediately made to the Shore,
but between the Wound, which was his mortal
Hurt, and the flrangling of the Water, he died juft
before he reach'd the Shore.
It is jmpoflible to exprefs the Aftonifhment of
thefe poor Crcati res at the Noife and the Fire of
my Gun, fome of them were even ready to die for
Fear, and fell down as dead with the very Ter-
ror. But when they faw the Creature dead, and
funk in the Water, and that I made Signs to them
to come to the Shore, they took heart and came
to the Shore, and began to fearch for the Creature.
I found him by his Blood ftaining the Water, and
by the help of a Pvope, which I flung round him,
and gave the Negroes to hawl; they dragged him
on Shore, and found that it was a mo(t curious
Leopard, fpotted and fine to an admirable Degree,
and the Negroes held up their Hands with Admira-
tion to think what it was I had killed him with.
The other Creature, frighted with the Flafh of
Fire and the Noifc of the Gun, fwam on Shore,
and ran up dire&ly to the Mountains, from whence
they come, nor could I at that Diftance know
what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were
for eating the Flcfli of this Creature, (o I was wil-
ling
ling to have them take it as a Favour from me*
which when I made Signs to them that they might
take him, they were very thankful for, immediate-
ly they fell to work with him, and tho' they had no
Knife, yet with a fharpen'd piece of Wood they took
off his Skin as readily, and much more readily than
we cou'dhave done with a Knife ; they offered me
fome of theFlefh, which I declined, making as if
I would give it them* but made Signs for the Skin*
which they gave me very freely., and brought me a
great deal more of their Provifion, which tho I did
not underftand, yet I accepted ; then I made Signs
to them for fome Water, and held out one of my
Jarrstothem, turning it bottom upward, to ftew
"that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled* they eall'd immediately to fome of their
Friends, and there came two Women and brought
a great Veflel made of Earth, and burnt as I fup-
pofe in the Sun; this they fet down for me, as be-
fore, and I fent Xury on Shore with my Jarrs, and
filled them all threes The Women were as flark
naked as the Men.
I was now furnifhed with Roots and Corn, fuch
as it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Ne-
groes, I made forward for about eleven Days more,
without offering to go near the Shore, till I faw
the Land run out a great Length into the Sea, at
about the Diftance of four or five Leagues before
me, and the Sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing to make this Point ,* at length, doubling the
Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I
faw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward ;
then I concluded, as it vvas moft certain indeed*
that this was the Cape de Verdy and thofe the l-
(landsy call'd from thence Cape de Verd Iflands.
However they were at a great Diftance, and I
could not well tell what I had beft to do, for if I
D 2 fliould
[ 3<n
fliould be taken with a Frefli of Wind I might mi-
ther reach one or other.
In this Dilemna, as I was very penfive, I ftept
into the Cabin, and fat me down, Xury having
the Helm, when on a fudden the Boy cry'd out
Mafleiy Mafter, a Ship with a Sail, and the foolifli
Boy was frighted out of his Wits, thinking it muft
needs be fome of his Matter's Ships fent to pur-
file us, when, I knew we were gotten far enough
out of their reach. I jump'd out of the Cabin,
and immediately faw not only the Ship,'but what
flie was, (viz,.) that it was a Portuguefe Ship, and
as I thought was bound to the Coaft oi Guinea for
Negroes. But when I obferv'd the Courfe- fhe
iteer'd, I was foon convinced they were bound
fome other way, and did not dcflgn to come any
nearer to the Shore ; upon whichl ftretclVd out to
Sea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with
them if poffible.
With all the Sail I could make I found I fliould
not be able to come in their Way, but that they
would be gone by, before 1 could make any Signal
to them ; but after I had crowded to the utmoft,
and began to defpair, they it fcems faw me by the
help of fheir Perfpective-Glalles, and that it was
fome European Boat, which as they fuppofed muft
belong to fome Ship that was loft, fothey fhortned
Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my Patron's Antienton Board, I
made a Waft of it to them for a S gnal of Di-
ftrefs, and fir'd a Gun, both which they faw, for
they told me they faw the Smoke, tho* they did
not hear the Gun ; upon thefe Signals they very
kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in a-
bout three Hours time I came up with them.
They askM me what I was, in Portugucfe> and in
Spanifr> and in F, erich, but I underftood none of
them;
them ; but at iaft a Scots Sailor who was on board*
call'd to me, and I anfwer'd him, and told him I
was an Englijh Man, that I had made my efcape out
of Slavery from the Moors at Sal/ee; than they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and ail my Goods.
It was an inexpreffible Joy to me, that any one
will believe, that 1 was thus delivered, as Ieltcem'd
it, from fiich amiferablc and almoft hopelefs Con-
dition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I
had to the Captain of the Ship, as a Return for
my Deliverance,* but he generoufly told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I had
fhould be delivered fafe to me when I came to the
Bmfils; for, fays he, 1 have few d your Lije on no o-
ther Therms than I would be glad to befaved myfelf, and
it may one time or other be my Lot to ke taken up in the
fame Condition \ be fides, fa id he, when I carry you to
theBratilSjfogreata way jrom your own Country, If I
Jhould take jrom you what you have, you will be flawed
there, and then I only take away that Life 1 have given.
fSlo, no, Seignor, Inglefe fays he, Mr, Englifhman,
I will carry you thither in Charity, and thofe things will
he7p you to buy your Subfiftence there, and your Pajfage
home again.
As he was Charitable in this Propofal, fo he was
juft in the Performance to a title, for he ordered
the Seamen, that none fliouldotfer to touch any
thing I had; then he took every thing into his own
Pofleffion, and gave me back an axa& Inventory of
them, that I might have them, even fo much as
my three Earthen Jarrs.
As to my Boat it was a very good one, and
that he faw, and told me he would buy it of me
for the Ship's Ufe, and ask'd me what I would have
for it ? I told him he had been fo generous ito me
in every thing, that I could not ofter to make a-
D 3 ny
[3H
py Price of the Boat, but left it entirely to him*
upon which he told me he would give me a Note
of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces ofEightforit
at Brafily and when it came there, if any one of-
fered to give more he would make it up; he offered
me alfo 60 Pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xuryy
which I was loath to take, not that I was not wil-
ling to let the Captain have him, but I was very
loath to fell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had.&ffi-
fted me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How-?
ever when I let him know my Reafon, he own'd it
to be juft, and offered me this Medium, that he
would give the Boy an Obligation to fet him free
in ten Years, if he turned Chnftian ; upon this, and
Xury faying he was willing to go to him, I let the
Captain have him.
We had a very good Voyage to the Brafils, and
#rriv'd in the Bay de Todoslos Santos, or All-Saints-
Bay, in about Twenty-two Days after. And now
I was once more delivered from the molt miferable:
of all Conditions of Life, and what tp do next
with myfelf I was now to confider.
The generous Treatment the Captain give me,
1 can never enough remember 5 he would take no-
thing of me for my Paifage, gave me twenty Ducats
for the Leopard's Skin, and forty for the Lyon's
Skin which I had in my Boat, and caufed every
Thing I hid in the Ship to be punctually delivered
:ne, and what I was willing to icll he bought; fuch
as the Cafe of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a
Piece of the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made
Candles of the reft; in a word, I made about 220
Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo, and with this
Stock I went on Shore in the Brafilo.
I had not been long here, but being recommen-
ded to the Houfe of a good honeft Men likehim-
feif, who had an Ingeino as they call.it; that is, a
Plan-
Plantation and a Sugar-Houfe, I lived with him
jfome time, and acquainted my felf by that Means
with the Manner pf their planting and making of
Sugar ; and feeing how well the Planters liy'd, and
how they grew rich fuddenly, I refolv'd, if I could
get Licence to fettle there, I would turn Planter a-
mong them, refolving in the mean time to find out
fome Way to get my Money which I had left in Lon-
don remitted to me. To thisPurpofe getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalization, I purcfrafed as much
Land that was Uncur'd, as my Money would reach,
and form'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settlement,
and fuch a one as might be fuitable to the Stock
' which I propofed to my Yelf to receive from England.
I had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of Englijh Parents, whofe Name was Wells >
and in much fuch Circumftances as I was, I call
him Neighbour, becaufe his Plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on veryfociable together. My
Stock was but low as well as his > and we rather
planted for Food, than any thing elfe, for about two
Years. However, we began to increafe, and our
Land began to come into Order; fo that the third
Year we planted fome Tobacco, and made each of
us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting Canes
in the Year to come ; but we both wanted Help ;
and now I found more than before, I had done
wrong in parting with my Boy Xury.
But alas 1 for me to do-wrong that never did rights
was no great Wonder: I had no Remedy but to go
on; I was gotten into an Employment quite remote
to my Genius, and diredtly contrary to the Life I
delighted in, and for which I forfook my Father's
Houfe, and broke thro' all his good Advice ; nay,
I was coming into the very middle Station, or up-
per Degree of low Life, which my Father advifed
me to before j and which if I refolved to go on
D 4 with
with, I might as well ha' ftaid at home, and never
have fatigu'd my {l-lf in the World as I had done j
and I ufed often to fay to my felf, I could ha' done
this as well in England among my Friends, as ha"'
gone 5000Miles off to do it among Strangers and
Savages in a Wildernefs, and at fuch a Diftance,
as never to hear from any Part of the World that
had the lead Knowledge of ir.e.
In this manner I ufed to look upon my Condition
with the utrnoft Regret. I had no Body to converfe
with, but now and th^n this Neighbour; no Work
to be done, but by the Labour ot my Hands; and
I ufed to fay> I liv'd juft like a Man caft away up-
on feme defolateliland, that had no Body there but
himfelf. But how juft has it been, and how fhould
all Men reflect, that, when they compare their pre-
sent Conditions with others that are worfe, Heaven
may oblige them to make the Exchange, and be
convinc a of their former Felicity, by their Experi-
ence : I. fay, how juft has it been, that the truly foli-
tary Life I reflected on in an Ifland of meer Defe-
ction fhould be my Lot, who had fo often unjuftly
compared it with the Life which I then led, in
which had I continued, I had in all Probability
been exceeding profperous and rich.
I was in fome Degree fettled in my Meafures for
carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend
the Captain of the Ship, that took me up at Sea,
went back ; for the Ship remained there in provi-
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage
near three Months, when telling him what little
Stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me
this friendly and fincere Advice, Seignor Inglefe, fays
he, for fo he always call'd me, if you will give me
Letters, and a .Procuration here in Form to me,
with Orders to the Perfon who lias your Money ia
London, to fend your Effecls to Lisbon, to fuch Per-,
fons.
[4i 3
Tons as I fhall direft, and in fuch Goods as are pro-
per for this Country, I will bring you the Produce
of them, God willing, at my Return; but fince
human Affairs are ail fubjeft to Changes and Di-
fafters, I would have you give Orders but for ioo/.
SterL which you fay is half your Stock, and let
the Hazard be run for the firft; fo that if it come
fafe, you may order the reft the fame Way h and
if it mifcarry, you may have the other Half to
have Recourfe to for your Supply.
This was fo wholefome Advice, and looked fo
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was
the beft Courfe I could take', fo I accordingly pre-
pared Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I
had left my Money, and a Procuration to the Por-
tuguefe Captain, as he defired.
I wrote the Englifh Captain's Widow a full Ac-
count of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Efcape,
and how I had met with the Portugal Captain at
Ses, the Humanity of his Behaviour, and in what
Condition I was now in, with all other neeeffary
Direfiions for my Supply 5 and when this honeft
Captain came to Lisbon, he found means by fome of
the Englijh Merchants there, to fend over not the
Order only, but a full Account of my Story to a
Merchant at London, who reprefented it effectual-
ly to her; whereupon, fhe not only delivered the
Money, but out of her own Pocket fcnt the Por-
tugal Captain a very handfom Prefent for his Hu-
manity and Charity to me.
The Merchant in London veiling this 100 /. in
Englijh Goods, fuch as the Captain had writ for,
fent them dire&ly to him at Lisbon, and he brought
them all fafe to me to the Brajils, among which,
without my Direction (for I was too young in my
Bufinefs to think of them) he had taken Care to
have all Sorts of Tools, Iron-work, and Uten-
fils
fils ncceffary for my Plantation, and which were
of great Ufe to me.
When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortune
made, for I was furpriz'd with Joy of it; and my
good Steward the Captain had laid out the 5 L
which my Friend had lent him for a Prefent for
himfelf, to purchafe, and bring me over a Servant
under Bond for fix Years Service, and would not
accept of any Confideracion, except a little To-
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of
my own Produce.
Neither was this all; but my Goods being all
Englijh Manufactures, fuch as Cloath, Stuffs, Bays,
and Things particularly valuable and defireablein
the Country, I found means to fell them to a very
great Advantage ; fo that I may fay, I had more
than four times the Value of my firit Cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour, I
mean in the Advancement of my Plantation ; for
the firft thing I did, I bought me&Negroe Slave, and
an European Servant alfo > I mean another befides
that which the Captain brought me from Lisbon,
But asabus'd Profperity is oftentimes made the
very Means of our greateft Adverfity, fo was it
with me. I went on the next Year with great S.uc-
cefs in my Plantation : I raifed 50 great Rolls of
Tobacco on my own Ground, more than I had
difpofed of for Neceflaries among my Neighbours;
ancf thefc 50 Rolls being each of above a 100 PJ/h
were well cur'd and laid by againft the Return of
the Fleer from Lisbon : And now increafing in Bufi-
nefs and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of
Projects and Undertakings beyond my Reach j
fuch as are indeed often the Ruin of the beft
Heads in Bufinefs.
Had
Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my Father fo earneftly recom-
mended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had
fo fcnfibly defcribed the middle Station of Life to
be full of; but other things attended me, and I
was ftill to he the wilful Agent of all my own
Miferies ; and particijlarly to encreafe my Fault
and double the Reflections upon myfelf, which in
my future Sorrows I fhould have Leifureto make;
all thefe Mifcarriages were procured by my appa-
rent obftinate adhering to my foolifh Inclination of
wandring abroad, and purfuing that Inclination, in
contradiction to the cleared Views of doing my
felf good in a fair and plain purfuit of thofe Prof-
pefts and thofe Meafures of Life, which Nature
and Providence concurred to prefent me with, and
to make my Duty.
As I had once done thus in breaking away
from my Parents, fo I could not be content now,
but I muft go and leave the happy View I had of
being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantati-
on, only to purfue a rafli and immoderate Defire of
riling fafler then the Nature of the Thing admit-
ted ; and thus I caft myfelf down again into the
deepeft Gulph of human Mifery that ever Man fell
into, or perhaps could be confiftent with Life and
a State of Health in the World.
To come then by juft Degrees, to the Parti-
culars of this Part of my Story; you may fuppofe,
that having now lived almoft four Years in the
Bra/flo, and begining to thrive and profper very
wei) upon my Plantation; I had not only learn a
the Language, but had contracted Acquaintance
and Friendfliip among my Fcilow-Plantcrs, as well
as among the Merchants at St. Safaadore, which
was our Port; and that in my Difcourfe, among
them*
them, I had frequently given them an Account of
my two Voyages to the Coaft of Guinea, the
manner of Trading with the Negroes there, and
howeafy it was to purchafe upon the Coaft, for
Trifles, fuch as Beads, Toys, Knives, Sciffars,
Hatchets, bits of Glafs, and the like; not only
Gold Duft, Guinea Grains, Elephants Teeth, &c.
but Negroes for the Service of the Braftls, in great
Numbers.
They liftened always very attentively to my
Difeourfes on thefe Heads, but efpecially to that
Part which related to the buying Negroes, which
was a Trade at chat time not only not far entred
fnto, but as far as it was, had been carried on by
the Affiento\s, orPermiffion of the Kings of Spain
and Portugal, and engrofs'd in the Publick, fo that
few Negroes were brought, and thofe exceffive
dear.
It happen VI, being in Company with fome Mer-
chants and Planters of my Acquaintance, and
talking of thofe things very earneftly, three of
them came to me the next Morning, and to:d me
they had been muling very much upon what I had
difcourfed with them of, the laft Night, and they
came to make a fecret Propoful to me; and after
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me that they had
a mind to fit out a Ship to go to Guinea, that
they had all P.anrations as well as I, and were
ftraiteia'd for nothing fo much as Servants; that as
it was a Trade that could not be carried on, be-
caufe they could not publickly fell the Negiocs
when tiiey came home, fo thoy dchred to
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes on
Shore private y, and divide them among then1
own Plantations; and in a Word, the Queftior*
wav, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the
Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coaft
of
[45 1
bf Guinea ? And they offer'd me that I fhould have*
toy equal Share of the Negroes, without providing
any Part of the Stock.
This was a fair Propofal, it mutt be confeis d,
had it been made to any one that had not had a
Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to be very
tonfiderablc, and with a good Stock upon it. But
jtorme that was thus entered and eflablifhed, and
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four Years more, and to have fent for the
other ioo /. from England, and who in that time,
and with that little Addition, could fcarce have
fail'd of being worth 3 or 4000 /. Sterling, and
that encreafing too,* for me to think of fucha
Voyage* was the mod prepofterous Thing that e-
ver Man in fuch Circumftances could be guilty of.
But 1 that was born to be ray own Deftroyer,
could no more refift the Offer than I could reftrain
my firft rambling Defigns, when my Father's good
Counfel was loft upon me. In a word, I told
them I would go with all my Heart, if they
would undertake to look after my Plantation ia
my Abfence, and would difpofe of it to fuch as I
fhould dired if I mifcarry'd. This they all en-
gag'd to do, and entred into Writings or Covenants
to do fo ; and I made a formal Will, difpofing of
my Plantation and Effe&s, in Cafe of my Death,
making the Captain of the Ship that had fav'd
my Life, as before, my univerfal Heir, but obli-
ging him to difpofe of my EfFefts as I had directed
in my Will* one h^lf of the Produce being to him-
felf, and the other to be fhipp'd to England.
In (hort, I took all poffible Caution to preferve
my Effe&s, and to keep up my Plantation; had Iu-
fed half as much Prudence to have look'd into my
own
own Intrcft, and have made a Judgment ot vfhat
I ought to have done, and not to have done, I had
certainly never gone away from (o profperous an
Undertaking, leaving ail the probable Views of a
thriving Circumftance, and gone upon a Voyage to
Sea, attended with all its common Hazards; to fay
nothing of the Rcafons I had to cxped particular
Misfortunes to my felf
But I was hurry 'd on, and obcyM blindly the
Dilates of my Fancy rather than my Reafon : and
accordingly the Ship being fitted our, and the Car-
go furnifhed, and all Things done as by Agreement,
by my Partners in the Voyage, I went on Board
in an evil Hour again, the ift of Sept, 1659. being
the fame Day eight Year that I went from my
Father and Mother at Hull, in order to aft the
Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to my own
In te reft.
Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried
6 Guns, and 14 Men, befides the Mailer, his Boy,
and my felf; we had on Board no large Cargo of
Goods) except of fuch Toys as were fit for our
Trade with the Negroes, fuch as Beads, bits of
Glafs, Shells, and odd Trifles, efpecially little
Looking-GlaiTcs, Knives, Sciffars, Hatchets, and
the like.
The fame Day I went on Board we fet fail,
{landing away to the Northward upon our own
Coaft, with Defign to ftretch over for the African
Coaft, when they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of
Northen Latitude, which it fcems was the man-
ner of their Courfe in thofe Days. We had very
good Weather, only exceflive hot, all the way up-
on our own Coaft, till we came to the Height of
Cape St. AugnflinOj from whence keeping farther off
ar Sea we loft Sight of Land, and ftcer'd as if we
was bound for the Ifle Fernowl do Ncrcnhdy holding
Out
•our Conrfe N. E. by N. and leaving thofc Ides
on the Rail; in this Courfc we paft the Line in
about 12 Days Time, and were by our lad Obfer-
vation in 7 Degrees 22 Min. Northern Latitude,
when a violent lournado or Hurricane took us quite
out of our Knowledge; it began from the South-
Eaft, came about to the North-Weft, and then
fettled into the North-Eaft, from whence it blew
in fuch a terrible manner, that for 12 Days toge-
ther we could do nothing but drive, and fcudding
away before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate
and the Fury of the Winds dire&ed; and during
thefe 12 Days, I need not fay, that I expefted
every Day to be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any
in the Ship exped: to fave their Lives.
In this Diilrefs we had, befides the Terror of
the Storm, one of our Men died of the Calenture,
and one Man and the Boy wafh'd over-board. A-
bout the 12th Day the Weather abating a little,
the Mafter made an Obfervation as well as he
could, and found that he was in about 11 Degrees
North Latitude, but that he was. 22 Degrees of
Longitude difference \Vcll from Cape St. Auguftin&j
fo that he found he was gotten upon the Coaft
of Guiana^ or the North Part of Brafil, beyond
the River Ama&ones, toward that of the River
Oroonoque, commonly called the Great River, and
began to confult with me what Courfe he fliould
take, for the Ship was leaky, and very much dis-
abled, and he was going dirc&Iy back to the
Coail of Brafil.
I was poiiuvely againfl that, and looking over
the Charts of the Sea Coail of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for
us to have recourfe to, till we came within the
Circle of the Carribbee J/lands,and therefore refolved
to ftand away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off
at
C 48.3
at Sea, to avoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph
of Mexico, we might eafily perform, as we hoped,
in about fifteen Days Sail, whereas we eould not
poffibly make our Voyage to the Coaft of Africa
without fome Affiftance both to our Ship and to
our felves.
With this Defign we changed our Courfe, and
fteerM away N. W» by W. in order to reach fome
of our Englijh Iflands, where I hoped for Relief:
but our Voyage was otherwife determined, for
being in the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a fe-
cond Storm came upon us, which carryM us away
with the fame Impetuofity Weftward, and drove
us fo out of the very Way of all human Com-
merce, that had all our Lives been faved, as to
the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de-
voured by Savages than ever returning to our
own Country.
In this Diftrefsj the Wind flill blowing very
hard, one of our Men, early in the Morning, cry?d
out, Land : and we had no fooner run out of the
Cabin to look out, in. hopes of feeing where-
abouts in the World we were, but the Ship (truck
upon a Sand, and in a Moment her Motion being
fo flopped, the Sea broke over her in liich a man-
ner, that we expefted we fliould all have perifh'd
immediately * and we were immediately driven
into our clofe Quarters, to fhelter us from the very
Foam and Sprye of the Sea.
It is not eafy for any one, vvho has not been
in the like Condition, to defcribe or conceive the
Confirmation of Men in fuch Cireumftances; we
knew nothing where we were, or upon what Lan4
it was we were driven, whether an Ifland or the
Main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and
as the Rage of the Wind was ftill great, tho* ra-
ther lefs than at firft, we could not fo much as
hop©
hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes without
breaking in pieces, unlefs the Wind by a kind of
Miracle fhould turn immediately about; in a word,
we fat looking one upon another, and expe&ing
Death every Moment, and every Man a&ing ac-
cordingly, as preparing for another World, for
there was little or nothing more for us to do in
this; that which was our prefent Comfort, and all
the Comfort we had, was, that contrary to our
Expectation the Ship did not break yet, and that
the Matter faid the Wind began to abate.
Now tho* we thought that the Wind did a little
abate, yet the Ship having thus ftruck upon the
Sand, and flicking too faft for us to exped her get-
ting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of faving our
Lives as well as we could; we had a Boat at our
Stern juft before the Storm, but flic was fir ft ftav'd,
by dafhing againft the Ship's Rudder, and in the
next place lhe broke away, and either funk or was
driven oft" to Sea, fo there was no hope from her;
we had another Boat on board, but how to get
her off into the Se$ was a doubtful thing; how-
ever there vrasno room to debate, for we fancy'd
the Ship would break in pieces every Minute, and
fome told us flie was a&ually broken already.
In this Diftrefs the Mate of our Veflel lays hold
of the Boat, and with the help of the reft of the
Men they got her flung over the Ship fide, and
getting all into her,' let go, and committed our
felves, being n in Number, to God's Mercy and
die wild Sea ; for tho* the Storm was abated con-
fiderably, yet the S~ja went dreadful high upon
the Shore, and might well be call'd, Den wild Zee,
as the Dutch call the Sea in a Storm.
E And
[50]
And now our Cafe was very difmal indeed; for
we all faw plainly, chat the Sea went (o high, that
the Boat could not live, and that we fliould be ine-
vitably drown'd. As to making Sail, we had none,
nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with
it; (o we workM at the Oar towards the Land,
tho* with heavy Hearts, like Men going to Executi-
on ; for we all knew, that when the Boat came nea-
rer the Shore, {he would be dafh'd in a thoufand
Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However we
committed our Souls to God in the mod earneft
manner, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore,
we haften'd our Dcftruftion with our own Hands,
pulling as well as we could towards Land.
What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand,
whether Steep or Shoal, we knew not; the only
Hope that could rationally give us the leafl: Shadow
of Expectation, was, if we might happen intofome
Bay or Gulph, or the Mouth of fome River, where
by great Chance we might have run our Boat in, or
got under the Lee of the Land, and perhaps made
Imooth Water. But there was nothing of this ap-
peared ; but as we made nearer and nearer the Shore,
the Land looked more frightfu than the Sea.
After we had row'd, or rather driven about a
League and a Half, as we reckoned it, a raging
Wave, Mountain-like, came rowling a-fternof us,
and plainly bad us expedt the Coupe-de-Grace. In a
word, it took us with fi;ch a Fury, that it overfet
the Boat at once; and feparated us as well from
the Boat, as from one another, gave us not Time
hardly to fiy, O God 1 for we are all fwallowed
up in a Moment.
Nothing can defcribe the Confufion of Thought,
which I felt when I funk into the Water; for tho' I
fwam very well, yet I could not deliver myfelf from
the Waves, fo as to draw Breath, 'till the Wave
having
having driven me, or rather carried me a vz& foiy
on towards the Shore, and having fpent it felf went
back, and left me upon the Land almoft dry, but
half dead with the Water I took in. I had fo much
Prefence of Mind as well as Breath left, that feeing
my felf nearer the main Land than I expected, I got
upon my Feet, and endeavour'd to make on to-
wards the Land as faft asl could before another
Wave fliould return and take me up again. But I
foon found it was impoffible to avoid it, for I fa\v
the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill, and
as furious as an Enemy, which I had no Means or
Strength to contend with, my Bufmefs was to hold
my Breath, and raife my felf upon the Water, if I
could, and fo by fwimming to preferve my breath-
ing, and pilot my felf towards the Shore* if pofli-
b!e, my greateft Concern now being, that the Sea*
as it would carry me a great way towards the Shore
when it came on, might not carry me back again
with it when it gave back towards the Sea.
The Wave that came upon me again buried me
at once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own Body, and I
could feel my felf carried with a mighty Force and
Swiftnefs towards the Shore a very great way, but
I held my Breath, and affifted my felf to fwim ftill
forwards with all my Might. I was ready to burft
with holding my Breath, when as I felt my felf
riling up, fo to my immediate Relief I found my
Head and Hands fhoot out above the Surface of the
Water, and tho* it was not two Seconds of Time
that I could keep thy felf fo, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was
covered again with Water a good while, but not
fo long but I held it out; and finding the Water
had fpent it felf, and began td return, I ftruck for-
ward againft the return df the Waves, and felt
Ground again with my Feet. I flood ftill a few
E % Mo-
Moments to recover Breath, and till the Water
went from me, and ihen took to my Heels and run^
with what Strength I had, farther towards the
Shore; but neither would this deliver me from the
Fury of the Sea, which came pouring in after me
again, and twice more I was lifted up by the
Waves, and carried forwards, as before, the Shore
being very Hat.
The lafi: time of thefe two had well near been
fatal to me, tor the Sea having hurry'd me along as
before, landed me, or rather clalh'd me againft a
piece of a Rock, and that with fuch Force, as it
left me fenlkfs, and indeed helplefs as to my own
Deliverance, tor the Blow taking my Side and
Breaft, beat the Breath as it were quite out of my
Body, and had it returned again immediately I
mult have been Icrangled in the Water, but I re-
covered a little before the return of the Waves;
and feeing I fhould be covci'd again with the Wa-
ter, I rcfolv'd to hold fall by a piece of the Rock,
and fo to hold my Breath, if poflible, till the Wave
went back ; now as the Waves were not fo high as
at firft, being near Land, I held my Hold, till the
Wave abated, and then fetched another Run,
which brought me fo near the Snore, that the
next Wave, cho' it went over me, yet did not fo
fwallow me up as to carry me away, and the next
Run I took 1 got to the main Land, where, to
my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the Gifts of
the Shore, and fat me down upon the Grafs, free
from Danger, and quite out of the reach of the
Water.
I was.now landed,and fafe on (hore,and began to
look up and thank God chat my Life was fav'd in a
Cafe wherein there was ibme minutes before icarce
any room to hope. 1 believe it is impoffible to ex-
prefs to theLife what the Extafics andTranfports of
the
die Soul are, when it is fo fav'd, as I may fay5 out
of the very Grave; and I do not wonder now at
thac Cuftom, viz,. That when a Malefactor, who 
has the Halter about his Neck, is ty'd up, and juft
going to be turn'd off, and has a Reprieve brought
to him : I fay, 1 do not wonder that they bring a
Surgeon with it, I do not wonder that very Mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the Surprize may
not drive the animal Spirits from the Heart, and
overwhelm him :
For fudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at fir ft.
I walked about on the Shore, lifting up myHands
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a thou-
fand Geitures and Motions winch Icannotdefcribe,
reflecting upon all my Comrades that were drown'd,
and that there fliould not be one Soul fav'd but my
felf j for, as for them, I never faw them afterwards,
or any Sign of them, except three of their Hats,
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.
I caft my Eyes to the ftranded Vellel, when the
Breach and Froth of the Sea being (o big, I could
hardly fee it, it lay fo far off,and confiderd, Lord!
how was'ic poffible I could gee on Shore 1
After I had fohe'd myMmd with the comfortable
Part of my Condition, I began to look round me to
fee what kind of Place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I foon found my Comforts abater
and that, in a word, I had a dreadful Deliverance :
For I was wet, had no Cloaths to (hift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did 1 fee any Profpedt before me, but that of pe-
•rifiling with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild
'IBeaits • and that which was particularly afflidting '
to me, was, that I had no Weapon either to hunt
E 3 and
and kill any Creature for my Suftenance, or to de-
fend my felf againft any other Creature that might
defire to kill me for their's: In a word, I had no-
thing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-pipe, and a
little Tobacco in a Box; this was all my Provifion,
and this threw me into terrible Agonies of Mind,
that for a while I run about like a Mad-man; Night
coming upon me, I began with a heavy Heart to
confider what would be my Lot if there were a-
ny ravenous Beads in that Country, feeing at
Night they always come abroad for their Prey.
All the Remedy that ofrer'd tc my Thoughts at
that Time, was, to get up into a thick bufhy
Tree like aFirr, but thorny, which grew near me,
and where I refolv'd to fit all Night, and confider
the next Day what Death I fhould die, for as yet I
faw no Profped of Life; I walk'd about a Furlong
from the Shore, to fee if I could find any frefh Wa-
ter to drink, which I did, to my great Joy; and ha-
ving drank, and put £ little Tobacco in my Mouth
to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, and get-
ting up into it, endeavoured to place my felf fo, as
?hat if I flipuld fleep, I m.'ght not fall; and having
£ut me a fhort Stick, like a Truncheon, for my
Defence, I took up my Lodging, and having been
exceffively fatigu'd, I fell faft afieep, and flept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in
my Condition, and found my felf the moll refrefh'd
with it, that I think I ever was on fuch an Occa-
When I w^kxi, it was broad Day, the Weather
clear, and the Storm abated, fo that the Sea did
not rage and fwell as before : But that which fiir-
priz/dmemoft, was* that the Ship was lifted off
in the Night from the Sand where fhe lay, by
the Swelling of the Tide, and wras driven up al-
moft as far as the Rpck^ which I firft mentioned,
where
where I had been fo bruis'd by the dafiiing me a-
gafnft it; this being within about a Mile from the
Shore where I was, and the Ship feemingto ftand
upright ftill, I wifh'd myfelf on Board, that, at
leaft, I might fave fome neceffary Things for my
Ufe.
When I came down from my Appartment in the
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the firft Thing
I found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and
the Sea had tofs'd her up upon the Land, about
two Miles on my Right-Hand. I walk das far as I
could upon the Shore tojhave got to her, but found
a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the
Boat, which was about half a Mile Broad, fo I
came back for the prefect, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where 1 hop'd to find fome-?
thing tor my prefent Subfiftence.
A little after Noon I found the -Sea very calm,
and the Tide ebb'd fo far out, that I could come
within a quarter of a Mile of the Ship,* and here
I found a frefli renewing of my Grief, for I faw
evidently that if we had kept on Board, we had
been all fafe, that is ro fay, we had all.got fafe
on Shore, and I had not been fo miferable as to
be left entirely deftirute of all Comfort and Com-
pany, as now I was; this forced Tears from my
Eyes again, but as there was little Relief in that,
1 refolv'd, if poffible, to get to the Ship, fo I
pull'd off my Cloaths, for the Weather was hot to
Extremity, and took the Water; but when I came
to the Ship, my Difficulty was ftill greater to
know how to get on Board, for as £he lay a-ground,.
and high out of the Water, there was nothing
within my Reach to lay h<s>!d of, I fwam round
her twice, and the fecond Time I fpy'd a fmati
Piece of a Rope, which I wondered I did not fee
at tirft, hang down by the Fore-Chains fo low,
E-4 as
as that with great Difficulty I got hold of it, and
by the help of that Rope, got up into the Fore-
caftle of the Ship, here I found chat the Ship was
bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold,
but that fhe lay fo on the Side of a Bank of hard
Sand, or rather Earth, and her Stern lay liked up
upon the Bank, and her Head low almoft to
the Water; by this Means all her Quarter was
free» and all that was in that Part was dry;
for you may be fure my firft Work was to fearch
and to fee what was fpoil'd, and what was
free; and firft, I found that all the Ship's Pro~
vilions were dry and untouched by the Water,
and being very well difpos'd to eat, I went to
the Bread-Room and ril]'d my Pockets with Bif-
ket, and eat it as I went about other Things,
for I had no time to lofe? I alfo found fome Rum
in the great Cabin, of which I took a large
Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of:
to fpirit me for what was before me: Now I
wanted nothing but a Boat to furnifli my felf with
many Things which I forefaw would be very ne-
ceflary to me.
It was in vain to fit ftill and wifh for what was
not to be had, and this Extremity rouz'd my
Application; we had feveral (pare Yards, and
two or three large Sparrs of wood, and a fparc
Top-maft or two in the Ship; I refqiv'd to fall to
work with thefe, and flung as many of them
over Board; as I could manage for their Weight,
tying every one with a Rope, that they might
not drive away; when this was done I went down
the Ship's Side, and pulling them to me, I ty'd
four of them faft together at both Ends as well
as I could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying
two or three fhort Pieces of Plank upon them
crofs-ways, I found I could walk upon it very
well.,
•.."•-£ fc-
Well, but that it was able to bear any great
Weight, the Pieces being too light; fo I went to
work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a fpare
Top-maft into three Lengths, and>addedthem to
my Raft, with a great deal of Labour and Pains,
but hope of furnifhiug myfelfwith Neceffaries, en-
courag'd me to go beyond what I fliould have been
able to have done upon another Occafion.
My Raft was now ftrong enough to bear any
reafonable Weight; my next Care was what to
load it with, and how to preferve what I laid upon
it from the Surf of the Sea; but I was not long con-
iidering this, I firft laid all the Planks or Boards up-
on it that I could get, and having confider'd well
what I moll: wanted, I firift got three of the Sea-
mens Chefts, which I had had broken open and em-
pty M, andlower'd them down upon my Raft,* the
hrft of thefe I. fill'd with Provihons, viz,. Bread,
Rice, three Dutch Cheefcs, five Pieces of dry'd
Goat's, Flefh,which wehVdmuch upon, and a little
Remainder of European Corn, which had been laid
by for fome Fowls which we brought to Sea with
us, but the Fowls were kill'd ; there had been fome
Barlyand Wheat together, but, to my great Dis-
appointment, I found afterwards that the Rats had
eaten or fpoil'd it all ,• as for Liquors, I found Se-
veral Cafes of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, in
which were fome Cordial Waters, and in ailabout
five or fix Gallons of Rack, thefe I ftow'd by
themfelves, there being no need to put them into
the Cheft, nor no room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the Tide begin to flow, tho'
very calm, and I had the Mortification to fee my
Coat, Shirt, and Waft-coat, which I had left on
Shore upon the Sand, fwim away ,• as for my
Breeches, which were only Linnen and open-knee'd,
\ fwam on Board in them and my Stockings: How-
'. • - ev$r
ever this put me upon rummaging for Cloaths, of
which I found enough, but took no more than I
wanted for prefent Ufe, for I had other Things
which my Eye was more upon, as firft Tools to
work with on Shore, and it was after long fearch-
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Cheft, which
was indeed a very ufeful Prize to me, and much
more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would
have been at that time; I got it down to my Raft,
even whole as it was, without lofing Time to look
into it, fori knew in general what it contained.
My next Care was for fome Ammunition and
Arms; there were two very good Fowling-Pieces
in the great Cabin, and two Piflols, thefe I fe-
cur'd firft, with fome Powder-Horns, and afmall
Bag of Shot, and two old rufty Swords ; I knew
there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship,
but knew not where our Gunner had ftow'd them,
but wirh much Search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water, thofe
two I got to my Raft, with the Arms, and now
I thought my felf pretty well freighted, and be-
gan to think howl fhouldget to Shore with them,
having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and theleaft
Cap full of Wind would have overfet all my Na-
vigation.
I had three Encouragements, x. A fmooth
calm Sea. 2. The Tide riling, and fetting in to
the Shore. 3. What little Wind there was blew
i^e towards the Land ; and thus, having found two
or three broken Oars belonging'to the Boat, and
beiides the Tools which where in the Cheft, I found
rwo Saws, an Axe, and a.Hammer, and with this
Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile, or thereabouts my
Raft went very well, only that I found it drive a
little diftant from the Place where I had landed be-
fore, by which IperccivM that there was fome In-
draft
draft of the Water, and confequeqtly, I hop'd to
find fome Creek or River there, which I might
make ufe of as a Port to get to Land with my
Cargo.
As Iimagind, fo it was, there appear'd before
me a little opening of the Land, and I found a
itrong Current of the Tide to fet into it, fo I gui-
ded my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Mid-
dle of the Stream : But here I had like to have fuf-
fer'd a fecond Shipwreck, which, if I had, I think
verily would have broke my Heart, for knowing
nothing of the Coaft, my Raft run a-ground at one
End pf it upon a Shoal, and not being a-ground at
the other End, it wanted but a little that all my
Cargo had flipp'd off towards that End that was
a-float, and fo falln into the Water: I did ray ut-
moft by fetting my Back againft the Chefts, t© keep
them in their Places, but could not thruft off the
Raft with all my Strength, neither durft I ftir
from the Pofture I was in, but holding up the
Chefts with all my Might, flood in that Manner
near half an Hour, in which time the rifing of the
Water brought me a little more upon a Level,
and a little after, the Water {kill rifing, my Raft
floated again, and I thruft her off with the Oar I
had, into the Channel, and then driving up higher,
I at length found my felf in the Mouth of a little
River, with Land on both Sides, and a ftrong
Current or Tide running up, I look'd on both Sides
for a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was not
willing to be driven too high up the River, ho-
ping in time to fee fome Ship at Sea, and there-
fore refolv'd to place my felf as near the Coaft as I
could.
At length I fpy'd a little Cove on the right
Shore of the Creek, to which with great Pain and
difficulty I guided my Raft, and atlaft gotfo near,
as
as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could
thruft her dircfily in, but here I had like to have
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again ; for chat Shore
lying pretty fteep, that is to fay doping, there
was no Place to land, but where one End of my
Float, if it run en Shore, would lie fo high, and
the other fink lower as before, that it would en-
danger my Cargo again: All that I could do, was
to wait 'till the Tide was at the higheft, keeping
the Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the
Side of it faft to the Shore, near a flat Piece of
Ground which I expefted the Water would flow
ovbr; and fo it did : As foon as I found Water
enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot of Water,
I thruft her on upon that flat Pcice of Ground, and
there faften'd or mor'd her by flicking my two
broken Oars into the Ground ,* one on one Side
near one End, and one or the other Side near the
other End ; and thus I lay till the Water ebb'd a-
way, and left my Raft and all my Cargo fafe on
Shore.
My next Work was to view the Country, and
feek a proper Place for my Habitation, and where
to flow my Goods to fecure them from whatever
might happen ; where I was, I yet knew not, whe-
ther on the Continent or on an Illand, whether in-
habited, or not inhabited; whether in Danger of
wild Beafls or not: There was a Hill not above a
Mile from me, which rofe up very Iteep and high,
and which feem'd to over top fome other Hill$
which lay as in a Ridge from it Northward; I took'
out one of the Fowling-Pieces, and one of the Pi-
ftols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I
travelled for Difcovcry up to the Top of that Hill,
where after I had with great Labour and Difficult
ty got to the Top, I faW my Fate to my great Af-
fliction, (viz,.) that I was in an lfland environ'd
every
every way with the Sea, no Land to be feen, ex-
cept fome Rocks, which lay a great way off, and
two fmall Iflands lefs than this, which lay. about
three Leagues to the Weft.
1 found alfo that the Ifland I was in was barren,
and, as I faw good reafon to believe, uninhabited,
except by wi d Beafts, of whom however I faw
none, yet I faw abundance of Fowls, but knew
not their Kinds, neither when I kill'd them could
I tell what was fit for Food and what not; at my
coming back I (hot at a great Bird, which I faw
fitting upon a Tree on the fide of a great Wood, I
believe it was the firft Gun that had been fird
there lince the Creation of the World, I had no
fooner fir'd, but from all the Parts of the Wood
there arofe an innumerable Number of Fowls of
many forts, making a conhis'd fcreaming and cry-
ing, every one according to his ufual Note, but
not one of them of any Kind that I knew : as for
the Creature 1 kilfd, I took it to be a Kind of a
Hawk, its Colour and Beakrefembling it, but had
no Talons or Claws more than common, its Flefli
was Carrion, and fit for nothing.
Contented with this Difcovery I came back to
my Raft, and fell to work to bring my Cargo on
fhore, which took me up the reft of that Day, and
what to do with my felf at Night I knew not, nor
indeed where to reft, for I was afraid to lie down
on the Ground, not knowing but fome wild Beaft
might devour me, tho*, as I afterwards found, there
was really no need for thofe Fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricado'd my
felf round with the Cheils and Boards that I had
brought on fliorc, and made a kind of a Hut-for
that Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet faw not
which way to fupply my felf, except that I had
feen
feen two or thr<*e Creatures like Hares run out ot
the Wood where I fhdt the Fowl.
I now began to confide^ that I might yet get a
great many Things out of the Ship which would
be ufeful to me, and particularly foilie of the Rig-
ging and Sails, and fuch other Things as might
come to Land, and I refolved to make another
Voyage on board the Veflfel, if poifible; and as I
knew that the firft Storm that blew muft neceflari-
ly break her all in pieces, I refol/d to fet all other
Things apart till I got every Thing out of the Ship
that I could get; then I called a Council, that is
to fay, in my Thoughts, whether I fhould take
back the Raft, but this appearYl impracticable;
fo I refolved to go as before, when the Tide was
down, and I did fo, only that I ftripp'd before I
went from my Hut, having nothing but a che-
quer'd Shirt, a Pair of Linnen Drawers, and a Paitf
of Pumps on my Feet.
1 got on board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd
a fecond Raft, and having had Experience of the
firft, I neither made this fo unwcildy, nor loaded
it fo hard, but yet I brought away feveral Things
very ufeful to me; as firft, in the Carpenter's Stores
I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spikes,
a great skrew Jack, a Dozen or two of Hatchets,
and above all, that moft ufeful Thing call'd a
Grindftone, all thefe I fecur'd together, with feve-
ral Things belonging to the Gunner, particularly
two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of Mus~i
kct Bullets, feven Muskets, and another Fowling
Piece, with fome fmall Quantity of Powder more.,
a large Bag full of fmall Shot, and a great Roll of
Sheet Lead, but this was fo heavy I could not
hoife it up to get it over the Ship fide,
Befides thefe things I took all the Mens Cldaths
that I could find, and a fpare Fore-top-fail, a Ham-
meek,
mock and fome Bedding; and with this I loaded
my fecond Raft, and brought them all fate on Shore
to my very great Comfort.
I was under fome Apprehenfions during my Ab-
(ence from the Land, that at leaft my Provifions
might be devour'd on Shore; but when I came back,
I found no Sign of any Vifitor, only there fat a
Creator like a wild Cat upon one of the Chefts,
which when I came towards it, ran away a little
Diftance, and then flood ftill; fhe fat very com-
posed, and unconcerned, looked full in my Face,
as if (lie had a Mind to be acquainted with me, I
prefented my Gun at her, but as flie did not under-
Hand it, (he was pcrfe&ly unconcerned at it, nor
d id (he offer to ftir away ; upon which I tofs'd her
a bit of Bisket, tho' by the Way I was not very
free of it, for my Store was not great: However,
Ifpar'd her a bit, I fay, and fhe went to it, fmell'd
of it, and eat it, and look'd (as pleas'd) for more,
but I thank'd her, and could fpare no more; fo fhe
march'd off.
Having got my fecond Cargo on Shore, tho* I
was fain to open the Barrels of Powder, and bring
them by Parcels, fo they were too heavy, being
large Casks; I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and fome Poles which I cut tor
that purpofe, and into this Tent I brought every
Thing that I knew would fpoil, either with Rain
or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chefts and Casks
up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from a-
ny fudden Attempt, either from Man or Beaft.
When I had done this I blocked up the Door of
the Tent with fome Boards within, and an empty
Cheft let up an End without, and fpreading one
of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pi-
ftols jiift at my Head, and my Gun at Length by
me, X went to Bed for the firft Time, and flept
very
very quietly all Night, for I was very weary and
heavy, for the Night before I had flept little, and
had labour'd very hard all Day, as well to fetch
all thofe Things from the Ship, as to get them on
Shore.
I had the biggeft Magazine of all Kinds now
that ever was laid up, 1 believe, for one Man;
but I was not fatisfy a ftill, for while the Ship fat
upright in that Pofture, I thought I ought to get
every thing out of her that I could, fo every Day
at low Water I went on board, and brought away
fome thing or other; but particularly the third
time I went I brought away as much of the Rig-
ging as I could, as alfo all the fmall Ropes and
Rope-twine I could get, with a Piece of fpare Can-
vafs, which was to mend the Sails upon occafion,
the Barrel of wet Gunpowder; in a wordj brought
away all the Sails firft and laft, pnly that I was
fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a
time as I could, for they were no more ufeful to
be Sails, but as meer Canvafs only.
But that which comforted me more ftill was,
that at laft of all, after I had made five or fix fuch
Voyages as thefe, and thought I had nothing more
to expeft from the Ship that was worth my med-
ling with, I fay, after all this, I found a great Hog-
jfhead of Bread, and three large Runlets of Rum or
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine
Flower, this was furprizing to me,- becaufe I had
.given over cxpe&ing any more Provifions, except
what was fpoil'd by the Water; I foon emptied the
Hogfhead of that Bread, and wrapt it up Parcel
by Parcel in pieces of the Sails, which I cut out;
and in a word, I got all this fafe on fhore alfo.
The next Day I made another Voyage; and
now having plundered the Ship of what was porta-
ble
05]
ble and fit to hand out, I began with the Cables;
and cuttiug the great Cable into Peces, fuch as
1 could move, I got two Cables and a Hawfer on
Shore, with all the Iron-work I could get ;, and
having cut down the Spritfail-yard, and the Mif-
fen-yard, and every Thing I could to make a large
Raft, I loaded with it all thofc heavy Goods, and
came away: but my good Luck began now to
leave me; for this Raft was fo unweildy, and fo
overloaden, that after I was enter'd the little Cove,
where I had landed the reft of my Goods, not be-
ing able to guide it fo handily as I did the other,
it overfet, and threw me and all my Cargo into
the Warer; as for my felf it was no great Harm,
for I was near the Shore ,• but as to my Cargo,
it was great Part of it loft, efpecially the Iron,
which I expected wou'd have been of great Ufe
tome : However, when the Tide was out, I got
moll of the Pieces or Cable afhore, and fome of
the Iron, tho> with infinite Labour ; for I was fain
to dip for it into the Water, a Work which fa-
tigu'd me very much : After this I went every Day
"on Board, and brought away what I could get.
. I had been now thirteen Days on Shore, and had
been eleven times on Board the Ship ; in which
Time I had brought away all that one Pair of
Hands could well be fuppos d capable to bring, tho*
I believe verily, had the calm Weather held, I
fhould have brought away the whole Ship Piece
by Piece: But preparing the 12th Time to go on
Board, I found the Wind began to rife; however
at low Water I went on Board, and tho' I thought
I had rumag'd the Cibin fo etFe&ually, as that no-
thing more could be found, yet I difcover'd a Lock-
er with Drawers in it, in one of which I found two
or three Razors, and oue Pair of large Sciflars,
with fome ten or a dozen of good Knives and
F Foaks;
Forks; in another I found about Thirty fix £ouncl
value in Money, fome Eurvpean Coin, fome Brajtly
fome Pieces of Eight, fome Gold, fome Silver,
1 fmil'd to myfelf at the Sight of this Money,
0 Drug i faid I aloud, what art thou good for ?
Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the Ground, one of thofe Knives is worth all
this Heap, I have no Manner of ufe for thee, e'en
remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as
a Creature whofe Life is not worth faving. How-
ever upon fecond Thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, I began
to thing of making another Raft, but while I was
preparing this, I tound the Sky over caft and the
Wind began to rife, and in a Quarter of an Hour
it blew a frefli Gale from the Shore; it prefently
occur'd to me* that it was in vain to,pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that
it was my Bufinefs to be gone before the Tide of
Flood began, otherwife I might not be able to
reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let my
felf down into the Water, and fwam crofs the
Channel, which lay between the Ship and the
Sands, and even that with Difficulty enough^ part-
ly with the Weight of the Things 1 had about me,
and partly the roughnefs of the Water, for the
Wind rofe very haftily, and before it was quite
high Water, it blew a Storm*
But I was got Home to my little Tent, where
1 lay with all my Wealth about me very fecure.
I blew very hard all that Night and in the Morn-
ing when I look'd out, behold no more Ship was to
befeen; I was a little furpriz'd, but recover'd my
felf with this fatisfaftory Refle&ion, viz,. That I
had loft no Time, nor abated no Diligence to get
every Thing out of her that could be ufefulto me,
and that indeed there was little left in her, that I
was
was able to bring away, if I had had more
Time.
I now gave over any more Thoughts of the
Ship, or of any Thing out of her, except what
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed
divers Pieces of her afterwards did ; but thofe
Things were of fmall Ufe to me.
My Thoughts were now wholly employ\I about
fecuring my felf, either againft Savages, if any
Ihould appear, or wild Beafts, i( any were in the
Ifland ; and I had many Thoughts of the Method
how todothis>and whatkindof Dwelling to make,
whether I fhould make me a Cave in the Earth, or
d Tent upon the Earth : And, in ffcort, I refolv'd
upon both, the Manner and Defcription of which
it may not be improper to give an Account of.
I foon found the Place I was in was not for my
Settlement, particularly becaufe in was upon a low
moorifh Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd
would not be wholefome, and more particularly
becaufe there was no frefh Water near it, fo I re-
folv'd to find a more healthy and more convenient
Spot of Ground.
I confulted feveral Things in my Situation which
I found would be proper for me, ift. Health, and
frefh Water I juft now mention'd. 2dly, Shelter
from the Heat of the Sun. 3dly, Security from
ravenous Creatures, whether Men or Beafts. 4thly,
a View to the Sea, that if God fent any Ship in
Sight, I might not lofe any Advantage for my De-
liverance, of which I was not willing to banifli all
my Expectation yet.
In fearch of a Place proper for this, I found a
little Plain on the fide of a rifing Hill, whofe
Front towards this little Plain was fteep as a
Houfe-fide, fo that nothing could come down
upon me from the Top; on the fide of this Rock
F 2 there
there was a hollow Place worn a little Way in like
the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was not
really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all.
On the flat of the Green, juft before this hollow
Placejrefolv'd to pitch my Tent: This Plain was
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay like a Green before my
Door, and at the End of it defcended irregularly
every Way down into the low Grounds by the
Sea-fide. It was on the N.N. IV. Side of the Hill,
fo that I was fhelter'd from the Heat every Day,'
ill it came to a JV. and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,'
which in thofe Countries is near the Setting.
Before I fet up my Tent, I drew a half Circle
before the hollow Place, which took in about ten
Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock,,and
twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning
and Ending.
In this half Circle I pitched two Rows of ftrong
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they
flood very firm like Piles, the biggeft End being
out of the Ground about five Foot and an half,
and (harpenM on the Top ; the two Rows did not
ftand above fix Inches from one another.
Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut
in the Ship, and laid them in Rows one upon
another, within the Circle between thefe two
Rows of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other
Stakes in the Infide, leaning again ft them, about
two Foot and a half high, like a Spur to a Poft,
and this Fence was fo ftrong, that neither Man or
Bead could get into it or over it: This coft me
a great deal of Time and Labour, efpecially to cut
the Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place,
and drive them into the Earth.
The Entrance into this Place I made'to be not
by a Door, but by. a;. fliort Ladder, to go over
the
f 69.]
the Top, which the Ladder, when I was m I lifted
over after me, and fo I was compleatly fenced in,
and forify'd, as I thought, from all the World,
and consequently flept fecure in the Night, which
otherwife I could not have done, tho' as it appeared
afterward, there was no need of all this Caution
from the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from.
Into this Fence or Fortrefs, with infinite La-
bour, I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provisions,
Ammunition and Stores, of which yon have the
Account above, and I made me a large Tent, which
to preferve me from the Rains, that in one Part of
the Year are very violent there, I made double, viz,.
one fmaller Tent within, and one larger Tent above
it, and covered the uppermoft with a larger Tar-
paulin which I had fav'd among the Sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed
which I had brought on Shore, but in a Ham-
mock, which was indeed a very good one, and be-
longed to the Mate of the Ship.
Into this Tent 1 brought all my Provifions, and
every thing that would fpoil by the Wet, and ha-
ving thus enclosed ail my Goods, I made up the
Entrance, which till now I had left open, and fo
pafs'd and repafs'd, as I faid by a fhort Ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my Way
into the Rock, and bringing all the Earth and
Stones that I dug down out thro' my Tent, I laid
'em up within my Fence in the Nature of a Ter-
ras, that fo it rais'd the Ground within about a
Foot and half; and thus I made me a Cavejuft
behir.d my Tent, which ferv'd me like a Cellar to
my Houfe- *
It coft me much Labour, and many Days, be-
fore allthefe things were brought to Perfection, and
therefore I muft go back to fome other things which
took up fome of my Thoughts. At the fame time it
F 3 happened,
luppcn'd after I had laid my Scheme for the fet-
ting up my Tent, and making the Cave, that a
Storm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud, a
fudden Flafh of Lightning happen'd, and after
that a great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the
Efte&of it; I was not fo much furpriz'd with the
Lightning, as I was with a Thought which dar-
ted into my Mind as fwift as the Lightning it felf :
0 my Powder! my very Heirt funk within me,
when I thought, that at one Blaft all my Powder
may be deltroy'd; on which, not my Defence on-
ly, but the providing me Food, as I thought, en-
tirely depended; I was nothing near fo anxious a~
bout my own Danger, tho' had the Powder took
fire, I had never known who had hurt me.
Such Impreffion did this make upon me, that
after the Storm was over, I laid afide all my
Works, my Buildings, and Fortifying, and ap-
ply'd my felf to make Bags and Boxes to feparate
the Powder, and keep it a little and a little in a
Parcel, in hope, that whatever might come, it
might not all take Fire at once, and to keep it fo
apart, that it fhould not be pofTtble to make one
Part fire another. I finifli'd this Work in about a
Fortnight, and I think my Powder, which in all
was about 2401b. we'ght, was divided, in not lefs
than a hundred Parcels ; as to the Barrel that had
been wet, I did not apprehend any Danger from
that, folplac'dit in my new Cave, which in my
Fancy I called my Kitchen, and the reft I hid up
and down in Holes among the Rocks, fo that no
wet might come to ir, marking very carefully where
1 laid it.
In the Interval of time while this was doing, I
went out once at lead every Day with my Gun, a$
well to divert my felf, as to fee i( I could kill any
thing
[7i 1
thing fit for Food, and as near as I could to ac-
quaint myfelf with what the Ifland produced. The
flrft Time I went out I prefently difcover'd that
there were Goats in the Ifland, which was a great
Satijfaftion to me; but then it was attended with
this Misfortune to me, viz,. That they were fo
fliy, fo fubtile, and fo fwift of Foot, that it was
the difficulteft'Thing in the World to come at them :
But I was hot difcourag'd at this, not doubting
but I might now and then flioot one, as it foon hap-
pened ; for after I had found their Haunts a little,
I laid wait in this Manner for them : I obferv'd if
they faw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon
the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
Fright; but if they were feeding in the Valleys,
and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice
of me; from whence I concluded, that by the
Pofuion of their Opticks, their Sight was fo di-
rected downward, that they did not readily fee
Objects that were above them; fo afterwards I
took this Method, I always climbed the Rocks firft
to get above them, and then had frequently a fair
Mark. The firft Shot I made among thefe Crea1
tares, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid
by her which flic gave Suck to, which grieved me
heartily; but when the old one fell, the Kid flood
flock ftill by her 'till I came and took her up ; and
not only fo, but when I carryM the old one witH
me upon my Shoulders, the Kid foltow'd me quite
to my Enclofure, upon which I laid down the
Pam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and car-
ry'd it over my Pale, in-Hopes to have bred it up
tame, but it would not eat, fo I was force! to kill
it, and eat it myfelf ,* thefe two fupply'd me with!
Flefli a great while, for I eatfparingly ; and fav'd
my Provifions (my Bread efpccially) as much a£
poflible I could.
F 4 Having
C7» ]
Having nowfixVl my Habitation, I found it ab^-
folutely neceffary to provide a Place to make a
Fire in, and Fewel to burn ,* and what I did for
that, as alfo how I enlarged my Cave, and what
Conveniences I made, I fhall give a full Account
of in its Place: But I muft firft give fome little
Account of myfelf, and of my Thoughts about
Living, which it may well be fuppofed were not a
few*
I had a difinal Profpeft of my Condition, for as
I was not call: away upon that Ifland without be-
ing driven, as is faid, by a violent Storm quite out
of the Courfe of our intended Voyage, and a great
Way,w"&. fome hundreds of Leagues out of the
ordinary Courfe of the Trade of Mankind, I had
great Reafon to confider it as a Determination of
Heaven, that in this defolate Place, and in this
defolate Manner I fhould end my Life ,• the Tears
would run plentifully down my Face when I made
thefe Reflections, and fametimes I would expoftu-
latc with myfelf, Why Providence fhould thus
compleatly ruin its Creatures, and render them fo
abfolutely miferable, To without Help abandoned,
fo entirely deprefs'd, that it could hardly be ra-
tional to be thankful for fuch a Life.
But fomething always return \t fwift upon me to
check thefe Thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my
Hand by the Sea-fide, I was very peniive upon the
Subjed of my prefent Condition, when Reafon as
it were eApoftulate with me t'other Way, thus:
Well, you are in a defolate Condition 'tis true, but
pray remember, Where are the reft of you? Did
not you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where
2te the Ten; Why were not they fav'd, and you
loft? Why we;e you fingl'dout? Is it better to be
h^rQ or there ? And then I pointed to the Sea. All
v ... I , r . Evils
Evils are to be confider'd with the Good th^t is
in. them, and with what worfe attends them.
Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was
furnifh'd for my SubMence, and what would have
been my Cafe if it had not happen'd, Which was
an Hundred T'houfand to One, that the Ship floated
from the Place fhe was firft ftruck and was dri-
ven fo near to the Shore, that I had Time to get
all thefe Things out of her: What would have
been my Cafe, if I had been to have liv'dinthe
Condition in which I at firft came on Shore, with-
out Neceflaries of Life, or Neceflaries to fupply
and procure them ? Particularly, faid I aloud, (tho'
to my felf) what fhould I have done without a
Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools,
to make any Thing, or to work with, without
Cloaths, Bedding, a Tent, or any Manner of
Covering, and that now I had all thefe to a fuffi-
cient Quantity, and was in a fair Way to provide
my felt* in fuch a Manner, as to live without
my Gun when my Ammunition was fpent; fo
that I had a tollerable View of fnbfifting without
any Want as long as I hVd •> for I confider'd from
the beginning how I would provide for the Acci-
dents that might happen, and for the Time that
was to come, even not only after my Ammunition
fhould be fpent, but even after my Health or
Strength fhould decay.
I confefs I had not entertained any Notion of my
Ammunition being deftroy'd at one Blaft, I mean,
my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this
made the Thoughts of it fo furpnfing to me when
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I obferv'd juft now.
And now being to enter into a melancholly
Relation of a Scene of filent Life, fuch perhaps as
was never heard of in the World before, I fhall
take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its
Order
f 74]
Orden It was by my Account, the 30th of Sep,
when, in the Manner as abovefaid, J firft fet Foot
upon this horrid' Ifland, when the Sun being, to,
us, in its Autumnal Equinox, was almoft juftover
my Head, for I reckoned mytelf, by O bier nation,
to be in the Latitude of 5? Degrees 22 Minutes,
North of the Line. '" . ''l '"
After I had been there about ten or twelve
Days it came into my 'Thoughts, that I fhould
lofe my Reckoning of- Time for want of Books
and Pen and Ink, and fhould even forget the Sab-
bath Days from the working Days ; but tor prevent
this, I cut it with my Knife upon a large Poft, in
Capital Letters, and making it into a great Crofs,
I let it up on the Shore where I firft landed, viz,.' I
came on Shore here on the $oth 0/ Sept. 1659. Upon
she Sides of this Square Poft, I cut every Day a
Notch with my Knife, and every feventh Notch
was as long again as the reft, and every firft Day of
the Month as long again as that long one, and thus
I kept my Kalender, or weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of Time.
In the next Place we are to obferve, that among
the many Things which I brought out of the Ship
in the feveral Voyages, which asabovemention'd,
I made to it, I got feveral Things, of lefs Value,
but not at all his ufeful to me, which I omitted
letting down before; asin particular, Pens, Ink,
and Paper, feveral Parcels in the Captain's, Mate's,
Gunner's, and Carpenters, keeping, three or four
Compafles, fome Mathematical Inftruments, Di-
als, Perfpeftives, Charts, and Books of Navigati-
on, all which I huddled together; whether I might
want them or no ; alfo I found three very good
Bibles, which came to me in my Cargo from Eng-
land, and which I had packed up among m'y Thing's:
fome Portuguese Books alfo, and among them two
ot
or three Popifh Prayer-Books, and feveral other
Books; all which I carefully fecur'd. And I mull
not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and
two Cats ; of whofe eminent Hiftory, I may have
Occafion to fay fomething in its Place,• for I car-
ry 'd both the Cats with me; and as for the Dog,
he jump'd out of the Ship of himfelf and fwam
on Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore
with my firft Cargo, and was a trufty Servant to
me many Years: I wanted nothing he could fetch
me, nor any Company that he could make up to
me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but
that would not do. As I obferv'd before, I found
Pen, Ink, and Paper, and I husbanded them to the
utmoft; and I (hall fhew, that while my Ink la-
fled, I kept Things very exact; but after that was
gone, I could not; for I could not make any Ink,
by any Means that I could devife.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithftanding all that I hadamafs'd to-
gether; and of thefe, this of Ink was one, as alfo
Spade, Pick-Ax, and Shovel, to dig or remove
the Earth, Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for
Lumen, Ifconlearn'd to want that without much
Difficulty.
. This Want of Tools made every Work I did, go
on heavily; and it was near a whole Year before I
had entirely finifli'd my little Pale or furrounded
Habitation : The Piles or Stakes, which were as
heavy as X could well lift, were a long Time in-cut-
ting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far
in bringing home ; fo that I fpent fometimes two
Days in cutting and bringing home one of thofc
Pofts, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground;
for which Purpofel got a heavy Piece of Wood
at firft, but at Iaft bethought myfelf of one of the
Iron Crows, which however, tho* I found it, yet

it made driving thofe Pofts or Piles very ladorious
and tedious Work,
But what need I ha' been concerned, at the Te-
dioufnefs of any Thing I had to do, feeing I had
Time enough to do it inj nor had I any other Em-
ployment, if that hajl been over, at leaft, that I
could forefee, except the ranging the Ifland to feek
for Food, which I did more or lefs every Day.
I now began to confider ferioufly my Conditi-
on, and the Circumftancel was reduced to, and I
drew up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not fo
much to leave them to any that were to come af-
ter me; for I was like to have but few Heirs, as
to deliver my Thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and affiifting my Mind; and as my Reafon
began now to mafter my Defpondency, I began
to comfort myfelf as well as I could, and to fet
the Good againft the Evil, that I might have
fomcthing to diflinguifh my Cafe from worfe; and
I dated it very impartially, like Debtor and Cre-
ditor, the Comforts I enjoy'd, againft the Mife-
ries I fufter'd, thus:

to the Shorey that I have
gotten out fo many neceffa-
ry Things as will either
fupply my lVants> or ena-
ble me to fupply my felf e-

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Tefti-
mony, that there was fcarce any Condition in the
World fomiferable, but there was fomethrngu^-
tive, or (omcthingpoffitive, to be thankful for in it
and let this ftand as a D.'redion from the Experi-
ence of the moft miferab.'e of all Conditions in;
this World, that we may always find in it fome-
thing to comfort our felves from, and to fet in the
Defcription of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side
of the Account.
Having now brought my Mind a little to relifh
my Condition, and given over the looking to Sea,
to fee if I could fpy a Ship; I fay, giving over
thefe Things, I began to apply my felf to accom-
modate my way of Living, and to make Things
as eafy to me as I could.
I have

I have already defcribed my Habitation, which
was a Tent under the Side of a Rock, furrounded
with a ftrong Pale of Ports and Cables, but I
might now rather call it a Wall, for I rais'd a kind
tof Wall up againft it of Turfs, about two Foot
thick on the Outfide, and after fome time, I chink
it was a Year and half, I rais'd Rafters from it
leaning to the Rock, and thatch'd or cover'd it
with Boughs of Trees, and fuch Things as I could
get to keep out the Rain, which I found at fome
times of the Year very violent.
I have already obferved how I brought all my
Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave which I
had made behind me: But I mud obferve too,
that at firft, this was a confused Heap of Goods,
which as they lay in no Order, fo they took up
all my Place; I had no room to turn my feJf: So I
fet my felf to enlarge my Cave and Works farther
into the Earth ; for it was loofe fandy Rock,
which yielded eafily to the Labourl beftowed on
it: And fo when I found I was pretty fafe as to
Beads of Prey, I work'd fideways to the Right-
Hand into the Rock; and then turning to the
Right again, work'd quite out, and made me a
Door to come out, on the Outfide of my Pale or
tification.
This gave me not only Egrefs and Regrefs, as
it were a Back-way to my Tent and to my Store-
houfc, but gave me room to flow my Goods.
And now I began to apply my felf to make fuch
neceffary Things as I found I mod wanted, as par-
ticularly a Chair and a Table; for without thefel
was notable to enjoy the few Comforts I had in
the World; I could not write or eat, or do feveral
Things with fo much Pleafure without a Table.
So I went to work ; and here I muft needs ob-
ferve, that as Reafon is the Subftance and Origi-
nal
£79] . ,
m\ of the Mathematicks, fo by ftating and fijtia-
ring every Thing by Reafon, and by making the
moft rational Judgment of Things, every Man
may be in time Matter of every mechanick Art. t
had never handled Tool in my Life, and yet in
time by Labour, Application and Contrivance, I
found at laft that 1 wanted nothing but I could
have made it, especially if I had had Tools; how-
ever, I made abundance of Things, even without
Tools, andfome with no more Tools than an Adze
and a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made
that way before, and that with infinite Labour:
For Example* if I wanted a Board, I had no other
Way but to cut down a Tree, fet on an Edge be-
fore me, and hew it flat on cither Side with m^
Ax, till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank,
and then dubb it fmooth with my Adze. It is true,
by this Method I could make but one Board out
<of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy for
but Patience, any more than I had for the prodi-
gious deal of Time and Labour which it took me
up to make a Plank or Board : But my Time or
Labour was little worth, and fo it was as well em-
ployed one way as another.
However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as
I obferv'd above* in the firft Place, and this I did
out of the fhort Pieces of Boards that I brought
on my Raft from the Ship: But when I had
Wrought out fome Boards, as above, I made large
Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and a Half one
over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in a
Word, to feparate every Thing at large in their
Places, that I might come eafily at them; I knocked
Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns
and all Things that would hang up.
So
So that had my Cave been to be feen, it look'd
like a general Magazine of all neceflary Things,
and I had every Thing fo ready at my Hand, that
it was a great Pleafure to me to fee all my Goods
in fuch Order, and efepicialjy to find my Stock of
all Neceffaries fo great.
And now it was when I began to keep a Jour-
nal of every Day's Employment, for indeed at firft
I was in too much Hurry, and not only Hurry
as to Labour, but in too much Difcompofure of
Mind, and my Journal would ha7 been full of many
dull things. For Example, I muft have faid thus:
Sept. the 30th, After I got to Shore and hadefcap'd
drowning, inftead of being thankful to God for
my Deliverance, having firft vomited with the
great Quantity of fait Water which was gotten
into my Stomach, and recovering my felf a little, I
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands an^i beat-
ing my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Mifery,
and crying out I was undone, undone,- till tir'd
and taint I was fore'd to lye down on the Ground
to repofe, but durft not fleep for fear of being
devoured.
Some Days after this, and after I had been on
board the Ship, and got all that I could out of
her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top
of a little Mountain and looking out to Sea in
hopes of feeing a Ship, then fancy at a vaft Di-
ftance I fpy'd a Sail, pieafe my felf with the Hopes
of it, and then after looking fteadily till I was al-
moft blind, lofe it quite, and lit down and weep
like a Child, and thus encrcafe my Mifery by my
Folly.
But having gotten over thefe things in fome Mea*
fure, and having fettled my Houfboiild-Stuff and
Habitation, made me a Table and a Chair, and all
as handfome about me as I could, I bega*tto keep

The JOURNAL.
SEptember 30, 1659. I poor mifcrable Rob'wfon
Crufoe, being Shipwrecked, during a dreadful
Storm in the Offing, came on Shore on this dif-
mal unfortunate Ifland, which I call'd the Ifland
of-Defpair, all the reft of the Ship's Company be-
ing drown'd, and my felt almoft dead.
. All the reft of the Day I fpent in affliaing my
•{elf at the difmal Circumftances I was brought to,
[viz,, I had neither Food, Houfe, CJoaths, Wea-
pon, or Place to fly to, and in Defpair of any Re-
lief, faw nothing but Death before me, either that-
I fhould be devour'd by wild Beafts, murther'd by
Savages, or ftarv'd to Death for want of Food. At
the Approach of Night, I flept in a Tree for fear
of wild Creatures, but flept foundly tho' it rain'd
all Night.
OBoler 1. In the Morning I faw to my great
Surprife the Ship had floated with the high Tide,
and was driven on Shore again much nearer the
Ifland, which as it was fome Comfort on one hand,
for feeing her fit upright, and not broken to Pieces,
I hop'd, if the Wind abated, I might get on Board,
2nd get fome Food and Necelfaries out of her for
my "Relief; fo on the other hand it renew'd my
Grief at the Lofs of my Comrades, who I ima-
gin'd if we had all ftaid on Board might have
fav'd the Ship, or at leaft that they would not have
been all drown'd as they were; and that had the
Men been fav'd, we might perhaps have built us
a Boat out ot the Ruins of the Ship, to Jhave car-
G ried
tied us to fome other Part of the World. I fpent
great Part of this Day in perplexing my felf on
thefe Things ; but at length feeing the Ship almoft
dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could, and
then fwam on Board; this Day alfo continued
raining, tho' with no Wind at all.
From the ift of Oclober to the 24th. All thefe
Days entirely fpent in many feveral Voyages to
get all I could out of the Ship, which I brought
on Shore, every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much
Rain alfo in thefe Days, tho' with fome Intervals
of fair Weather : But, itfeems, this was the rainy
Seafon.
OEl. 20. I overfet my Raft, and all the Goods
I had got upon it, but being in fhoal Water, and
the Things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many
of them when the Tide was out.
Oft. 25* Itrain'd aft Night and all Day, with
fome Gufts of Wind* during which Time the Ship
broke in Pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder
-than before, and was no more to be feen, except
the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water,
I fpent this Day in covering and fecuring the Goods
which I had fav'd, that the Rain might not fpoil
them.
Oft. 26. I walk'd about the Shore almoft all Day
to find out a Place to fix my Habitation, greatly
concern'd to fecure my felf from any Attack in the*
Night, either from wild Beafts or Men. Towards
Night I fix'd. upon a proper Place under a Rock,
and marled out a Semi-Circle for my Encampment^
which I refolv'd to ilrengthen with a Work, Wall*
or Fortification made of double Piles, lin'd with-
in with Cable, and without with Turf
From the 26th to the 30th I worked .very hard
in carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation
tho* fome Part of the Time it rain'd exceeding
hard.
The 31 ft in the Morning I went out into the
Ifland with my Gun to fee for fome Food, and dif-
cover the Country; when I kili'd a She-Goat, and
her Kid foilow'd me Home, which I afterwards
kiird alfo, becaufe it would not feed.
November i. I fet up my Tent under a Rock, and
lay there for the firft Night, making it as large as
I could with Stakes driving in to fwing my Ham-
mock upon.
Nov. 2. Ifet up all my Chefts and Boards, and
the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and
with them form/d a Fence round me, a little with-
in the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortifi-
cation.
Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun, and kill'd two
Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food.
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a
Table.
Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my
Times of Work, of going out with my Gun, Time
of Sleep, and Time of Diversion, viz,. Every
Morning I walk'd out with my Gun for two or
three Hours if it did not rain, then employed my
felf to work till about eleven a Clock, then eat what
I had to live on, and from twelve to two I lay
down to fleep, the Weather being exceffive hot*
and then in the Evening to work again: The
working Part of this Day and the next were whol-
ly employed in making my Table, for I was yet
but a very forry Workman, tho* Time and Nece{-
fity made me a compleat natural Mechanick foori
after, as I believe it would do any one elfe.
Nov. 5. This Day went Abroad with my Gun
and my Dog* and killed a wild Cat, her Skin
pretty foft, but her Flefhgood for nothing: Every
G % Creature
lh)
Creature I kill'd, I took off the Skins afid preferv7d
them. Coming back by the Sea-fhore, I faw ma-
ny Sorts of Sea-Fowls, which I did not under-
ftand; but was furpriz'd, and almoit frighted with
two or three Seals* which, while I was gazing at,
not well knowing what they were* got into the Sea,
and efcap'd me for that Time.
Nov. 6. After my Morning Walk, I went to
work with my Table again, and fmifh'd it, tho'
not to my Liking j nor was it long before I learn'd
to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be fettled fair Wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and Part of the
12th, (for the nth was Sunday, according to my
Reckoning) I took wholly up to make me a Chair,
and with much ado brought^t to a tolerable Shape,
but never to pleafe me ; and even in the making I
pull'd it to Pieces feveral times. Note, I foon negt
lefted my keeping Sunday:, for omitting my Mark
for them on my Poll, 1 forgot which was which.
'Nov. 13. This Day it rain'd, which refrefli'd me
exceedingly, and cooled the Earth, but it was ac-
company ?d with terrible Thunder and Lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my Pow-
der : As foon as it was over, I refolv'd to feparate
my Stock of Powder into as many little Parcels as
poffible, that it might not be in Danger.
.AW 14, r5, 16. Thefe three Days I fpent m
making littie fquare Cheits or Boxes, which might
hold about a Pound, or two Pound, at moft, of
Powder; and fo putting the Powder in, I flowed
it in Places as (ecure and remote from one another,
as poffible. On one ot thefe three Days I kill'd a
large Bird that was good to eat, but I know not
what to call it.
Nuv. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my
Tent into the Rock, to make room for my farther
Conve-
f 85]
Convenrency. Note, Three Things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this Work, viz,, a Pick-ax, a Shovel,
and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, fo I de/ifted from
my Work, and began to confider how to fupply
that Want, and make me fome Tools : As for a
Pick-ax, I made ufe of the Iron Crows, which
were proper enough, tho' heavy; but the next
Thing was a Shovel or Spade ; this was fo abso-
lutely neceffary, that indeed I could do nothing
effectually without it; but what kind of one to
make I knew not,
Nov. 18. The next Day in fearching the Woods,
I found a Tree of that V/ood, or like it, which
in the Bmfth they call tiie Iron Tree, for its ex-
ceeding Hardnefs; of th.'s, with great Labour
and almoft fpoiling my Ax, I cut a Piece, and
brought it Home too with Difficulty enough, for
it was exceeding heavy.
The exceffiveHardnefs of the Wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this
Machine ; for I worked it effectually by little and
l'ttle into the Form of a Shovel or Spade, the
Handle exa&ly ftap'd like ours in England, only
that the broad Part having no Iron fhod upon it
at Bottom, if would not laft me fo long; ^ however
it fetVd well enough for the Ufes which I had
Occafion to put it to ,* but never was a Shovel,
I believe, made after that Fafliion, or To long a
making.
I was dill deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a
Wheel-barrow • a Basket I could not make by any
means, having no fuch Things as Twigs that would
bend to make Wicker Ware, at lead: none^yet found
out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy a I could
make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion
of, neither did I know how to go about it; befides
I had no poflibl? w^y to make the Iron Gudgeons
G 3 for
for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, fo
1 gave it over; and fo for carrying away the Earth
which I dug out of the Cave, I made me a Thing
like a Hodd which the Labourers carry Mortar in
when they ferve the Bricklayers.
This was not fo difficult to me as the making
the Shovel; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the
Attempt, which I made in vain, to make a Wheel-
barrow, took me up no lefs than four Days, I mean
always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun,
which 1 feldom faiVd; and very feldom fail'd alfo
of bringing home fomething fit to eat.
Nov. 23. My other Work having now Hood ftill,
becaufe of my making thefe Tools ; when they
were finifti'd, 1 went on, and working every Day>
as my Strength and Time allowed, I fpent eigh-
reen Days entirely in widening and deepning my
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodi-
oufly.
Note, During all this Time, 1 work'd to make
this Room or Cave fpacious enough to accommo-
date me as a Warehoufe or Magazine, a Kitchen,
a Dining-room, and a Cellar ; as for my Lodging,
1 kept to the Tent, except that fomeumes in the
wet Scafon of the Year, it rain'd fo hard that 1
could not keep my fcif dry, which caus'd me after-
wards to cover ail my Place within my Pale with
long Poles in the Form of Rafters, leaning againft
the Rock, and load them with Flags, and large
Leaves of Trees like a Thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my Cave
or Vault finished, when on a fudden (it feems I
had made it too large) a great Quantity of Earth
fell down from the Top and one Side, fo much,
that in ihort it frighted me, and not without Rea-
fon too, for ii I had been under it, I had never
wanted a Grave digger : Upon this Difafler 1 had
a great
a great deal of Work to do over again ; for I had
the loofe Ea^th to carry out, and which was of
more Importance, I had the Cielingto prop up, fo
that I might be dire no more would come down.
Dec. 11. This Day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two Shoars or Pods pitched upright
to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-crofs over
each Pod $ this I finifh'd the next Day ; and fetting
more Pods up with Boards, in about a Week more
I had the Roof fecur'd ; and the Pods {landing in
Rows, ferv 'd me for Partitions to part of my Houfe.
Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I
plac'd Shelves, and knock'd up Nails on the Pods
to hang every Thing up that could be hung up,
and now I began to be in fomc Order within
Doors.
Dec. 26. Now I carry'd every Thing into the
Cave, and began ro furnifli my Houfe and fet up
fomc Pieces of Boards, like a Dreflcr, to order my
Victuals upon, but Boards began to be very fcarce
with me; alfo I made me another Table.
Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day ; no
furring out.
'Dec. 25. Rain all Day.
Dec* 26. No Rain, and the Earth much cooler
than before, and pleafanter.
Dec. 27. Kill\i a young Gbat, andlam'd ano-
ther'fo that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a,
String ; when I had it Home, I bound and fplin-
ter'd up its Leg which was broke. N. B. I
took fitch care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg
grew well and as ftrong as ever ; but by nurfing
it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
Green at my Door, and would not go away :
This was the fird Time that I entertain'd a
Thought of breeding up fomc tame Creatures,
G 4 that
that I might have Food when my Powder and
Shot was all fpent.
Dec. 28, 29 y 30, Great Heats and no Breeze ; fo
that there was no ftirring abroad, except in the E-
vening for Food ; this Time I fpent in putting ail
my Things in Order within Doors.
January 1. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad ear-
ly and late with my Gun, and lay ftill in the middle
of the Day ; this Evening going farther into the
Valleys, which lay towards the Center of the Illand,
I found there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding
fhy arid hard to come at, however Irefolv'd to try
if I could not bring my Dogto hunt them down.
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out
with my Dog, and fat him upon the Goats ; but I
was miftaken, for they all fae'd about upon the
Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he
would not come near them.
Jan. 3.1 began my Fence or Wall ; which, being
ftill jealous of my being attacked by fome Body, I
refoiyd to make very thick and ftrong.
N. B. "this Wall being defcrib'd before> I
purpofely omit what was fat d in the Jour-
nal, it is fujficient to obfervey that I was
no lefs 'Time than from the 3d of January
to the 1 qtb of April, working, finfhing and
perfecting this Walk tho it was no more
than about 24 Turds in Length, being a half
Circle from one Place in the- Reck to another
Place about eight Yards from it, the Door
of the Cave being in the Center behind it.
All this. Time I work'd very hard, the Rains
hindering me jnany Days, nay fometimes Weeks
together; but 1 thought I ftould never be perfect-
ly fecure'till this Wail was finifh'd; and it is
fcarce
r.89 3
jfcarce credible what inexpreffible Labour every
Thing was done with, efpecially the bringing Piles-
out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground ; for I made them much bigger than I
iiecd to have done.
When this Wall was finifh'd, and the Out-fide
double fenced with a Turf-Wall rais'd up clofe to
it, I perfuaded my felf, that if any People were to
come on Shore there, they would not perceive any
Thing like a Habitation; and it was very well I
did fo, as may be obferv'd hereafter upon a very
remarkable Occafion.
During this Time, I made my Rounds in the
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain ad-
mitted me, and made frequent Difcoveries in thefe
Walks offomething or other to my Advantage;
particularly I found a kind of wild Pidgeons, who
built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather
as Houfe Pidgeons, m the Holes of the Rocks ;
and taking fome young ones, I endeavour'd to
breed them up tame, and did fo ; but when they
grew older, they flew all away, which perhaps
was at firft for want of feeding them, for I had
nothing to give them ,* however I frequently found
their Nefts, and got their young ones, which was
very good Meat.
And now in the managing my Houfhold Affairs,
I found myfelf wanting in many Things, which I
thought at firft it was impoffible for me to make,
as indeed as to fome of them it was; for Inflance,
I could never make a Cask to be hoop'd, I had a
fmall Runlet or two, as I obfervd before, but I
could never arrive to the Capacity of making one
by them, tho' I /pent many Weeks about it • I
could neither put in the Heads, or joint the Staves
fp true to one another, as to make them hold Wa-
ter, fo I gave that alfo over.
In
In the next Place, I was at a great lofs for Can-
dle; fo that as foon as ever it was dark, which was
generally by Seven a Clock, I was obliged to go to
Bed: I remember the Lump of Bees-wax with
which I made Candles in my African Adventure,
but I had none of that now; the only Remedy I
had, was, that when I had kill'd a Goat, I fav'd
the Tallow, and with a little1 Difli made of Clay,
which I bak'd in the Sun, to which I added a. Wick
of fome Oakum, andl made me a Lamp ; arid this
gave me Light, tho5 not a clear fteady Light like
a Candle,* in the middle of all my Labours it hap-
pen'd, that rummagingmy Things, I found a little
Bag, which, as I hinted before, had been fili\f with
Corn for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Vo-
yage, but before, as I fuppofe, when the Ship
came from Dskn; what little Remainder of Corn
had been in the Bag, was all devour'd with the
Rats, and I faw nothing in the Bag but Husks and
Duft ,• and being willing to have the Bag for fome
other Ufe, I think it was to put Powder in, when
1 divided it for fear of the Lightning, or fome fuch
Ufe, I (hook the Husks of Corn out of it on one
Side of my Fortification under the Rock.
it was alittle before the great Rains, juft now
menuonM that I threw this Stuff away, taking no
Notice of any Thing, and not fo much as remem-
bring that I had thrown any Thing there; when
about a Month after, or thereabout, I faw fome
few Stalks of iorr.ething Green {hooting out of the
Ground, which I fancy'd might be fome Plant I
had not feen, but I was fnrprizM and perfeft'y
altonifh'cl, when after a little longer time I faw
about ten or twelve Ears come out, which were
perfeft green Barley of the fame Kind as our£«-
rvpeati, nay, as our Engfyh Barley;
-. *. It
C91]
It is impoffible to exprefs the Aftonifliment and
Confufion of my Thoughts on this Occafion; I
had hitherto afted upon no religious Foundation at
all; indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in
my Head, or had entertained any Senfe of any
Thing that had befallen me, otherwife than as a
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, whatpleafes God;
without fo much as enquiring into the End of Pro-
vidence in thefe Things, or his Order in gover-
ning Events in the World : But after I few Barley
grow their, in a Climate which I knew was not
proper for Corn, and efpecially that I knew not
how it came there, it ftartled me ftrangeJy, and I
began to fuggeft, that God had miraculoufly caus'd
this Grain to grow without any help of Seed
fown, and that it was fo direded purely for my
Suftenance on that wild miferable Place.
This touch'd my Heart a little, and brought
Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to blefs my
felf, that fuch a Prodigy of Nature fliould happen
upon my Account; and this was the more ftrange
tome, becaufe I few near it ftill all along by the
Side of the^ Rock, fome other {haggling Stalks,
which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice, and which I
knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa, when
1 wasafhore there.
I not only thought thefe the pure Produ&ions
of Providence for my Support, but not doubting,
but that there was more in the Place; I went all
over that Part of the Ifland, where I had been
before, peering in every Corner, and under every
Rock, to fee for mvore of it, but I could not find
any ; at Jaft it occur5d .to my Thoughts, that I had
(hook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place,
and then the Wonder began to ceafe; and I mull
confefs, my religious Th^nkfulnefs to God's Pro-
vidence began to abate too upon the difcovq-
ring that all this was nothing but what was com-
mon ; tho* I ought to have been as thankful for lb
ftrange and unforefeen Providence, as if it had
been miraculous j for it was really the Work of
Providence,as to me, that fhould order or appoint,
that 10 or iz Grains of Corn fhould remain un*
fpoilM (when the Rats had deftroy'd all the reft)
as if it had been dropt from Heaven : As aifo that I
fhould throw it out in that particular Place where
it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it fprang up
immediately; whereas if I had thrown it any
where elfeat that Time, jthad been burnt up and
deftroy'd.
I carefully fav'd the Ears of this Corn, you may be
fure in their Seafpn> which was about the End of
yune, and laying up every Corn, I refolv'd to fow
them all again, hoping in Time to have fome
Quantity fufficient to fupply me with Bread ; but
it was not til] the 4th Ye«ir that J could allow my
felf the Ie^fl Grain ofthjs Corn to eat, and even
then but fparingly, as I fhall fay afterwards in its
Order; for Itokeall that I fow'd the firft Seafon,
by not obferving the proper Tjm£ forlfow'd it
juft before the dry Seafon, fo that it never came
up^all, at leaft, not as it wouldh^ve done: Qf
whichfiti its Place,
BefideNs this Barley, there was, as above 20 or
20 Stalks\>fRi'ce, which IprefervM with the fame
Care, and\vhofe Ufe was of the fame Kind, or to
the fame Piirpofe, (viz,,) to make me Bread, or
rather Food; for I found Ways to cook it up with-
out baking/ tho* I did that alfo after fome Time,
Put to return to my Journal.
I wo/Vd exceffive hard thefe three or four
Months' to get my Wall done ,* and the 14th of
/^r/Mdofed it up, contriving to go into it, not
\fy a, Poor, but ever the Waif by a Ladder, that
there
there might be no Sign in the Out-fide of my Ha-
bitation.
April 16. I finifii'd the Ladder, fo I went up with
the Ladder to the Top, and then puil'd it up after
me, and let ic down on the Iniide: This was a
compleat Enclofure to me; for within I had room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unlefs it could firft mount my Wall.
The very next Day after this Wall wasfinifhed,
I had almoft had all my Labour overthrown at
once, and myfelf kill'd ,• the Cafe was thus: As I
was bufy in the Iniide of it, behind my Tent, juft in
the Entrance into my Cave, 1 was terribly frighted
with a moil; dreadful furprizing Thing indeed ;
for all on a fudden I found the Earth come crum-
bling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from
the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and two of
the Pofts I had fet up in the Cave, crack'd^in a
frightful manner: I was heartily feared, but thought
nothing of what was really the Caufe, only think-
ing that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as fome
of it had done before; and for fear I fhould be bu-
ry?d in it, I ran forward to my Ladder, and not
thinking my felf fafe there neither, I got over my
Wall for fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I ex-
petted might roll down upon me : I was no fooner
ftcpt down upon the firm Ground, but I plainly
faw it was a terrible Earthquake, for the Ground
I flood on (hook three times at about eight Mi-
nutes diftance, with three fuch Shocks, as would
have overturned the ftrongeft Building that could
be fupnos'd to have flood on the Earth ; and a
great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which flood
about half a Mile from me next the Sea, fell down
with fuch a terrible Noife, as I never heard in all
my Life: I perceiv'd alfo, the very Sea was put
into violent Motion by it; and 1 believe the
Shock
Shocks were ftronger under the Water than on the
Wand.
I was fo amaz'd with the Thing it felf, having
never felt the like, or difcourfed with any one that
had, that I was like one dead or lhipify'd; and the
Motion of the Earth made my Stomach lick, like
one that was tofs'd at Sea ; but the Noifc of the
falling of the Rock awak'd me, as it were, and rou-
sting me from theftupiiied Condition I was in, fill'd
me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then
but the Hill falling upon my Tent, and all my
Houfhold Goods, and burying all at once; and
this funk my very Soul within me a fecond time.
After the third Shock was over, and I felt no
more for fome time, I began to take Courage, and
yet I had nor Heart enough to get over my Wall a-
gain, for fear of being buried alive, but fat itill
upon the Ground, greatly caft down and difconfo-
late, not knowing what to do : All this while I had
not the lcaft ferious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord ha Mercy upon me; and
when it was over, that went away too.
While I fat thus, I found the Air ovcr-caft, and
grew cloudy, as if it would rain; fo that in lefs
than half an Hour it blew a moll dreadful Hurri-
cane : The Sea was all on a fudden covered over
with Foam and Froth, the Shore was covered with
the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up
by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was ; and
this held about three Hours, and then began.to
.abate, and in two Hours more it was calm, and
began to rain very hard.
All this while 1 far upon the Ground very tiiuch
terrify'd and dcjecled, when on a fudden it came
into my Thoughts, chat uhefe Windsand Rain being
the ConfcquejiCe of the Earthquake, the Earthquake
kfctf
t95l
itfclt was fpc'nt and over, and I might venture into
my Cave again : With this Thought my Spirits
began to revive, and the Rain alfo helping to per-
fuade me, 1 went in and fat down in my Tent,
but the Rain was fo violent, that my Tent was
ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forced
to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and un-
cafy for fear it fhould fall on my Head.
This violent Rainforc'd me to a new Work,wz..
to cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a
Sink to let Water go out, which would clfe have
drown'd my Cave. After I had been in my Cave
feme time, and found ftill no more Shocks of the*
Earthquake follow, I began to be more compos'd;
and now to fupport my Spirits, which indeed want-
ed it very much, I went to my little Store, and
took a fmall Sup of Rum, which however I did
then and always very fparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that Night, and great
Part of the next Day, fo that 1 could not ftir
abroad, but my Mind being more composed, I be-
gan to think of what I had beft do, concluding,
that if the Ifland was fubjed; tothefe Earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a Cave, but I
muft confider of building me fome little Hut in an
open Place, which I might furround with a Wallas
I had done here, and fo make my felf fecurc from
wild Beafts or Men : But concluded, if I ftaid
where I? was, 1" fhould certainly, one time or other,
be bury'd alive.
With thefe Thoughts I refolvVl to remove my
Tent from the Place where it flood, which was
juft under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and
which, if it fhould be fhaken again, would certain-
ty fall upon my Tent: And I fpent the two next
Days
Dip, being the 19th and 20th of April, in con-
triving where and how to remove my Habitation.
The Fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made me
that I never flept in quiet; and yet the Apprehen-
iion, of lying abroad without any Fence, was al-
moft equal to it: But ftill when 1 look'd about,
and faw how every thing was put in Order, how
pleafantly conceal'd. I was, and how fafe from
Danger, it made me very loth to remove.
In the mean time it occurred tome, that it would
require a vaft deal of Time for me to do this, and
that I muft be contented to run the Venture where
I was, 'till I had form'd a Camp for my felf, and
had fccur'd it fo as to remove to it: So with this
Refolution Icompos'd myfelf for a Time, and re-
folv'd that I would go to work with all Speed to
build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &c. in a
Circle as before, and fet my Tent up in it when it
was finifli'd, but that I would venture to flay where
I was'till it was finifh'd and fit to remove to. This
was the 21ft.
April 22. The next Morning I began to confider
of Means to put this Refolve in Execution, but I
was at a great Lofs about my< Tools; I had three
large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (Tor we
carry'd the Hatchets for Traffick with the Indians)
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
Wood, they were all hill of Notches and dull,
and tho'IhadaGrindftoiie, I could not turn it and
grind my Tools coo; this coft me as much Thought
as a Statefman would have beftowM upon a grand
Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Life and
Death of a Man. At lengch I contrived a Wheel
with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I
might have both my Hands at Liberty: Note, 1 had
pever fee 11 any fuch thing in England, or at leaft
jipt to take Notice how it was done, tho* fincel
have
fcaVe obferv'd it is very common there ; befide?
that, my Grind/lone was very large and heavy
This Machine coft me a full Weeks Work to'bring
it to Perfection.
April 28, 29. Thefe two whole Days I took up
in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning
my Gtindftone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my Bread had been
low a great while, now I took a Survey of ir,
and reduced my felf to one Bisket-cake a Day,
which made my Heart very heavy.
May 1. In the Morning looking towards the
Sea-fide, the Tide being low, I faw fomethinglye
on the Shore bigger than ordinary, and it look'd
like a Cask; when I came to it, I found a frnall
Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late
Hurricane, and looking towards the Wreck itfelf*
I thought it feem'd to lye higher out of the Water
than it us'd to do ; I examined the Barrel which
was driven on Shore, and foOn found it was a.
JBarrel of Gunpowder, but it had taken Water,
and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone, how-
ever I roll'd it farther on Shore for the pre fen t, and
went on upon the Sands as near as I could to the
Wreck of the Ship to look for more.
When I came down to the Ship t found itftrsnge-
ly .removed, The Fore-caftle which lay before bu-
ry *d in Sand, was heav'd up at leafh fix Foot, and
the Stern which was broke to Pieces and parted
From the reft by the Force of the Sea foon after!
had left rummaging her, was tofs'd, as it were, up>
and ieaft on one Side, and the Sand was thrown
To high on that S;de next her Stern, that whereas
there was a great Place df Water before, fo that, I
could not come within a Quarter of a Mile of the:
Wreck without fwimming, I could now %waljk
H quite
quite up to her when the Tide was out; I was fur-
priz'd with this at firft> but foon concluded it muft
be done by the Earthquake, and as by this Violence
the Ship was more broken open than formerly, fo
many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea
had loofen'd, and which the Winds and Water rol-
led by Degrees to the Land.
This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the
Defign of removing my Habitation; and I bufied
myfelf mightily that Day efpecially, in fearching
whether I couid make any Way into the Ship, but I
found nothing was to be expected of that Kind, for
that all the Infide of the Ship waschoack'd up
with Sand : However, as I had learn'd not todefpair
of any Thing, I refoiv'd to pull every Thing to
Pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding* that
every Thing I could gee from her would be of fome
Ufe or other to me.
May 3. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece
of a Beam thro', which I thought held fome of the
upper Part or Quarter-Deck together, and when
I had cut it thro', I clear'd away the Sand as well
as I could from the Side which lay higheft; but
the Tide coming in, I was oblig'd to give overfor
that Time.
May 4.1 went a fifliing, but caught nfat ohfc Fife
that I durft eat 0(5 till 1 was weary of my Sport,
when juft going to leave off, I caught a ycung
Dolphin. I had made me a long Line of fome
Rope Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently
caught Fifh enough, as much as 1 car'd to eat;
all which I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry.
May 5. Work'd on the Wreck, cut another
Beam afunder, and brought three great Fir Planks
off from the Decks, which I ty a together, and
made fwim on Shore when the Tide of Flood came
on.
May
May 6. Work'd on the Wreck, got feveral Iron
Bolts oat of her, and other Pieces of Iron Work,
work'd very hard, and came Home very much tyr'd,
and had Thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an
Intent not to work, but found the Weight of the
Wreck had broke itfelf clown, the Beams being cut,
that feveral Pieces of the Ship feem'd to lie loofe,
and the In-fide of the Hold lay fo open, that I
could fee into it, but almoft full of Water and Sand.
May $• Went to the Wreck and carry'd an Iron
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now
quite clear of the Water or Sand ; I wrench a open
two Planks, and brought them on Shore alfo with
the Tide: I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for
next Day.
May 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow
made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and felc
feveral Casks, and loofen'd them with the Crow,
but could not break them up ; I felt alfo the Roll
of Englijb Lead, and could ftir it, but it was too
heavy to remove.
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every Day to
the Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Tim-
ber, and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 Weight
of Iron.
May 15. I carry d two Hatchets to try it 1
could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by
placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and driving it
with the other; but as it lay about a Foot and a
half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to
drive the Hatchet.
May 16. It had blow'd hard in the Night* and
the Wreck appeared more broken by the Force df
the Water; but I ftay'd fo long in the Woods to get
Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented me
soine to the Wreck that Day.
86 H 2 May
[ 100 }
May 17. Ifaw fome Pieces of the Wreck blovftl off
Shore, at a great Diftance, two Miles oft' me*
but refolv'd to fee what they were, and found it
was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24. Every Day to this Day I work'd on
the Wreck, and with hard Labour I loofen'd fome
Things f© much with the Crow, that the firft
blowing Tide feveral Casks floated out, and two
of the Seamcns Chefts ; but the Wind blowing from
the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but
Pieces of Timber, and a Hogfliead which had fome
Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand
had fpoil'd it.
I continued this Work every Day to the 15 th of
jfitne> except the Time neceflary to get Food,
which I always-appointed, during this Part of my
Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I,
might be ready when it wasebb'd out, and by this
Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-
Work enough, to have builded a good Boat, if I
had known how; and alfo, I got at feveral Times,
and in feveral Pieces, near 100 Weight of thcSheet-
Lead.
June i6r Going down to the Sca-fulc, I found
a large Tortoife or Turtle; this was the firft I had
ieen, which it feems was only my Misfortune, not
any Defeft of the Place,or Scarcity ; for had I hap-
•pen'd to be on the other Side of the Ifland, 1
might havchad Hundreds, of them evey Day, as
i found afterwards;.^ but prehaps had paid de^r
enough for them.
- "June 17. 1 fpenfc in Cooking the Turtle; I
found in hcrthreefcore Eggs; and her Flefli was to
rmc at that Time the moft favoury and pleafant
that- ever Itafied'in my Life, having had no Flefh*
but
;but of Goats and Fowls, fince I landed in this <
'horrid Place.
June 18. Rain'd all Day, and I fta/d within.
1 thought at this Time the Rain felt cold, and I
was fomcthing chilly, which I knew was not ufual
in that Latitude.
June ip. Very ill, and flavoring, as if the Wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20. No Reft .all Night*, violent Pains in
jny Head, andfeaverifh.
June 21. Very ill, frighted almoft to Death
with the Apprehcnfions of my fad Condition, to
t>c fick, and no Help : Pray'd to G O D for the
jfirft Time lince the Storm of Httl/, but fcarce
knew what I fa id., or why ; my Thoughts being
ail confnfed.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful
Apprehensions -of Sicknefs.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and fhivering,
and then a violent Head-ach.
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An Ague very violent; the Fit held
me feven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint
Sweats after it.
June 26. Better; and having no Vi&uals to eat,
took my Gun, but found my felf very weak.;
however I kilfd a She-Goat, and with-much Dif-
ficulty got it Home, and broil'dfome of it, and
eat; I would fain have ilew'd it, and made fome
Broadi,' but had no Pot,
June 27, The Ague again fo violent, that I
by a-Bed all Day, and neither'fet or drank. I
was ready to perifli for Thirft, but fo weak, I had
not Strength to ftand up* or to get my felf any
Water to drink j Pray *d to God again, but was
light-headed, and when 1 was not, I was fo igno-
rant, that I knew not what to fay ; only I lay and
H 3 cry\l,
cry'd, Lord look upon me, Lord pity mey Lord have
Mercy upon me: I fuppofe I did nothing elfe for two
or three Hours, till the Fit wearing oft; I fell afleep,
and did not wake till far in the Night; when I
wak'd, I found my felf much refrefFd, but weak,
and exceeding thirfty : However, as I had no Wa-
ter in my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to lie till
Morning, and went to deep again : In this fecond
Sleep, 1 had this terrible Dream.
I thought, that I was fitting on the Ground on
the Out-fide of my Wall, where 1 fat when the
Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that I faw
a Man defcend from a great black Cloud, in a
bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the Ground;
He was all over as bright as a Flame, fo that I could
but juft bear to look towards him ; his Counte-
nance was molt inexpreffibly dreadful, impoffible
for Words to defcribe ; when he ftepp'd upon the
Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth trem-
bled, juft as it had done before in the Earthquake,
and all the Air lock'd, to my Apprehenfion, as if
it had been fill'd with Flafhes of Fire.
He was no fooner landed upon the Earth, but
he moved forward towards me, with a long Spear
or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me; and when he
came to a rifing Ground, at fome Diflance, he
f ;oke to me, or I heard a Voice fo terrible, that
it is impoffible to cxprefs the Terror of it; all that
I can fay, I underflood, was this, Seeing all thefe
"Things have not brought thee to Repentance, now thou
/halt die: At which Words, 1 thought he lifted-up
the Spear that gft wa«> in his Hand to kill me. ?
No ojie, that fhall ever read this Account, will
fcxpeft that I fhould be able to defcribe the Horrors'
of my Soul at this terrible Vifion, I mean, that e-.
ven while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of thofe
Horrors ; nor is it any more poffible to defcribe
- • >: .- • •., > the
the Imprcffion that remain'd upon my Mind when
I awak'd and found it was but a Dream.
I had alas! no divine Knowledge; what Ihad re-
ceived by the good Inftru&ion of my Father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of
Seafaring Wickednefs, and a conftant Converfation
with nothing but fuch as were like myfelf, wicked
and prophane to the laft Degree: I do not remember
that I had in all that Time one Thought that fo
much as tended either to looking upwards toward
God, ox inwards towards a Refle&ion upon my
own Ways : But a certain Stupidity of Soul, with-
out Defire of Good, or Conscience of Evil, had
entirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the moft
hardned, unthinking, wicked Creature among our
common Sailors, can be fuppofed to be, not having
the leaft Senfe, either of the Fear of God in Danger,
or of Thankfulnefs to God in Deliverances.
In the relating what is already paft of my Story,
this will be the more eafily believ'd, when I fhall
add, that thro5 all the Variety of Miferies that
had to this Day befallen me, I never had fo much
as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or
that it was a jufl; Punifhment for my Sin ; my re-
bellious Behaviour againft my Father, or my pre-
fcht Sins which were great; or fo much as a Pu-
nifhmeht for the general Courfe of my wicked Life*
When I was oh the defperate Expedition on the de-
fart Shores of 'Africa, I never had fo much as one
'Thought of what would become of me ; or one
Wifli to God to dired me whether I (hould go, or
to keep me from the*Danger ^yhich apparently fur-
rounded me, as well from.voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages : But I was meerly thoughtlefs of a
God, or a Providence, a&ed like a meer Brute
from the Principles of Nature, and by tfre'Pi&ates
of common Senfe only, and indeed hardly 'that.
H4 When
When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by th$
Portugal Captain, well us'd, ai.d dealt juftly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not
the leaft Thankfulnefs on my Thoughts: Wher\
again I was fhipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in Danger of
drowning on this Ifland, I was as far from Re-
morfe, or looking on ic as a Judgment; 1 only faid
to my felt often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and
born to be always miferable.
It is true, when I got on Shore firft here, and
found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and my felf
fpar'd, I was furpnVd with a kind of Extafy,and
fome Tranfports of Soul, which, had the Grace of
God affiitcd, alight have come up to true Thank-.
fulnefs ; but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common Flight of Joy, or as. 1 may fay, being glad t
uas alive, without the left Reflection upon the
diftingu.'fhing Goodnefs of the Hand which had
prefeiv'd me, and had fingled me out to be pre;-
jfcrv'd, when all the reft were deftroy'd ; or an En-
quiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
nie ; even juft the fame co.mmpn Sort of Joy which
Seamen generally have after they are got fafe afhore
from a Shipwreck, which they drown all huhenext
Bowl of Punch, and forget almqftas foon, as it is.
over, and.all the reft of my Life was like it.
Even when I was. afterwards, on due Confide-
nation, made fenfible of my Condition,, howl was
caft on this dread fill PLce, out of the Reach of hu-
man Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Profpeft
of Redemption, as fpon as I faw but a Profpeft of
livini, and that 1 (hould not itarve and perifh for
Hunger, all the S<?nl<? of my Affliction wore oft,
$.nd I begun to be very eafy, apply'd my felf to the
Works pyoper for my Prefervation and Supply, and
was far enough from being ailUded at my Con-
dition, as a Judgment from Heaven, or as th£,
"' * " v Haud
Hand of God againft me ; thefe were Thoughts
which very feldom entered into my Head.
The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my
Journal, had at firft fome little Influence upon me,
and began to affed me with Serioufnefs, as long as
I thought it had fomething miraculous in it; but
as foon as ever that Part of the Thought was re-
move, all the Impreffion which was raised from it,
wore off alfo, as I have noted already.
Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately
dire&ing to the invifible Power which alone di-
rects fiich Things, yet no fooner was the firft Fright
over, but the Impreffion it had made went off alfo.
I had no more Senfe of God or his Judgments,
much lefs of the prefent Affliftion of my Circum-
ftances being frQm his Hand, than if I had been in
the moft profperous Condition of Life.
But now when I began to be fick, and a lcifure-
ly View of the Miferies of Death came to place it-
felf before me ; when my Spirits began to fink un-
der the Burthen of a ftrong Diflemper, and Nature
was. exhaufled with the Violence of the Feaver*
Confcience that had flept fo long, begun to awake*
and I began to reproach myfelf with my paft Lifcl
in which I had fo evidently, by uncommon Wicked*
nefs, provok'd the Juftice of God to lay me under
uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in fo vin-
dictive a Manner.
Thefe Refle&ions opprefs'd me for the fecond or
third Day of my Diflemper, and in the Violence,
as well of the Feaver, as of the dreadful Reproaches
of my Confcience, extorted fome Words from me,
like praying to God, tho' I cannot fay they were
either a Prayer attended with Defires or with
Hopes; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright
£nd Diftrefs ; my Thoughts were confused, the
Con-
I0<J ]
Convt&ions great upon my Mind, and the Hor-
ror of dying in fucha'miferable Condition raised
Vapours into my'Head with the meer Apprehen-
fions, and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I know
not what my Tongue might cxprefs: but it was ra-^
ther Exclamation, fuchas, Lprd! vyhat a miferable
Creature am I? If I fhould be fick, I fhall certain-
ly die for want of Help, and what will "become of
xnc! Then the Tears burft out of my Eyes, and I
could fay no more for a good while. ' : ; ' ''
In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father
came to my Mind, and prefently his Prcdi&ion
which I mentioned at the Beginning of this$tory,'
VU. That if I did take this fcohfi Step, God would not
llefs me> and I would have Leifure hereafter to refieEl
upon having mglecied his Counjel, when there might be
none to affift in my Recovery. Now, faid I aloud,
My dear Father's Words are come to pafs : God's
jtiiticc has overtaken me, and 1 have none to help
or hear me: I rejected the Voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a Pofture or Sta-
tion of Life, wherein I might have been happy
and eafy ; but I would neither fee it myfelf, or learn
to know the Bleffing of it from my Parents; I left
them to mourn over my Folly, and now II am left
to mourn under the Confeqticnccs of it: I rcfus'd
their Help and Affiftancc whowou'd have lifted me
into the World, and would have made every thing
eafy to me, and now I have Difficulties to flrug-
gle with, too great for even Nature itfclt to fup-
port, and no Affiftancc, no Help, no Comfort, no
Advice ; then 1 cry 'd out, Lord be my Help, for I am
hi great Diftrefs. '
This was the firfl Prayer, if I may call it fo,
that I had made for many Years: But I return to'
my Journal- '
June
June 28. Having been fomewhat refrefh'd with
the Sleep I had had, and the Fit being entirely
off, I got up ; and tho' the Fright and Terror of
my Dream was very great, yet I confider'd, that
the Fit of the Ague would return again the next
Day, and now was my Time to get fomething to
refrefh and fupport myfelf when I fliould be ill ;
and the firft thing I did, I fill'd a large fquare
Cafe Bottle with Water, and fct it upon my Table,
in reach of my Bed, and to take off the ChiU
or aguifli Difpofition of the Water, I put
about a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it,
and mix'd them together; then I got me a Piece
of the Goat's Flefh,and broil'd it on the Coals, but
could eat very little ; I walked about, but was very
weak, and withal very fad and heavy-hearted in
the Scnfe of m^ mi(erable Condition ; dread-
ing the Return of my Diftemper the next Day;
at Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's
Eggs, which I roafted in the Afhes, and eat, as we
call it, in the Shell; and this was the firft Bit of
Meat I had ever ask'd God's Bleffing to, even as
I could remember, in my whole Life.
After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found
my felf fo weak, that I could hardly carry the
Gun, (for I never went out without that) fo I
went but a little Way, and fat down upon the
Ground, looking out upon the Sea, which was
juft before me, and very calm and fmooth : As
I fat here, fome fuch Thoughts as thefe occurred
tome:
What is this Earth and Sea of which I have(een
fo much, whence is it product, and what am I,
and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane
and brutal, whence are we ?
Sure
Sure we are all made by fomefecret Power, who
form'd the Earth and Sea, the Air and Sky ; and
who is that ?
Then it follow'd moft naturally, It is God that
has made it all: Well, but then it came on ftrange-
ly, if God has made all thefe Things, He guides
and governs them all, and ail Things that concern
them; for the Power that could make all Things,
itiuft certainly have Power to guide and dired
'them.
If fo, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of
ill's'Works, either without his Knowledge or Ap-
pointment:.
- And if nothing happens without his Knowledge,
he knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful
Condition ;' and if nothing happens without his
Appointment, he has appointed all this to befal
me: f
Nothifig occurred to my Thought to contradift
any -of thefe Conclusions; and therefore it refted
upon mc with the'greater Fptce, that it muft needs,
be, that God hafclr appointed r,all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miferable'Circiiniftance
by his Dire6Hon0 he having the fole Po^er, not of
me only, but of every Thing that happened in th£
World. Immediately it follow^) y ' K> '
Why has God done this' to me ? What have 1 done
to be thus u$\i? ' ' 'v •' '-'   ' *'
My Confcience prefently checked me in that En'-»
cjuiry, as if I had blafphem'd, and methoilght it
ipokc tome like a Voice; JVRETCffl. :Joft thou
izsk what thou haft done! Look back upon1 a dreadful
mif-fpent Life, and ask thy felf what thou haft not
done? ask, Why is it that thou wort not long ago de*
(hofd ? Why wert, thou not drown d in Yarmouth
Roads ? Kilul in the Fight when the Ship was taken by
the 'Bailee Man of War ? Devour d ly the wild Beafts
ion
en the Coaft of Africa? Or, Drown'd HERE,
when all the Crew periftid but thy felf? Doft thou ask
What have I done ?
I was ftruck dumb with thefe Refle&ions, as one
aftonifli'd, and had not a Word to lay, no not to
anfwer to my felf, but rife up penfive and fad>
walk'd back to my Retreat, and went up over my
Wall, as if I had been going to Bed, but my
Thoughts were fadly diftuiVd, and I had no In-
clination to Sleep; fo I fat down in my Chair,
and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark t
Now as the'Apprehension of the Return of my Di-
ftemper terrify 'd me very much, it occurr'd to my
Thought, that the Brafilians take no Phyfick but
their Tobacco, for almoft all Diftempers; and I
had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in cue of the
Chefts, which was quite cur'd, and fome alfo that
was green and not quite cur'd..
I went, dire&ed by Heaven no doubt; for in
this Cheft I found a Cure,- both for Soul and Body,
] open'd the Cheft, and found what I look'd for, viz,.
the Tobacco; and as the few Books, I had fav'd*
lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which
I mention'd before, and which to this Time I had
not found Leifure, or fo much as Inclination to
look into ; I fay, I took it out, and brought both
that and the Tobacco with me to the Table.
What life to make of the Tobacco, I knew not.
as to my Diftemper, or whether it was good for it
or no; but I try'id feveral Experiments with it> as
if I was refolv'd it fliould hit one Way or other :
I firft took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my
Mouth, which indeed at firft almoft ftupify'd my
Brain, the Tobacco being green andftrong, and
that I had not been much us'dtoit; then I took
fome and fteeped it an Hour or two in fome Rnm.i
and refolv'd to take a Dofeof it when Hay down *
and
and Iaflly, I burnt fome upon a Pan of Coals, and
held my Nofe clofe over the Smoke of it as long as
I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almoft for
Suffocation,
In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too
much difturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading,
at leaft that Time; only having open'd the Book ca-
fually, the firft Words that occur'd to me where
thefe, Call on me in the DayofeTroub!ey and I will deli-
<ver> and thou Jhah glorify me.
The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made
fbme Impreflion upon my Thoughts at the Time of
reading them, tho' not fo much as they did after-
wards ; for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no
Sound, as I may fay, to mc; the Thing was fo remote,
fo impoifible in my Apprchenfion of Things, that
I began to fay as the Children of Ifrael did, when
they were promised Flefli to eat, Can Godfpread a
lable in the Wilderness ? So I began to fay, Can' God
himfelf deliver me from this Place ? And as it was
ftot for many Years that any Hope appeared, this
prevailed very often ijpon my Thoughts : But
however, the Words made a great Impreflion upon
jftie, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew
fiowlate, and the Tobacco had, as I faid, doz'd
my Head fo much, that I inclin'd to fleep; fo I
left my Lamp burning in the Cave, leaft I fhould
want any Thing in the Night, and went to Bed ,* .
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done
in all my Life, I kneel'd down and prayM to God
to fulfil thePromifeto me, that if I called upon him
in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me; af-
ter my broken and imperfed Prayer was over, I
drunk the Rum in which I had fleep'd the Tobac-
co, which was fo ftrong and rank of the Tobacco*
that indeed i could fcarce gee it down; immediately
upon
upon this I went to Bed, I found prefently it flew
up in my Head violently, but I fell into a found
Sleep, and wak'd no more 'till by the Sun it muft
neceilarily be near Three a-Clock in the Afternoon
the next Day; nay, to this Hour, I'm partly of the
Opinion, that I llept all the next Day and Night,
and 'till almoft Three that Day after; for other-
wife I knew not how I fhould lofe a Day out of my
Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appeared
fome Years after I had done ; for if I had loft it by
crofling and re-croffing the Line, I fhould have loft
more than one Day : But certainly I loft a Day in
my Aecompt, and never knew which Way.
Be that however one Way or th* other, when I
awak'd I found my felf exceedingly refrefh'd, and
my Spirits lively and chearful; when I got up, I
was ftronger than I was the Day before, and my
Stomach better, for I was hungry; and in fhort, I
had no Fit the next Day, but continu'd much
altered for the better; this was the 29th.
The 30th was my well Day of Courfc, and I
Went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to
travel too far ,• I kill'd a Sea Fowl or two, fome-
thing like a brand Goofe, and brought them Home,
but was not very forward to eat them ,• fo I eat fome
more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good:
This Evening I renewed the Medicine which I had
fuppos'd did me good the Day before, viz. the
Tobacco fteep'd in Rum, only I did not take fo
much as before^ nor did I chew any of the Leaf,
or hold my Head over the Smoke; however, I was
not fo well the next Day, which was the firft of July >
as I hop'd I fhould have been; for I had a little
Spice of the cold Fit, but ir was not much.
July 2. I renew'd the Medicine all the three
Ways, and doz'd my felf with it as at firft j and
doubled the Quantity which 1 drank,
5. I riiifs'd the Fit for good and all, tho' I did
hot recover my full Strength forfome Weeks after ;
while I was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, / will 'deliver
thee, and the Impoffibility of my Deliverance lay
much upon my Mind in Barr of my ever expc&ihg
it: But as I was difeburaging myfelfwith fuch
Thoughts, it occurred to my Mind, that I pored
fo much upon my Deliverance from the main Affli-
ction, that Idifregarded the Deliverance I had re-
ceived ; and I was, as it were, made to ask my
felf fuch Qucftions as thefe, viz,. Have I not been
delivered, and wonderfully too,from Sicknefs? From
the moll diftrefs'd Condition that could be, and
that was fo frightful to me, and what Notice I
had taken of it: Had I done my Part, God had de-
liver'd me, but I had not glorify d him ; that is to fay,
I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a
Deliverance, and how couM I expeft greater De-
liverance ?
This touched my Heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneel'd down and gave God Thanks sr
loud, for my Recovery from my Sicknefs.
July 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and be*
ginning at the New Teiiament, I began ferioufly
to read it, and impos'd upon my felf to read a
while every Morning and every Night, not tying
my felf to the Number of Chapters, but as long as
my Thoughts fhou'd engage me: It was not long
after I fee ferioufly to this Work, but I found
my Heart more deeply and fincerely affe&ed with
the Wickednefs of my paft Life : The Im-
preffion of my Dream revived, and the Words, All
thefe Things have not brought thee to Repentance^ ran fe-
rioufly in my Thoughts: I was earneflly begging
of God to give me Repentance, when it happened
providentially the' very Day that reading the Scri-
pture
tm-py I ca me to thefe Words, He is exalted a Prince
and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and to give Remifji-
on. I threw down the Boo£ and with my Hearc
as well as my Hands Jitced up to Heaven, in a
Kind of Extafy of Joy, I cry'd out aloud, Jefus,
thou Son of David, Jefus, thou exalted Prince and
Savimv, give me Repentance I
This was the firit Time that I could fay, in the
true Serife of the Words, that I pray'd in all my
Life; for now I pray'd with a Serife of my Conditi-
on,! and with a true Scripture View.of Hope found-
ed on the Encouragement of the Word of God,- and
from this Time, I may fay, I began to have Hope
that God would hear me.
Now I began to conltrue the Words mentioned
above, Call on me and 1 will deliver you, in a diffe-
rent Senfe from what I had ever done before; for
then I had no Notion of any thing bsing calfd De-
liverance, but my being delivered from the Capti-
vity I was in,* for tho' I was indeed at large
in the Place, yet the Ifland was certainly a
Prifon to me, and that in the worft Senfe in the
World; but now I learn'd to take it in another
Senfe : Now I look'd back upon my pad Life with
fuch Horror, and my Sins appear'd fo dreadful>
that my Soul fought nothing of God, but Delive-
rance from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my
Comfort: As for my folitary Life it was nothing;
I did not fo much as pray to be delivered from it,
or think of it; it was all of no Consideration in
Comparifon to this; And I add this Part here, to
hint to whoever fhall read it, that whenever they
come to a true Senfe of things, they will find De-
liverance from Sin a much greater BlefTmg, than
Deliverance from Affliftion.
But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal.
I My
[ lHl
My Condition began now to be, tho'not lefs ml-
ferable as to my Way of living, yet much eafier
to my Mind ; and my Thoughts being directed, by
a conftant reading the Scripture and praying to
God, to things of a higher Nature; I had a great
deal of Comfort within, which till now I knew no-
thing of; alfo, as my Health and Strength returned,
IbeflirM myfelf to furnifh myfelf with every thing
that I wanted, and make my Way of living as re-
gular as I could.
From the-4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in the walking about with my Gun in my
Hand, a little and a little at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering np his Strength after a Fit of
Sicknefs : For it is hardly to be imagined, how low
I was, and to what Weaknefs I was reduced. The
Application which I made Ufe of was perfedly
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to
prafiife, by this Experiment; and tho' it did carry
off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening
me ; for I had frequent Convulfions in my Nerves
and Limbs for fome Time.
I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that be-
ing abroad in the rainy Seafon was the moft perni-
cious thing to my Health that could be, efpecially
in tihofe Rains which came attended with Storms
, .'and Hurricans of Wind; for as the Rain which came
in the dry Seafon was always moft accompany'd
with fnch Storms, fo I found that Rain was much
more dangerous than the Rain which fell in Sep-
tember and OBcber.
I had been now in this unhappy Ifland above 10
Months, all PoflTtbility of Deliverance from this
Condition feem'd to be entirely taken from me;
and I firmly believed, that no humane Shape had
ever fet Foot upon that Place: Having now fecur'd
my
my Habitation, as I thought, fully to my Mind, I
had a great Defire to make a more perfect Difco-
very or" the liland, and to fee what other Produ-
ctions I might find, which I yet knew nothing
of.
It was the 15 th of July that I began to take a
more particular Survey of the Ifland it felf: I went
up the Creek firft, where, as I hinted I brought
my Rafts on Shore; I found after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little
Brook of running Water, and very frefh and good;
but this being the drySeafon, there was hardly any
Water in fome Parts of it, atleait, not enough to
run in any Stream, fo as it could be perceived.
On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea*
fant SavanaSy or Meadows, plain, fmooth, and
covered with Grafs; and on the rifing Parts of
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa-
ter, as it might be fuppofed, never overflowed, I
found a great deal of Tobacco, green and growing
to a great and very ftrong Stalk; there were di-
vers other Plants which I had no Notion of, ot Un-
derflanding about, and might perhaps have Vir-
tues of their own, which I could not find out.
I fearched for the Cajjava Root, which the In-
iiansvazVi that Climate make their Bread of, bur I
could find none. I faw large Plants of Aloes, but
did not then understand them. I faw feveral Sugar
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, im~
perfed. I contented myfelf with thefe Difcoveries
for this Time, and came back mnfing with my
felf what Courfe I might take to know the Virtue
and Goodnefs of any of the Fruits or Plants which
I flioulJ difoover; but could bring it to no Con->
clufion : for in fhort, I had made fo little Obfer-
Yation while I was in the .Brqfils, that I knew little
1 2 of
of the Plants in the Field, at leaft very little that1
might ferve me to any Purpofe now in my Di-
ftrefs.
The next Day, the i£th, I went up the fame
Way again, and after going fomething farther than
I had gone the'Day before ; I found the Brook, and
the Sav arias began to ccafe, and the Country be-
came more woody than before ; in this Part I found
different Fruits, and particularly I found Melons
upon the Ground in great Abundance; and Grapes
upon the Trees; the Vines had fpread indeedover
the Trees, and the Clufters of Grapes were juft
now in their Prime, very ripe and rich: This was a
furprifing Difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of
them ; but 1 was warn'd by my Experience to eat
fparingly of them, remembring, that when I was
afliore in Barbary, the eating of Grapes killed feveral
of our Engl'ijh Men who were Slaves there, by
throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers : But I
found an excellent Uk for thefe Grapes, and that
was to cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep
them as dry'd Grapes, or Raifins are kept, which
I thought would be, as indeed they were, as
wholefome, as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes
could be had,
I foent all that Evening there, and went not
back to my Habitation, which by the way was
the firft Night, as I mighu fay, 1 had lain from
Home. In the Night 1 took my firft Contrivance,
and got up into a Tree, where I flept well, and the
next Morning proceeded upon my Difcovery, tra-
velling near four Miles, as I might Judge by the
length of the Valley, keeping ftill due North, with
a Ridge of Hills on the South, and Eaft fide of
me.
At the End of this March I came to an Open-
ings where the Country feem'd to defqend to the
Weft,
1^7 1
Weft, and a little Spring of frefli Water, which i(-
fued out of the Side ot the Hill by me, run the
other way, that is due Eaft; and the Country ap-
peared fo frefli, fo green, fo flourishing, every thing
being in a conftant Verdure, or Flpurifli ot Spring,
that it look'd like a planted Garden.
I defcended a little on the Side of that delicious
Vale, furveying it with a fecret kind of Pkafure,
(tho' mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was King
and Lord of ail this Country indefeafibly, and
had a Right of Pofleffion ; and if I could convey it,
I might have it in Inheritance, as compleatly as
any Lord of a Manor in England, I faw here
abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Le-
mon, and Citron Trees; but all wild, and very
few bearing any Fruit, at leaft not then: Howe-
ver the green Limes that I gathered, were not
only pleafantfto eat, but very wholefome; and I
mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which
made it very wholefome, and very cool, and re-
'frefliing.
I found now I had Bufinefs enough to gather and
carry Home; and I refolrd to lay up a Store, as
well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnifh
myfelf for the we: Seafon, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In order to this, I gatherd a great Heap of
Grapes m one Place,'anda letter Heap in another
Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in
another Place ; and taking a few of each with me,
I traveled homeward, and refolv'd to come again,
and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make to
carry the reft Home.
Accordingly, having fpent three Days in this
Journey, I came Home; fo I muft npw call my
Tent and my Cave: But before I got thither, the
I 3 Grapes
Grapes were fpoil'd, the Richnefs of the Fruits,
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them,
and bruis'd them, they were good lor little or no-
thing ; as to the Limes they were good, but I
could bring but a few.
The next Day, being the 19th, I went back,
having made me two fmall Bags to bring Home
my Harveft: But I was furpriz'd, when coming
to my Heap of Grapes, which were fo rich and
fine when I gathered them, I found them all fpread
about, trod to Pieces, and drag'd about, fome
here, feme there, and Abundance eaten and de-
vour'd: By this I concluded, there were fome wild
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found that there was no laying
them up on Heaps* and no carrying them away in
a Sack, but that one Way they would be deftroy'd,
and the other way they would be crnfli'd with
their own Weight, I took another Courfe ; for I
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung
them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that
they might cure and dry in the Sun ; and as for the
Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as many back as I
could well Hand under.
When I camt. home from this Journey; I con-
templated with great. Pleafure the Fruitfulnefs of
that Valley, and the Pleafantnefs of the Situation,
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water,
and the Wood, and concluded, that 1 had /pitched
upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far
t le worft Part of the Country. Upon the whole
1 began to confider of removing my Habitation;
and to lock out for a Piace equally fafe, as where
I now was fituate, if poffible, in that pleafant
iruittU Part ot the Iiland.
This
This Thought run long in my Head, and I was
exceeding fond of it for fome Time, the Pleafant-
nefs of the Place tempting me ; but when I came
to a nearer View of it, and to confider that I, was
now by the Sea-Side, where it was at leaft poffible
that fomething might happen to my Advantage,
and by the fame ill Fate that brought me hither,
might bring fome other unhappy Wretches to the
fame Place ; and thor it was fcarce probable that
any fuch Thing fhould ever happen, yet to enclofe
myfelf among the Hills and Woods, in the Center
of the Ifland, was to anticipate my Bondage, and
to render fuch an Affair not only improbable, but
impoffible; and that therefore 1 ought not by any
Means to remove.
However I was fo enamoured of this Place,
that I fpent much of my Time there for the
whole remaining Part of the Month of July; and
tho' upon feeond Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not
to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower,
and funrounded it at a Diftance with a ftrong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could
reach, well ftak'd, and fill'd between with Brufi-
wood; and here I lay very fecure, fometimes two
or three Nights together, always going over it
with a Ladder, as before ; fo that I fancy'd now I
'had my Country Houfe, and my Sea-Coaft-Houfe:
And this Work took -me up to the Beginning of
Augtift. #
1 had but newly finifh d my Fence, «md began
to enjoy my Labour, but the Rains came on,-and
made me ftick clofe to my firfi Habitation; for tho*
I had made me a Tent like the other, w^th a Piece
of a Sail, and fprcad it very well; yet I had not
the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, nor
a Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains
were extraordinary.
I 4 About
About the beginning of Auguft, as Ifaid, I had
finifhU my Bower, and began to enjoy myfelf.
The third of Auguft, I found the Grapes 1 had
hung up were perfectly dry'd, and, indeed, were:
excellent good Raifins of the Sun; fo I began to
take them down from the Trees, and it was very
Happy that I did fo; for the Rains which followed
would have fpoil'd them, and 1 had loft the beft
Part of my Winter Food ,• for I had above two
hundred large Bunches of them. No fooner had
I taken them all down, and carry'd raoft of them
Home to my Cave, but it began to rain, and from
hence, which was the fourteenth of Augufi, it ra.in'd
more or lefs, every Day, till the middle of OBober;
and fometimes io violently, that I could not ftir out
of my Cave for feveral Days.
In this Seafon I was much furpnVd with the
Incrcafc of my Family ; I had been concerned for
the Lofs of one of my Cats, who run away from
me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Aftonifli-
ment {he came Home about the End of Auguft,
with three Kittens. This was the more ftrange to
me, becaufe tho* I had kill'd a wild Cat, as I
call'd it, with my Gun; yet I thought it was a
quite differing Kind from our European Cats,- yet
the young Cats were the fame Kind of Houfe breed
like the old one ; and both my Cats being Females,
I thought it very ftrange : But from thefe three
Cats, I afterwards came to be fo pefter'd with Cats,
that I was fore a to kill them like Vermin, or wild
Beai'ls, and to drive them from my Houfe as much
as poffiblc.
From the fourteenth of Augufi to the twenty
fmh was inceffant Rain, fo that I could not ftir, and
was now very careful not to be much wet. In this
(pohiiucmtnt I began to be ftiaitned for Food, but
J j venturing
venturing out twice, I one Day kill'd a Goat, an4
the laft Day, which was the twenty fixth, found
a very large Tortoife, which was a Treat to me,
and my Food was regulated thus ; I eat a Bunch of
Raifins for myBreakfaft, a Piece of the Goat's Flcfh
or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil'd; for to my
great Misfortune, I had no Veffel to boil or flew
any Thing; and two or three of the Turtle's Eggs
for my Supper.
During this Confinement in my Cover by the Rain
I work'd daily two or three Hours at enlarging my
Cave,and by Degrees worked iton towards one Side,
till I came to the Outfide of the HiiJ, and made
a Door or Way out, which came beyond my Fence
or Wall, and fo I came in and out this Way; but I
was not perfectly eafy at lying fo open; for as I
had manag'd myfelf before, I was in a perfeft En-
clofure, whereas now I thought I lay exposed, and
open for any Thing to come in upon me,- and yet
I could not perceive that there was any living
Thing to fear, the biggeft Creature that I had yet
feenupon the Ifland being a Goat.
September the thirtieth, I was now come to the
unhappy Anniverfary of my Landing. I cafiup the
Notches on my Pott, and found I had been on
Shore three hundred and iixty five Days. I kept
this Day as a Solemn F^tt, fetting it apart to Re-
ligious Exercife, proftrating myfelf on the Ground
with the molt ferious Humiliation, confeffing my
Sins to God, acknowledging his Righteous Judg-
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer-
cy on me, through Jefus Chrift-y and having not
tatted the leaft Refrefhment for twelve Hours,
even till' the going down of the Sun, I then eat a
BisketLCake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went to
Bed, finifhing the Day as I began it.
I had
1 had all this Time obferv'd no Sabbath-Day \
for as at firft I had no Senie of Religion upon my
Mind, I had after feme Time omitted to diftin-
guifli the Weeks, by making a longer Notqh than
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and fo did not really
know what any of the Days were; but now having
caft up the D./ys, as above, I found I had been
there a Year; fo I divided it into Weeks, and jfet
apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath ; though I
found at the End of my Account I had loft a Day
or two in my Reckoning.
A little after this my Ink began to f lil me, and
fo I contented myfelf to uk it more fparingly, and
to write down only themoft remarkable Events of
my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum
of other Things.
The rainy Seafon, and the dry Seafon, began new
to appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide
them fo, as to provide for them accordingly. , But
I bought all my Experience before I had it; and
this lam going to relate, was one of the moft dif-
couraging Experiments that I made at all. I have
mention a.that I hadfav'd the few Ears of Barley
and Rice, which I had fo furprizingly founa fpring
tip, as I thought, of themfeives, and believe there
were about thirty Stalks ot Rice, and about twenty
of Barley-; and now I thought it a proper Time
to fow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its,
Southern Pofition going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well
as I could with my wooden Spade, and dividing
it into two Parts, 1 fow\i my Grain ; but as I was
lowing, it cafually accpuM to my Thoughts, that
I would not fow it all at firft, becaufe I did not
know when was the proper Time for it; folfow'd
about two Thirds ot the Seed, leaving about a
handful of each.
It
It: was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that
I did fo, for not one Grain of that I fow'd this
Time came to any thing; for the dry Months
following, the Earth having had no Rain after the
Seed was fown, it had no Moifture to affift its
Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet
Seafon had come again, and then it grew as if it
had been but newly fown.
Finding my firft Seed did not grow, which I
eafily imagined was by the Drought, I fought for
a moifter Piece of Ground to make another Trial
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new
Bower, and fow'd the reft of my Seed in Februaryr,
a little before the Vernal Equinox; and this having
the rainy Months of March and April to water it,
fprung up very pleafantly, and yielded a very good
Crop ; but having Part of the Seed left only, and
not daring to fow all that I had, I had butafmall
Quantity at laft, my whole Crop not amounting
to above half a Peck of each kind.
But by this Experiment I was made Matter of
my Bufinef, and knew exactly when the proper
Seafon was to fow; and that I might expe£t two
Seed Times, and two Harvefts every Year.
While this Corn was growing, I made a little
Difcovery which was of life to me aftewrards; As
foon as the Rains were over, and the Weather be-
gan to fettle, which was about the Month of No-
vember, I made a Vifit up the Country to my Bow-
er, where though I had not been fome Months, yet
I found all Things juft as I left them. The Cir-
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on-
ly firm and entire ; but the Stakes which I had cut
out of fome Trees that grew thereabouts, were all
foot out and grown with long Branches, as much
as a Willow-Tree ufuailyfhoots the firft Year after
lopping its Head. I could not tell what Tree to
call
call it, that thefe Stakes were cut from. I.wa$
furpris'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to fee the
young Trees grow ; and I prun'd them, and led
them up to grow as much alike as I could ; and it
isfcarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew
into in three Years; fo that though the Hedge
made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Dia-
meter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might now call
them, ' foon coverd it ,• and it was a compleat
Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the dry Seafon.
This made me refolve to cut fome more Stakes,
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle
round my Wall ,• I mean that of my firft Dwelling,
which I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in k
'double'Row, at about eight Yards Diftance from
my, firft Fences they grew prefently, and were at
firft a fine Cover to my Habitation, and after-
ward ferv'd for a Defence alfo, as I fhall obferve
in its Order.
I found now, That the Seafpns of the Year
might generally be divided, not into Summer and
Winter, as in Europe; but into the Rainy-Seafons,
and the Dry-Seafons, which were generally thus :

Half February,)
The Rainy-Seafbn fometimes held longer or
fhorter, as the Winds happen'd to blow * but this
was the general Obfervation I made : After I had
found, by Experience, the ill Confequence of being
Abroad in the Rain, I took care to furnifli myfelf
with Provifions before-hand, that I might not be
oblig'd to go out; and I (at within Doors as much
as poffible during the wet -Months.
In this Time I found much Employment* (and
very fuitable alfo to the Time) for I found great
Occafion of many Things which I had no way to
furnifli myfelf with, but by hard Labour and con^
ftant Application; particularly, I try'd many Ways
to make my felf a Basket, but all the Twigs I
could get for the Purpofe prov'd fo brittle, that
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent Ad-
vantage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I
ufed to take a great Delight in ftanding at a Basket-
maker s in the Town where my Father liv'd, to
fee them make their Wicker-ware ; and being, as
Boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a
great Obferver of the Manner how they worked
thofe Things, and fometimes lending a Hand, I
had by this Means full Knowledge of the Methods
of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials ;
when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew,
might
might pofllbly be as tough as the Sallows, and
Willows, and Ofiers in England, and I refolv'd
to try.
Accordingly the next Day I went to my Coun-
try-Houfe, as I call'd it, and cutting fome of the
fmaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpofe as
much as I could defire; whereupon I came the
next Time prepared with a Hatchet to cut down a
Quantity, which I foon found, for there was great
Plenty of them ; thefe I fet up to dry within my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe,
I carried them to my Cave, and here during the
next Seafon I employ'd my (t\(m making, as well
as I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry
Earth, or to carry or lay up any Thing as I had
Occafion. And tho* I did not finifli them very hand-
fomly, yet I made them fufficiently ferviceable for
my Purpofe ,* and thus afterwards I took Care ne-
ver to be without them ; and as my Wicker-ware
decay'd, I made more, efpecially, I made ftrong
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, inftead of Sacks,
when I fhould come to have any Quantity of it.
Having mafter'd this Difficulty, and employ*d a
World of Time about it, I bcftir'd myfelf to fee
if poffible how to fupply two Wants : I had no
Veffels to hold any Thing that was Liquid, ex-
cept two Runlets which were almoft full of Rum,
and fome Glafs Bottles, fome of the common Size,
and others which were Cafe-Bottles fquare, for
the holding of Waters, Spirits, &c. I had not (b
much as a Pot to boil any thing, except a great
Kettle, which I /av'd out of the Ship, and which
was too big for fuch Ufe as I defir'd it, vfc* to
make Broth, and ftew a Bit of Meat by it felf.
The fecond Thing I would fain have had, was a
Tobacco-Pipe; but it was impoffiblc to me to
make
make one, however I found a Contrivance for tha^
too at laft.
I employ'd myfelf in Planting myfecond Rows
of Stakes or Piles, and in this Wicker-w-oxk'm^ all
the Summer, ordrySeafon, when ar.ocher Bufincfc
took me up more Time than it could be imagined
I could fpare.
I mentioned before, That I had a great Mind to
fee the whole Ifland, and that I had travclfd up
the Brook, and fo on to where I built my Bower,
and where 1 had an Opening quite to the Sea on
the other Side of the Ifland, I now refolv'd to''
travel quite crofs to the Sea-Shore on that Side;
fo taking my Gun, a Hatcher, and my Dog, and
a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than ufual,
with two Bisket Cakes, and a great Bufrch of
Raifins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my
Journey. When I had pafs'd the Vale where my
Bower flood as above, 1 came within View of the
Sea, to the IVeft, and it being a very clear Day, I
fairly defcry'd Land, whether an llland or a Con-
tinent, I could not tell; but it lay very high,
extending from the Hyefi to the IV S. IV. at a very
great Diftance; by my Guefs it could not be lefs
than fifteen or twenty League,-; off
I could not tell what Part of the World this
might be,, otherwife than that 1 knew it muft be
part of America, and as I concluded by all my
Observations, muft be near the Spamjh Dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by Savages, where
if I flionld have landed, I had been in a worfe
Condition than I was now, and therefore I acqui-
efced in the Difpofitions of Providence, which I
began now to own, and to believe, order'd every
Thing for the bell:; I fay, I quieted ray Mind with
this, and left affii&ing myfelf with fruitlefs Wifhes
of being their
Eefides
JBefides, after fome Paufe upon this Affair, f
confider'd that if this Land was the Spanifi Coaft*
I fhould certainly, one Time or other, fee fome
Veffel pafs or re-pafs one Way or other: but if
not, then it was the Savage Coaft. between the
Spani(h Country and Brafils, which are indeed the
worftof Savages-, for they are Cannibals, or Men-
eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all the
humane Bodies that fall into their Hands.
With thefe Confiderations I walk'd very leifure-
ly forward. I found that Side of the Ifland where
I now was, much pleafanter than mine, the open
or Savana Fields fweet, adorn'd with Flowers and
Grafs, and full of very fine Woods. I faw Abun-
dance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught one,
if poffible to have kept it to be tame, and taught
it to (peak to me. I did, after fome Pains taking,1
catch a young Parrot, for I knocked it down with
a Stick, and having recover'd it, I brought it home *
but it was fome Years before I could make him
fpeak: However, at lad I taught him to call me
by my Name very familiarly: But the Accident
that foilow'd, tho' it be a Trifle, will be very di-
verting in its Place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I
found in the low Grounds Hares, as i thought
them to be, and Foxes, but they differed greatly
from all the other Kinds I had met with ,• nor could
I fatisfy myfelf to eat them, tho7 I killed feveral :
But I had no need to be venturous ; for I had no
Want of Food, and of that which was very good
too; efpeciaily thefe three Sorts* viz,. Goats, Pid-
geons,and Turtle or- Tortoife; which, added to my
Grapes, Leaden-hall Market could not have fur-
nifh'd a Table better than I, in Proportion to the
Company; and tho' my Cafe was deplorable
enough, yet I had great Caufe for Thankfulnefs
and
that I was not driven to any Extremities for Food;
but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.
I never traveled in this Journey above two Miles
outright in a Day, or thereabouts ,• but I took fo
many Turns and Returns, to fee what Difcovertes
I could make,, that I came weary enough to the
Place where I refolved to fit down for all Night;
and then I either repos'd myfelf in a Tree, or fur-
rounded myfelf with a Row of Stakes fet upright
in the Ground, either from one Tree to another,
or fo as no wild Creature could come at me, with-
out waking me.
As foon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was fur-
prifed to fee that I had taken up my Lot on the
worft Sideofthelfland,* for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas on
the other Side I had found but three in a Year and
half. Here was alfo an infinite Number of Fowls,
of many Kinds, fome which I had feen, and fome
which I had not feen of before, and many of them
very good Meat; but fuch as I knew not the
Names of, except thofe call'd Penguins.
I could have fhot as many as I pleas'd, but was
very fparingof my Powder and Shot; and therefore
had more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on ,• and though there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the
Ifland, yet it was with much more Difficulty that
I could come near them,i. the Country being flat
and even, and they faw me much fooner than when
I was on the Hill.
I confefs this Side of the Country was much
pleafanter than mine, but yet I had not the leafi In-
clination t6 remove; for as I was fix'd in my Ha-
bitation, it became natural to me, and I feem'd all
the while I was here, to be as it were upon a Jour-
ney3 and from Home; However, I travelled along
K the
the Shore of the Sea, tdwards the Eaft> I fuppofe
about twelve Miles; and then fetting up a great
Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I
would go Home again ; and that the next Journey
I took fhould be on the other Side of the Ifland,
Eafi from my Dwelling, and fo round till I came
to my Poll again : Of which in its Place.
I took another Way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could eafily keep ail the Ifland
fo much in my View, that I could not mifs finding
my firft Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I
found myfelf mihaken ; for being come about two
or three Miles, I found mylelf defcended into a
very large Valley ; but fo furrounded with Hills,
and thofe Hills covered with Wood, that I could
not fee which was my Way by any Dire&ion but
that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefs I knew very
well the Pofition of the Sun at that Time of the
Day.
It happened to my farther Misfortune, That the
Weather proved hazey for three or four Days,
while I was in this Valley ; and not being able to
fee the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably,
and at laft was obliged to find out the Sea Side,
look for my Poft, and come back the fame Way I
went; and then by eafy journiesl turn'dHome-
wardj the Weather being exceeding hot, and my
Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things
very heavy.
In this journey my Dog ftirpnVd a young Kiel,
and fei/M upon it, and running in to take hold
of it, caught it, and fav'd it alive from the Dog:
1 had a great Mind to bring it Home if I could,*
for 1 had often been muling, Whether it might not
be poffible to get a Kid or two, and fo raife a
Breed of tame Goats, which might fupply me
when my Powder and Shot fhould be all fpent.
I made
I made a Collar to this little Creature, and.With
k String which I made of fome Rope-yarn, which
I always carryM about me, I led him along, th'o*
with fome Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, and
there I enclos'd him, and left him; for I was very
impatient to be at Home, from whehce I had been
kbfent above a Month.
I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to
me, to come into my old Hutbh, and lye down, ih
my Hammock-Bed : This little wandring Journey,
without fettled Place of Abode, had been fo im~
pleafant to me, that my own Hdufe, as I call'd it,
to myfelf, was a perfect Settlement to me, com-
pared to that; and it recder'd every Thing about
me fo comfortable, that I refolv'd I would never
go a great Way from it again, while it ftiould be
my Lot to flay oh the Ifland.
I repos'd myfelf here a Week, to reft and regale
myfelf after my long Journey ; during which, moft
of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of
fnaking a Cage for my Poll, who began now to bd
a mere Domeftick, ahd to be mighty well acquain-
ted with we. Thcfi I began to think of the poor
Kid, which I had penn'd in within my little Cir-
cle, and refolv'd to go and fetch it Home, or give
it forhe Food; accordingly I went, and found it
•Where I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but
was afmoft flarv'd for want of Food, I went and
cut Bows of Trees, and Branches of fuch Shrubs
as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed
it, I ty'd it as I did before to lead away; but it
was fo tame with being hungry, that 1 had no need
to have ty'd it, fdr it follbw'd me like a Dog ; and
as I continually fed it, the Creature became fo
Ibving, fo gentle, &nd fd fond, that it was from,
that Time one of my Domefticks alfo, and wrould
never leave me afterwards.
K' a ' ' The
The rainy Seafon of the Autumnal Equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th oi'September in the
fame folemn Manner as before, being the Anniver-
fary of my Landing on the Ifland, having now been
there two Years, and no more Profpeft of being de-
livered than the firfl Day I came there. I fpent the
whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful Mercies which my fo-
Utary Condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miferable.
I gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had
been pleafed to difcover to me, even that it was
poffible, I might be more happy in this folitary
Condition, than I fhould have been in a Liberty of
Society, and in all the PJeafures of the World. That
He could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of
my folitary State, and the want of human Society,
by his Prefence, and the Communications of his
Grace to my Soul, fupporting,comforting, and en-
couraging me to depend upon his Providence here,
and hope for his eternal Prefence hereafter.
It was now that I began fenfibly tp feel how
much more happy this Lite I now led was, with
ail its miferable Circumftances, than the wicked,
curfed, abominable Life I led all the paft Part of
my Days; and now I changed both my Sorrows
and my joys ; my very Defires altered, my Affecti-
ons changed their Gufts, and my Delights were
perfe&ly new, from what they were at my firfl:
coming, or indeed for the two Years paft.
Before, as I wallui about either on my Hunt-
ing, or for viewing the Country, the Anguifti of
my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon
me on a fudden, and my very Heart would die
within me, to think of the Woods, the Mountains
the Defarts I was in"; and how I was a Prifoner
Iock'd up with the eternal Bars and Bolts of the
Ocean,
Ocean, in an uninhabited Wildernefs, without Re-
demption : In themidftof the greateft Compofures
of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a
Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep
like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the
middle of my Work, and I would immediately fit
down and figh, and look upon the Ground for an
Hour or two together; and this was ftill wo:feto
me; for if I could burft out into Tea#, cr vent
my felf by Words, it would go off, and the G:ief
having exhaufted it felf, would abate.
But now I began to exercife my felf with new
Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God, and ap-
ply'd all the Comforts of it to my prefent State.
One Morning being very fad, I opened the Bible
upon thefe Words, / will never, never leave theey
nor forfake thee i immediately it occur'd, That thefe
Words were to me, Why elfe fliould they be dired-
ed in fuch a Manner, juft at the Moment when I
was mourning over my Condition, as one forfaken
of God and Man ? Well then, faid I, if God dees
not forfake me, of what ill Confequence can it be,
or what matters it, though the World fhould all
forfake me, feeing on the other hand, if I had all
the World, and i'hould lofe the Favour and Blef-
iing of God, there would be no Comparifon in the
Lofs ?
From this Moment I began to conclude in my
Mind, That it was poffible for me to be more hap-
py in this forfaken folitary Condition, than it was
propable I fhould never have been in any other
particular State in the World ; and with this
Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for
bringing me to this Place.
I know not what it was, but fomething fhock'd
my Mind at that Thought, and I durft not fpeak
the Words: How canft thou be fuch a Hypocrite,
K 3 (faid
(fold I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for
a Condition, which however thou may'ft endea-
vour to be contented with, thou would'ft rather
pray heartily to be delivered from; fo I flopped
there: But though I could not fay, Ithank'dGod
for being there; yet I finccrcly gave Thanks to
Godto^ opening my Eyes, by Whatever afflifting
Providences, to fee the former Condition of my
Life, and to mourn for my Wickednefs, and repent.
I never open'd the Bible, or flint it, but my very
Soul within meblcfs'd God fordire&ing my Friend
in England, without any Order of mine, to pack it
tip among my Goods; and for affifting me after
wards to fave it out of the Wreck of the Ship.
Thus, and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began
my third Year ,' and tho'I have not given the Rea-
der the Trouble of fo particular Account of my
Works this Year as the firft; yet in general it
may be obferv'd, That I was very feldom idle :
but having regularly divided my Time, according
to the feveral daily Employments that were before
me, fuch as, Firft, my Duty to God and the Read*
fng the Scriptures, which I conftantly fet apart
k>me Time for thrice every Day. Secondly, The go-
ing abroad with my Gun for Food, which generally
took me up three Hours in every Morning, when
it did not rain, thirdly, The ordering, curing,.
pVe&rving, and cooking what I had kill'dor catch'cj
for my fupply ; tbefe took up great Part of thfc
Day : Alfo it is to beconfidered that the middle of
the Day, when the Sun was in the Zenith, the5 Vio-
lence of the Heat was too great to fiir out; fo that
about tour Hours in the Evening was all the Time
I could be fnppbs'd to work in, with this Excep-
tion, That fomeiimes I changed my Hours of
Hunting and Working, and went to work in the*
'" Morning
,n?5] .,
Morning, and abroad with my Gun in-the After-
noon.
To this ftiort Time allowM for Labour, I defirc
may be added the exceeding Laborioufhefs of my
Work; the many Hours which for want of Tools,
want of Help, and want of Skill; every Thing I
did, took up out of; my Time. For Example, I
was full two and forty Days making me a Board for
a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave; where-
as two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw-Pit
would have cut fix of them out of the fame Tree
in half a Day.
My Cafe was this : It was to be a large Tree,
which was to be cut down, becaufe my Board was
to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days
a cutting down, and two more cutting off the
Bows, and reducing it to a Log or Piece of Tim-
ber. With inexpreffible hacking and hewing I
redue'd both the Sides of it into. Chips, till it be-'
gun to be light enough to move; then I turn'd it,
and made one Side of it fmooth and flat as a
Board, from End to End ; then turning that fide
downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth
on both Sides. Any one may judge the Labour of
my Hands in fuch a Piece of Work; but Labour
and Patience carry'd me through that and many
other things : I only obferve this in particular, to
(hew the Reafon why fo much of my Time went
away with fo little Work, viz,. That what might be
a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a vaft
Labour, and required a prodigious Time to do a-
lone, and by hand.
But notwithftanding this, with Patience and La-
bour I went through many things; and indeed eve-
ry thing that my Circumftances made neceflary to
me to' cto> as will appear by what follows,
K 4 'I was
I was now, in the Months of November and De-
cember, expe&ing my Crop of Barley and Rice.
The Ground I had manurd or dug up for them
was not great; for 4s I obferv'd, my Seed of each
was not above the Quantity of half a Peck ;
for I had loft one whole Crop by fowing in the
dry Seafon ; but now my Crop promised very well,
when on a fudden I found I was in danger of lo~
fing all again by Enemies of feveral Sorts, which
it was fcarce poffible to keep from it; as firft, the
Goats, and wild Creatures which I calf d Hares,
who tailing the Sweetnefs of the Blade, lay in it
Night and Pay, as foon as it came up, and eat it
fo clofe, that it could get no Time to fhoot up into
Stalk.
This I faw no Remedy for but by making an En-
clofure about it with a Hedge, which I did with a
great deal of Toil; and the more, becaufe it re-
quir'd Speed. However, as my arable Land was
but fmall, fuited to my Crop, I got it totally well
fencd in about three Weeks Time; and (hooting
fome of the Creatures in the Day-time, I fet my
Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up to a
Stake at the Gate, where he would ftand and bark
all Night long; fo in a little time the Enemies for-
foo'k the Place, and the Corn grew very ftrong, and
well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the Beafts ruined me before, while my
Corn was in the Blade; fo the Birds were as likely
to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear ; for go-
ing along by the Place to fee how it throve, I faw
my little Crop furrounded with Fowls of I know
not how many Sorts, who flood as it were watch-
ing till I fhould be gone: I immediately let fly a-
mong them (for I always had my Gun with me)
I ha*d"no fooner {hot but there rofe up a little
Cloud
Cloud of Fowls, which I had not ken at all, from
among the Corn it felf.
This touch'd me fenfibly, for I forefaw, that in
a few Days they would devour all my Hopes, that
I fhould be ftarv'd, and never be able to raife a Crop
at all, and what to do I could not tell: However,
I refolv'd not to lofe my Corn, if poffible, tho* I
fhould watch it Night and Day. In the firft
Place, I went among it to fee what Damage \yas
already done, and found they had fpoil'd a good
deal of it, but that as it was yet too green for
them, the Lofs was not fo great, but that the Re-
mainder was like to be a good Crop if it could be
fav'd.
I ftaid by it to load my Gun, and then coming
away I could eafily fee the Thieves fitting upon all
the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the Event proved it to be fo;
for as I walked off as if I was gone, I was nofooner
out ^of their Sight, but they dropt down one by
one into the Corn again. I was fo provok'd that 1
could not have Patience to ftay till more came on,
knowing that every Gfain that they eat now, was^
as it might be Jaid, a Peck-loaf to me in the Confe-
quencc; but coming up to the Hedge, Ifir'd again,
and kilfd three of them. This was what I wjfh'd
for 5 fo I took them up, and ferv'd them as we
ferve notorious Thieves in England^ (viz..) hang'd
them in Chains for a Terror to others. It is im~
poffible to imagine a(moft,that this fhould have fuch
an EfFed as it had ,• for the Fowls wou'd not only
not come at the Corn, but in fhort they forfook all
that Part of the Ifland, and I could never fee a Bird
near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows hung
there.
This
This I was very glad of, you may be fare, and
about the latter end of December, which was our
fecond Harveft of the Year^ I reap'd my Crop.
I was fadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out of one of the broad Swords
or Cutlaffes, which I fav'd among the Arms out of
the Ship. However, as my firft Crop was but fmall*
I had no great Difficulty to cut it down; in fhort,
Ireap'dit my Way, fori cut nothing off but the
Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which
I had made, and fo rubb*d it out with my Hands ;
and at the End of all my Harvefting, I found that'
out of my half Peck of Seed, I had near two Bufhels
of Rice, and above two Eufhels and half of Barley,
that is to fay, by my Guefs, for I had no Meafure
at that time.
However, this was a great Encouragement tome;
and I forefaw that in time, it would plcafe God
to< fupply me with Bread : And yet here I was per-
plex'd again, for I neither knew how to grind or
make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean it
and part it; nor if made into Meal,, how to make
Bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew
not how to bake it: thefe things being added to my
Beiire of having a good Quantity of Store, and to
fecure a conftant Supply, 1 refolv'd not to tafte any
of this Crop, but to preferve it all for Seed againft
the next Seafon, and in the mean time to employ
all my Study and Hours of working to accomplifh
this great Work of providing my felf with Cora
and Bread.
It might be truly faid, that now I worked for
my Bread : *Tis a little wonderful, and what I be-
lieve few People have thought much upon, viz*, the
ftrange Multitude of little Things neceffary in the
Pro-
providing, producing, curing, dreffing, making
and finifhing this one Article of Bread.
I that was reduc'd to a mere State of Nature,
found this to be my daily Difcouragement, and was
made more and more feiifible of it every Hour, even
after I had got the firft Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have faid, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a Surprize.
Firft, I had no Plow, to turn up the Earth, no
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this 1 conquer^
by making a wooden Spade, as I obferv'd before;
but this did my Work but in a wooden manner, and
tho' it coft me a great many Days to make ir, yet
for want of Iron it not only wore out the fooner,
but made my Work the harder, and made it bp
perform'd much worfe.
However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with Patience, and bear with the BadT
nefs of the Performance. When the Corn was fow'd,
I had no Harrow, but was fore'd to go over it my
felf, and drag a great he^vy Bough of a Tree over
it, to fcratch it, as it may be call'd, rather than
rake or harrow it.'
When it was growing and grown, I have ot>
ferv'd already, how many Things I wanted, to
Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure and
Carry it home. Thrafh, Part it from the Chaff,
and Save it. Then I wanted a Mill to Grind it.
Sieves to'Drefs ir, Yeaft and Salt to make it into
Bread, and an Oven to Bake it; and yet all thefe
things I did without,1 as (hall be obferv'd ; and
yet the Corn was an ineftimable Comfort and Ad-
vantage to me too. All this, as I faid, madee-
very thing laborious and tedious to me, but that
there was no help for, neither was my Time fo
much Lofs to me, becaiife as I had divided it, a
certain Part of it was "every Day appointed tb
thefe
thefe Works; and as I refolv'd to ufe none of the
Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by
me, I had the next fix Months to apply my felf
wholly by Labour andlnvention to furnifh my felf
with Utenfils proper for the performing all the
Operations neceffary for the making the Corn
(when I had it) fit for my ufe.
But firft, I was to prepare more Land, for I
had now Seed enough to fow above an Acre of
Ground. Before I did this, I had a Weeks Work,
at leaft, to make me a Spade, which when it was
done was but a forry one indeed, and very heavy,
and requir'd double Labour to work with it;
however I went thro* that, and fow'd my Seed in
two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my
Houfe as I could find them to my Mind, and
fenc'd them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were ail cut of that Wood which I had fet
before and knew it would grow, fo that in one
Year's time I knew I fliouldhave a quick or living
Hedge, that would want but little Repair. This
Work was not fo little as to take me up lefs
than three Months, becaufe great Part of that
time was of the wet Seafon, when I could not go
abroad.
Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I
could not go out, I found Employment on the fol-
lowing Occasions,- always obferving, that all the
while I was at work I diverted my felf with talk-
ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to fpeak;
and I quickly learned him to know his own Name,
and at laft to fpeak it out pretty loud, POLL,
which was the firft Word I ever heard fpoken in
the Ifland by any Mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my Work, but an Affiftant to my
Work; for now, as I faid, I had a great Employ-
ment upon my glands, as follows, (viz,.) I had
long
long ftud/d, by fome Means dr other, to make
my felf fome Earthen Veflels, which indeed I
wanted forcly, but knew not where to come at
them: However, confidering the Heat of the Cli-
mate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any
fuch Clay, I might botch up fome fuch Pot, as
might, being dry'd in the Sun, be hard enough,
and ftrong enough to bear handling, and to hold
any Thing that was dry, and required to be kept
fo ; and as this was neceflary in the preparing Corn,
Meal, &c which was the Thing I was upon, I re-
folvM to make fome as large as I could, and fit
only to ftand like Jarrs to hold what fiiould be put
into them.
It would make the Reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many awkward Ways I
took to raife this Pafte, what odd mifhapen ugly
Things I made, how many of them fell-in, and how-
many fell out, the Clay not being ftiff enough to
bear its own Weight ,• how many crack'd by the
over violent Heat of the Sun, being fet out too
haftily; and how many fell in Pieces with-only re-
moving, as well before as after they wtre dry'd;
and in a Word, how after having laboured hard
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring
it home and work it, I could not make above two
large earthen ugly Things, I cannot call them Jarrs,
in about two Months Labour.
However, as the Sun bak'd thefe two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fet
them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets,
which I had made on purpofe for them, that they
might not break ; and as between the Pot and the
Basket there was a little room to fpare, I fluff 'd it
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and thefe two
Pots being to ftand always dry, I thought would
hold
hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal, when
the Corn was bruifed.
Tho' I mifcarried fo much in my Defign for
large Pots, yet I made feveral fmaller things with
better Succefs; fuch as little round Pots, flat Diflies,
Pitchers and Pipkins, and any Things my Hand
turnM to, and the Heat of the Sun bak'd them
ftrarigely hard.,
But all this would not anfwer my End, which
was to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Li-
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of thefe could
do. It happenVl after fome time, making a pretty
large Fire for cooking my Meat, when I went to
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro-
ken Piece of one of my Earthen-ware Veflels in the
Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile,
1 was as agreeably furpriz'd to fee it, and faid to my
felf, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This fet me to ftudying how to order my
Fire, fo as to make it burn me fome Pots. I had
no Notion of a Kiln, fuch as the Potters burn
in, or of glazing them with Lead, tho' I had fome
Lead to do it with ,* but I plac'd three large Pip-
kins, and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon ano-
ther, and placed my Fire-wood all round it, with
a great Heap of Embers under them; 1 ply'd the
Fire with frefh Fuel round the Outfide, and upon
the Top, till I faw the Pots in the Infide red hot
c[uite thro*, and obferv'd that they did not crack
at all; when I faw them clear red, I let them ftand
in that Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one
of them1, tho' it did not crack, did melt or run; for;
the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted.
by the Violence of the Heat, and would have run
into Glafsif I had gone onif; fo I flack'd my Fire
gradually, till the Pots began to abate of the red
Colour
Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might
not lee the Fire abate too fail; in the Morning I
had three very good, I will not fay handfome Pip-
kins ; and two other Earthen Pols, as hard burnt
as cou'd be defir'd; and one of them perfe&ly
glaz'd with the running of the Sand.
After this Experiment, I need not fay that I
wanted no fort of Earthen Ware for my Ufe ; but
I muft needs fay, as to the Shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may fuppofe,
when I had no way of making them,* but as the
Children make Dirt-Pies^ or as a Woman would
make Pies that never leaned to raife Parte.
No Joy at a Thing of fo mean a Nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an
Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire ; and I had
hardly Patience to flay till they were cold, before
I fet one. upon the Fire again, with fome Water in
it, to boil me fome Mear, which it did admirably
well; aqd wich a Piece of a Kid I made fome very
good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and feve-
ral other Ingredients requifite to make it fo good
as 1 would have had it been.
My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor-
tar to ftamp or beat fome Corn in; for as to the
Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Per-
fection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. . To fup-
ply this Want I was at a great Lofs ; for of all
Trades in the World 1 was as perfectly unqualified
for a Stone-Cutter, as for any whatever; neither
had I any Tools to go about it with. I fpent many
a Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could find
none at all, except what was in the folid Rock,
and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor in-
deed were the Rocks in the llland of Hardnefs fuf-
ficient,. but were all of a fandy crumbling Stone,
which
which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy
PeftleV or would break the Corn without filling it
with Sand ; fo after a great deal of Time loft in
fearching for a Stone, 1 gave it over, and refolv'd
to look out for a great Block of hard Wood,
•which.I found indeed much eafier ,* and getting one
as:big a$ I had Strength to ftir, I rounded it, and
formed it in the Outfide with my Axe and Hatchet,
and then with the Help of Fire, and infinite La- •
bour, made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in
Brafil make their Canoes. After this, I made a
great heavy Peftle or Beater, of the Wood called
the Iron-Wood, and this I prepared and laid by a-
gainft I had my next Crop of Corn,' when I pre- "
pos'd to myfelfto grind, or rather pound my Corn
into Meal to make my Bread.
My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or
Searfe, to drefs my Meal, and to part it from the
Bran and the Husk, without which I did not fee
it poffible I could have any Bread. This was a
moft difficult Thing, fo much as but to thiftk on ;
for to be fure I had nothing like the neceflary
Thing to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas, or
Stuff to fearfe the Meal through. And here I was
at a full Scop for many Months; nor did I real-
ly know what to do ; Linnen I had none left, but
what was meer Rags; I had Goat's Hair, but nei-
ther knew I how to weave it, or fpin it; and had
I known how, here were no Tools to work it
with; all the Remedy that I found for this, was,
That at laft I did remember I had among the
Seatriens Cloaths which were fav'd out of the Ship,
fome Neckcloathsof Callicoe or Muflin ; and with"
fome Pieces of thefe I made three fmall Sieves, but "
proper enough for the Work ; and thus I made'fhift
for fome Years; how I did afterwards, 1 (hall (hew
in its Place,
The baking Part was the next Thing to B?
tonfider'd, and how I fhould make Bread when!
came to have Corn ; for firlt I had no Yeaft ; as to
that Part, as there was nofupplying the Want, fol
did not concern myfelf much about it: But for an
Oven,I was indeed in great Pain; at length I found
out an Experiment for that alfo, which was this ;
I made fome earthen Veflels very broad, but not
deep; that is to fay* about two Foot Diameter*
and not above nine Inches deep ; thefe I burnt in
the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid them
by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
Fire upon my HeJth, which I had pav'd with fome
fquare Tilesofmyown making, and burning alfo;
but I (hould not call them fquare.
When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much in-
to Embers, or live Coals, I drew them forward
upon this Hearth/o as to cover it all over,and there
I let them lie, till the Hearth was very hot; then
fweeping away all the Embers, I fet down my Loaf*
or Loaves, and whelming down the earthen Pot
upon them, drew the Embers all round the Out-fide
of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the Heat; and
thus, as well as in the beft Oven in the World, I
bak'd my Barley Loaves, and became in little Time
a meer Paftry-Cook into the Bargain for I made
myfelf feveral Cakes of the Rice, and Puddings ;
indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any Thing to
put into them, fuppofing I had* except the Fieftj
either Fowk or Goats.
It need not be wonder d at, if all thefe Things
took me up aloft Part of the third Year of my A-'
bode here; for it is to be obferv'd, That in the In-
tervals of thefe Things, I had my new Harveft and
Husbandry to manage; for I reaped rtiy Corn in its
Seafon, and carried it Home as well as I could, and
laid it up in the Ear, inmylargeBaskets> till I had
L Tim
Time to rub it out; for I had no Floor to thrafli it
on, or Inflrument to thrafli it with-
And now indeed my Stock of Corn increafing,
I really wanted to build my Barns bigger: I wanted
a Place to lay it up in; for the Increafe cf the Corn
now yielded me fo much* that I had of the Barley
about twenty Bufliels, and of the Rice as much,
or more'; infomuch, that now I refolv'd to begin
to ufe it freely; for my Bread had been quite gone
a great while ; alfo I refblv'd to fee what Quanti-
ty would be fufficient for me a whole Year, and to
fow but once a Year.
Upon the whole, 1 found that the forty Bufliels
of Barley and Rice was much more than I could
confume in a Year; (o I refolv'd to fpw juft the
fame Quantity every Year that I fowed the laft, in
hopes tnat fuch a Qiiantity would fully provide me
with Bread, &c.
All the while thefe Things were doing, you may
by fure my Thoughts run many times upon the
Profpeft of Land which I had feen from the other
Side of the Ifland, and I was not without fecret
Wiflies that I were on Shore there, fancying the
feeing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country.
I might find fome Way or other to convey my
felf farther, and perhaps at laft find fome. Means
of Efcape.
But all this while I made no Allowance for the
Dangers of fuch a Condition, and how I might fall
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch as I
might have Reafon to think far worfe than the Ly-
ons and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came in-
to their Power, I fliould run a Hazard more than a
Thoufand to One of being kii/d, and perhaps of be-
ing eaten; for I had heard that the People of the.
Carribean Coafts were Cannibals or Man-eaters; and
I knew by the Latitude, that I could not be far oft'
• . from
from that Shore. That fuppofe they were not Canni-
bals, ye^ that they might kill me, as many Europeans
who ha^iatieiKinto their Hands had been ferv d,
even when they IpA been ten or twenty together j
much more I that wa$ but one, and could make lit-
tle or no Defences All thefe Things, 1 fay, which I
ought to have confider'd well of, and did cad up in
my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my.
Apprehenfions at firft ; but my Head run mightily
upon the Thought of gettirgoverto the Shore.
Mow I wifib'd for my Boy Xury, and the Long-
Boat, with the Shoulder of Mutton-Sail, with
which I failed aboveathoufand Miles on the Coaft
of Africk; but this was. in vain. Then I thought I
would go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I
have faid, was blown up upon the Shore a great
Way in the Storm, when we w|ere firft call away.
She lay almoft where lhe did at firft, but not quite;
and was turn'd by the Force ot the Waves and the
Winds, almoft Bottom upward, againft a high
Ridge of bcachy rough Sand; but no Water a-
bout her as before.
If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to
have launch'd her into the Water, the Boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brafils with her ealily enough; but
I might have forefeen, that I could no more turn
her, and fee her upright upon her Bottom, than I
could remove the Ifland: However, I went to the
Woods, and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought
them to the Boat, refolv'd to cry what 1 could do;
fuggefting to myfelf, that if I could but turn her
down, I might eafily repair the Damage (he had
received, and fhe would be a very good Boat, and.
I might go to Sea in her very eaiily.
1 fpar'd'Ao Pains indeed, in this Piece of fruitlefs
Toil, and (pent, I think, three or four Weeks a-
L % bout
bout it; at laft finding it lmpofltble to heave it up
with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the
Sand to undermine it, and fo to make it fail down,
fetting Pieces of Wood to thru ft and guide it right
in the Fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it
up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move it
forward towards the Wa:er; fo I was fore'd to give
it over ; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of
the Boat, my defire to venture over for the Main
increafed, rather than decreafed, as the Means for
it feem'd impoffible.
This at length put me upon thinking, Whether
it was not poflibleto make myfelf a Canoe, or Peria-
guajuch as the Natives of thofe Climates make,even
without Tools, or, as I might fay, without Hands,
viz,, of the Trunk of a great Tree ? This I not
only thought pcffible, but eafy, andpleas'd my felf
extreamly with the Thoughts of making it, and
with my having much more Convenience for it than
any of the Negroes ox Indians; but not at all consi-
dering the particular Inconveniences which I lay
under, more than the Indians did, viz,. Want of
Hands to move it, when it was made, into the
Water; a. Difficulty much harder for me to fur-
mount, than all the Confequences of want of
Tools could be to them.- for what was it tome,
That when 1 had chofena vaft Tree in the Woods,
1 might with much Trouble cut it down, if after
I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub
the Outiide into the proper Shape of a Boat, and
burn or cut out the Infide to make it hollow, fo
to make a Boat of it, if after all this, I muft leave
it juft there where I found it, and was not able to
launch it into the Water ?
One would have thought I could not, have had
' the 1'e'afi Reflection upon my Mind of my Circum-
.',>-,.. : ~: ftance,
ftance, while I was making this Boat; but I fhould
have immediately thought how I fhould get it into
the Sea ; but my Thoughts were Co intent upon my
Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never orceconfi-
det'd how I fhould get it off of the Land; and it
was really in its own Nature more eafy for me to
guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than about
forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to let it
afloat in the Water.
I went to work upon this Boat the mod like a
Fool that ever Man did, who had any ofhisSenfcs
awake. I pleased myfelf with the Defign, with-
out determining whether I was ever able to under-
take it; nor but that the Difficulty of launching
my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a
ftop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolifh
Anfwer which I gave myfelf, Let's fir ft make it^TU
warrant 17/find fome way or other to get it aleng> when
'tis done.
This was a moft prepofterous Method; but the
Eagernefs of my Fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, I fell'd a Cedar Tree: I queftion much
whether Solomon ever had fuch a one for the Build-
ing of the Temple at Jerufalem. Ic was five Foot
ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the
Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at
the End of twenty two Foot, after which it lei-
fen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches:
It was not without infinite Labour that I fell'd
this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking and hew-
ing at it at the Bottom. I Was fourteen more get-
ting the Branches and Limbs, and a vaft fpread-
ing Head of it cut off, which I hack'd and hew'd
through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpreffible
Labour: after this, it cofl me a Month to fliape
it, and. dub it to a Proportion, and to fomething
like the Bottom of a Boat, that it rtiight fwim up-
L 3 richt
right as it ought to do. It coft me near three
Months more to clear the Infide, and work it out
fo, as to make an' exact Boat of it: This I did in-
deed without Fire, by meer Mallet and Chiflel, and
by the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought it
to be a very handfome Periagua, and big enough to
hive carried fix and twenty Men, aiki consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my Cargo.
When I had gone through this Work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The Boat was really
^ much bigger then I ever law a Canoe, or Periagua,
* that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a
weary Stroke it had coft, you may be fure ,• and
there remain'd nothing but to get it into the Wa-
ter; and had I gotten it into thewater, I make no
queftion, but Ifhould have begun the maddeft Voy-
age, and the mod unlikely to be perform'd, that
ever was undertaken.
But all my Devices'to get it into the Water
faifd me, though they coft me infinite Labour too.
It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water,
and not mo^e : But the firft Inconvenience was, it
was up Hill towards the Creek; well, to take a-
way this Difcouragement, I refolv'd to dig into
the Surface of the Earth, and fo make a Declivity:
This I begun, and it coft me a prodigious deal of
Pains; but who grudge Pains, that have their
Deliverance in View? But when this work'd
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was ftill
much at one ; fori could no more ftir the Canoey
than I could the other Boat.
Then I meafur'dthe Diftance of Ground, and
refolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canal, to bring the Wa-
ter up to the Came, feeing I could not bring the
Canoe down to the Water: Well, I began this
Work, and when I began to enter into it, and cal-
culate how deep it was to be dug, how broad,
who
hew the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, that, by
^ the Number of Hands I had, being none but my
own, it muft have been ten or twelve Years be-
fore I fhould have gone through with it; .for the
Shore lay high, fcVhat at the upper End it muft
have been at leaft twenty Foot deep; fo at length,
rho' with great Relu#ancy, 1 gave this Attempt
over alfo. >
Thisgriev'dme heartily, and now I law, tho
too late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we
count the Coff, and before we judge rightly of
our own Strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this Work, I finifli'd my fourth
Year in this Place, and kept my Anniverfary with
the fame Devotion, and with as much Comfort as
ever before; for by a cenftant Study, and ferious
Application of the Word of God, and by the Af-
fiftance of his Grace, I gain'd a different Know-
ledge from what I had before, I entertained diffe-
rent Notions of Things. I look'd now upon the
World ,as a Thing remote, which I had nothing to
do with, no Expe&ation from, and indeed no De-
fires about: In a Word, I had nothing indeed to
do with it, nor was ever like to have ,• fo 1 thought
it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,^
viz,, as a Place I had lived in, but was come out of
it; and well might I fay, as Father Abraham to
Dives, Between me and thee is a great Gulph fixed.
In the firil Place, I was removed from all the
Wickednefs of the World here : I had neither the
Lufl of the Flejhy the Lujl of the Eye, or the Pride of
Life. I had nothing to covet; for I had ail that I
was now capable of enjoying : I was Lord of the
whole Manor, or if I pleas M, I might call myfeif
King, or Emperor over the whole Country, which
I had Poffeffion of. There were no Rivals : I uad
no Competitor, none to dilpute Sovereignty or
L 4 Com-
Command with me, I might have rais'd Ship
JLoadings of Corn ; but I had no. ufe for it; fo I
let as little grow as I thought enough for my Qc?
cafion. I had Tqrtoife or Turtles enough ; but
now and then orie wajtf as much 3s I could put to
any ufe. I had Timber enough to have built a
Fleet of Ships. I had Grapes enough to have
made Wine, or to havecur'd into Raifins, to have
loaded that Fleet when they had been built,
But all I could make ufe of, was,' All that was
valuable. I had enough to eat, and to fupply my
Wants; and, what was all the reft to me ? If I
kill'd more Flefh than I could eat, the Dog muft
eat it, 0£ the Vermin. If I fowM more Corn than
I could eat, it muft be fpoil'd. The Trees that I
cut down, were lying to rot on the Ground : I
could make no more ufe of them than for Fewel,
and that I had no Qccaiion for, but to drefs my
Food. .
In a Word, The Nature and Experience of
Things dictated to me upon juft Refleftion, that
all the good Things of this World, are no farther
good to us, than they are for our Ufe ; and tha,t
whatever we may heap up indeed to give others,
we enjoy jiift as much as we can ufe, and no more.
The mod covetous griping Mifcr in the World
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetoufnefs,
if he had been in my Cafe j; for I poiieffed infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room
for Defire, except it was of Things which I had
not, and they were but Trifles, though indeed of
great Ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Par
cjI of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thir-
ty fix Pounds Sterling : Alas! there the naftyforry
vifelefs Scuff lay h 1 had no manner of Bufincft
for it ; and I often thought with myfelf, that I
would have given a Handful of it for a Gr.ofs of
v Tobacco-
Tobacco-Pipes, or for a Hand-Mill to grind my
Corn ; nay, I would have given it all for Sixpenny-
worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out o£England, or
fpr a Handful of Peafe and Beans, and a Bottle of
Ink : As it was, I had not the leafl: Advantage by
it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay in a Draw-
er, and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave
in the wet'Seafon; and if I had had the Drawer
full of Diamonds, it had been the fame Cafe ; and
they had been of no manner of Value to me, be-
caufe'of no Ufe.
I had now brought my State of Life to be much
eafier in it felf than it was at firft, and much ea-
lier to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I fre-
quently fat down to my Meat with Thankfulnefs,
and admired the Hand of God's Providence, which
had thus fpread my Table in the Wildernefs. I
learned to look up more on the bright Side of my
Condition, and iefs upon the dark Side; and to
confider what I enjoy'd, rather than what I want-
ed >* and this gave me fometimes fuch fee ret Com-
forts, that I cannot exprefs them ; and which I
take Notice of here, to put thofe difcontented
People in Mind of it, who cannot enjoy comforta-
bly what Gcd has given them ; becaufe they fee,
and covet fomething that he has not given them :
All our Difcontents about what we want, appea-
red to me, to fpring from the want of Thankful-
ness for what we have.
Another Reflefcion was of great Ufe to me, and
doubtlcfs would be fo to any one that fhould fall
into fuch Difrrefs as mine was j and this was, to
compare my prefent Condition with what 1 at firft
expeded it fhould be ; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, .if the good Providence of
God had not wonderfully ordered the Ship to be
caft up nearer to the Short:, where I not only could
come
come at her, but could bring what I got; out of
her to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort;
without which, I had wanted for Tools to work,
Weapons for Defence, or Gun-Powder and Shot
for getting my Food.
I fpent whole Hours, I may fay, whole Days, in
reprefenting to my felf in the moft lively..Colours,
how I mult have aSed, if I had got nothmg out
of the Ship; how I could not have fo much as
got any Food, except Fifli and Turtles ,* and that
as it was long before I found any of them, I muft
have perifli'd firft : That I fhould have liv'd, if I
had not jperifb'd, like a meer Savage: That if I
had killed a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance,
I had no way to flea or open them* or part the; Flefh
from the Skin and the Bowels, or to cut it up,*
but muft gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it: with
my Claws like a Beaft.
Thefe Reflexions made me very fenfible of the
Goodnefs of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my prefent Condition, with all its Hardfhips
and Misfortunes : And this Part alfo I cannot but
recommend to the Refle&ion of thofe, who are apt
in their Mifery, to fay, Is any AffliEtion like mine!
Let them confider, How much worfe the Cafes of
fomc People are, and their Cafe might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.
I had another Refledtion which affifted me alfo
to comfort my Mind with Hopess and this was,
comparing my prefent Condition with what I had
dcferv'd, and had therefore Rcafon to expeft from
the Hand of Providence. If had liv'd a dreadful
Life,perfectly deftitute of the Knowledge and Fear
of God. I had been well inftru&ed by Father and
M other; neither had they been wanting to me, in
their early Endeavours, to infufe a religious Awe
of God into mv Mind, a Senfe of my Duty, and
of
of what the Nature and End of my Being required
of me. But alas ! failing early into the Sea-faring
Life, which of all the Lives is the moft deftitute
of the Fear of God, though his Terrors are al-
ways before them ; I fay, failing early into the
Sea-faring Life, and into Sea-faring Company, all
that little Senfe of Religion which I had entertain-
ed, waslaugh'd out of me by my Mefs-Mates, by
a hardened defpifing of Dangers, and the Views of
Death, which grew habitual to me, by my long
Abfencefrom all manner of Opportunities to con-
vert with any Thing but what was like my felf,
or to hear any Thing that was good, or tended
towards it.
So void was I of every Thing that was good, or
of the leaft Senfe of what I was, or was to be,
that in the greatefl Deliverances I enjoy'd, fuch
as my Efcape from SaUee; my being taken up by
the Portuguefe Matter of the Ship,- my being plant-
ed fo well m the Braftls; my receiving the Cargo
from England, and the like;-1 never had once the
Word, Thank God, fomuch as on my Mind, or in
my Mouth, nor in the greatefl: Diftrefs, had I fo
much as a Thought to pray to him, or fomuch as
to lay, Lord have Mercy upon me; no nor to men-
tion the Name of God, unlefs it was to fwear by
and blafpheme it. "
1 had terrible Reflefiions upon my Mind for
many Months, as I have already obferv'd, on the
account of my wicked and hardned Life paft; and
when I look d about.me, andconfider'd what parti-
cular Providences had attended me face my com-
ing into this Place, and how God had dealt boun-
titulty with me; had not only punifh'd me lefs than
my Iniquity had deferv'd, but had fo plentifully pro-
vided forme; this gave me great Hopes that my
Repen-
Repentance was accepted, and that God had yet
Mercy in ftore for me.
With thefe Reflexions I work'd my M'nd up,
not only to Reiignation to the Will of God in the
prefent Difpofition of my Circumftances,- but even
to a fincere Thankfulnefs for my Condition; and that
I, who was yet a living Man, ought not to com4-
plain, feeing'I had not the due Punifihment of my
Sins ; that I enjoy'd fo many Mercies which I had
no reafon to have expected in that Place,* that I
ought nevermore to repine at my Condition, but to
rejoyce, and to give daily Thanks for that daily
JBread,which nothing buta Crowd of Wonders could
have brought. That I ought to confider J had been
fed even by a Miracle, even as great as that of feed-
ing Elijah by Ravens ; nay, by a long Series of Mi-
racles, and that I could hardly have nam'da Place
in the unhabitable part of the VVorld where I could
have been caft more to my Advantage : A Place,
where as I had no Society, which was my AfFU-
ftion on one hand, fo I found no ravenous Beafts,
no furious Wolves or Tygers to threaten my Life,
510 venomous or poifonons Creatures, which I might
feed on to my Hurt, no Savages to murder and de-
vour me.
In a word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one
way, fo it was a Life of Mercy, another ; and I
wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort, but
to be able to make my Senfe of God's Goodnefs
to me, and Care over me in this Condition, be my
daily Confolation ; and after 1 did make a jufl Im-
provement of thefe Things, I went away and was
no more (ad.
I had now been here fo long, that many Things
which I brought on Saore for my Help, wcr^ ei-
ther quite gone, or very much walled and near
fpent.
V My
My Ink, as I obferv'd, had been gone for fome
time, ail but a very little, which I eek'd out with
Water a little and a little, till it was fopaleit fcarce
left any.Appearance of black upon the Paper : As
long as it lafted, I made ufe of it to minute down
the Days of the Month on which any remarkable
Thing happen'd to me ; and firft, by cafting up
Times paft, I remember that there was a ftrange
Concurrence of Days in the various Providences
which befel me; and which, if I had been fuperfti-
tioufly inclin'd to obferv^ Days as Fatal or Fortu-
nate, I might have had Reafon to have look'd upon
with a great deal ofCuriofity.
Firft, I had obferv'd, that the fame Day that I
broke away from my Father and my Friends, and
run away to HuU> in order to go to Sea ; the fame
Day afterwards I was taken by the SaUee Man of
War, and made a Slave.
The fame Day of the Year that I efcap'd out of
the Wreck of that Ship it\ Yarmouth Roads, that
fame Day-Year afterwards I made my Efcape from
Sattee in the Boat.
The fame Day of the Year I was born on, (viz..)
the 30th of'September, the fame Day I had my Life
fo miraculoufly fav'd 26 Years after, when I was
call on Shore on this Illand; fo that my wicked
Life and my folitary Life began both on a Day,
The next Thing to my Ink's being wafted, was
that of my Bread, I mean the Bisket which I
brought out of the Ship : This I had husbanded to
the laft Degree, allowing my felt but one Cake of
Bread a Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite
without Bread for near a Year before I got any
Corn of my own ; and great Reafon I had to be
thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being
as has been already obferv'd, next to miraculous/
My
My Cloaths began to decay too mightily * As to
Linnen, I had had none a good while, except fome
chequer'd Shirts which I found in the Chefts of the
other Seamen, and which I carefully prefcrv'd, be-
caufe many times I could bear no other Cloaths on
but a Shirt ,• and it was a very great Help to me
that I had among all the Mens Cloaths of the Ship
almoft three dozen of Shirts. There were alfo fe-
veral thick Watch-Coats of the Seamens, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear ;
and tho' it is true, that the Weather was fo vio-
lent hot that there was no need of Cloaths, yet I
could not go quite naked ; no, tho' I had been in-
clined to it, which I was not, nor could not abide
the Thoughts of it, tho' I was all alone.
The Reafon why I could not go quite naked,
was, I could not bear the Heat of the Sun fo
well when quite naked, as with fome Cloaths on ;
nay, the very Hear frequently blifter'd my Skin ;
whereas with a Shirt on, the Air it felf made fome
Motion, and whittling under that Shirt was twofold
cooler than without it: No more could I ever bring
myfelf to go out in the Heat of the Sun without a
Cap or a Hat; the Heat of the Sun beating with
fuch Violence as it does in that Place, would give
me the Head-ach prefently, by darting fo direfiJy
on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on ; fo that I
could not bear it; whereas, if I put on my Hat, it
would prefently go away.
Upon thefe Views I began to confiderabout put-
ting the few Rags I had, which I call'd Cloaths,
into fome Order: I had worn out all the Waft-
coats I had, and my Bufinefs was now to try if I
could not make Jackets out of the great Watch-
Coats which I had by me, and with fuch other
Materials as I had ; fo I fet to work a Tayloring,
or rather indeed a Botching, for I made moft
piteous
piteous Work of it. However, I made fhift to
make two or three new Waftcoats, which I hoped
would ferve me a great while; as for Breeches or
Drawers, I made but a very forry fhift indeed, till
afterward.
I have mentioned that I faved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones,
and I had hung them up ftretch'd out with Sticks
in the Sun, by which Means fome of them were fo
dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others
it feems were very ufeful. The firft thing I made
of thefe was a great Cap for my Head, with the
Hair on the Outfide to fhoor off the Rain; and
this I perform'd fo well, that after this I made me
a Suit of Cloaths wholly of thefe Skins, that is to
lay, a Wafkoat, and Breeches open at Knees, and
both loofe, for they were rather wanting to keep
me cool than to keep me warm. I muft not omit
to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made ;
for if I was a bad Carpenter, I was a worfe Taylor.
However, they were fuch as I made very good
fhift with ; and when I was Abroad, if it happen'd
to rain, the Hair of my Waftcoat and Cap being
outermoft, I was kept very dry.
After this I fpent a great deal of Time and Pains
to make me an Umbrella; I was indeed in great
want of one, and had a great Mind to make one :
I had feen them made in the Brafils, where they
are very ufeful in the great Heats which are there:
And I felt the Heats every jot as great here, and
greater too, being nearer the Equinox; befides, as
I was obliged to be much Abroad, it was a mod
ufeful Thing to me, as well for the Rains as the
Heats. I took a World of Pains at it, and was a
great while before I could make any Thing likely to
hold ; nay, after I thought I had hit the Way, I
fpoird * or 3 before I made one to my Mind; but
at
at laft I made one that anfwer'd indifferently well t
The main Difficulty I found Was to make it to let
down. I could make it to fpread, but & it did nor
let down too, and drawn in, it was not portable for-
me any Way but juft over my Head, which would
not do. However, at laft, as I faid, I made one
to anfwer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair up-
wards, fo that it caft off the Rains like a Pent-
houfe, and kept off the Sun fo effe&ually, that I
could walk out in the hotteft of the Weather with
greater Advantage than I could before in the cool-
eft, and when I had no need of it, could clofe it and
carry it under my Arm.
Thus IIIv'd mighty comfortably, my Mind be-
ing entirely compofed by resigning to the Will o£
God, and throwing my felf wholly upon the Dif*
pofal of his Providence. This made my Life bet-
ter than fociable; for when I began to regret thQ
want ofConverfation, I would ask my felf whether
thus converfing mutually with my own Thoughts,
and, as I hope I may fay, with even God himfelf
by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmoft
Enjoyment of human Society in the World >
I cannot fay that after this, for five Years, any
extraordinary Thing happen'd to me, but I hVd on
in the fame Courfe, in the fame Pofture and Pla£e,>
juft as before: the chief Things I was employ'din*
befides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and
Rice, and curing my Raifins, of both which I al-
ways kept up juft enough to have fufficient Stock
of one Year's Provisions beforehand ; I fay, befides
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a
Camey which at laft I finifh'd: So that by diging
a Canal to it of fix Foot wide, and four Foot 
deep, I, brought it into the Creek, a!moft half a
Mile. As for the firft, which was fo vaftly big,
a*
as I made it without confidering before-hand, as I
ought to do, how I (hould be able to launch it ,* fo
never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring
the Water to it, I was obliged to let it lye where it
was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wifet
next Time : Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could
not get a Tree proper for it, and in a Place where
I could not get the Water to it, at any lefs Diftance
than as I have faid, near half a Mile; yet as I faw
it vtfas pracfticable at laft, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two Years about it, yet I never
grutch'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat
to go off to Sea at laft.
However, though my little Periagua was fi-
nifh'd, yet the Size of it was not at all anfwerable
to the Defign which I had in View, when I made
the firft; I mean, Of venturing over to zhzTerra
Firma, where it was above forty Miles broad; ac-
cordingly, the Smallnefs of my Boat affifted to put
an End to that Defign, and now I thought no more
of it: But as I had a Boat, my next Defign was to
make a Tour round the Illand; for as I had been on
the other Side, in one Place, eroding as I have al-
ready defcrib'd it over the Land; fo the Difcove-
ries I made in that little Journey, made me very ea-
ger to fee other Parts of the Coaft, and now I had
a Boat, I thought of nothing but failing round the
Ifland.
For this Purppfe, that I might do every Thing
with Difcretion and Confideration, I fitted up a lit-
tle Maft to my Boat, and made a Sail to it out of
fome of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail which lay in
Store, and of which I had a great Stock by me.
Having fitted my Maft and Sail, and try'd the
Boat, 1 found flie would fail very well; Then I
made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either End of my
Boat, to put Provifions, Neceffaries and Ammuni-
M < tion-
tion, &c- into, to be kept dry, either fifom Rain, or
the Sprye of the Sea; and a little long hollow Plaee
I cutjn rhe Iniide of the Boat, ^here Icould lay
my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it to
keep it dry.
I fix'd my Umbrella alfo in a Step at the Srern*
like a Mad, to (land over my Head, and keep the
Heat of the Sun off of me like an Alining; and
thus I every now and then took a little Voyage
upon the Sea, but never went far out, nor far from
the little Creek ; but at laft being eagar to view
the Circumference of my little Kingdom, Irefolv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly 1 vi&uall'dmyShip
for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of my Loaves
(Cakes I fliould rather call them) of Barley Bread*
an earthen Pot full of parch'd Rice, a Food I eat
a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum, half a
Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more, and
two large Watch-coats, of thofe which, as I men-
tion d before, I had fav'd out of the Seamen's
Cheils; thefe I took, one to lye upon> and theo-
thcrto cover me in the Night.
It was the lixth of November, in the fixth Year
of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you pleafe,
That. I fat out on thi$ Voyage, and I found it much
longer than I expe&ed; for though the liland itfelf
was not very large, yet when 1 came to the Eaft
Side of ir, 1 found a great Ledge of Rocks lye out;
above two Leagues into the Sea, fome above Wa-
ter, Come under it; and beyond that, a Shoal of
Sand, lying dry half a League more; fo that! was
obhg'd to go a great Way out to Sea to double che
Poinr.
When firfl I difcover'd them, I was going to give
over my ti Lerprize, and come back again, not
knowing how tar it might oblige me to go out to
Sea; and above ali, doubting how I fliould get back
again;
again; (o f came to an Anchor ; for | h^d^jnadc
me a kind of an Anchor ; with a Piecef^p?^^^n
Graplin, which t got ort(f$tf the Ship, '^Ifc;::^*'
Having fecund my Boat, I took my Gun, and
went on Shore, climbing up upon'a? HilJ, which
feem'd to over-look that Point, where I few the
full Extent of it, and refolv'd to venture.
In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I
flood, I perceived a ftrong, and indeed, amoft fu-
rious Current, which run to the Eafiy and even
came clofe to the Point; and I took the more No-
tice of it, becaufc I faw there might be fome Dan-
ger, that when I came into it, I might be carry'd
out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able
to make the Ifland again ; and indeed, had I not
gotten firft up upon this Hill, I be.ieve it would
have been fo; for there was the fame Current on
the other Side the Ifland, only, that itfetoffat
a farther Diftance; and I faw there was a ftrong
Eddy under the Shore; fo I had nothing to do but
to get in out of the firft Current, and I fhould pre-
fently be in an Eddy.
I lay here, however, two Days; becaufe the
Wind blowing pretty frefti at E. S. E. and that
being juft contrary to the faid Current, made a
great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; fo that it
was not fafe for me to keep too clofe to the Shore
for the Breach, not to go too far off becaufe of
the Scream.
The third Day in the Morning, the Wind ha-
ving abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I
ventur'd ; but I am a warning Piece again to all
rafli and ignorant Pilots ; for no fooner was I come
to the Pointy when even I was not my Boat's
Length from the Shore, but I found myfelf in a
great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice
of a Mill: It carry'd my Boat a long with it
M 2 with
^i^^^fc Violence, that all I could do, could
%f^^^Rt fo much as on the Edge of it ; but I
foS^^fiurry'd me IfPier and farther out from
the Eddy, which was on my Left Hand. There
was no Wind^irring to help me, and all I could
do with my Paddlesfignify'd nothing; and now I
began to give myfelf over for loft ; for as the Cur-
rent was on both Sides the Ifland, I knew in a few
Leagues Diftance they muft joyn again, and then
I was irrecoverably gone ; nor did I fee any Poffi-
bility of avoiding it; fo that I had no Profpeti be-
fore me but of Perifhing; not by the Sea, for that
was calm enough, but of ftarving for Hunger. I
had indeed found a Tortoife on the Shore, as big
almoft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the
Boat; and I had a great Jar of frefh Water, that is
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all
this to being driven into the vaft Ocean, where to
be fure, there was no Shore, no main Land, orl-
fland, for a thoufand Leagues at leaft.
And now I faw how eafy it was for the Provi-
dence of God to make the moft miferable Condi-
tion Mankind could be in. worfe. Now I look'd
back upon my defolate folitary Illand, as the moft
pleafant Place in the World, and all the Happinefs
my Heart could with for, was to be but there a-
gain. I ftretch'd out my Hands to it with eager
VVifties. O happy Defart, faidl, I {hail never fee
the more/ O miferable Creature, faid I, whi-
ther am I going ! Then I reproached my felf with
my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at,
my folatary Condition; and now what would I give
to be on Shore there again. Thus we never fee
the true State of our Condition, till it is illuftrated
to us By its Contraries; nor know how to value
what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It isfcarce
poffible to imagine the Confternation I was now in,
being
 being driven from my beloved Ifland (fcs^iyLaP'"
peared to me now to be) into the wide C^^^^l-
moft two Leagues, and fe<the utmoft Dlfpair of
ever recovering it again Efowever, I work'd hard,
till indeed my Strength was almoft elhaufted, and
kept my Boat as much to the Northward, that is,
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy
lay on, as poffibly I could; when about Noon, as
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a lit-
tle Breeze of Wind in my Face, fpringing up from
the S. S. £. This chear'd my Heart a little, and
efpecially when in about half an Hour more, it
blew a pretty fmall gentle Gale. By this Time I
was gotten at a frightful Diftance from the IQand,
and had the lead Cloud or hazey Weather in cerven'd,
I had been undone another Way too; for I had no
Compafs on Board, and fliould never have known
how to have fleered towards the IQand, if I had
but once loft Sight of it; but the Weather conti-
nuing clear, I apply'd myfelf to get up my Maft
again, fpread my Sail, ftanding away to the North
as much as poflible, to get out of the Current.
J Lift as I had fet my Maft and Sail, and the Boat
began to ftretch away, I faw even by the Cleamefs
of the Water, fome Alteration of the Current was
near; for where the Current was fo ftrong, the
Water was foul; but perceiving the Water clear, I
found the Current abate, and prefently I found to
the Eafly at about half a Mile, a Breach of the
Sea upon fome Rocks; thefe Rocks I found caus'd
the Current to part again, and as the main Strefs
of it ran away more Southerly, leaving the Rocks
to the North-Eaft; fo the other returned by the Re-
pulfe of the Rocks, and made a ftrong Eddy, which
yari back again to the North-Weft with a very
jharp Stream.
M 3 They
TjuaU^o know what it is to have a Reprive
bi"^i|JPpt'hem upon the Ladder, or to be refill-
ed froMFhieves juft goiif to murder them, or who
have been in fuch like Extremities, may guefs what
my prefent Surprize of Joy was, and how gladly I
put my Boat into the Stream of this Eddy, and the
Wind alfo frefhning, how gladly I fpread my Sail
to it, running chearfully before the Wind, and with
a ftrong Tide or Eddy under Foot.
This Eddy carry *d me about a League in my
Way back again directly towards the Ifland, but
about two Leagues more to the Northward than
the Current which carried me away at firft; fo
that when I came near the Ifland, I found my felf
open to the Northern Shore of it, that is to fay,
the other End of the Wand oppofite to that which
I went out from.
When I had made fomething more than a League
of Way by the Help of this Current or Eddy, I
found it was fpent and fervM me no farther. How-
ever, I found that being between the two great
Currents, (viz,.) that on the South Side, which
had hurried me away, and that on the North,
which lay about a League on the other Side: I fay,
between thefe two, in the Wake of the Ifland, I
found the Warer at. leaft ftill and running no Way ;
and having ftiil a Breeze of Wind fair forme, I
kept on fleering dire&Jy for the Ifland, tho5 not
making fuch frefh Way as I did before.
About four a Clock, in the Evening, being then
within about a League of the Ifland, I found the
Point of the Flocks which occasioned this Bifafter*
ftretching out, as is defcribed before, to the South-
ward, and eafting oft the Current more Southward-
ly, had of Courf e made another Eddy to the North*
andthis I found very ftrong, but not dire&Jy fetting
the Way my Ccurfclay, which was due Weft, but
. almoft
almoft full North. However, having a frefli Gale,
1 fttetch'd a-crofs this Eddy flaunting North-weft,
and in about an Hour came within about a Mile
of the Shore, where it being ftnooth Water, I foon
got to Land.
When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and
gave God Thanks for my Deliverance, refolving
to lay afideail Thoughts of my Deliverance by my
Boat; and refreshing myfelf with fuch Things as
I had, I brought my Boat clofe to the Shore in a
little Cove that I had fpy'd under fome Trees, and
lay'd me down to lleep, being quite fpent with the
Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.
I was now at a great Lofs which way to get
Home with my Boat: 1 had run fo much Hazard,
andiknew too much the Cafe to think of attempt-
ing it by the Way I went out', and what might be
at ^he other Side (I mean the Weft Side) I knew
not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures;
(o I only refolved in the Morning to make my Way
Weftward along the Shore, and to fee if there was
no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safe-
ty, fo as to have her again if I wanted her In about
three Mile, or thereabout, coafting the Shore, I
came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over;?
which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet
or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour
for my Boat, and where (he lay as if fhe had beea
in a little Dock made on Purpofe for her. Here I
put in, and having ftow'd my Boat very fafe> I went
•on Shore to look about me, and fee where I was.
I foon found I had but little pafs'dby the Place
where I had been before, when I travelfd on Foot
.to that Shore ; fo. taking nothing .out of my Boat,
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, I began my March. The Way was
comfortable enough after fuch a Voyage as 1 had
M 4 been
been upon, and I reached my old Bower in the
Evening, where I found every Thing {landing as I
left it; for I always kept it in good Order, being,
as I faid before, my Country-Houfe.
I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the
Shade to reft my Limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell afieep : But judge you, if you can, that read
my Story, what a Surprize I mull be in, when I
was awak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me
by my Name feveral times, Robin, Robin, Robin
Crufoe, poor Robin Crufoe ! where are you Robin
Crufoe? \Vhereare you? Where have you been ?
I was fodead afleep at firft, being fatiguM with
rowing, or padling, as it is call'd, the firft Part
of the Day, and with walking the latter Part,
that 1 did not wake thoroughly ,• but dozing be-
tween fleeping and waking, thought I dream'd
that fome body fpoke to me : But as the Voice
continual to repeat, Robin Crufoe, Robin Crufoe, at
laft I began to wake more perfedly, and was at
firft dreadfully frighted, and ftarted up in the ut-
moft Confirmation : But no fooner were my Eyes
open, then I faw my Poll fitting on the Top of the
Hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that
fpoke to me? for juft in fuch bemoaning Language
1 had nfed to talk to him, and teach him ,* and he
had learn'd it fo perfectly, that he would fit upon
my Finger, and lay his Bill clofe to my Face, and
cry, Poor Robin Crufoe, Where are you ? Where have
you been ? How come you here ? And fuch Things as I
^ had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the Parrot,
and that indeed it could be no Body elfe, it was
a good .while betore I could compofe myfelf:
Firft, I was amazed how the Creature got thither,
and then how he fhould juft keep about the Place,
and no wjaere elfe : But as I was well fatisfied it
i could
could be no Body but honeft PoB> I got it over;
and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his
Name Poll, the fociable Creature came to me, and
fat upon my Thumb, as he ufed to do, and conti-
nued talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, and how
did I come here ? And where had I been ? Juft as if he
:had beed overjoy'd to fee me again; and fo I car-
rry'd him Home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for
fome time, and had enough to do for many Days
to fit ftiil, and refled upon the Danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had
my Boat again on my Side of the Ifland; but I
knew not how it was practicable to get it about.
As to the Eaft Side of the Ifland, which I had
gone round : I knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that Way; my very Heart would drink, and
my very Blood run chill to think of it: And as
to the other Side of the Ifland, I did not know
how it might be there; but fuppofing the Current
ran with the lame Force againft the Shore at the
Eaft, as it pafs d by it on the other, I might run
the fame Risk of being driven down the Stream
and carryM by the Ifland, as I had been before!
of being carry*d away from it: fo with thefe
Thoughts I contented myfelf to be without any
Boat, though it had been the Produd of fo many
Months Labour to make it, and of fo many more
to get it unto the Sea.
In this Government of my Temper I remained
near a Year, lived a very fedate retired Life as
you may well fuppofe; and my Thoughts being
very much compofed as to my Condition and ful*
ly comforted in refigning my felf to the Difpofiti^
onsof Providence, 1 thought I liv'd really very hap-
pily in all Things except that of Society.
Iim-
^ I improv'd my felf in this time in all the mecha*
nick Exercifes which my Neceffities put me upon
applying my felf to, and I believe could, upon Oc-
casion, made a very good Carpenter, efpecially con-
sidering how few Tools I had.
Ikfides this, I arriv'd at an unexpe&ed Perfe&i-
on in my earthen Ware, and contriv'd well enough
to make them with a Wheel, which I found infi-
nitely eafier and better; becaufe I made Things
round and fhapable, which before were filthy
Things indeed to look on. But I think I was ne-
ver more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for any Thing I found out, than for my be-
ing able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was
a very ugly clumfy Thing, when it was done, and
only burnt red like other earthen Ware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, 1
was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had been
always ufed to fmoke, and there were Pipes in the
Ship, but I forgot them at firft, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in the Ifland; and afterwards,
when I fearch'd the Ship again, I could not come
at any Pipes at alJ.
In my Wicker-Ware alfo I improved much, and
made abundance of neceflary Baskets, as well as
my Invention fhew'd me, though not very hand-
fome, yet they were fiich as were very handy and
convenient for my laying Things up in, or fetching
Things home in. For Example, if I killed a Goat a-
broad, I could bang it up in a Tree, flea it, and
drcfs it, and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in
a Basket; and the like by a Turtle, I could cut it
up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of the.
Flefli, which was enough for me, and bring them
home in a Basket, and leave the reft behind
me. Alfo large deep Baskets were my Recei-
vers for my Corn, which I always rubbed out as
foon
foonas it was dry, andcur'd, and kept it in great
Rackets*
I began now to perceive my Powder abated con-
fiderably, and this was a Want which it was im-
poffible for me to fupply, and I began ferioufiy to
confider what I muft do when I fhould have no
more Powder ; that is to fay, how I fhould do to
kill any Goat. I had, as is obferv'd in the third
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred
her up tame, and I was in hope of getting a He-
Goat, but I could not by any means bring it to
pafs, "till my Kid grew an old Goat; and I could
never find in my Heart to kill her, till fhe dyM at
laft of meer Age.
But being now in the eleventh Year of my Refi-
dence, and, as I have faid, my Ammunition grow-
ing low, I fet my felf to ftudy fome Art to trap and
fnare the Goats, to fee whether I could not catch
fome of them alive, and particularly I wanted a She-
Goat great with Young.
To this Purpofe I made Snares to hamper them,
and I do believe they were more than once taken
in them, but my Tackle was not good, for I had
no Wire, and I alway found them broken, and
my Bait devoured.
At length I refolv'd to try a Pit-fall, fo I dug
feveral large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I
had obferv'd the Goats us'd to feed, and over thefe
Pits I plac'd Hurdles of my own making too,
with a great Weight upon them; and feveral times
I put Ears of Barley and dry Rice, without let-
ting the Trap, and I could eafily perceive that the
Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I
could fee the Mark of their Feet. At length I fet
three Traps in one Night, and going the next
Morning I found them all ftanding, and yet the
Bait eaten and gone* This was very difcouraging;
How,
However, I alter'd my Trap, and, not to trouble
you with Particulars, going one Morning to fee my
Trap, I found in one of them a large old He-Goat,
and in one of the other, three Kid^ a Male and
two Females,
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was fo fierce I durft not go into the Pit to
him; that is to fay, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
kill'd him, but that was not my Bufjnefs, nor would
it anfwer my End. So I e'en let him out, and he
ran away as if he had been frighted out of
his Wits : But I had forgot then what I recollected
afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon. If I
had let him flay there three or four Days without
Food, and then have carryM him fome Water to
drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been
as tame as Qne of the Kids, for they are mighty
fagacious tradable Creatures where they are well
nfed.
However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing
no better at that time ; then I went to the three
Kids, and taking, them one by one, I tyed them
with Strings together, and with fome Difficulty
brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed, but
throwing them fome fwcet Corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame: and now I found that
if I expected to fupply my felf with Goat-Fled
when 1 had no Powder or Shot left, breeding fome
up tame was my only Way, when perhaps I
might have them about my Houfe like a Flock qf
Sheep.
But then it prcfently occur e'd to me, that I muft
keep the Tame from the Wild, or elfe they would
always run wild when they grew up ,* and the pnly
Way for this w^s to have fome enclofed Piece of-
Ground.
*>
Ground, well fcnc'd either with Hedge or Pale* to
keep them in fo effectually, that thofe within might
not break out, or thofe without break in.
This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of
Hands ; yet as I faw there was an abfolute Necef-
fity of doing it, my firft Piece of Work was to
find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz,, where there
was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water
for them to drink,, and Cover to keep them from
the Sun.
Thofe whounderftand fuch Enclofures will think
I had very little Contrivance, when I pitched upon
a Place very proper for all thefe, being a plain o-
pcn Piece of Meadow-Land or Savanna^ (as our
People call it in the We/tern Colonies,) which had
two or three little Drills of frefh Water in it, and
at one end was very woody: I fay they will fmile
at my Forecaft, when I {hall tell them I began my
enclofing of this Piece of Ground in fuch a man-
ner, that my Hedge or Pale mud have been at leaft
two Mile about. Nor was the Madnefs of it fo
great as to the Compafs, for if it was ten Mile a~
bout I was like to have time enough to do it in.
But I did not confider that my Goats would be
as wild i/) fomuch Compafs, as if they had had the
whole Iiland, and I fhould have fo much Room
to chace them in, that I fhould never catch
them.
My Hedge was begun and carry ?d on, I believe,
about fifty Yards, when this Thought occur'd
to me ^ fo Iprefently ftopt fliort, and for the firft
beginning I refolv'd to endofe a Piece of about 150
Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which
as it would maintain as many as I fhould
have in any reafonable time, fo as my Flock en-
creafed, I could add more Ground to my En-
clofure.
This
This was a&ing with fome Prudence, and I went
to work with Courage. I was about three Months
hedging in the firft Piece, and till I had done it I
tether'd the three Kids in the beft part of it, and
usM them to feed as near me as poflible to make
them familiar ; and very often I would go and car-
ry them fome Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice,
and feed them out of my Hand; fo that after my
Enclofurc was finifli'd, and I let them loofe, they
would follow me up and down, bleating after me
for a handful of Corn.
This anfwer'd my End, and in about a Year and
half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids
and all; and in two Years more I had three and
forty, befides feveral that I took and kill'd for my
Food. And after that I enclos'd five feveral
Pieces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens
to drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and
Gates out of one Piece of Ground into ano-
ther.
But this was not all, for now I not only had
Goats-Flefh to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk
too, a Thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not fo much as think of, and which, when it came
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur-
prize. For now I fet up my Dairy, and had fome
times a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every
Creature, di&ates even naturally how to make ufe
of it ,* fo I that had never milk'd a Cow, much lefs
a Goat, or feen Butter or Cheefe made, very rea-
dily and handily, tho' after a great many Mays
and Mifcarriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe
at laft, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
Creatures, even in thofe Conditions in which they
fcem'd to be overwhelmed in Deftru&ion! How
can
can he fwecten the bittereft Providences, and give
us caule to praife him for Dungeons and Prifons!
What a Table was here fpread for me in a Wilder-
nefs, where I law nothing at firft but to perifh for
Hunger!
It would have made a Stoick fmile to have feen,
me and my little Family fit down to Dinner; there
was my Majefty the Prince and Lord of the whole
Ifland; I had the Lives of all my Subje&s at my
abfolute Command. I could hang, draw, give Li-
berty, and take it away, and no Rebels among all
my Subje&s.
Then to fee how like a King I din'd too all
alone, attended by my Servants, Poll, as if he had
been my Favorite, was the only Perfon permit-
ted to talk to me. My Dog, who was now grown
very old and crazy, and had found no Species to
multiply his Kind upon, fat always at my Right-
Hand rand two Cats, one on one Side the Ta-
ble, and one on the other, expefting now and
then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of fpecial
Favour.
But thefe were not the two Cats which I brought
on Shore at firft, for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my Habitation by my
own Hand ; but one of them having multiply'd by
I know not what kind of Creature, thefe were
two which I had preferv'd tame, whereas the reft
run wild in the Woods, and became indeed trou-
blcfome to me at lait; for they would often come
into my Houfe, and plunder me too, till at laft I
was obliged too fhoot them, and did kill a great
many j at length they left me with this Atten-
dance, and in this plentiful Manner I liv'd; nei-
ther could I be faid to want any thing but Society,
and of that in fome time after this, I was like to
haye too much.
i I was
i Was fomething impatient, as I have tibfeiVd*
to have the ufe of my Boat; though very loth to
run anymore Hazards; and therefore fometimes I
fat contriving Ways to get her about the Ifland>
and at other Times I fat my felf down contented
enough without her.' But I had a ftrange Uneafinefs
in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Ifland,
where, as I have faid, in my laft Ramble, I went up
the Hill to fee how the Shore lay, and how the
Current fet, that I might fee what I had to do : This
Inclination increased upon me eveiy Day, and at
length I refolv'd to travel thither by Land, follow-
ing the Edge of the Shore, I did fo: But had any
one in £^to^ been to meet fuch a Manas I was, it
muft either have frighted them, or raised a great deal
of Laughter; and as I frequently flood ftill to look
at my ifelf, I could not but fmile at the Notion of
my travelling through Torkjhhe with fuch an Equi-
page, and in fuch a Drefs: Be pleas'd to take a
Sketch of my Figure as follows.
I had a great high (hapelefs Cap, made of a
Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as
well to keep the Sun from me, as to (hoot the Rain
off from running into my Neck; nothing being fo
hurtful in thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the
Flefli under the CI oaths.'
I had a ftort Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts
coming down to about the middle of my Thighs ;
andaPairof open- knee'd Breeches of the fame; the
Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He goat,
whofe Hair hung down fuch a Length on either
Side, that like Pantaloons it reach'd to the middle
of my Legs; Stockings and Shoes I had none, but
had made me a Pair of fomething, 1 fcarce know
what to call them, like Buskins, to flap over my
Le^s, and lace on either Side like Spatter-dafhes ;
b but
, bl77 ]
but of a moft barbarous Shape, as indeed were all
the reft of my: Cloafhs.
I, had on a broad 'Belt of Goats-Skin dryed,
which I drew together with two Thongs of the
fame, inftead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog
on either Side of this. Inftead of a Sword and a
Dagger hung a little Saw and a Hatchet* one on
one,. Side, one on the other. I had another Belt
not fo broad, and btften'd in the fame fanner,,
which hung over my Shoulder ; and at the End of
it, under my Left Arm, hung two Pouches, b6th
made of Goats-Skin too; in one of which hung
my Powder, in.the'other my Shot: At my Back I
carried my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and
over my Head a great clumfy ugly Goat-Skin
Umbrella, but which, after all, was the moft ne-
ceffary Thing I had about me, next to my Gun :
As for my Face, the Colour of it was really not fo
Mojetta like, as one itiight exped: from a Man not
at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten
Degrees of the Equinox. My Beard I had once
fuffer'd to grow till it was about a quarter of a Yard
long; but as I had both Sciflars and Razors fuffi-
cient, I had cut it pretty flibrt, except what grew on
my upper Lip, which I had trimm'd into a large
Pair, of Mahometan Whiskers, fuch as I had feen
Worn by fome Tiirks, who I faw at Sallee ; for the
Moors did not wear fuch, th6' the Turks did ; of thefe
Muftachioes or Whiskers, I will not fay they were
long enough to hang my Hat upon them ; but they
were of Length and Shape monftrous enough, and
fuch as in. England,would have pafs'd for frightful.
But all this by the by ; for as to my Figure, I
had fo few to obferve me, that it was of namai;-
ner of Confequence ; fo I fay no more to that Parr.
In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey, aid
was out five or fix Days. I travelled firfl along the
N Sea
Sea Shore, dire£Uy to the Place where I fir#
brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon
the Rocks ; and having ho Boat now to take care
of, I went over the Land a nearer Way, to the fame
Height that I was upon before ; when looking for-
ward to the Point of the Rocks which lay out,
£M which I was obliged to double with my Boar,
as iis f$id above, I was furprix'd to fee the Sea all
fmooth and quiet, no Ripling, no Motion, no Gir-
tent, any more there than in other Places.
1 was at a ftrange Lofs to underftand this, and
refolv'd to fpend fome Time in the obferving it, to
fee if nothing from the Sets of the Tide hadocca-
. fion'dit; but I was prefently convinced how it was,
viz,. That the Tide of Ebb fettirig from the Weft,
and joining with the Current of Waters from fome
great River on the Shore, muft be the Occafionof
. this Current; and that according as the Wind
blew more forcibly from the Wefi^ or from the
North, this Current came near, or went farther
from Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I
went up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of
Ebb being made, I plainly faw the Current again
as before, only, that it run farther off, being near
half a League from the Shore; whereas in my Cafe*
it fet clofeupon the Shore, and hurried me and my
Came along with it, which at another time it
would not have done.
This Obfervation convinced me, That I had no-
thing to do but to obferve the ebbing and the
flowing of the Tide, and I might very eafily bring
my Boat about the lfland again : But; when I be-
gan to think of putting it in Practice, I Jiadfuch a
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of
the Danger I had been in, that I could not think of
it again with any Patience; but on the contrary, I
.took up another Refoluc.'on, which was more fafe,
. though
.tho* more laborious ,• and this was, that I would
build, or rather make me another Pariagua] or Car
noe; and fo have one for one Side of the IQand,
and one for the other.
You are to underftand, that now I had, as I
may call it, two Plantations in the Ifland; one my
little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me,
which by this Time I had enlarged into feveral
Apartments, or Caves, one within another. One
of thefe, which was the drieft, and largeft, and
had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification ;
that is to fay, beyond where my Wail joyn'd to
the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large earthen
Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold
five or fix Bufhels each, where I laid up my Stores
of Provifion, efpecially my Corn, fome in the Ear
cut off ftiort from the Straw, and the other rubb'd
out with my Hand.
As for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes
or Piles, thofe Piles grew all like Trees, and were
by this Time grown fo big, and fpread fo very
much, that there was not the leaft Appearance to
any one's View of any Habitation behind them.
Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my
two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and fow'd, and which duly yielded me
their Harveft in its Seafon ; and whenever I had
Occafiofc for more Corn, I had more Land ad-
joying as fit as that.
Beiidcs this, I had my Country Seat, and I had
now a tolerable Plantation there alfo; for firft, I
had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept
in Repair; that is to fay, I kept the Hedge which
circled it in, conftantly fittedupto its ufual Height;
, "9
the
. £ l8° .3
the1 Ladder ftariding always in the Infide ; I kep¥
the Trees which at firfl: were no more than my '
Stakes, but-were now grown very firm and tall j
kept them always fo cut, that they might fpread
and grow thick and wild, and, make the more a-
greeafrie Shade^ which they dtd effe&ually to my
Mind. In the Middle of this.I had; my Tent al-
ways (landing, "being a Piece of a Sail fpread oven
Poles fet up for that Purpofe, -and which never
waited any Repair or Renewing ; and under this
I had made me a Squab or Couch, with the Skins
©f the Creatures I had kilJucfy*.. and.with other fqjft
Things, -and a Blanket laid^on them, fuch as be-
longed to pur Sea- Bedding,, .which I had faved, and
a great Watch^Goat to cover me i and^here,.when-
ever I had Occiafion to be abfent from my chief
Seat, I took up^my Country Habitation.
Ad joiningito this I had my Enclofures for my Cat-
tle, that is to-fay^ my Goats : And as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and enclofe
this Ground'; fo I was fo uneafy to fee it kept en-
tire, left the Goat sihould break thro', that I never
left off till with infinite Labour I had ftuck, the
Outfide of the Hedge fo full of fmall Stakes, . and
fo near to one another, that it was,rather a Pale
than a Hedge, and there was fcarce Room.t&put
a Hand thro' between them, ;which afterwards
when thofe Stakes grew, as they all did in the next;
r-ainy Seafon, made the Enclofure ftrong like a WalJ,
indeed ftronger than any Wall. •. K
¥/This will teftify for mey that 1 was potjdk^
and that I fpared no Pains to bring to pafs, what-
ever appeared neceifary for my. comfortable ..Sup-
port; for 1 cohfider'd the keeping up a Breed of
tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a liv-
ing Magazine of Flelh, Milk, Butter and Cheefe;
fcr me as long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be
forty Years, and that keeping them in ray Reach,
depended entirely upon my perfc&ing my Enclo-
sures to fuch a Degree, that I might be fore ot
keeping them together; which by this Method in-
deed 1 fo effectually fecut'd, that when thefe lit-
tle Stakes began to grow, I had planted them fq
very thick, I was farced to pull feme of them up
again.  .  
In this Place alfo I had my Grapes growing,
which I principally depended on for my Winter
Store of Raifins: and'which l never ^l'^ t0 Pre"
ferve very'carefuily, as the beft and moft agreeable
Dainty pf my whpleDiet; and indeed they were
not agreeable only, but phyfical, w b.olefome, nour
rifliin-g, and refrefbing, to the laft Degree.
As this was alfo about half the Way between my
other Habitation and the Place were I had laid up
ray Boat I generally ftay'd, and lay here in my
Way thither; for J ufed fre^uejitiy to vifit my
Boat, and keep all Thimgs a-bout or belonging to
her in very good Order; fometimes I went out
in her to divert myfelf, but no more hazardous
Voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever above a
Stone's Caft or two from the Shore, I was fo ap-
prehenfive of being hurried out of my Knowledge
again by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Ac-
cident. But now I came to a new Scene of my Life.
It happen'd one Day about Moon going towards
my Boat, I was exceedingly furpriz'd with the Print
of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore which was
very plain to befeen in the Sand: 1 ftood like one
Thunder-fhuck, or as if I had feen an Apparition ;
I liflxn'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing,
iior fee anything; I went up to a riling Ground to
loolT'farther; I went up to the Shore and down the
Shore, but k was all one, I could fee no other
' 3SI 3 Impreffion
Impreflion but that one, jl went to it again to fee
if there were any more, and to obferve if it might
not be my Fancy ; but there was no Room for
that, for there wasexaftly the very Print of a Foot,
Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot; how it
came thither, I knew not, nor could in the leaft
imagine.Butafter innumerable fluttering Thoughts,
like a Man perfe&ly confus'd and out of my felf, I
came Home to my Fortification, not feeling, as we
fay, the Ground I went on, but terrify 'd to the laft
Degree, loojotig behind me at every two or three
Steps, mistaking every Bufh and Tree, and fancy-
ing every Stump at a Diftance to be a M$n; nor is
it poffibleto defcribe how many various Shapes af-
frighted Imagination reprefented Things to me in;
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
in my Fancy, and what ftrange unaccountable
Whimfics came into my Thoughts by the Way.
When I came to my Caftle, for fo.I think Icall'd
it ever after this, I fled into it like one purfued ;
whether I went over by the Ladder as firft con-
trived, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which
I call'd a Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could
I remember the next Morning ; for never frighted
Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more
Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat.
I flept none that Night; the farther I was from
the Occafion of my Fright, the greater my Ap-
prehenfions were; which is fomething contrary to
the Nature of fuch Things, and efpecially to the u-
fual Pra&iee of all Creatures in Fear : But I was
fo embarrafs'd with my own frightful Ideas of the
Thing, that I form'd nothing but difmal Imagina-
tions to myfelf, even tho' I was now a great way
off it. Sometimes I fancy'd it muft be the De-
vil.; and Reafon joyn'd in with me upon this Sup-
poiidon : For how fhoulcl any other Thing in hu-
man
man Shap come into the Place ? Where was the
Veffel that brought them ? What Marks was there
of any other Footiteps? And how was it poffible
a Man fliould come fhefe? But then to think that
Satan flipuld take human Shape upon him in fucha
Place where there could be no manner of Occafion
for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind
him, and that even for no Purpofe too, for he could
not be (lire I fliould fee it; this was an Amufemcnt
the other Way : I confidered that rhe Devil n}ight
have found out abundance of other Ways to have
terrify'd me than this of the fingle Print of a Foot.
That as I liy'd quite on the other Side of the Ifland,
he would never have been fo fimple to leave a Mark
in i Place where it was ten phoufand to one whe-
ther I fhould never fee it or not, and in the Sand
top, which the firft Surge of the Sea upon a high
Wind would have defac'd entirely : All thisfeem'd
inconfiftent with the Thing it felf, and with all the
Notions we ufually entertain of the Subtilty of the
Devil.
Abundance of fuch Things as thefe affifjted to ar-
gue me out of all Apprehenfjons of it$ being the
Devil: And I prefently concluded then, that it muft
|^e fome more dangerous Creature, (viz,*) That it
muft be fome of the Savages of the main Land
pvet-againft me, who had wandered out to Sea.in
their Canoes, and either driven by the Currents, or
by contrary Winds, had made the Ifland; and had
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea*
being as loath,!perhaps, to have ftai'4 in this defo-
Jate Ifland, as I would have been fo have had them.
While thefe Refleftipns were rpuling upon my
Mind, I was very thankful in my Thoughts, that
I was fo happy as not to be thereabouts at that
Time, or that they did not fee my Boat, by which
they would Have concluded that fome Inhabitants
"'N 4 '"""' had
C-*»4 3
had been in the Race,, 'and perhaps have fearcVd
farther forme : Then terrible Thoughts ra'ck'd my
Imagination about their having found my Boat,
and that there were People here- and that if fo, I
fhould certainly have them cpjjie again in greater
Numbers.and devour me,- that if it mould happen
fo tnat they ftould not find''me, yet they would
find my Enclofure, ^deftroyall my Corn, carry a-
Wiy mnyrFJ°ck Qi tame Goats, and I mould "pe-
riih at laft for mere Want. ' .' *
Thus my Fear banifli'dall my religious Hope,-
all that former Confidence in God, which was
founded upon fuch wonderful Experience as I had
had of his Goodnefs, now vanifh'd, as if he that
had fed me by Miracle hither to, could not preferve
by his Powertne Provifion which he had made for
me by his Goodnefs: I reproach'd myfelfwith my
Eafinefs, that would not fow any more Corn ore
Year than would pit ferve me till the next Seafon
asit no Accident could intervene to prevent my
enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground:
and this J thought fo juft a Reproof, that I refo!v'd
ior the. future to have two of three Years Corn be-
fore-hand, fothat whatever might come, I miffht
,not perifli for want of Bread.
How flrange a ChequefrWori< of Providence is
. the Ufe of Man ! and by what fecret differing
Springs are the Affections hurry'd about, as differ-
.ring Circumftancesprefent! To Day we love what
1 to Morrow we hate ,• to Day we feek what to Mor-
row we ftun; to Day we defire what to Morrow
, we fear) nay, even tremble at the Apprehenfionsof •
.,-This was exemplified in me at this time in the mo/t
:;|vely Manner imaginable: For J, whofe only Af-
;;|i;^fon:was? that I feem'd banifhed from human
„ Surety.,, that J'.was alone, circumfcrib'd 'by 'the-
Mbouiid.efs Ocean, cut oft from Mankind, and con-
demn d
demn'd to what I calTd filent Life ; that I was as
one^whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
ber^ among the Living, or to appear among the
reft of his Creatures; that to have feen one of my
own Species would have feem'd to me a Raifing
me from Death to Life, and the greateft Bjeffing
that Heaven itfelf, next to the fupreme Bleffing of
Salvation, could beftow; I fay, that I ftould now
tremble at the very Apprehenfionsof feeing a Man*
and was ready to fink into the Ground at but the
Shadow, or filent Appearance of a Man's having
fet his Foot in the IQand.
Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it
afforded me a great many curious Speculations.af-
terwards. When I had a little recovered my firft
Surprize; I confider'd that this was the Station of
Life the infinitely wife and good Providence of
God had determined forme; that as I could not
forefee what the Ends of divine Wifdom might be
in' ail this, fo I was riot to difpute his Sovereignty
who as I was his Creature, had an undoubted
Right by Creation to govern and difpofeof me ab-
solutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a
Creature who had offended him, had likewife a ju-
dicial Right to condemn me to what Punifhment
he thought fit; and' that it wasmypart tofubmit
to bear his Indignation, became I had finn'dacainft
him. &
p 1 then n-fleaedthat God, who was not only
Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had thought
fit thus to pumih and afflia me, fo he was able
to deliver me ; that if he did not think fit to do it,
twos my unqueftion'd Duty to refign myfelfabfo-
lutey and entirely to his Will; and on the other
hand, it was my Duty alfo to hope in him, pray
to him, and quietly to attend the Dictates and Di-
reft.ons of his daily Providence.
''' ' Thefe
*Thefe Thoughts tookmp up many Hours, Days,1
nay, I may fay, Weeks and Jvlonths ,* and one par-
ticular Effed: of my Cogitations on this Occafion,
I cannot omit, viz,. One Morning early, lying m
my Bed, anciSll'd with Thought about my Danger
from the Appearance of Savages, I found it 4if-
composM me very much ; upon which thofe Words
of the Scripture c^me into my Thoughts, Call upon
me in the Day of Trouble, and J will ffeliver, and thou
/halt glorify me.
Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my Be J, my
Heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encourag'd to pray earneftly to God for Deli-
verance : When I had done praying, I took up my
JJible, and opening it to read, the firft Words that
prefented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and be of
good Cheer, and he JJja/1 Jlrengthen thy Heart; waif,
\lfayy on the Lord. It is impoffible to exprefs the
Comfort this gayc me. In Anfwer, I thankfully
Jaid dowp the Book, and was no. more fad, at lead
not on that Occafion.'
Ii}the middle of thefe Cogitations, Apprehenfj-
onsaild |tefle<5tions, it came into my Thought one
Day,' that all this might be; a mere Chimera of my
"own J and that this Foot might be the Erjnt of my
"own Foot,'whqi I came on Shore from my Boat:
This ehcar'd mc up a little too, arid I began tq per-
fuade my felf it was all a Delufion ] that if was no-
thing elfebutmy own Foot; and why might'not 1
come that way from the Boat, as well asl was go-
ing that way to the Boat: Again, J con/Ider'd affo
that I could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not; and that if at laf£
tins was only the Print of my own Foot, I had
play VI the parr of thofe Fools, whoitrivc to make
Stories of Spectres and Apparitions, and then arc
frighted at them more than any Body.  ,
* ' ' ' 'Now
Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not ftirr'd out of my Cattle for three
Days and Nights; fo that I began to ftarve for
Provifion ; for I had little or nothing within Doors
but fome Barley Cakes and Water. ^Then I knew
that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
ufually was my Evening Diverfion ; and the poor
Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for
want of it; and indeed, it almoft fpoil'd fome of
them, and almoft dry'd up their Milk.
Hcartning my felf therefore with the Belief that
this was nothing but the Print of one of my own
Feet, and fo 1 might be truly faid to ftart at my
own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and
went to my Country Houfe to milk my Flock; but
to fee with what Fear I went forward, how often I
look'd behind me, howl was ready every now and
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it
would have made any one have thought I was haunt-
ed with an evil Conference, or that 1 had been late-
ly moft terribly frighted, and fo indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
Days, and having feen nothing, I began to be a lit-
tle bolder; and to think there was really nothing in
it, but my own Imagination: But I could not per-
fuade my felf fully of this, till I fhould go down to
the Shore again, and fee this Print of a Foot, and
mcafure it by my own, and fee if there was any Si-
militude or Fitnefs, that I might be aflur'd it was
my own Foot: But when I came to the Place,
Firfti it appeared evidently to me, that when I laid
up my Boat, I could not poffibly be on Shore any
where there about. Secondly', When I came to mea-
fure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
not fo large by a great deal; both thefe Things fill'd
my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the
Vapours again, to the higheft Degree; fo that I
• fliook
Vffl j
JhQ^.^f^pb|id, likepne:*iii ah Ague : Arid, I ivent
Home again, filfd witli the Belief that fonie' Man
or Men Had been on die Shore; or in fhort, that the
Ifland was ^habited, and I might be furpm'd be-
fore I was aware; an'4 wh^t courfe to take for my
Security I knew not. ' T ,.
O what ridiculous Refolutions'Mefl take, when
poffefs'd With Fear ! It deprives them of the Ufe of
thofe Means which Reafon offers for their Reiief.
The firft; thing I proposed to my felf, was, to
throw 'dpwh my Encloiurts, and turn all my tarns
Cattle wild into the Woods," that the Enemy mignt
not find them; and then'frequent thelftand in Prof-
peft of the fame, or the liUe; Booty: Then to the
iim'ple thing of digging'tip/my two Corn Fields,
that they might not find fuch a Grain there, and
liill be prompted to frequeiitthe Iflandr then to d<e-
molifti my Bower and Tent, that they might not
fee any Veftig.es of Habitation, arid be prompted
to look farther, in order to find put the Perfons
inhabiting^
Thefe were the'Subjea of t%^firft Night's Co-
gitation, after 1 was come Honfeigain, while the
Apprehenfions which' had fo over-run my Mind
were frefh upon me, and my Head Wasfull of Va-
pours, as above. Thus fear ok Danger is ten .thou-
sand times more terrifying than Bangei;itfelf, when
apparent to the Eyes; and'we find the Burthen
of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which
we are anxious about; and which was worfe than
all this, I had not that Relief iif this Trouble
from* the Resignation I iifed to pra&fe, which I
hopM to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul> who
comp.air/d not only that the Philifimes were upon
tiim, but tfiat Godhad rbrfakenhim; for I did not
iiow take due Ways to compofe my Mind, by crying
ro God iirmy Diftrefs, -and refting upon his Provi-
dence,
i-89 ]
dcnce, as I had done; before, for my-Defence and
Deliverance; which if I had. done, I had, atleaft,
been more cheerfully imported under tjiisnew Stir-
prife* and perhaps carry5 d through it with* more .Re-.
iolution. . '"•.. ' • "f ,; ' -•;" , . .
This Confufion of my. Thoughts kept me waking

foundly, ^ind walui' njuch .better cpmfps'd; than
1 hadevejt been,before"I 4??^/now I began to think
fedately ;; and upon,the^uiiaoft Debate, with my
felf, I concluded,. T^jiai £hif Ifland, which was. Co
exceeding pleafant, frujt£ulvand no farther from the
main t'and than as'I fiadi feen, was not fo entirely a-
bandp%'4 -as I might-imagine : Thaoalthp'. there
were 110 fta.ted InhabiunU ^ho liv'd^n^he.Spot;
yet that there migjfot fomejilmescome Bqats off from
the .'Shore, who '.'either' wi#iV Defign! or perhaps
never* but when they were driven by -enrols Winds
might come to this.Place. t , •. ,:J »
That I had liv'd-here.fifteen Years iiowrand had;
not met with the leaft Shadow or-Eigure of any
People yet. .; and that if at; any Time they fliould be
driven here, It was probable they.went away again,
as.foon as ever they could, feeing they had never
thought-fit to fix thereupon any Qcqafion, to this
Time. . ^  ';-.';,
.Thattfiemoftlcpu'dfuggeft any. Danger from,
was,, from any fuch cafual accidental Landing of
flriggling. People from the Main, .who, as it. was
likely if they were driven hither, were here againft
their Walls; fo they made no ftay here, but went off
again with all poffibie Speed, .felcjom flaying one
Night on Shore, .leaft they fnoulcl not have the
Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again,; and
that therefore I had nothing todo^but to confider
of
of fome fafe Retreat, in cafe I fliould fee any Sava-
ges land upon the Spot.
Now I began forely to repent, that I had dug
my Cave fo large, as to bring a Door through a*
gain, which Door, as I faid, came out beyond where
my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock : upon mature-
ly confidering this therefore, I refolv'd to draw me
a fecond Fortification, in the fame Manner of a Se-
micircle, at a Diftance from my Wall, juft where I
had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelve
Years before, of which I made mention : Thefe
Trees having been planted fo thick before, they
wanted but a few Piles to be driven between them
that they fhould be thicker, and ftronger, and my
Wall would be foon finifh'd.
So that I had now a double Wall, and my outet
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Ca-
bles, and every Thing I could think of to make it
ftrong; having in it feven little Holes, about as
big as I might put my Arm out at: In the Infidc
of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot
thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the. Wall, and
walking upon it; and through the feven Holes, I
contrived to plant the Mufquets, of which I took
Notice, that I got feven on Shore out of the Ship;
thefe, I fay, I planted as Cannon, and fitteds them
into Frames that held them like a Carriage, that
fo I could fire all the feven Guns in two Minutes
time: This Wall I was many a weary Month a
finishing, and yet never thought my felf fafe till it
was done.
When this was done, I ftucfc all the Ground
without my Wall, for a great way every way, as
full with Stakes or Sticks of the 0/feHike Wood,
which I found fo apt to grow, as they could well
ftand,- infomueh, that I believe I might fetin near
twenty
twenty thoufand of them, leaving a pretty large
Space between them and my Wall, that I mighc
have room to fee an Enemy, and they might have
no flielter from the young Trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer Wall.  ,
Thus in two Years time I had a thick Grove,
and in five or fix Years time I had a Wood before
my Dwelling, growing fo monftrous thick1 and
ftrong, that it was indeed perfe&Iy impaflable;
and no Man of what kind foever* would ever ima-
ginjLthat there was any Thing beyond it, muchlefs
a Habitation, As for the Way which I propofed to
myfeif to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it
was by fetting two Ladders; one to a Part of the
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left
room to place another Ladder upon that; fo when
the two Ladders were takep down> no Man living
could come down to me Without mifchiefing hiiri-
Telf; and if they had com<k down, they wereftill
on the out-fide of my outer Wall.
Thus I cook all the Meafures human Prudence
cottld fugged for my own Prefervation; and it will
be feen at length, that they were not altogether
without juft Reafon ; though I forefaw nothing at
that Time, more than my mere Fear fuggeftedto
me.
While this was doing* I was not altogether care-
\6(s of my other Affairs ; for I had a great Concern^
upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they were
not only a prefent Supply to me upon every Occa-
(ion, began to be fufficient to me, without the
Expence of Powder and Shot; but alfo without the
/Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones ; and I was
loth to lofe the Advantage of them, and to have
. them all to nurfe up 6ver again.
To this Purpofe, after long Confideration, I
could think of but two Ways tp preferve them;
one
toe was to find another convenient Place to dig &
Cave under Ground, and to drive them into it every
Night; and the other was to enclofe two or three
little Bits of Land* remote from one another, and as
much concealed as I could,- where I might keep a-
bout half a Dozen young Gpats in each Place: So
that if any Difafter happened to the Flock in gene-
: ral, .1 might be able to raife them again with little
; Trouble and Time : And this, tho5 it would re-
quire a.great deal of Time and Labour,t I thought
was the moft rational Defign. . f
Accordingly I fpent fome Time to find oM: the
moft retir'd Parts of the Ifland ; and I pitch'd up-
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart
could wifli for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground
in the middle of the Hollow and thick. Woods,
where, as is obfer.v'd, I almoft loft myfelf once be-
fore, endeavouring to come back that Way from
the Eaftern Part of xhc Ifland : Here I found a cleat
Piece of Land near three Acres, fo funouqded with
Woods;, that it was almoft an Enclofure by Nature,
< •atleaft it did not want near fo much Labour to
make it fo, as. the other Pieces of Ground. I had
. Work'd fohard at.
1 immediately went to work with this Piece of
Ground, and in lefs than a Month's Time, I had
fofene'd it round, that my.Flock or Herd, call it
which you pleafe, who were not fo wild now as at
.firfttheymight.be fyppofeito be, were well e-
nough fecur'd in it, So without any farther De-
lay, I removed ten young,She-Goats and two He-
Goats to this Piece ; and ,when they were there, I
continu'd to pexfcft the Fence, till I hadmadeat
as fecure as the other, which, however, Ididat
more Leifure, and it took me up more Time,by:a
. great .deal.
All
All this Labour I was at the Expence of, purely
from my Apprehenfions on the Account of the Print
of a Man's Foot which I had feen; for as yet I
never law any human Creature come near the Ifland,
and I had now iiv'd two Years under thefe Unea-
fmefles, which indeed made my Life much lefs
comfortable than it was before; as may well be
imagined by any who know what it is to live in
the conftant Snare of the Fear of Man; and this 1
muft obferve with Grief too, that the Difcompo-
fure ,of my Mind had too great Impreffions alfo up-
on the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the
Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Sa-
vages and Canibals, lay fo upon my Spirits, that
Ifeldom found myfelf in a due Temper for Appli-
cation to my Maker, at leaft, not with the fedate
Calmnefs and Resignation of Soul which I was
wont to do \ I rather pray'd to God as under
great Affliftion and Preffure of Mind, furrounded
with Danger, and in Expe&ation every Night of
being murther'd and devoured before Morning;
and 1 muft teftify from my Experience, that a Tem-
per of Peace, Thankfulnefs, Love and Aflfeftion, is
much more the proper Frame for Prayer, thfjifhat
of Terror and Difcompofure; and that under the
Dread of Mifchief impending, as Man is no more
fit for a comforting Performance of the Duty of
praying to God, than he is for Repentance on a
lick-Bed: For thefe Difcompofures affe<a the Mind
as the others do the Body; and the Difcompofure
of the Mind muft neceflarily be as great a Difabi-
lity as that of the Body, and much greater, pray-
ing to God, being properly an Ad of the Mind, not
oftheBodyr
But to go on : After I had thus feeur'd one Part
of my little living Stock, I went about the whole
Ifland, fearching for another private Place, to make
O fuch
fuch another Depofit; when wandring riibre to the
Weft Point of the Ifland than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to Sea, I thought I faw a Boat up-
on the Sea, at a great Diftance; I had found a Pro-
fpetiive-Glafs, or two, in one of the Seamen's
Chefls, which I fav'd out of our Ship; but I had
it not about me, and this was fo remote, that I could
not tell what to make of it; though I look'd at it
till my Eyes were net able to hold to look any
longer: Whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not
know; but as I defcended from the Hill, I could
fee no more of it, fo I gave it over ,* only Irefolv'd
to go no more out without a Profpe&ive-Glafs in
my Pocket.
When I was come down the Hill, to the End of
the Ifland, where indeed I had never been before,
I was prefently convincM, that the feeing the Print
of a Man's Foot, was not fuch a flrange Thing in
the Uland as I imagined ; and but that it was a fpe-
cial Providence that I was call upon the Sideofthe
Uland where the Savages never came, I fliould ea-
iily have known, that nothing was more frequent
than for the Canoes from the Main, when they hap-
peruito be a little too far out at Sea, to fhoot over
to that Side of the Illand for Harbour ; likewife as
they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Vi-
ctors having taken :anyPrifoncrs, would bring them
over to this Slrote, where, according to their dread-
ful Cuftcm-s, being ail Canibals> they would kill and
eat them j ot which hereafter.
When I was come down the Hill to the Shore,
as I faid above, being the S. W- Point of the
Uland, 1 was perfe&Iy confounded andamaz'd; nor
is it poifible tor mc to exprefs the Horror of my
Mind, at -feeing the Shore fpread with Sculls,
-Handst 'Pc^r, and <St?het Boris's of human Bodies ;
ymd particularly I'dbfervM a place where there had
/:' •* been
[ '9? J
been a Fire made, and a Circle dug m the Earthy
like a Cockpit, where it is fiippofed the Savage
Wretches had fet down to their inhuman Feaft-
ings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.
I was fo aftonifli'd with the Sight of thefe Things*
that I entertained no Notions of any Danger to my
felf from it for a long while; all my Apprehen-
fions were buried in the Thoughts of fuch a Pitch of
inhuman, hellifli Brutality, and the Horror of the
Degeneracy of human Nature; which though I
had heard of often, yet I never had fo near a View of
before; in fhort> I. turned away my Face from the
horrid Spe&acle ,• my Stomach grew fick, and I
was j uft at the point of fainting, when Nature dif-
cha.rg'd the Diforder from my Stomach ; and ha-
ving vomited with an uncommon Violence, I wa$
a little relieved, but could not bear to flay in the
Place a Moment > fo I got me up the Hill again
with all the Speed I could, and walk'd on towards
my own Habitation.
When I came a little Out of that Part of the
Ifland, I ftood ftill awhile as amaz'd; and then re-
covering myfelf, Ilook'd up with the utmoftAfte-
£tion of my Soul, and with a Flood of Tears in my
Eyes, gave God Thanks, that had caft my firft Lot
in a Part of the World* where I was diftiriguifhM
from fuch dreadful Creatures as thefe; and that
though I had efleemed my prefent Condition very
miferable, had yet given me fo many Comforts in
it, that I had ftill more to give thanks for than to
complain of j and this above all* that I had even
in this miferable Condition been comforted with
the Knowledge of himfelf, and the Hope of his
fileffing, which was a Felicity more than fufficient-
ly equivalent to all the Mifery which I had fuffer'd*
or could fuffer.
0 * Iri
In this Frame of Thankfulnefs, I went Home t&
my Caftle, and began to be much eafier now, as^
to the Safety of my Circumftances, than ever I was
before ; for I obferv'd that thefe Wretches never
came to this Ifland in fearch of what they could
get; perhaps not feeking, nor wanting, ornotex-
pe&ing any Thing here 5 and having often, no doubt,
been up in the cover'd woody Part of it, without
finding any Tiling to their Purpofe. I knew I had
been here now almoft eighteen Years, and never
faw the leaft Footfteps of human Creature there
before ; and I might be here eighteen more, as en-
tirely conceaPd, as I was now, if I did not difcover
myfejf to them, which I had no manner of Occa-
fion t|o do, it being my only Bufinefs to keep my
felf entirely concealed where I was, unlefs I found
a better fort of Creatures than Canibah to make my
felf known to.
Yet I entertain'd fuch an Abhorrence of the Sa-
vage Wretches that I have been fpeaking of, and of
the wretched inhuman Cuftom of their devouring
and eating one another up, that I continu'd penfive,
and fad, and kept clofe within my own Circle
for almoft two Years after this: When I fay my
own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plantations,
viz,, my Caftle, my Country-Seat, which I called
my Bower,, and my Enclofure in the Woods; nor
did I look after this for any other Ufe than as an
Enclofure for my Goats ,* for the Averfion which
Nature gave me to thefe hellifli Wretches, was
fuch, that 1 was fearful of feeing them, as of feeing
the Devil himfelf; nor did I fo much as go to look
after my Boat in all this time, but began rather
to think of making me another; for I could not
think of ever making any more Attempts to bring
the other Boat round the Ifland to me, left I
fhould meet with fome of thefe Creatures at Sea,
in
in which, if I had happened to have fallen into their
Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot.
Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that
I was in no Danger of being difcovered by thefe
People, began to wear off my Uneafinefs about
them; and I began to live juft in the fame composed
Manner as before ; only with this Difference, that
I ufed more Caution, and kept my Eyes more about
me than I did before, left I fhould happen to be
feen by any of them; and particularly, 1 was more
cautious of firing my Gun, left any of them being
on thellland, ftiould happen to hear of it,* and it
was therefore a very good Providence to me, that
I had furnifh'd myfeif with a tame Breed of Goats,
that I needed not hunt any more about the Woods,
or (boot at them; and if I did catch any of them,
after this it was by Traps, and Snares, as I had
done before; fo that for two Years after this, I be-
lieve I never fir'd my Gun once off, though I ne-
ver went out without it ,• and which was more, as
I hadfav'd three Piftols out of the Ship, I always
carried them out with me, or at leaft two of them,
fticking them in my Goat-Skin Belt; alfo I fur-
bifli'd up one of the great Cutlafties, that I had
out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on
alfo; fo that I was now a moft formidable Fellow
to look at, when I went Abroad, if you add to the
former Description of myfeif, the Particular of two
Piftols, and a great broad Sword hanging at my
Side in a Belt, but without a Scabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have faid, fot fome
Time; I feem cf, excepting thefe Cautions, to be
redue'd to my former calm, fedate way of Living^
all thefe Things tended to fhewing me more and
more how far my Condition was from being mile-
rable, compared to fome others; nay, to many
other Particulars of Life, which it might have plea-
O 3 fed
fed God to have made my Lor. It put me upoq
reflecting, how little repining there would be ar
mong Mankind, at any Condition of Lite, if Peo-
ple would rather compare their Condition with
thofe that aye worfe, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with thofe which are
fetter, to affift their Murmurings and Complain-
ings.
As in my prefent Condition there were not real-
ly many Things which I wanted; fo indeed I
thought that the Frights I had been in about thefe
Savage Wretches, and the Concern I had been in
for my own Prefervation, had taken off the Edge
of my Invention for my own Conven encies ; and I
had dropt a good Deiign, which I had once bent
iwy Thoughts too much upon ; and that was, to
try if I could not make fome of my Barley into
Malt, and then try to brew myfelf fome Beer :
This was really a whimfical Thought, and I re-
proved myfelf often for the Simplicity of it; for I
prefently faw there would be the Want of feveral
Things neceffary to the making my Beer, that it
would be impoffible for me to fupply: As firft,
Casks to preferve it in, which was a Thing, that
as I have obferv'd already, I could never compafs ;
no, tho? I fpent not many Days, but Weeks, nay
Months, in attempting it, but to no Purpofe. In
the next Place, I had no Hops to make it keep, no
Yeaft to make it work, no Copper or Kettle to
make it boil; and yet all thefe Things, notwith-
standing, I verily believe, had not thefe Things in-
tervene, I mean the Frights and Terrors I was in
about the Savages, I had undertaken it, and per-
haps brought it to'pafs too; for 1 feldom gave a-
ny Thing over without accomplishing it, when I
once had it in my Head enough to begin it.
But
[ i99l
But my Invention now run quite another Way ;
for Night and Day I could think of nothing but
how I might deftroy fome of thefe Monftersin their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and, if poffible, favc
the Vi&im they (bould bring hither to deftroy. It
would take up a larger Volume than this whole
Work is intended to be,, to fet down all the Con-
trivances I hatch'd, or rather brooded upon in my
Thought, for the deftroying thefe Creatures, or at
leaft frighting them, fo as to prevent their coining
hither any more ; but all was abortive, nothing
could be poffible to take Effeft, unlefsl was to be
there to do it for myfelf; and what could one Man
do #mong them, when perhaps there might be
twehty or thirty of them together, with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which
they could (hoot as true to a Mark, as I could
with my Gun?
Sometimes I contrived to dig a Hole under the
Place where they made their Fire, and put in five
or fix Pound of Gun-powder, which, when they
kindled their Fire, would confequcntly take Fire,
and blow up all that was near it; but as in the firfl
Place Ifliouldbe very loth to wafle fo much Powder
upon them, my Score being now within the Quan-
tity of one Barrel; fo neither could I be furc of its
going off at any certain time, when it might iur-
prize them, and at bell, that it would do little more
than juft blow the Fire about their Ears and fright
them, but not fufficient to make them forfake the
Place » fo I laid it afide, and then proposal, that
I would place myfelf: in Ambufh, in fome con-
venient Place, with my three Guns, all double
loaded ; and in the Middle of their bloody Cere-
mony, let fly at them, when I fhonld be fure to kill
or wound perhaps two or three at every Shoot; av-d
then tailing 'm upon them with my three Pidols,
O 4 and
and my Sword, I made no Doubt but that if there
was twenfy, I fhould kill them all. This Fancy
pleas'd my Thoughts for fome Weeks, and I wasfo
full of it, that I often dream'd of it; and fometimes
that I was juft going to let fly at them in my Sleep.
I went fo far with it in my Imagination, that I
employed myfelf feveral Days to find out proper
Places to put myfelf in Ambufcade, as I faid, to
watch for them; and I went frequently to the
Place it felf, which was now grown more familiar
tome; andefpecially while my Mind was thus fill'd
with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody put-
ting twenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I
may call it; the Horror I had at the Place, and
at the Signals of the barbarous Wretches devour-
ing one another, abated my Malice.
Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of
the Hill, where I was fatisfy'd I might fecurely
wait, till I faw any of their Boats coming, and
might then, even before they would be ready to
come on Shore, convey myfelf unfeen into Thic-
kets of Trees, in one of which there was a Hollow
large enough to conceal me entirely ; and where I
might lit and obferve all their bloody Doings, and
take my full Aim at their Heads, when they were
fo clofe together, as that it would be next to im-
poflible that I fhould mifs my Shoot, or that I could
fail wounding three or four of them at the firft
Shoot.
In this Place then I refolved to fix my Defign,.
and accordingly I prepar'd two Muskets and my
ordinary Fowling-Piece. The two Muskets I
loaded with a Brace of Slugs each, and four or five
fmaller Bullets, about the Size of Piftol-Bullets ;
and the Fowjjing-Piece I loaded with near a Hand-
ful of Swan-Shot, of the Jargeft Size; Ialfo loaded
my Piftols with about four bullets each ; and in this
Pofture*
Pofture, well provided with Ammunition for a fe-
cond and third Charge, I prepaid my felf for my,
Expedition.
After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Defign;
and in my Imagination put it in Pra&ice, I conti-
nually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top of the Hill, which was from my Caftle, as I
call'dit, about three Miles, or more, to fee if I
could obferve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near
the Ifland, or (landing over towards it; but I be-
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I had fo,r two
or three Months conftantly kept my Watch ,• but
came always back without any Difcovery, there
having not in all that Time been the leaft Appea-
rance, not only on, or near the Shore5 but not on
the whole Ocean, fo far as my Eyes or Glafles
could reach every Way.
As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill
to look out, fo long alio I kept up the Vigour of
my Defign, and my Spirits feem'd to be all the
while in a fnitable Form forfooutragious an Exe-
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages,
for an Offence which I had not at all entred into a
Difcuffion of in my Thoughts, any farther than my
Paflions were at firft fir'dby the Horror I conceived
at the unnatural Cuftom of that People of the Coun-
try, who, it feems, had been fufter'd by Providence,
in his wife Difpofition of the World, to have no
other Guide than that of their own abominable and
vitiated Paflions ; and confequently were left, and
perhaps had been fo for fome Ages, to a£t fuch
horrid Things, and receive fuch dreadful Cu-
ftoms, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd
of Heaven, and a6ted by fome hellifh Degeneracy,
could have run them into: But now when, as I
have faid, I began to be weary of that fruitlefs Ex-
curlion which I had made fo long, and fo fara eve-
ry
ry Morning in vain, fo my Opinion of the Action,
itfelf began to alter, and I began with cooler and
calmer Thoughts to confider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in. What Authority or Call I had,
to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon thefe
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought tit
for fo many Ages to fuffer unpunifli'd, to go on,
and to be, as it were, the Executioners of his Judg-
ments one upon another. How far thefe People
were Offenders againft me, and what Right I had
to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they
lhed promifcuoufly one upon another. I debated
this very often with my felt'thus ; How do I know
what God himfelf judges in this particular Cafe?
It is certain thefe People cither do not commit this
as a Crimes it i$ not againft their own Confciences
reproving, or their Light reproaching them. They
do not know it to be an Offence, and then commit
it in Defiance of divine Juftice, as we do in almoft
all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a
Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do
to kill an Ox; nor to eat human Flefli, than we
do to eat Mutton.
When I had confider'd this a little, it followed
neceflarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in
it; that thefe People were not Murderers in the
Senfe that I had before condemned them in my
Thoughts, any more than thofe Chriftians were
Murderers, who often put to Death the Prifoners
taken in Battel; or more frequently, upon many
Occafions, put whole Troops of Men to the Sword,
without giving Quarter, though they threw down
their Arms and fubmittcd.
in the nsxt place it occurred to me, that albeit the
Ufuage they thusgave one another, was thus brutifh
and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me :
Thefe People had done me no Injury : That if they
attempted
attempted me, or I faw it neceffary for my imme"
d/ate Perfervation to fall upon them, fomething
might be (aid for it; but that as I was yet out of
their Power, and they had really no Knowledge
of me, and confequently no Defign upon me;
therefore it could not be juft for me to fall upon
them. That this wou'd juftify the Condud: of the
Spaniards in all their Barbarities pra&is'd in Ame**
rica, and where they deftroy'd Millions of thefe
People, who, however they were Idolaters and Bar-
barians, and had feveral bloody and barbarous
Rites in their Cuftoms, fuch as facrificing human
Bodies to their Idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent People ; and that the rooting them
out of the Country, is fpoken of with theutmoft
Abhorrence and Deteftation, by even the Spaniards
themfelves, at this time, and by all other Chrifti-
#n Nations of Europe, as a meer Butchery, a bloody
and unnatural Piece of Cruelty, unjuftifiable either
to God or Man ; and fuch, as for which the very
Name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and
terrible to all People of Humanity, or of Chriftian
Compaffion : As if the Kingdom of Spain were par-
ticularly eminent for the Produd: of a Race pf Men,
who were without Principles of Tendernefs, or the
common Bowels of Pity to the Miferable, which
is reckoned to be a Mark of generous Temper in
the Mind.
Thefe Considerations really put me to a Paufe,
and to a kind of a Full-flop ? and I began by little
and little to be off of my Defign, and to conclude,
I had taken wrong Meafures in my Refolutions to
attack the Savages; that it was not my Bufinefs to
meddle with them, unlefs they firft attacked me,
and this it was my Bufinefs if poffible to prevent;
but that if I were difcover'd, and attack'd, then I
knew my Duty.
On
On the other hand, I argu'd with myfelf, That-
this really was the way not to deliver my/elf, but
entirely to ruin and deftroy myfelf; for unlets I was
fare to kill every one that not only fliould be on
Shore at that time, but that fiiould ever come on
Shore afterwards, if but one of them efcap'd, to
teil their Country People what had happened, they
would come over again by Thousands to re-
venge the Deaths of their Fellows, and I fhould
only bring upon myfelf a certain Deftru&ion,
which at prcfent I had no manner of Occafion
for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in
Principles, nor in Policy, I ought one way or other to
concern myfelf in this Affair. That my Bufinefs
was by all poffible Means to conceal myfelf from
them, and not to leave the Leaft Signal to them to
guefs by, that there were any living Creatures up-
on the Ifland ,• I mean of human Shape.
Religion joyn'd in with this Prudential, and I was
convinc'd now many Ways, that I was perfectly out
of my Duty, when I was laying all my bloody
Schemes for the Deftru&ion of innocent Creatures,
I mean innocent as to me : As to the Crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them; they were National, and I ought
to leave them to the Jaftice of God, who is the
Governour of Nations, and knows how by Na-
tional Puniflitnents to make a juft Retribution for
National Offences ; and to bring publick Judg-
ments upon thofe who offend in a publick Manner,
by fuch Ways as beft pleafes him.
' This appeared fo clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater Satisfaction to me, than that I had
not been faffer'd to do a Thing which I now faw
fo much Reafon to. believe would have been no lefs
a Sin, than that of wilful Murder, if I had com-
mitted
mittcd it; and I gave molt humble Thanks on my
Knees to God, that had thus delivered me from
Blood-guiltinefs, befeeching him to grant me the
Protedion of his Providence, that I might not fail
into the Hands of the Barbarians-, or that I might
not lay my Hands upon them, unlefs I had a more
clear Gail from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my
own Life.
In this Difpofition I continued for near a xear
after this; and fo far was I from defiring an Oc-
cafion for falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all
that Time I never once went up the Hill to fee
whether there were any of them in fight, or to
• know whether any of them had been on Shore
there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances againft them, or be
provoked by any Advantage which might prefentit
felf, to fall upon them; only this I did, I went and
removed my Boat which I had on the other Side
the Hand, and carried it down to the Eafi-End of
the whole Iiland, where I ran it into a little Cove
which I found under fome high Rocks, and where
I knew, by reafon of the Currents, the Savages durit
not, at lead would not come with their Boats, up-
on any Account whatsoever.
With my Boat I carried away every Thing that
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne-
ceflary for the bare going thither, viz,, a Maft and
Sail which I had made for her, and a Thing like
an Anchor, but indeed which could not be call'd
either Anchor or Grapling; however, it was the
beft I could make of its kind. All thefe I remov'd
that there might not be the leaft Shadow of any
Difcovery, or any Appearance of any Boat, or of
any human Habitation upon the Ifland.
Befides this, I kept my felf, as I faid, more re-
tired than ever, and feldom went from my Cell, o-
ther
ther than upon my conftant Employment, viz,. T&
milk my She-Goast*and manage my little Flock in
the Wood ; which as it was quite on the other Part
of the Wand, was quite out of Danger'; for certain
it is, that thefe Savage People, who fometimes
hau/ited this Ifland, never came with any Thoughts
of finding any thing here; and confequently never
wandred off from the Coaft i and I doubt not, but
they might have been feveral times on Shore, after
my Apprehensions of them had made me cauticu < as
well as before; and indeed, I look'd back with
feme Horror upon the Thoughts of what my Con-
dition would have been, if I had chop'd upon them,
and been difcover'd before that, when naked and
unarmed, except with one Gun, and that loaden
often only with fmail Shot. I walk'd every where
peeping and peering about the Ifland, to fee what
I could get ; what a Surprifc (hould I have been in,
if when I difcover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I
had inflead of that ken fifteen or twenty Savages,
and found them pnrfuing me, and by the Swiftnefs
of their Running, no Poffibility of my efcaping
them?
The Thoughts of this fometimes funk my very
Soul within me, and diftrefs'd my Mind fo much
that I could not fpon recover it, to think what I
fhould have done, and how 1 not only fhould not
have been able to re lift them, but even fhould not
have had Prefence of Mind enough to do what I
might have done; much lefs, what now after fo
much Confideration and Preparation I might be a-
b!e to do: Indeed, after ferious thinking of thefe
Things, I fhould be very melancholy, and fome-
times it would laft a great while ; but I refolv'd it
at laft all into Thankfulnefs to that Providence,
which had delivered me from fa many unfeen Dan-
cers, and had kept me from thefe Mifchiefe which
b I could
[ ?-07 3
I could no way have been the Agent in delivering
myfelffrom, becaufe I had nottheleaft Notion of
any fuch thing depending, or the leaft Suppofition
of it being poffible.
This renewed a Contemplation, which often had
come to my Thoughts in former Time, when firft
I began to fee the merciful Difpofitions of Heaven,
in the Dangers we run through in this Life, How
wonderfully we are delivered, when we know no-
thing of it. How, when we are in (a Quandary, as
we call it) a Doubt or Hesitation, whether to go
this Way, or that Way, a fecret Hint fhail direct
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way ;
nay, when Senfe, our own Inclination, and perhaps
Buiinefs has call'd to go the other Way,yec a ftrange
Impreffion upon the Mind, for we know not what
Springs, and by we know not what Power, fhail o-
ver-rule us to go this Way, and it (hall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that Way which we would
have gone, and even to our Imagination ought to
have gone, we fliould have been ruih'd and loft,
Upon thefe, and many like Reflections, I after-
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That when-
ever I found thofe fecret Hints, or Pieffings of my
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that pre-
fenced ; or to going this Way, or that Way, I never
fail'd to obey the fecrec Dictate, though I knew no
other Reafon for it, then that fuch a Preffure, or
fuch a Hint hung upon my Mind : I could give ma"
ny Example, of the Succefs of this Condud in the
Courfe of my Life ; but more efpecially in the lat-
ter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Ifland ; be-
fides many Occafions which it is very likely I might
have taken notice of, if I had ken with the fame
Eyes then, that I faw with now : But 'tis never too
late to be wife ,• and I cannot but advife all confi-
dering Men, whofe Lives are attended with fuch ex-
traordinary
traordinary Incidents as mine, or even though not
fo extraordinary, not to flight fuch fecret Intima-
tions of Providence, let them come from whatin-
vifiblc Intelligence they will, that I fhall not dif-
cufs, and perhaps cannot account for ; but cer-
tainly they are a Proof of the Converfe of Spirits,
and the fecret Communication between thofe em-
body 'd, and thofe unembodyM; and fuch a Proof
as can never be withftood : Of which I fhall have
Occafion to give feme very remarkable Inftances,
in the Remainder ot my folitary Refidence in this
difmal Place.
1 believe the Reader of this will not think
ftrange, if I confefs that thefe Anxieties, thefecon-
ftant Dangers I liv'd iny and the Concern that was
now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to
all the Contrivances that I had laid for my future
Accommodations and Conveniences. I had the
Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands than
that of my Food. 1 car'd not to drive a Nail, or
chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noife I
fiioiild make, fliould be heard; much lefs would I
fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon ; and above all, I
was intolerably uneafy at making any Fire, left
the Smoke, which is vifible at a great Diftance in
the Day, fhould betray me; and for this Reafcn I
removed that Part of my Bufinefs which requir'd
Fire ; fuch as burning of Pots and Pipes, .&c. in-
to my new Apartment in the Woods, where, af-
ter I had been fome time, I found, to my unfpeak-
able Confolation, a meer natural Cave in the Earth,
which went in a vaft Way, and where, I dare fay,
no Savage had been at the Mouth of it, or would
be fo hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would a-
ny Man elfe, but one who, like me, wanted no-
tning fo much as a fafe Retreat,
The
The Mouth of this Hollow was at the Bottom
of a great Rock, where by meet Accident (I
would fay, if I did nor fee abundant Reafon co af-
cribe all fuch Things now to Providence) I was
cutting down fome thick Branches of Trees to
make Charcoal; and before I go on, I muft obferve
the Reafon of my making this Charcoal, which
was thus:
I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Ha-
bitation, as I faid before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my Bread, cooking my Meat,
&c. fo I contriv'd to burn fome Wood here, as I
had feen done in England, under Turf, till it be-
came Chark, or dry Coal; and then putting the
Fire out, Ipreferv'd the Coal to carry Home, and
perform the other Services, which Fire was want-
ing for at Home, without Danger of Smoke.
But this by the by. While I was cutting down
fome Wood here, I perceived, that behind a very
thick Branch of low Brufhwood, or Underwood,
there was a kind of hollow Place. I was curious
to look into it; and getting with Difficulty into
the Mouth of it, I found it was pretty large, that
is to fay, fufficient for me to ftand upright in it,
and perhaps another with me; but I muft confefs
to you, I made mbre hafte out than I did in, when
looking farther into the Place, and which was per-
fectly dark, I faw two broad fhining Eyes of fome
Creature, whether Devil or Man, I knew not,
which twinkled like two Stars, the dim Light
from the Cave's Mouth fhiningdireftly in, and ma-
king the Refle&ion.
However, after fome Paufe, I recover'd my felf,
and began to call my.felf a thoufand Fools, and
tell myfelf, that he that was afraid to fee the De-
vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Ifland all
alone; and that I durft to believe there was no-
P thing
t iio j
thing in this Cave that was more frightful than ttif
ielf; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took
up a great Firebrand, and in I rufh'd again, with
the Stick flaming in my Hand ; I had not gone
three Steps in, but I was almoft as much frighted
as I was before ,• for I heard a very loud Sigh, like
that of a Man in fome Pain, and it was followed
by a broken Noife, as if of Words half exprefs'd,
and then a deep Sigh again : I ftep'd back, and
was, indeed, ftruck with fuch a Surprize, that it
put me into a cold Sweat; and i( I had had a Hat
on my Head, I will not anfwer for it, that my Hair
might not have lifted it off. But ftill plucking up
my Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my
felf a little, with confidering that the Power and
Prefence of God was every where, and was able
to proteft me: Upon this I ftep'd forward again;
and by the Light of the Firebrand, holding it up
a little over my Head, I faw lying on the Ground
a moft monftrous frightful old He-goat, juft making
his Will, as we fay, and gafpifrg for Life, and dy-
ing indeed of meer old Age.
I ftirr'd him a little, to fee if I could get him
out, and he cfTay'd to get up, but was not able to
raife himfelf; and I thought with myfelf, he might
even lie there ,* for if he had frighted me fo, he
would certainly fright any of the Savages, if any
of them fliould be fo hardy as to come in there,
while he had any Life in him.
I was now recovered from my Surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when 1 found the Cave was
but very fmall, that is to fay, it might be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei-
ther round or fquare, no Hands having ever been
employed in making it, but thofeof mecr Nature.
I obferv'd alfo, that there was a Place at the far-
ther Side of it, that went in farther, but was fo
low.
Iow> that it required me to creep upon my Hands
atid Knees to go into it, and whither I went I
knew not; fo having no Candle, I gave it over
for fome Time ,• but refolv'd to come again the
next Day provided with Candles, and a Tinder-
box, which I had made of the Lock of one of the
Muskets, with fome Wild-fire in the Pan.
Accordingly, the next Day I came provided
with fix large Candles of my own making; for I
made very good Candles now of Goats-Tallow;
and going into this low Place, I was oblig'd to
creep upon all Fours, as I have faid, almoft ten
Yards; which, by the way, I thought was a Ven-
ture bold enough, confidering that I knew not how
far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I
wa$ got through the Strait, I found the Roofrofe
higher up, I believe near twenty Foot; but never
was fuch a glorious Sight feen in the IQand, I dare
fay, as it was, to look round the Sides and Roof
of this Vault or Cave ; the Walls reflc&ed a hun-
dred thoufand Lights to me from my two Can-
dles; what it was in the Rock, whether Diamonds,
or any other precious Stones, or Go!d> which I
rather fuppos'd it to be, I knew not.
The Place I was in, was a moft delightful Ca-
vity, or Grotto, of its. Kind, as could be expeftej*
though perfectly dark ; the Floor was dry and
level, and had a fort of fmall loofe Gravel upon
it, fo that there was no naufeous or venomous
Creature to be feen, neither was there any Damp
or Wet on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficulty
in it was the Entrance, which, however, as it
was a Place of Security, and fuch a Retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience;. fo
that I was really rejoye'd at the Difcovery, and re-
folv'd, without any Delay, to bring fome of thofe
.Things which I was moft anxious about to this
P 2 Place 5
Place; particularly, I refolv'd to bring hither mty
Magazine of Powder, and all my fpare Arms, via.
Two Fowling-Pieces, (for I had three in all) and
three Muskets, (for of them I had eight in all;) fo
I kept at my Caftle only five, which' Hood ready
mounted, like Pieces of Cannon, on my outmoft
Fence ; and were ready alfo to take out upon any
Expedition.
Upon this Occafion of removing my Ammuni-
tion, I took Occafion to open the Barrel of Powder
which I took up out of the Sea, and which had
been wet; and I found that the Water had pene-
trated about three or four Inches into the Powder
bn every Side, which caking and growing hardi
had pteferv'd the Infide like a Kernell in the Shell;
fo that I had near fixty Pound of very good Pow-
der in the Centre of the Cask, and this was aft a-
greeable Difcovcry to me at that Time; fo I car-
ry'd all away thither, never keeping above two
or three Pound of Powder with me in my Caftle,
for fear of a Surprize of any Kind : I alfo carry'd
thither all the Lead I had left for Bullets.
I fahcy'd myfelf now like one of the ancient
Giapts, which were faid to live in Caves and Holes
in the Rocks, where none could come at them;
for I perfuaded myfelf, while I was here, if five
hundred Savages were to hunt me, they could ne-
ver find me out ,• or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here. '
The old Goat, who I found expiring, dy'd in
the Mouth of the Cave, the next Dj,y after I made
this Difcovery ; and I found it miich eafier to dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and covet
him with Earth, than to drag him out: So I in-
tend him there, to prevent Offence to my
Nofc.
I was
1 was now jn my twenty thircj Year ot Refe-
rence in this Iflan'd, and was fo naturalized to the
Place, and to the Manner of Living, that could
I. have but enjoy'd, the Certainty, that no Savages
would come to the place to difturb me, I could
have been content to have capitulated (or fpending
the reft of my Time there, even to the laft Mo-
ment, till I had laid we down and dy'd, like the old
Cioat in the Cave! I had alfo arrivd to fome little
Diversions and Amujfem exits, which madpthe Time,
pafs more pleafantly with me a great deal, th^n
it did before ; as firft, I had taught my Pell, as I
noted before, to fpeak; and he did it fo familiarly,
and tailed fo articulately" and plain, that it was
very pleafant to me ; and he lived with me no lefs
than iix and twenty Years. How long he might
live afterwards, I know not ,* tho' I know they
have a Notion in the Brafils, that they live a hun-
dred Years; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there
flilJ, calling after Poor Robin Crufoe to this Day. J
with no Englijh Man the ill Luck to /come there and
hear him; but if he did, he would certainly believe
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleafant
and loving Companion to me for xiq lefs than fix-
teen Years of my Time, and then dy'd of meer
old Age y as for my Cats, they multiply'd, as I have
obferv'd, to that Degree, that I was oblig'd toflioot.
fcveral of them at firft, to keep them from devour-
ing me and all I had ; but at length, when the.
two old ones' I brought with me, were gone, and
after fome Time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no Provifion with me, they
all ran wild into the Woods, except two or three
Favourites, which I kept tame; and whofe Young,
when they had any, I always drowtwi; and thefe
were Part of my Family. Befides thefe I always
kept two or three Houfliold Kids about me, which I
 -V "' ' ' p 3 taught
taught to feed out of my Haad; and I had two,
more Parrots which talk d pretty wen, and would
all call Robin Cwfoe, but none like my firft; nor,
indeed, did I take the Pains with any of them that
I had done with him. I had alfo feveral tame Sea-
Fowls, whofe Names I knew not, who I caught
upon the Shore, and cut their Wings; and the lit-
tle Stakes which I had planted before my Caftle-
Wall being now grown up to a good thick Grpve>
thefe Fowls all iiVd among thefe low Trees, and
bred there, wjrich was very agreeable to me; fo
that, as I faid jabove, I began to be very weil con-
tented with the Life I led, if it might but have
beenfecur'd from the Dread of the Savages.
But it was otherwife directed; and it may not be
amifs for all People who fiiall meet with my Story,
to make this juft Obfervation from it, viz*. How
frequently, in the Courfe of our Lives, the Evil
which in itfelf we feek moft to fluin, and which,
when we are fallen into, is the moft dreadful to
us3 is oftentimes the very Means or Door of our
Deliverance, by which alone we can be raised agaiq
irom the Affli&ion we are fallen into. I could give
many Examples of this in the Courfe of my unac-
countable Life i but in nothing was it more parti-
cularly remarkable, than in the Circumftances of
jay laft Years of folitary Residence in this Ifland.
It was now the Month of December &s I faid
'above, in my twenty third Year; and this being the
Southern SoJftice, for Winter I cannot call it, was
the particular Time of my Harveft, and required
xny-being pretty vniuch abroad in the Fields ; when
going out pretty early in the Morning,.eveuvbefore
it was thorow Day-light, I was furprii\l with fee-
ing a Light of fome Fire upon the Shore, a^ Di-
ftance from me, of about two Miles towards the,
Jiijd of the Ifland, where I had obferv'dfome Sa-
vages
rages had been, as before, but not on the other
Side; but, to my great Affli&ion, it was on my
Side of the Ifland.
I was indeed terribly furpriz'd at the Sight and
ftept'd fhort within my Grove, not daring to go
out, left I might be furpnYd; and yet I had no
more Peace within, from the Apprehenfions I had,
that if thefe Savages/ in rambling over the Ifland,
fliould find my Corn ftand'ing, or cut, or any of my
Works and Improvements, they would immediate-
ly conclude, that there were People in the Place,
and would then never give over till they had found
jne out. In this Extremity I went bapk direftly to
my Caftle, pull'd up the Ladder after me, and made
all Things without look as wild and natural as I
coulcj.
Then I prepaid myfelf within, putting my felf
in a Pofture of Defence; I loaded all my Canpon,
as I call'd them; that is to fay, my Muskets, which
werp mounted upon my new Fortification, and all
my Piftols, and refolv'd to defend myfelf to the
laft Gafp, not forgetting ferioufly to commend my
,lelf to the divine Prote&ion, and earneftly to pray
to God to deliver me out of the Hands of the Bar-
barians; and in this Pofture I continued abouttwo
Hours, but began to be n^ighty impatient for In-
telligence abroad, for I had no Spies to fend out.
After fitting a while longer, and mufing what I
fliould do in this Cafe, I was not able to bear (it-
ting in Ignorance any longer; (o fetting up my
Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a
flat Place, as I obferv'd before, and then pulling
the Ladder up after me, I fet it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hill, and pulling out
my Profpe&ive-Glafs, which I had taken on pur-
pofe, I laid me down flat on my Belly on the
Ground, and began to look for the Place. Ipre-
P 4 fently
[zirf]
fently found there was no lefs than nine naked Sa-
vages fitting round a fmall Fire they had made, not
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the
Weather being extreme hot; but as I fuppos'd, to
drefs fome of their barbarous Diet of human Fieffy
which they had brought with them, whether alive
or dead, I could not know.
They had two Cannes with them, which they
had haled up upon the Shore; and as it was then
Tide of Ebb, they feem'd to me to wait for the
Return of the Flood to go away again; it is not
e^fy to imagine what Confufion this Sight put me
into, efpecially feeing them come on my Side the
Ifland, and fo near me too; but when I obfeiVd
their coming muft be always with the Current of
the Ebb, I began afterwards to be more fedate in
my Mind, being fatisfy'd that I might go Abroad
with Safety all the Time of the Tide of Flood, if
they were not on Shore before: And having made
this Obfervation, I went Abroad about my Har-
veft-work with the more Compofure.
As I expe&ed, fo it prov'd ; for as foon as the
Tide made to the Weftward, I faw them all take
Boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away,
1 fhould have obferv'd, that for an Hour and more
before they went oft they went to dancing, and I
could eafily difcern their Poftures and Geftures
by my Glafles; I could not perceive by my niceft
Obfervation, but that they were ftark naked, and
had not the leafl: Covering upon them ;; but whe-
ther they were "Men or Women, that I could not
diftinguifh.
As foon as I faw them fhipp*d and gone, Itook
two Guns upon my Shoulders, and two Piftols at
my Girdle, and my great Sword by mySide, with-
out a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able
to, make, I went away to the Hill,- where I had difc
covered
cover'd the firft Appearance of all; and as foon as
I oat tuither, which was not lefs than two Hours,
(for 1 could not go apace, being fo loaden with
Arms as I was) I perceived there had been three
Canoes more of Savages in that Place; and looking
out farther, I faw they were ail at Sea together,
making over for the Main.
Tnls was a dreadful Sight to me, efpecially
when goin^-down to the Shore, I could fee the
Miirk.s of Horror which the difmal Work they had
been about,, had left behind it, viz,, the Blood, the
Bones, and Parr of the Flefti of human Bodies,
eaten and devoured by thofe Wretches, with Mer-
riment and Sport: I was fo hll'd with Indignation
at the Sight, that I began now to premeditate the
Deftru&ion of the next that I faw there, let them be
who or how many foever.
- It feem'd evident to me, that the Vifits which
they thus make to this Ifland, are not very frequent;
for it is above -fifteen Months before any more of
them earne on Shore there again ; that is to fay, ::$
I neither faw them, or any Footfteps, or Signals
of them, in all that Time ; for as to the rainy
Seafons, then they are fure not to come Abroad,
at leaft not fo far ; yet all this while I liv'd un-
comfortably, by reafon of the conftant Apprehen-
fions I was in of their coming upon me by Surprize;
from whence I obferve, that the Expectation ot E-
vil is more bitter than the Suffering, efpecially if
there is no Room to (hake of that Expectation, or
tbofe Apprehenfions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering
Humour, and took up moll of my Hours, which
fliould have been better employed, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very
next Time I fhould fee them ; efpecially if they
jhoald be divided, as they were the laft Time, in-
«-  > . to
to two Parties; nor did I cpnfider at all, that if
I killed one Party, fuppofe Ten or a Dozen, I was
ftill the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill
another, and fo another, even ad infinitum, till I
fliould be at length no lefs a Murderer than they
were in being Man-eaters, and perhaps much more
fo.
I fpent my Days now in great Perplexity and
Anxiety of Mind, expefting that I fliould one Day
pr other fall into the Hands of thefemerciiefs Crea-
tures; and if J did at any time venture abroad, it
was not without looking round me with the great-
eft Care and Cautipp imaginable; and now I found
to my great Comfort, how happy it was that j
provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats ; for
I durft not, vipon any Account, fire my Gun,efpe-
cially near that Side of the Ifland where they ufu-
aily came, left I fliould alarm the Stages; and
if they had fled from me now, I was fure to hav^
them come back again with, perhaps, two or three
hundred Canoes with them in a few Days, and then
I knew what to expefit.
However, I wore out a Year and three Months,
more, before I ever faw any more of the Savages,.
and then I found them again, as I (hail foon ob-
ferve. It is true, they might have been -there oace
or twice, but either they made ho Stay, or at leaft
1 did not hear them; but in the Month of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four and twen-
tieth Year, I had a very flrange Encounter with
them, of which in its place. ' v b
The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fat-
teen or fixteen Months Interval, was very great;
I Hept unquiet, dream'd always frightful Dreams,
and often ftarted out of my Sleep in the Night: In
the Day great Troubles overwhelmed my Mind,
a-- in the Night I dream'd often of killing the
Savages^
Savages, and of the Reafons why I might juftify
the doing o£ it: But to wave all this for a while,
it was in the Middle of My, on the fixteenth Day
I think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar
would reckon; for I mark'd all upon the Poft ftill;
I fay, it was the fixteenth of May, that it blew a
very great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great
deal of Lightning and Thunder, and a very foul
Night it was after it: I know not what was the
particular Occafionofit; but as I was reading in
the Bible, and taken up with very ferious Thoughts
about my prefent Condition, Iwasfurpriz'd with
£ Noife of a Gun, as I thought, fir'd at Sea.
This was to be fure a Surprize of a quite diffe-
rent Nature from any I had met with before; foe
the Notions this put into my Thoughts were quite
of another Kind. I ftarted up in the greateft Hafte
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the
middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd it after me,
and mounting it the fecond Time, got to the Top
of the Hill the very Moment that a FJafli of Fire
bid me liftenfor a fecond Gun, which accordingly,
in about half a Minute, I heard, and by the Sound,
knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where
I was driven down the Current in my Boat.
I immediately confider'd that this muft be fome
Ship in Diftrefs, and that they had fome Comrade,
or fome other Ship in Company, and fir'd thefe Guns
for Signals of Diftrefs, and to obtain Help, I had
this Prefence of Mind at that Minute, as to think,
that though I could not help them, it may be
they might help me ; fo I brought together all the
dry Wood I could get at hand, and making a good
handfome Pile, I fet it on Fire upon the Hill; the
Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and though the
Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out s that
J was certain* if there was any fuch Thing as a
* :'-- Ship,
Ship, they muft needs fee it, and no doubt they
did : for as foon as ever my Fire blaz'd up, I heard
another Gun, and after thatfcveral others, all from
the fame Quarter. I ply'd my Fire all Night long^
till Day broke; and when it was broad Day, and
the Air clear'd tip, I faw fomething at a great Di-
flance at Sea, full Eafl of the Ifland, whether a
Sail, or a Hull, I could not difcinguifh, no not
with my Glafles, the Pittance was fo great, and
the Weather ftill fomething hazey alfo; at leafl it
was fo out at Sea.
I lookfd frequently at it all that Day, and foon
perceived that it did not move ; fp I prpfently con-
cluded that it was a Ship at an Anchor; and being
eager, you may be fure, to \)c fatisfy'd, I took my
Gun in- my Hand, and run toward the South Side of
the Ifland, to the Rocks where I had formerly been
carry'd away with the Current, and getting up
there, the Weather by thjs Time being perfectly
clear, I could plainly ice, to my great Sorrow, the
Wreck of a Ship caft away \n the Night, upon
thofe concealed Rocks which I fount} when I was
out in my Boat; and which Rocks, as they check'd
the Violence of the Stream, and made a kind of
Counter Stream, or Eddy, were the Occafion of my
recovering from the moll defperate hopelefs Con-
dition that ever I had been in in all my Life..1
Thus, what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's
Deftru&ion ; for it feems thefe Men, whoever they
were, being out of the Knowledge, and the Rocks
bcins wholly under Water, had been driyeiv up-
on them in the- Night, the Wii]d blowing hard at
E. and E. N.E.kl ad they feen the I(lan4> as I muft,
neceilarily iuppofe they did not, they muft, as I
thought, havcendcavour'd to havefavxi thcmfelves
on Shore by the Help of their Boat; but their firing
of Guns for Help, cfpccially when they faw, as I
imaging
imaging, my Fire, fill'd me with many Thoughts,
Firft I imaging, that upon feeing my Light, they
might have put themfelves into their Boat and
have endeavoured to make the Shore; but that the
Sea going very high, they might have been calfc
away ; other times I imagined, that they might
have loft their Boat before, as might be the Cafe
many Ways; as particularly, by the Breaking of
the Sea upon their Ship, which many times obli-
ges Men to ftarve, or take in Pieces their Boat;
and fometimer, to throw it over Board with their
own Hands: Qther times I imagined, they had
(ome other Ship or Ships in Company, who upon
the Signals of tKftrefs they had made, had taken
them up, and carry *d them off: Others whiles I
fancy'd, they were all gone oft'to Sea in their Boat,
and being hurry'd away by the Current that I
had been formerly in, were carry\\ out into the
great Ocean where there was nothing but Mifery
and Perifliing; and that perhaps they might by
this Time think of Starving, and of being in a
Condition to eat one another.
As all thefe were but Conjeftures at beft, fo in
the Condition I was in, I could do no more than
look on.upon the Mifery of the poor Men, and
pity them, which had ftill this good Effeft on
my Side, that it gave me more and more Caufe
to give Thanks to God, who had lo happily and
comfortably provided for me in my defolate Con-
dition ; and that of two Ships Companies who were
now caft away upon this Part of the World, not
one Life fliould be fpir\i but mine: I learned here
again to obferve, that it is very rare that the Pro-
vidence of God calls us into any Condition of Life
fo low, or any Mifery fo great, but we may fee
fomethingor other to be thankful for; and may fee
others in worfe Circumftances than our own.
Such
Sbch certainly was the Cafe of thefe Meii, oi
whom I could not fo much as fee Room to fup-
pofe any of them were fav'd ,• nothing could make
it rational, fo much as to wifli or expeft that they
did not all perifli there, except the Poffibility on-
ly of their being taken up by another Ship in Com-
pany ; and this was but meer Poffibility indeed ;
fori faw not the leaft Signal or Appearance of any
fuch Thing.
I cannot expiain,by any poffible Energy of Words,
what a ftrange Longing or Hankering of Defires I
felt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out fome-
times thus; O that there had been but one or two;
nay, or but one Soul fav'd out of this Ship, to
have efcap'd to me, that I might but have had one
Companion, one Fellow-Creature to have fpoken
to me, and to have conversed with ! In all the Time
of my folitary Life, I never felt fo earneft, fo ftrong
a Defire after the Society of my Fellow-Creatures,
or fo deep a Regret at the Want of it.
There.are fome fecret moving Springs in the Af-
fections, which when they are fet a going by fome
Objeft in View, or be it fome Objefi;, tho* not
in View, yet render'd prefent to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out
the Soul by its Lnpetuofity to fuch violent eager
Embracings of the Objeft, that the Abfence of it
is infupportable.
Such were thefe earneft Wiftiings, That but one
Man had been fav'd ! O that it had been but One! I
believe I repeated the Words, 0 that it had been but
One, a thoufand Times; and the Defires were fo
mov'd by ky that when I fpoke the Words, my
Hands would clinch together, and my Finger prefs
the Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any foft
Thing in my Hand, it would have crufh'd it invo-
luntarily; and my Teeth in my Head wouldftrike
together,
together, and fetagainft one another fo ftrong, that
for fothc time I could not part them again.
Let the Naturalifts explain thefe Things, and
the Reafon and Manner of them ; all I can fay to
them, is, to defcribe the Fad, which was even
furprizingto me when I found it; though I knew
hot from what it fliould proceed, it was doubtlefs
the Efteft of ardent Wifhes, and of ftrong Ideas
formed in my Mind, realizing the Comfort which
the Converfation of one of my Fellow-Chriflians
would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their Fate or mine,
or both, forbad it; for till the laft Year of my be-
ing on this Ifland, I never knew whether any
were fav'd out of that Ship or no; and had only
the Affliction feme Days after, to fee the Corps of
a drown'd Boy come on Shore, at the End of the
Ifland, which was next the Shipwreck: He had on
no Cloaths but a Seaman's Waftcoat, a Pair of
open-knee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blue Linnen
Shirt; but nothing to dired me io much as to
guefs what Nation he was of. He had nothing in
his Pocket but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobac-
co-pipe ; the laft was to me of ten times more Va-
lue than the firft.
It was now calm, and I had a great Mind to
venture out in my Boat to this Wreck, not doubt-
ing but I might find fomething on Board that
might be ufeful to me; but that did not altogether
prefs me fo much, as the Poffibilky that there
might be yet fome living Creature on Board, whofe
Life I might not only fave, but might, by faving
that Life, comfort my own to the laft Degree ;
and this Thought clung fo to my Heart, that I
could not be quiet Night nor Day, but I muft
venture out in my Boat on Board this Wreck ; and
commktingthereft to God's Providence^ I thought
the
rhc Impreffion was fo ftrong upon my Mind, that
-it could not be refilled, that it mult come from
fome invifible Dire&ion, and that I ihould be want-
ing to'my felf, if I did not go. :.
- Under the Power of this lmpfeflion I hafteivd
baekto my Caftle, prepaid every Thing for my
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot for
irefh Water, a Compafs to fleer by, a Bottle of
Jfeum, for I hadftill a great deal of that left; a Baf-
^ket-fuii of Raifins. And thus loading myfelt" with
every Thing neceffary, I went down- to my Boat,
got the Water out of her j and got her afloat^, load-
ed all my Cargo in her, and then went Home &
gainfor more ; myfecond Cargo was a great Bag
full of Rice, the Umbrello to fet tip ovfer my Head
for Shade, another large Pot full of frefh Water,
and about two Dozen of my fmatl Loaves, or
Barley-Cakes, m6re than before, with a Bottle of
Goat's-Milk and aCheefc: All which, with great
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my Boat; and
praying to God to dired my Voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the Canoe along the Shore*
I-came at laft to the utmoft Point of the Ifland
on that Side, (v'iz,.) N. E. And now I was to launch
out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not
to-venture. I look'don the rapid Currents which-
ran conflantly on both Sides of the Ifland, at a-
Djftance, and which were very terrible to me/
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been
in before, and my Heart began to fa;il me ; fori'
tefaw that if I: was driven into either of thofe?
Currents, I fhould be carry'd a vaft Way.out t<*
Sea, and perhaps out £>f my Reach, ot Sight of the
Ifland again ; and that then, as my Boat was but:
fmall, it any little Gale-:of Windfhould rife, 1
Ihould be inevkablH^*' '<" • -•••'' *•- « ' -' ;
Thefe Thoughts fo opprefs'dmy Mind, that I
began to give over my Enterprize, and having ha-
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, 1
ftept out, and fate me down upon a little riling Bit
of Ground, very penfive and anxious, between tear
and Defire about my Voyage; when as I was mu-
ling, I could perceive that the Tide was turn d,
and the Flood came on; upon which my going
was for fo many Hours impracticable: Upon this,
prefently it occur "d to me, that I mould go up to
the higheft Piece of Ground I could find, and ob-
ferve, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or Cur-
rents lay, when the Flood came in, that I might
judge whether if I was driven one Way out, I might
not expeft to be driven another Way Home, with
the fame Rapidnefsof the Currents: This Thought
was no fooner in my Head, but I call my Eye up-
on a little Hill, which fufficiently overlook d the
Sea both Ways, and from whence I had a clear
View of the Currents,' or Sets of the Tide, and
which Way I was to guide myfelf in my Return;
here I found, that as'the Current of the Ebb fet
out clofe by the South Point of the Ifland, fo the
Current of the Flood fet in clofe by the Shore of
the North Side, and that I had nothing to do but
to keep to the North of the IQand in my Return,
and I lhould do well enough.
Encourag'd with this Obfervation, I refolv d the
next Morning to fet out with the firft of the Tide;
and repofingmyfelf fortheNightin the Canoe, un-
der the great Watch-coat I mentioned, I launch d
out: I made firft a little out to Sea full North, till I
began to feel the Benefit of the Current, which fet
Eaftward, and which carry'd me at a great Rate,
and yet did not fo hurry me as the Southern Side
Current had done before, and fo as to take from
me all Government of the Boat j but having a
Q. ftrong
ftrong Steerage with my Paddle, I weiit at a, great
Rate dire&ly for the Wreck, and in lefs than two
Hours I eame up to it.
It was a difmal Sight to look at: The Ship,
which by its Building was Spanijh^ ftuck fail jauiri'ji
in between two Rocks : All the Stern and Quarter
.of her was beaten to pieces with the Sea;, and as
her Forccaftle, which ftuck. in the Rocks, had run
on with great Violence, her Main-malt and For£-
<maft were.brpught by the Board,* that is to fay,
-broken fljort.o'ffj but her Boltfprit was found, and
and the Head and Bpw appear'd firm,* when I
cartie clofetojier, a D6g appeared upon her, who
feeing me coming, yelp'd and ery'd; and as foon
;as Icall'd him, jump'd into the Sea, to come to
me, and Ijiook him into the Boat, but found him
almoltdead for Hunger and Thirft; I gave him a
Cake of nXyr .Bread, and. he eat it like a ravenous
Wolf thfitaJiad been flawing a Fortnight in,the
Snow-. J then gave the poor Creature fome frefli
•Water with; which, ,if I would have let him, he
/would have burft himfelf.
\&fterthis I went on Board; but the firft Sight
I met with, was two Men drown'd in the Cook-
room, or Foi;ecaftle of the Ship, with their Arms
faft about one another: I concluded, as is indeed
probable,* that when, the Ship iiruck, it being in 2l
S'i?orm, the Sea. b'r.oke.fo high, and fo continually
over her. that the Men were not able to bear it,
and were fk&ngkd with ^the conftant rufhing in of
the Water, as -mu^h as if they had been under tf/a;
tier. Jktiyts^he Dog, there was nothing If ft in
the Ship,'that had Life, nor any Goods that I
could'fee,. b44it ,what was. fpbii'd by the Water
There •Atfer^Toiife Casks ofXiquor, whether Wine
or BraBdy;, i k;new not, which lay lower in the
Hold ;• rand: wi^h*. &* W#er being ebb a 04V.I
could fee; but they were too big to meddle with :•
I faw federal Chefts, which / believe beiong'd to
fome of the Seamen, and 4 got two of them into
the Boat, without examining what was in them.
-Had the Stern of the Ship been fix'd, and. the
Forepart broken off, I am perfuaded I might have
made a good Voyage ; for by what I found in thefe
two Chefts, I had room to fuppofe the Ship had
a great deal of Wealth on Board; and if I may
guefs by the Courfefhe fleer'd, £he muft have been
bound from the Buenos Ayres> or the Rio de la Plata
in the South Part of America,, beyond the E/aJils,
to the Havana, in theGulph of Mexico, and fo per-
haps to Spain: She had, no doubt, a great Treafure
in her, but of ^nojJJfe at that time to any Body;
and what became* of the reft of her People, I then
knew not.
I found, befides thefe Chefts, a little Cask full of
Liquor, of about twenty Gallons, which I got into
my Boat with much Difficulty ,• there were ieveral
Muskets in a Cabin, and a great Powder-horn, with
about 4 Pounds of Powder in it; as for the Muskets,
I had no occafion for them, fo I left them,• but
took the Powder-horn: I took a Fire-fliovel and
Tongs, which I wanted extremely > as alfo two
little Brafs Kettles, a Copper-Pot to make Choco-
late, and a Gridiron ,• and with this Cargo, and
the Dog, I came away, the Tide beginning to'
make home again; and the fame Evening, about
an Hour within Night, I reached the Ifland again,
weary and fatigu'd to the laft Degree.
I repos'd diat Night in the Boat, aijd in the Morn-
ing I refolv'd to harbour what I had gotten in my
new Cave, not to carry it home to my Caftle. Aftet
refrefliing myfelf, I got all my Cargo on Shore, and
began to examine the Particulars: The Cask of
Liquor I found tp be a kind of Rum, biitnot fuch
0.3 as
is\yehad at the Brafih\ ami irt a Word1, nbiat m
godd ; but when 1 came to open the Chefts, I
toutfd fe'veral Things of great Ufe to me : For
Example* I foimd in one a fine Cafe of Bottles, of
an extraordinary Kind, and fill'd with Cordial Wa-
ters, fine, and very good ; the Bottles held'about
three Pints each, and were rip'd with Silver: I
found two Pots of very good Suecades,< or Sweet-
meats, lofaften'd alfoon Top, that the Salt Water
had riot hurt them ; add two more of the fame*
which the Water had fpoiTd : I found fome very
good Shirts, which were very welcome to me, and1
about a Dozen and half of Linnen white Handker-
chiefs, and colour'd Neckcloths; the fdrnier were
alfo very welcome, being exceeding refrefliing to
wipe my Face in a hot Day ; befides this, when I
came to the Till in the Chefts, I found there three
great Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held out about
devfcn hundred Pieces in all; and in one of them,
wrapt up in a Paper, fix Doubloons of Gold, and
fbme fmall Bags or Wedges of Gold ; I fuppofe they
might all Weight near a Pound.
r The other Cheft I found had fome Cloaths in it*
but of little Value; but by the Circumftances it
nmfthave belong'dto the Gunnels Mate, though
there was no Powder in it, but about two Pound of
fine glaz'd Powder, in three fmall Flasks, kept, I
fuppofe, for charging thatr Fowling Pieefcs oft Oc-
tafiori :! Upon the Whole, I got very little by this
Vdy^lge, that was of any Ufe tome ; for as to the
Money, I had no Manner of Occalion for it; 'twa3
tbitiea's the Dirt under my Feet; and I would
hfcve given it all for three or foitfPait of Englijb
Shoes and Stockings, which Vvere Things I greatly
wanted, but had not had on my Feet now for
many Years : I Had, 'indeed, gdtten tv^o Pair of
Shoes now, which I took oflrbfthfe Feet of ;tM
*•"• two
ftwo drownM Men, who I (aw in the Wreck ; ar»4
I found two Pair more in phe of the Chefts, which
were very welcome tome ; but they were not!ik£
lour Englijh Shoes, either for E'afe or Service, being
rather what we call Pumps than Shoe?: I found
.in this Seamarc s Chefl about hfty Pieces of Eight
in Royals., but no G^ld ; I fuppofe this belong'd
to a poorer Man than the other, .which feem'd to
belong to fomp Officer.
Weil, however, I lug'd this Money home to
my Cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before,
which I brought from our own Ship ; buf it y/as
great Pity, ,a$ I faid, thattfie other Part of this
Ship had not come to my Share, for 1 am fatisfy'd
I might have loaded my 'Came feveral Times over
with Money, which, if I had ever eicap'd to Eng-
land, would have lain here fafe enough till I might
have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all my Things on Shore,
and fecur'd them, I went back to my Boat, and
rov/d'or paddled her along the Shore to her old
Harbour, where I laid her up, and made thebeft
of my way to my old Habitation, where I found
every thing fafe and quiet; fo I began to reppfc
my felf, live after my oldTafJiibn, and take Care of
my Family-Affairs; and for a while, Hived eafy
enough, on^y that I was more vigilent then J ufed
to be, look'd out oftner, and did not go abroad To
much; and if at any time I diditir with any Free-
dom, it was always to the Eaft Part of thelflaud*
vvherc I was pretty well fatisfy'd the Savages
never <?ame, and where I could go without fo ma-
ny Precautions, and fuclva JLoad of Arms and
Ammunitipri, as I always carry with me, if I went
the other Way.: " ' ; ,

.was all the two Years fill'd with Projeds and
Defigns, how, if it were poffible^ I might get away
from this Ifland; for fometimes I was for making
.another Voyage to the Wreck, though my Rea-
fon told me that there was nothing left there worth
the Hazard of my Voyage: Sometimes for a
Ramble one Way, fometimes another; and I be-
lieve verily, if I had had the Boat that I went from
Sallee in, I fhould have ventured to Sea, bound any
where.I knew not whether.
.I have been, in all my Circumftances, a Memento
to thofe who are touched with the general" Plague
of Mankind, whence, for ought I know, one Half
of their Miferies flow; I mean, that of not being
fatisfy'd with the Station- wherein God and Na-
ture :hath plac'd them ; for not to look back upon
my primitive Condition, and the excellent Advice
of my Father, the Opposition to which, was,
as Imay call ih my Original Sin, myfubfequent
Miftakes of the fame Kind had been the Means of..
my coming into this miferable Condition; for had
that Providence, which fo happily had feated me
at.the Braflsy as a. Planter, blef/d me with con-
fin'd. I^efires, and I could have been contented to
have gone on gradually, I might have been by this
Time, I mean in the Time of my being in this I[land>

and the Encreafe I fhould probably have made, if I
had ftay'd, I might have been worth an hundred

improving and 'encreafing, to turn Supra-Cargo to

Experience of Time; and (o it was with me now ;
md yet fo deep had the Miftake taken root in
my Temper that I could not fatisfy myfelf in my
Station, but was continually poring upon the,
Means and Poffibility of myEfcapefrom this Place;
and that I may with the greater Pleafure to thq

it may not be improper to give feme Account of.
jiiy firft. Conceptions on the Subjcft of this foolifh
Scheme for my EGpape ; and how, and upon what
Foundation laded. :'
I. am now to be fuppos'M retiu'd into my Caftle,
after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate
laid up, fecund under Water, as ufual, and my.
Condition reitored to what it was before : I had
ixiore Wealth indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer ; for I had no more Ufe for it, ..
than the Indlms of Ptru, had before the Spaniards
came their.
It was one of the Nights, in the rainy Seafonin
March, the four and twentieth Year of my firft .
letting Foot in this lllar.d of Solitarinefs, I was
lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well
in Health, had no Pain, no Diftemper, no Unea-
iinefs of Body, no, nor any Uneafinefs of Mind5
more than ordinary, but could by no fyteans
clofe my Eyes; that is, fo. as to deep; no, not &
Wink ail Night tong, ocherw jfe than as follows:
. " Q4 St
It is as impofltble as needle fs, to fet dovfrn the
innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd
through that great Thorofair of the Brain, the
Memory, in this Night's Time : I run over the
whole Hiftory of my Life in Miniature, or by
Abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this
Ifland: Andalfo of the Part of my Lite fince I
came to this Ifland. In my Reflexions i^on the
State of my Cafe, fince I came on Shore on this
Ifland, I was comparing the happy Pofture of my
Affairs in the firft Years of my Habitation here,
compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear, and Care,
which I had liv'd in ever fince I had feen the Print of
a Foot in the Sand ; not thatl did not believe the
Savages had frequented the Ifland even ail the while,
snd might have been feveral Hundreds of them at
times on Shore there,- but I had never known it*
and was incapable of any Apprehenfions about it ;*
my Satisfaction was perfed, tho* my Danger was
the fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing my
Danger, as if I had never really been expos'd to it.
This ftirnifh'd my Thoughts with many very pro-
fitable Reflexions, and particularly this one, How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has pro-
vided in its Government of Mankind fuch narrow
Bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things |
and tho* he walks in the Midft of fo many thou-
iand Dangers, the Sight.ot which, if difcover'd to
hint, would diflraft his Mind, and fink his Spirits,
te is kept ferene and calm, but having the Events
cf Things .hid from his Eyes,- and knowing no-1
thing of the Dangers which furround him.
After theie Thoughts had fome Time enter-
tained me, 1 came to rcfleft ferioufly upon the real *
Danger I had been in f xfo many Years in this
very Ifland? and how I nad walk aabotit 'in,the'
greateft Security, and. with all poffiblfc JTi'anquiU*
......... *.ty;
ty j even whcit; perhaps nothing but. a Brow o£tt
HiH, a great Tree, or the cafual Approach, ofa::i
Night, had been betwwen me and the worft Kind ^
of Dcftru&ion, viz,-. That of falling into the Hands
of Gimbals and Savages, who would have fei£:d
on me with the fame View as I did of a Goat or
a Turtle, and have thought it no more a Crime
to kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon or >
a Gurlieu : I fliould unjuftly flander myfelf, if X
fliould fay I was nor lincerely thankful to my
great Preserver, to whofe Angular Prote&ion I ac-
knowledge with great Humility, that all thefe
unknown Deliverances were due; and without
which I muft inevitably have fallen into their mcr-
cilefs Hands.
When thefe Thoughts were over, my Head was
for fome Time taken up in confidering the Nature
of. thefe wretched Creatures, I mean the Savages;
and how it came to pafs in the World, that.-the
wife Governour of all Things fliould give up any
of his Creatures to fuch Inhumanity; 'nay,.-, to
fomething fo .much below even Brutality itfelf, as
to devour its own Kind; but as this ended in Tome
(at that time fruitlefs) Speculations,K it occurdto
me to enquire, what Part of the World thefe .
Wretches liv/d in j how far off the Coaft wasfrom, :
whence they came; what they venturd over fo far
from Home for ; what kind of Boats they had ;
and why I might not order myfelf, and my Bufi- •:
nefs fo, that I might be as able to go over thither,
as they were to come to me.
I never fo much as troubled myfelf to confider
what I fliould do with myfelf when I came thi-
ther i what would become of me, if I fell into the
Hands of the Savages; or how I fliould efcape from ;
them, if they attempted me; .no; nor fo much as
how it was pQffible for me to reach the Coaft, and
> >. . . , • '-  not
not be. attempted by fome or other of them, with^
out any Poflibility-of delivering myfclf; and if 1
fhouid not fall into their Hands, what I fhouid do
for Provifion, or whither I fhouid bend my Courfe;
none of thefe Thoughts, I fay, fo much as came
in. my Way ; but my Mind was wholly bent upon
the Notion of my pa fling over in my Boat to th$
main Land : I look'd back upon my prefent Con-
dition, as the moft miferable that could poflibly be,
that I was not able to throw my fclf into any thing
but Peath, that could be eall'd worfe ; that if I
reach'd the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coaft along as I did
on the Shore of Ajrkk, till 1 came to fome inha-
bited Country, and where I might find fome Re-,
lief y and after ail, perhaps I might fall in with
fome Chriflian Ship that might take me in ; and-
if the word came to the worft, I could but die,,
which would put an End to all thefe Miferies at.
once. Pray note, all this was the Fruit of a di-
flqrb'd Mind, an impatient Temper, made as it
were dcfperate, by the long Continuance of my
Troubles, and the Difappointments I had met in
the Wreck I had been on Board of, and where I,
had been fo near the obtaining what I fo earneltly
Jong'u for, viz,, fome Body to fpeak to, and to learn
iome Knowledge from, of the Place where I was,
and of the probable Means of my Deliverance :
l,fay, I was agitated wholly by thefe Thoughts*
All my Calm of Mind in my Refignatioii to Pro-
vidence, and waiting the Iflue of the Dlfpofitions
of Heaven, feem'd to be fufpended; and I had, as
it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any
"Thing, but to the Projcd of a Voyage to the
Main, which cam-e upon me with fuch Force, and
J&ch ;in Impetuosity of Defire, that it was not to
be rciifted.
When
.When this had agitated my Thoughts for two
Hours or more with fuch Violence, that it fet
my very Blood into a Ferment, and my Pulfe beat
•as'high as if I had been in a Fever meerly with
the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it-
Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhaufted
with the very Thought of it, threw me into a
found Sleep : One would have thought I fliould
have dream'd of it; but I did not, nor of any
Thing relating to it; but I dream'd, that as I was
going out in the Morning, asufual, from my Caftle,
I (aw upon the Shore two Canoes, and eleven Sa-
vages coming to Land, and that they brought with
them another Savage, who they were going to kill,
in order to eat him ; when on a fudden, the Sa-
vage that they were going to k 11, jiurip'd away
and ran for his Life ; and I thought in my Sleep,
that he came running into my little thick Grove
before my Fortification to hide himfnlf,; and that
I feeing him alone, and not perceiving that the o-
ther fought him that way, fhew'd myfelf to him,
and, fmiling upon him, encouraged him; that he
kneel'd down to me, feeming to pray me to aflift
him ; upon which I fhew'd my Ladder, made him
go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he be-
came my Servant ; and that as foon as I had got-
ten this Man, I faidto myfelf, now I may cer-
tainly venture to the main Land ; for this Fellow
will ferve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to
do, and whither to go for Provifions; and whi-
ther not to go for fear of being devour'd, what
Places to venture into, and what toefcape: I wak'd
with this Thought, and was under fuch inexpref-
fible Impreffions of Joy at the Profped of my Efcape4
in my Dream, that the Difappointments which I
felt upon coming to myfelf, and finding it was no
more thai) a Dream, were equally extravagant the
other
oilier Way, and threw me into a very great De*
jefiion of Spirit.
Upon this, however, I made^this Conclufioi^,
That my only Way to go about an Attempt fot
an Efcape, was, if poflible, Ato get a Savage into
my JPoiTeffion; and? if poflible, it fhould be one of
their Prifoners, who they had condemned to be
eateni and fhould bring thither to kill; but the(e
Thoughts Ml were attended with this Difficulty,
that it was impoffible to effect this, without at"
tacking a whole Caravan of them, and killing
them all; and this was not only a very defperate
Attempt,' and might mifcarry; but, on the p-
ther Hand,' I had greatly"Templed the I-awfulnefe
of it to me, and my Heart trembled at thjb
Thoughts of fheddfng fo much Bipod, tho* ft
was for i^y Deliverance. I need' not repeat the
Arguments which octurd to ine againft this,
they being mentioned before r^But thef I had othefr
Reafons to offer notv, («z//&) that thofe Men were
Enemies to my Life, and would devour me, if they
could ; that it was Self-Prefefvation in the high-
eft Degree, to deliver myfelf from this Death of
a Life, and was a&ing ift my own pefence, as
much as if they w$re aftually affaultfng me, and
the like. I fay, tho' thefe Things "argued for k?
yet the Thoughts of flifcddirig human Blood fo£
my Deliverance, were very terrible to me, and
fuch as I could by no Means reconcile myfelf to i
great while. ... . '"""..
However, at laft, after many fecret Difputes
with myfelf, and after great Perplexities about
, It; lev all thefe Arguments, one way and another,
•ftruggled in my Head a long Time; the eaget
prevailing Deftreof Deliverance at length mafter'd
all the. reft ; and I refolv'd, if poflible* to get one
of thofe Savages- into my Hands* ,eoft what,it
would.
^rdiird My next Thing then was to contrive hovfr
to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to re-
folve on : But as I could pitch upon no probable
Means for it, fo I refolv'd to put myfelf upon the
Watch, to fee them when they came on Shore,
and leave the reft to the Event, raking fuch Mea-
sures as the Opportunity fiiould prefent, let be
$vhat would be.
With thefe Rofolutions in my Thoughts, I fet
myfelf upon the Scout, as often as poffible, and
indeed fo often', till I was heartily tir'd of it; for
if was abovfc a: Year an4 a halt that I waited, and
for great Part of that Time went out to the Weft
End, and to the South-Weft Corner of the Ifland,
ahiioft every Day, to fee for Canoes, but none
sppfcar'd. *Tis was very difcouraging, and began
to trouble me much ; tho' I cannot fay that it did
iti this Cafe, as it had done fome Time before that,
(s/fW) wear off the Edge of my Defire to the Thing.
But the longer it feem'd to be delayed, the more
eager 1 was for it; it* a Word, I was not at firft fo
careful to (huh the Sight of thefe Savages, and a-
void being feen by them, as I was now eager to be
upon them.
Befides, I fancy'd myfelf able to manage one,
nay > two or three Savages, if I had them, (b as
to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do what-
ever I flibuld direct them, and to prevent their
being able at any Time to do me any Hurt. It
was a gre^t while that I pleased myfelf with this
-Affair, but nothing ftill prefented; all my Fancies
atid Schemes came to nothing; for no Savages camp
near me for a great while. : 
»' About a Year and a half after I had entertained
thefe Notions, and, by long mufing, had as were
refolv*d them all into nothing, for want of anOc-
ca(k>n to put them in Execution, I was furpriz'd
one
f 23« ]
one Morning early, with feeing no lefs than five
Canoes ail on Shore together on my Side thellland;.
and the People who belonged to them all landed,
and out of my Sight: The Number of them broke
all my Meafures; for feeing fo many, and know-
ing that they always came; four or fix, orfometimes
more, in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my Meafures., to attack, twen-
ty or thirty Men fingle handed ,• fo I lay ftill in
my Caftle, perplexed and difcomforced: However,-*
I put myfelf into all the fame Poftures for an At-
tack, that I had formerly provided, and was juft
ready for Aftion, if any Tiling had.pre fen ted. Ha-
ving waited a good while, liltening to hear ifthey
made any Noife; at length, being very impatient,.
I fet my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and,
clambered up to the Top of the Hill, by my two
Stages as ufual; ftanding fo, however, that my
Head did not appear above the HiiJ, fo that
they could not perceive me by any means: Here
I obferv'd, by the Help of my Perfpe&ive Qlafs*
that they were no lefs than thirty in Number, that
they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat
drefs'd ; how they had cook'd it, that I knew.not,
or what it was ; but they; were all dancing in I
know not how many barbarous Geftures and Fi-
gures their own Way, round the Fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perc,eiv'd,
by my Perfpe&ive, two miferable Wretches drag'd,
from the Boats, where it kerns they were laid by,
and were now brought out. for the Slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fell, being,
knocked down, I fuppofe with.a Club or wooden
Sword, for that -was their Way, and two or three
others were at Work immediately cutting him open-
for their Cookery, while the other Vi&im was left
fianding.by himfelf, till they.fhouId.be ready for,
him.
him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch fee-
ing himfelf a little at Liberty. Nature infpir'djiina
with Hopes of Life, and he flatted away from
them, and ran with incredible Swiftnefs along the
Sands directly towards me, I mean, towards that
Part of the Coaft where my Habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted, (that I muft acknow-
ledge) when I perceiv'd him to run my Way; and
efpecially, when as I thought I faw him purfued
by the whole Body; and now I expe&ed that Part
of my Drearii was coming to pafs, and that he
would certainly take Shelter in my Grove; but I
could not depend by any Means upon my Dream
for the reft of it, (viz,!) that the other Savages
would not purfue him thither, and find him there.
However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began
to recover, when I found that there was not above
three Men that followed him ; and ftill more was I
encourag'd, when I found that he outflript them
exceedingly in running, and gain Ground of
them, fo that if he could but hold it for half an
Hour, I faw eafily he would fairly get away from
them all.
There was between them and my Caftle the
Creek which I mentioned often at the firft Part of
my Story, when I landed my Cargo.es out of the
Ship -, and this, I faw plainly, he muft neceflarily
fwim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken
there : But when the Savage efcaping came thi-
ther* 'he made nothing of it, tho' the Tide was
then up, but plunging in, fwatiTthro* in about thir-
ty Strokes or thereabouts, landed, and ran on
with exceeding Strength and Swiftnefs; when the
three Perfons came to the Creek, I found that two
of them could fwim, but the third could not, and
that {landing on the other Side, he look'd at the
other, but went no farther; and foon after went;
foftly
foftly back again, which, as it happcn'd, was very
#ell for him in the main.
I obferv'd, that the two who fwam, were yet
more than twice as long fwimming over the Creek,
as the Fellow was that fled from them : It came
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed
irrefiftible, that now was my Time to get me a
Servant, and perhaps a Companion or an Affiftant;
and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to fave
this poor Creature's Life ; I immediately run down
the Ladders with all poffible Expedition, fetched
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot
of the Ladders, as I obferv'd above; and getting
up again with the fame Hafte to the Top of the
Hill, I crofs'd toward the Sea ,• and having a very
fhort Cut, and all down Hill, clapp'd myfelf in
the Way between the Purfuers and the Purfued ;
hollowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
back, was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me
as at them; but I beckon'd with my Hand to him
to come back, and in the mean Time I (lowly ad-
vanced towards the two that followed; then rufliing
at once upon the foremoft, I knock'd him down
with the Stock of my Piece : I was loth to fire, be-
caufe I would not have the reft hear; tho* at that
Diftance it would not have been eafily heard ;
and being out of Sight of the Smoke too, they
would not have eafily known what to make of it:
Having knocked this Fellow down, the other, who
purfiui him ftopp'd, as if he had been frighted;
and I advane'd apace towards him ; but as 1 came
nearer, I perceiv'd prefently he had a Bow and
Arrow, and was fitting it too (hoot at me ; fo I
was then neceffitated to (hoot at him firft, which I
did, and kill'd him at the firft Shoot; the poor Sa-
vage who fled, but had ftopp'd, tho* he faw both
his Enemies fallen and kind, as he thought; yet
was
bras Co frighted.with the Fire, and Noife of m/. *
jpiece, chat he fhood ftock-ftiu, and neither cam#
forward or went backward, tho\ he leem'd rather
inclined to fly ftill, ^ than to come oiu I hollow d:
again to him,, and 'made Signs to come forward*
which he eafily underilood, and came a little Way*
then .ftopp'd again; and then a little farther; "and
fiopp'dagain.» and I could then perceive that be
flood trembling, as if he had been taken Prisoner,
and had jiift been to by kiil'd, as his two Enemies
were: X beckon'd him again to come to me, and
gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I
could think of, and he came nearer and nearer,
kneelingdown every ten or twelve Steps, in Token
of Acknowledgment for myfavinghis Life: I fmiTd
at: him, and look'd pleafantly,. and beck on 'd to him
to come ftill nearer; at. length he came clofe to me,.;
and then he kneel'd down again, kifs'd the Ground >
and laid his Head upon the Ground, and taking.
me by the Foot, fctmyFoot upon his Head ,\
this, it feems, was in Token of fwearingto be my
Slave for ever. . I took him up, and made much of .
him, and encouraged him all I could: But there
was more Work to do yet* for I perceiv'd the Sa-
vage, whom I knock'd down, was not kill\J, but;
ftunn'd'with the Blow, and began to come t6 him*
ielf; fo I pointed to him, and fhowing him the Sa~*
vage,. tliat he was not dead ; upon this he fpoke .
fome Words to me, and tho* I could not underftand
thepi, yet I thought they were pleafant to here, for..
they were.the firft Sound of a Man's Voice that I;
had heard,;,^) own excepted* for above twenty five ;
Years. But, there, was no Time for fuch Refle&ir,
ons how.; the, Savage,; who was knocked downy

Ground, and^rper^eivM that rxvy Savage .began.- to ,-
be^fraidi^b^yWn I fa,w that^I prdented.my o-
. R thec
thcr Piece at the Man, as if I Would flicdt him ?
upon this my Savage, forfo I call him now, made
a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hun g
naked in a Belt by my Side; fo I did: He no foot-
er had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one
Blow eut of his Head as cleverly, no Executioner
in Germany could have done it fooner or better ;
which I thought very ftrange, for one, who I had
Reafon to believe never Taw a Sword in his Lik be-
fore, except their own wooden Swords; however,
it Teems, as I learned afterwards, they make their
wooden Swords fo fliarp, To heavy, and the Wood
is To hard, that they will cutoff Heads even with
them* aye and Arms, and that at one Blow too :
When he had done this* he comes laughing to me
in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword
again, and with abundance of Geftures, which I
did not underftand, laid it down with the Head of
the Savage that he had kill'd, juft before me.
But that which aftonifl/d him moft, was to
know how I had kill'd the other Indian fo Tar off;
fo, pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let
him go to him; fo I bad him go, as well as I could ,*
when he came to him, he flood like one ama^d,
looking at him, turn'd him firft on one Side, then
on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet had
made, which, it Teems, was juft in his Breaft, where
it had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of
Blood had followed, but he had bled inwardly, for
he was quite dead : He took up his Bow and Ar-
rows, and came back, fo I turned to go away, and*
beckoned to him to follow me, making Signs to
him, that more might come after them-
Upon this he fign'd to me* that he fhould bury
them with Sand, that they might not be feen by
the reft if they follow'd, and fo I made Signs again
to him to do Jo -K he fell to work, &nd in an Inftant.
he
he had fcrap'd a Hole in the Sand with his Hands*
big enough to bury the firft in, and then dragg'd
him into it, and covered him, and did fo alio by
the other ; I believe he had bury'd them both in a
Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I car-
ry 'd him not to my Caftle, but quite away to my
Cave, on the farther Part of the IQand; fo I did
,not let my Dream come to pafs in that Part, viz*.
That he came into my Grove for Shelter.
Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raifins
to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I found he
was indeed in great Diftrefs for, by his Running;
and having refrefti'd him, I made Signs for him to
go lie down and fleep, pointing to a Place where
I had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a
Blanket upon it, which I ufed to fleep upon my
felf fometimes; fo the poor Creature laid down,
and went to fleep.
He was acomely handfome Fellow, perfe&ly well
made, with ftrait ftrong Limbs, not too large, tall
and well fliap'd, and, as I reckon, about twenty fix
Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance,
not a fierce and furly Afpe<5t* but feem'd to have
fomething very Manly in his Face, and yet he had
all the Sweetnefs and Softnefs of an European in his
Countenance too, efpecially when he imil'd. His
Hair was long and black, not curl'd like Wool; his
Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity
and fparkling Sharpnefs in his Eyes. The Colour of
his Skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and
yet not of an ugly yellow naufeous Tawny, as the
Brafiliansj and Virginians, and other Natives of A-
merica are, but of a bright Kind of a dun Olive Co-
lour, that had in it fomething very agreeable, tho*
not very eafy to defcribe. His Face was roun4
and plump, his Nofe fmall, not flat like the Ne-
groes, a very good Mouth, thin Lip?, an4 his
R a fine
fine Teeth well fet, and white as Ivory. After he
had flumber'd, rather then flept, about half an
Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of the Cave
to me ; for I had been milking my Goats which I
had in the Enclosure juft by : When he fpy'd me,
he came running to me, laying himfeif down re-
gain upon the Ground, with all the poffible Sigi s-
of an humble thankful Difpofition, making a
many antick Geflures to (how it: At laft he la)S
his Head flat upon the Ground, clofe to my Foot,
and fet my other Foot upon his Head, as he had
done before; and after this, made all the Signs to
me of Subject ion, Servitude, and Submiffion ima-
ginable, to let me know how he would ferve me as
long as heliv'd. 1 underflood him in many Things,
and let him know I was very well pleas'd with
him ; in a little Time I began to fpeak to him,
and teach.him to fpeak to me; and firft, I made
him know his Name fhould be Friday, which was
the Day I fav'd his Life; I call^Mm fo for the
Memory of the Time; I likewise nfught him to
fay Mafter, and then let him know"that was to
be my Name; I likewise taught him to fay Yes
and Noy and to know the Meaning of them; I
gave him forrie Milk, in an earthen Pot, and let
him fee me drink it before him, and fop my Bread,
in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do the
like, which he quickly comply'd with, and made
Signs that it was very good for him.
' 1 kept there with him all that Night, but as
fdon as it was Day, I beckon'd to him to come with
me, and let, him know I would give him fome
Qoaths, at which he feem'd very glad, for he was
flark-naked : As we went by the Place where he
had bury'd the two Men, he pointed exaftly to
the Place, andfhew'd me the Marks that "he had
xiiadeto find them'again, making Signs to me
' "' that
,tfrat wefhould dig them up again, and eat them ;
£t this I appear^ very angry, exprefs'd my Ab-
horrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to
him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great Submiillon. I then led him up to the
Top of the Hill, to fee if his Enemies were gone;
and pulling out my Glafs, I look'd and faw plain-
ly the Place where they had been, but no Appear-
ance of them, or of their Canoes; {q that it was
plain that they were gone, and h^d left their two
Comrades behind them, without any Search after
them.
But I: was not content with this Difcovery, but
having now more Courage, and confequently more
Curiofny, I takes my Man Friday with me, giving
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could ufe
very de^roufly, making Jiim carry one Gun. for me,
and I two for myfelf, and away we march'd to the
Place, where^efe Creatures had been; for I had
a Mind now'rto get fome fuller Intelligence of
them: When I came to the Place, my very Blood
ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart funk within
me at the H orror of the Spedacle: Indeed it was a
dreadful Sight, sat .Jeaitit was fo tome, tbo* Fridqy
made nothing of it : The Place was covered with
human Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Bloody
great Pieces of Flefli left here and there, half
eaten, mangled and fcorch'd; and, in fhort, all the
Tokens of the triumphant Feaft they had been
making there, after a Victory over their Enemies:.
1 faw. three Sculls,fiveHands,andthe Bones of three.
or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other Parts
of the Bodies ; and Friday by his Signs, made me
underftatid, that'they brought over four Ptifoners
to feaft upon, that three of them were eaten up*
R 3 and
arid that he, pointing to himfclf, was the fourth :
That there had been a great Battle between them,
and their next King, whofe Subje&s, it feems, he had
been one of; and that they had taken a great Num-
ber of Prifoners, all' which were carry'd to feveral
Places by thofe that had taken them in the Fight,
in order to feaft upon them, as was done here by
thefe Wretches upon thofe they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gather all the Sculls, Bones,
Flefti, and whatever remained, and lay them toge-
ther on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it,
and burn them all to Afhes : I found Friday had ftill
a hankering Stomach alter fome of the Flefhj and
was ftill a Canibal in his Nature; but I difco-
ver'd fo much Abhorance at the very Thoughts of
it, and at the leaft Appearence of it, thathedurft
not difcover it •, for I had, by fome Means, let him
know, that I would kill him if he ofter'd it.
When he had done this, we came back to our
Caftle, and there I fell to work for my Man Friday;
andfirft of all I gave him a Pair of Linnen Draw-
ers which I had out of a poor Gunner's Cheft I
mentioned, and which I found in the Wreck, and
which,with a little Alteration, fitted him very well;
then I made him a Jerkin of GoatVskin, as well as
my Skill would allow; and 1 was now grown a
tolerable good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap,
which I had made of a Hare-skin, very convenient,
and fafhionable enough ; and thus he was cloath'd
for the prefent, tolerably well, and was mighty
well pleased to fee himfelf almoft as wellcloath'd
ashisMaftcr: It is true, he went awkardlyin
thefe Things at firft:' Wearing the Drawers was
very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Waft-
coat gall'd his Shoulders, and the Infide of his
Arms i but a little eafing them,where he complained
........ they
jtjicy hurt him, and ufing himfelf to them, atlength
he took to them very well.
The next Day, after I came Home to my Hutch
with him, I began to confider where I fhould Jodge
him; and that I might do well for him, and yet be
perfectly eafy myfelf, I made a little Tent for him
in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
in tHe Infide of the laft, and in the Outfide of the
firft : And as there was a Door or Entrance there
into my Cave, I m^de a formal fram'd Door-cafe,
and a Door to it or Boards, and fet it up in the
Paffage, a little within the Entrance ; and caufing
the Door to open on the Infide, I barr'd it up ia
the Night, taking in my Ladders too > fo that Fri-
day could no Way come at me in the Infide of my
innermoft Wail without making fo much Noife in
getting over, that jit mull needs waken me ; for my
.jfirft Wall had npwa compleat Roof over it of long
Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the
Side of the Hill, which was again laid crofs with
fmaller Sticks inftead of Laths, and then thatch'd
over a grjpat Thicknefs with the Rice Straw, which
was throng like Reeds; and at the Hole or Place
V^hich was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had
plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the Outfide, would not have opened
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great Noife •, and as to Weapons, I took them all
j*a to my Side every Night.
But I needed none of all this Precaution •, for ne-
ver Man had a more faithful, loving, fincete Ser-
vant than Fridny was to me ; without Paffions,
Sullennefs, or Defigris, perfbftly obliged and en-
gaged ; his very Afte&ions were ty'd to me, like
thofe of a Child to a Father •, and I dare fay, 'he
would have facrific'd his Life for the faving mine,;
upon any Qccafion whatfoever; the many Tcftimo-
R 4 nics
mes1 He gave me of.this, put it out of Doubt, and
foon convinc'd me, that 1 needed to ufe no Precau-
tions as to my Safety on his Account.
This frequently gave me Qccafion to obferve,
and that with wonder, that however it had pleas'd
God in his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from fo great a
Part of the World of his Creatures, the belt Ufes to
which their Faculties and the Powers of their
Souls are adapted ; yet that he has beftow'd upon
them the fame Powers, the lame Reafon, the fame
Affe6tions, the fame Sentiments of Kindnefs and
Obligation, the fame Paflions and Refentments
of Wrongs, the fame Senfe of Gratitude, Sinceri-
ty,-Fidelity; and all the Capacities of doing Good,
and receiving Good, that he has given to us; and
that when he pleafesto offer to them Occafionsof
exerting thefe, they are as ready, nay, more ready
to apply them to the right Ufes for which they
were -beftov/d, then we are. And this made me
very melancholy fometimes, in refle&ing, as the
feveral Occafions prefented, how mean a Ufe we
make of all thefe, even th; ough we have thefe Pow-
ers enlightened by the great Lamp of Inftruffcion,
the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of his
Word added to our Under/landing; and why it
haspleas'd.:God to hide the like faving Knowledge
from fo many Millions of Souls, who (if I might
judge by this poor Sayage) would make a much
•better Ufe of.it. than we did.
From h£nce I. fometimes was led too far to in-
vade the Sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were,
arraign the  Juftice of fo arbitrary a Difpofition
of Things,: that ftiouidhide that Light from fome,
and reveal >it to others, and yet expe£t alike Du-
ty from both; .But Ifhutit up, and check'd my
Thoughts with this Conclufion, jft, That we did
I  ' not
not lenow by what Light and Law thefe fliould bg
condemn d > but that as God was neceflarily, an$l
by the Nature of his Being, infinitely holy and
juft, fo it could not be, but that if thefe Crea-
tures were all fentenc'd to Abfence from himfclf,
it was on Account of fining againft that Light,
which, as the Scripture fays, was a Law to therrv-
felves,and byfuch Rules as their Gonfc ences would
acknowledge to be juft,tho' the Foundation was not
difcover'd to us. And, 2dly, That flill as we are all
the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no Veflel
could fay to him, Why haft thou form'd me thus?
But to return to my new Companion:. I was
greatly delighted -with him, andmade.it my:Bufi-
nefs to teach him every Thing that was. proper to
make him ufeful^ handy, and helpful; but efpeci-
ally to make him fpeak, and underftand, me when
lfpake; and.he was the apteft Scholar that ever
was, and particularly was fo merry, fo conftantly
diligent, and To pleas'd, when he. could but ua-
deritand me or make me underftand him, that it
was very pleafant to me to talk to him; and now
my Life began to be fo eafy, that I began to fay to
myfelf, that could I but have been fafe from more
Savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from
the Place while Iliv'dr.
After I had been two or three Days returned to
my Caftle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday
oft from his horrid Way of Feeding, and from the
Relifli of a Canibai s Stomach, I ought to let him
tafte other Fleffi ; fo I took him out with me one
Morning to the Woods,* I went, indeed, intending*-
to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring him
home and drefs it: But as I was going, I faw
a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and. two
young Kids fitting by her; catch'd hold of Fri-
day, hold, fays I3 ftand ftill,- and made Signs to him
'•' . . v ' not
pot to ftir, immediately I preferred my Piece, fliQt
and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature^
toho had at a Diftance, indeed, feet? me kill the
Savage, his Enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine, how it was done, was fenfibly furpnz'd,
trembled, and (hook, and looked fo amazed, that
1 thoughj/he would have funk down. He did not
fee the Kid I had (hot at, or perceive I had kill'd
i*t, but ripp'd up his Waficoat to feel if he was
not wounded, and, as I found, prefently thought
I was refolvM' to kill him,; for he came and
kneeFd down to me, and embracing my Knees,
faid a great many Things I did not underftand,
but I could eafily fee that the Meaning was to
ptay me not to kiU him.
I foon found a Way to convince him that I would
do him no Harm, and taking him up by the Hand,
laugh'd at him, and pointing to the Kid which I
had kill'd, beckon'd to him to run and fetch it,
which he did ; and while he was wondering and
looking to fee how the Creature was kill'd, I load-
ed my * Gun again, and by and by I faw a great
Fowl like*a Hawk fit upon a Tree within Shots
fo, to let Friddy uridet&axid a little what I would doi
I call'd him to me again, pointing at'the Fowl,'
which was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had
been a Hawk; I fay, pointing to the Parrot, and
to my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot,
to let him fee I would make it fall, I made him
nnderftand that I would fhoot and kill thkt Bird j
accordingly I fir'd and bad him look,' and immedi-
ately he faw the Parrot fall; he flood* like 'one
frighted again, notwithftanding all I had f^id to
him ; and I found he was the more amafc'd,4 be-
caufe he did not fee me put any Thing into the
Gun ; but thought that there muft be fome won-
derful Fund of Death and Dcftrudtion hi that Thing,
able
able to kill Man, Beaft, Bird, or any Thing, near
or far off; and the Aflonifhment this created in
him was fuch, as could not wear off for a long
Time ; and I believe, if I would have let him, he
would have worfliipp'd me and my Gun : As for
the Gun itfdf, he would not fo much as touch it
for feveral Days after ,• but would fpeak to it, and
talk to it, as if it had anfwer'd him, when he was
by himfelf; which, as I afterwards learn'd of him,
was to defire it not to kill him.
Well, after his Aflonifhment was a little over
at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird
I had fliot, which he did, but ftay'd fome Time ;
for the Parrot not being quite dead, was fluttered
a good Way off from the Place where flie fell;
however, he found her, took her up, and brought
her to me,* and, as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance
about the Gun before, I took this Advantage to
charge the Gun again, and not let him fee me do
it, that I might be ready for any other Mark that
might prefent; but nothing more offer'd at that
Times fol brought home the Kid, and the fame
Evening took the Skin off, and cut it out as well
as I^could ; and having a Pot for that Purpofe, I
boild or ftew'd fome of the Fled, and made
fome very good Broth ; and after I had begun to
eat fome, 1 gave fome to my Man, who feem'd
very glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that
which was ftrangeft to him was to fee me eat
Salt with it ,• he made a Sign to me, that the Salt
was not good to eat, and putting a little into his
own Mouth,he feem'd to naufeate it, and would fpit
and fputter at it, wafliing his Mouth with frefh
Water after it; on the other Hand, I took fome
Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pretended
to fpit and fputter for want of Salt, as faft as he
had done at the Salt; but it would not do, he
would
would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his
Broth; atleaft, not a great while, and then but a
very little. ' <
Having thus fed him with boil d Meat and
Broth, I was refolv'd to feaft him the next Day
withroaftinga Piece of the Kid; this I did by hang-
ing it before the Fire in a String, as I had feen.
many People in England, fetting two Poles up,
one on each Side the Fire, and one crofs on the
Top, and tying the String to the crofs Stick, letting
the Meat turn continually : This Friday admir'd
very much; but when lie came to tafte the Flefli,
he took fo. many Ways to tell me how well he lik'd
it, that I .could not but underftand him ^ and at
laft he told me he would never eat Man's Flefli
any more, which I was very glad to hear.
The next Day I fet him work to beating fome
Corn out, and lifting it in the Marnier I ufed to do,
as I obferv'd before ; and hefoon underflood how
to do it as well as I, efpecially, after he had feen
what the Meaning of it was, and that it was to
make Bread of; for after that I let him fee me
make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a little
Time Friday was able to do all the Work for me,
as well as I could do it myfelf,
I began now to confider, that having two Mouths
to feed inftead of one, I mult provide more Ground
for my Harveft, and plant a larger Quantity of
Corn than I ufed to do; fo I mark'd out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the-Fence in the lame.
Manner as before, in which Friday not only work.d-
very willingly and very hard, but did it very.
chearfully ; and 1 told him what it was for, that it,
was for Corn to make more Bread, becaufe he was
row with me, and that I might have enough tor.
him and my felf ten : He appear d very feni.ble o
that Part, and let me know that he thought lhad
much
feuch more Labour upon me on this Account, that*
1 had tor my felt; and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.
This was the pleafanteft Year of all the Life I led
iti this Place : Eiday began to talk pretty well, and
imderftand the Names ofalmoft every Thing I had
Occafion to call for, and of every Place I had to
fend him to, and talk a great deal to me ; fo that,
in ftiort, I began now to have fome Ufe for my
Tongue again, which indeed I had very little Oc-
cafion for before; that is to fay, about Speech: Be-
iidesthe Pleafure of talking to him, I had a Angu-
lar Satisfaction in the Fellow himfelf, his fimple
unfeign'd Honefty appeared to me more and more
every Day, and I began really to love the Creature;
and on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it
was poffible for him ever to love any Thing before.
1 I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering
Inclination to his own Country again ; and having
learn9d him Englijh fo well, that he could anfwer me
alraoft any Queftions, I ask'd him whether the Na-
tion that he belonged to never conquer'din Battle ?
At which hefinil a, and faid, Yes, yes, we always
fight the better ; that is, he mean'd always get the
better in Fight; and fo we began the following
Difcourfe: You always fight the better, faid I, How
came you to be taken Prifoner then, Friday}
Friday, My Nation beat much, for all that.
Mafter, How beat; if your Nation beat them,
how come you to be taken?
Friday, They more many than my Nation in the
Place where me was; they take one, two, three,
and me : My Nation over beat them in the yon-
der Paace, where me no was; there my Nation
take one, two, great Thoufand.
JMafter, But why did not your Side recover you
from the Hands of your Encmxs then ?
Fridayy
Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the Canoe; my Nation have no Canoe
that Time.
Mafier, Well Friday', and what does your Na-
tion do with the Men they take, do they carry
them away, and eat them as thefe did ?
Friday, Yes, my Nation eat Mans too, eat all
up*
Mafier, Where do they carry them ?
Friday, Go to other Place, where they think.
Mafier, Do they come hither ?
Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
elfe Place.
Mafler, Have you been here with them ?
Friday, Yes, I been here \ [points to the N. W. Side
of the Ifland, which itfeems was their Side.']
By this I underftooti, that my Man Friday had
formerly been among the Savages, who uied to
come on Shore on the farther Part of the Ifland,
onthefaid Man-eating Occafions that he was now
brought for; and fome Time after, when I took
the Courage to carry him to that Side, being the
fame I formerly mentioned, he prefently knew
the Place, and told me, he was there once when
they eat up. twenty Men, two Women, and one
Child: He could not tell twenty in Englifh^ but
he numbred them by laying fo many Stones on a
Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I have told this Paifage, becaufe it introduces
what follows; that after I had had this Difcourfe
with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our
Ifland to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were
not often loll; he told me, there was no Danger,
no Canoes ever loft; but that after a little Way out
to the Sea, there was a Current, and a Wind, al-
ways one Way in the Morning, the other in the
Afternoon.
This
t 2-55 2
This I underftood to be no more than the Sets
faf the Tide, a$ going out, or coming in : but I
afterwards underftood it was occafiori'd by the
great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oyoq«
noque; in the Mouth or the Gulf of which River,
as I found afterwards, our Ifland Jay; and this
Land, which I perceived to the W. and N.W. was
the great Ifland Trinidad, on the N. Point of the
Mouth of the River. I ask'd Friday, a thoufand
Queftions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the
Sea, the Coaft, and what Nation were near; he
told me all he knew, with the greateft Opennefe
imaginable. I ask'd bim the Names of the feverai
Nations of his Sort of People, bu: could get no o-
ther Name than Carifa; from whence I eafily un-
derftood, that thefe were the Caribees, which our
Maps place on that Part America which reaches
from the Mouth of the River Oroonoque to Guianay
and onwards to St. Martha: He told me5 that up a
great Way beyond the Moon, that was beyond the
Setting of the Moon, which muft be Weft from
their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men,
like me, and pointed to my great Whiskers, which
I mentioned before \ and that they had kill'd much
Mans, that was his Word : By all which I under-
ftood, hemean'dthe Spaniards^ whofe Cruelties in
America had been fpread over the whole Countries,
and was remembered by all the Nations, from Fa-
ther to Son.
]j enquir'dif he could tell me how I might come
frpm this Ifland, and get among thofe white Men;
He told me3 yes, yes, I might go in two Canoe; I
could not underftand what he meant, or make him
defcribe to me what he meant by two Canoe, 'till at
laft, with great Difficulty,! found he meant it muft
be in a large great Boat, as big as two Canoes.
This
iThis Part of Fridays Difcourfe began to relifii
<vith me very well, and from this Time 1 enter-
tain d fome Hopes, that one Time or other I
might find an Opportunity to make myEfcape.
from this Place; and that this poor Savage might
be a Mtfans to help me to do it.
During the long Time that Friday has now been
with me, and that he began to (peak to me, and
underhand me, I was not wanting to lay a Foun-
dation of religious Knowledge in his Mind ; par-
ticularly, I ask'd him one Time, Who made him?
The poor Creature did not underftand me at all,
but thought I had ask'd who was his Father : But
I took it by another Handle, and ask'd him who
made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the
Hills and Woods ; he told me it was one old Be-
nanmckee, that livM beyond all: He could delcribe.
nothing of this great Perfon, but that he was very
old; much older, hefaid, than the Sea or the Land,-
than the Moon or the Stars ; I ask'd him then, It
this old Perfon had.made all Things, why did not
all Things worftip him ? He look'd vtry grave,
and with a perfeft Look of Innocence, faid, All
Thingsfaid 0 to him : I ask'd him if the People,
who'diein his Country, went away any where ?.
Hefaid, Yes, they all went to Benamuckee : Then.
1 ask'd him, Whether thefe they eat up went thi-
ther too? Hefaid, Yes. #
From .thefe. Things I began to mftrAift him in
the Knowledge of the true God. I told him, That
the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there,
pointing up towards Heaven : That he governs
the World by the lame Power and Providence by •
which he had made it: That he was Omnipotent,,
could do every Thing for us, give,every Thingto
uv, take every Thing from us ; -and,thus*. by,;pc-:
srecsv -iopee'd his Eves. He liflcn'd with great At-
^ k teuiion
tention, and receivM with Pleafure the Notion of
jefm Chrift, being tent t'o redeem us, and of the
Manner of making our Prayers to God, and his
being able to hear us, even into Heaven- He told
me one Day, that if our God could hear us up be-
yond the Sun, he muft needs be a greater God than
their Benamuckee, who liv'd but a little Way off*
and yet could not hear, 'till they went up to the
great Mountains where he dwelt, to fpeak to him:
I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to fpeak to
him? He faid, No, they never went that were
young Men; none went thither but the old Men,
who he call'd their Oowokakee, that is, as I made
him explain it t6 me, their Religious, or Clergy,
and that they went to fay, 0, (fo he call'd faying
Prayers) and then came back, and told them whac
Benamuckee faid. By this I obferv'd, That there
is Prieftcraft, even amongft the moft blinded igno-
rant Pagans in the World; and the Policy of ma-
king a fecret Religion, in order to preferve the
Veneration of the People to the Clergy, is not on-
ly to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among
All Religions in the World, even among the tnoft
brutifli and barbarous Savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this Fraud to my
Man Friday, and told him, That the Pretence of
their old Men going up to the Mountains to fay O
to their God Benamuckee, was a Cheat, and their
bringing Word from thence what he faid, was
much more f$; that if they met with any Anfwer,
or fpoke with any one there, it muft be with an
evil Spirit: And then I enter'd into a long Dif-
courfe with him about the Devil> the Original of
him, his Rebellion againft GQd, his Enimity to
Man, the Reafon of it, his fetting himfelf up in
the dark Parts of the World to be worfliipp'd in*
ftfcad of God, and as God; and the many Strata-
S gems
gems he made ufe of to delude Mankind to their
Ruin; how he had a fecret Accefs to our Paffions3
and to our Aflfe&ions, to adapt his Snares fo to
our Inclinations, as tocaufe us even to be our own
Tempters, and to run upon our Deftru&ion by our
own Choice.
I found it was not fo eafy to imprint right No-
tions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about
the Being of a God. Nature afflfted all my Argu-
ments to evidence to him even the Neceffity of a
great firft Caufe and over-ruling governing Power^
a fecret directing Providence, and of the Equity
and Juftice of paying Homage to him that made
us, and the like. But there appear'd nothing of
all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit, of his O
riginal, his Being, his Nature* and above all, of
his Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do
fo too. And the poor Creature puzzled me once
in fuch a Manner, by a Queftion meerly natural
and innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to
him. I had been, talking a great deal to him of
the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful
Averfion to Sin, his being a confuming Fire to the
Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all*
he could deftroy us and all the World in a Mo-
ment ; and he liften'd with great Serioufnefs tome
all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the De-
vil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and
ufed all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
Defigns of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom
of Chrift in the World, and the like. Well, fays
Friday, but you fay, God is fo ftrong> fo grea.t,
is he not much ftrong, much Might as the Devil?
Yes, yes, fays I, Friday, God is flronger than the
Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore wc
pjray to God to tread him down under our Feet,
and
[2-59 3
and enable us to refift his Temptations, and
quench his fiery Dares. But, fays he again, if
God much ftrong, much Might as the Devil, why God
no kill the Devil, fo make him no more do wicked.
I was ftrangely furpriz'd at his Queftion, and
after all, tho'Iwas now an old Man, yet I was
but a young Do&or, and ill enough qualify\J for
a Cafuift, or a Solver of Difficulties: And, at firft>
I could not tell what to fay, fo \ pretended not to
hear him, and ask'd him what he (aid ? But he was
too earneft for an Anfwer to forget his Queftion;
io that he repeated it in the very fame broken
Words, as above. By this Time 1 had recovered
myfelf a little, and I faid, God will at laft punifb
him-feverely ; he is refervd for the Judgment, and is
to be caft into the Bottomlefs Pit, to dwell with everlafl-
ing Fire This did not fatisfy Friday, but he re-
turns upon me, repeating my Words, Reserve
at last, me no underfland, But, why not kill the De-
vil now, not kill great ago ? You may as well ask me,
faid I> Why God does not kill you and I, when
we do wicked Things here that offend him? We
are prefervM to repent and be pardoned : He mufes
a while at this; Well, well, fays he, mighty af-
fectionately, that well; fo you, I, Devil, all wicked,
aUpeferve, recent, God far don all. Here I was run
down again by him to the laft Degree, and it was
a Teftimony to me, how the meer Notions of Na-
ture, tho' they will guide reafonable Creatures to
the Knowledge of a God, and of a Worfhip or
Homage due to the fupreme Being of God, as the
Confequence of our Nature; yet nothing but di-
vine Revelation can form the Knowledge of Jefm
Chrift, and of a Redemption purchased for us, of a
Mediator of the new Covenant,and of anlntercef-
for, at the Foot-Stool of God's Throne; I fay, no-
thing but a Revelation from Heaven, can form
S a theft
thefe in the Soul; and that therefore the Gofpe? of
our Lord and Saviour jfefm Chrjfi, I mean, the
Word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised
for the Guide and San&ifier of his People, are the
abfolutely neceflary lnftrufiors of the Souls of
Men, in the faving Knowledge of God, and the
Means of Salvation.
I therefore diverted" the pfefent Difcourfe be-
tween me arid my Man, rifing up haflily, as upon
fome fudden Occafion of going out; then fending
him for fome thing a good Way oflylferioufly pray'd
to God, that he would enable me to inftriNft faving-1-
]y this poor Savage, aflifting by his Spirit the
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the
Light of the Knowledge of God in Cbrifiy recon-
ciling him to himfelf, and would guide me tofpeak
fo to him from the Word of God, as his Confid-
ence might be convine'd, his Eyes openy, and his
Soul fav'd. When he came again to me, I entered
into a long Difcourfe with him upon the Subjeft of
the Redemption of Man by the Saviour of the
World, and of the Doctrine of the Gofpel preach'd
from Heaven, ™&. ot Repentance towards God,
and Faith in our blefled Lord Jefes. 1 then ex-
plained to him, as well as I could, why our bleffed
Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels,
but the Seed of Abraham, and how for that Rea-
fon the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redem-
ption v that he came only to the loft Sheep of the
Houfc of Jftaelj and the like.
I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Know-3
leci£?, in all the Methods 1 took for this poor Crea-
ture's Inftru&ion, and mnil acknowledge what I
believe ali that aft upon the fame Principle will find,
That in laying Things open to him, I really in-
formM and inftru&ed m\felf in many Things, that
either I did not know, or had not fully confided
before i
feefare, but which occur'J naturally to ray Mind,
upon my fearching into them, for the Information
of this poor Savage ; and I had more AfFe&ion in
my Enquiry after Things upon this Occaiion, than
ever I tele before ; (o that whether this poor wild
Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great
Reafon to be thankful that ever he came to me :
My Grief let lighter upon me, my Habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond Meafiure; and
when I reflected that in this iblitary Life which I
had been confined tc, I had not only been movM
myfelf to look up to Heaven, and tofeek to the
Hand that had brought me there ; but was now
to be made an Inftrument under Providence.to fave
the Life, and, for ought I know, the Soul of a poor
Savage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of
Reigion, and .of the Chriftian Do&rine, that he
might know Chriftjefus, to know whomjs Life eter~
ml I fay, when I reflefit-d upon ail thefe Things,
a fecret Joy run throusj'n every Part of my Soul,
and I frequently rejoye'd that ever I was brought
to this Place, whicn I had fo often thought the
mod dreadful of all AfJliftiQns that could poifibly
have befallen me.
In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Re-.
mainvler of my Time, and the Conservation which
em ploy \i the Hours between friday and I, was
iuch, as made the three Years which we iiv'd there
together p^rfe&iy and compleatly happy, if any
fuch-Thing as compleat Happmefs can be form din afub*
lunary State. Tne Savage was now a good Chri-
ftian,, a much better tii m 1 ; tho' I have Reafon
to hope, and b^Ts God for it, that we were e-
qually peniie,,t, and comforted reftor'd Penitents ;
we had here tne Wotd of God to read, and no
ferther otf from his Sp-'ric to indraft, than if we
had bwen i\r England.
S3 I always
I always apply'd myfelf to reading the Scrip-
ture, to lee him know, as well as I could, the
Meaning of what I read ; and he again, by his fe-
rious Enquiries and Qneftions, made me, as Ifaid
before, a much better Scholar in the Scripture
Knowledge, than I fhould ever have been by my
own private meer Reading. Another Thing I can-
npt refrain, from dbferving here alfo from Experi-
ence, in this retir'd Part of my-Life, viz,. How in-
finite and inexpreflibfe a Bleffing it is, that the
Knowledge of God, and of the Do&rine of Salva-
tion by Chriftjefm, is fo plainly laid down in the
Word of God, fo eafy to be receiv'd and under-
flood, that as the bare reading the Scripture
made me capable of understanding enough of my
Duty, to carry me diredly on to the great Work
of lincere Repentance for my Sins, and laying hold
of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a ftated
Reformation in Praftice, and Obedience to all
God's Commands, and this without any Teacher,
or Inftrnftor (I mean, human) fo the fame plain
Inftru&ion fufficiently ferv'd to the Enlightning
this Savage Creature, and bringing him to be
fuch a Chr i (Kan, as J have known few equal to
him in my Life.
As to all the Difputes, Wranglings, Strife, and
Contention, which has happen'd in the World a-
bout Religion, whether Niceties in Do&rines, or
Schemes of Church Government, they were all per-
fectly nfelcfs to us, as for ought 1 can yet fee, they
have been to all the reft of the World: We had the
fare Guide to Heavrn, viz,. The Word of God ;^
and we had, bkffed be God, comfortable Views of
cue Spirit of God, teaching and inflru&ing us by
his Word, leading m into allTruth, and making us
both w.liing and obedient to the Inftm&ion of his
Word; and I cannot fee the leaft Ufe that the
greatcft
greatefl Knowledge of the difputed Points in Re-
ligion, which have made fuch Confufions in the
World, would have been to us, it we could have
obtained it: But I muft go on with the Hiftorical
fart of Things, and take every Part in its Order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
?uainted, and that he could underftand almoft all
faid to him, and fpeak fluently, tho* in broken
Englijh, to me; I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at leafl: fo much of it as related to my
coming into the Place^ how I had liv'd there, and
how long. I let him into the Myftery, for fuch ic
was to him, of Gun-powder and Bullet, and taught
him how to (hoot: I g,ave him a Knife, which lie
was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him
a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, fuch as in Eng-
land we wear Hangers in ; and in the Frog, iii-
ftead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which
was not only as good a Weapon in fome Cafes, but
much more ufeful upon other Occafions.
I defcrib'd to him the Country of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from ; how we
liv'd, how we worfbipp'd God, how we behav'd.
to one another; and how we traded in Ships to all
Parts of the World: I gave him an Account of th *
Wreck vyhich I had been on Board of, and fhew'd
him as near as I could, the Place where Ihe lay ;
but flie was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.
I fliew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which w^
loft when we efcap'd, and which I could not Q.ic
with my whole Strength then, but was n6w fallen
almoft all to Pieces: Upon feeing this Boat, Frida;
ftood mufing a great while, and faid nothing; I
(ask\l him what it was he dudy'd upon; ariaft, fays
he, me fee fuch Boat like come to Place at my Nation.
I did not underftand hirxv a good while; but at
Jaft, when 1 had examin'd farther into it, 1 under-
S 4 flood
ftoqd by him, that a Boat, fuch as that had bpen^
came on Shore upon the Country where he liv'd j
that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by
Strefs of Weather : I presently imagined, thatfome
European Ship muft have been caft away upon
their Coaft, and the Boat might get loofe, anci
drive afhore, but I was (o dull, that I never once
thought pf Men making efcape from a Wreck thi-
ther, much lefs whence they might come; fo I on-*
ly enquir'd after a Defcription of the Boat.
Friday dekvib'd the Boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to underftand him, when he ad-
ded with fome Warmth, wefave the white Mans front
drown : Then I prefently ask'd him, if there wasa-
ny white Mans, as he caD'd them, in the Boat:
Tff> he faid, the Boat full of white Mans: I ask'd
him how many; he told upon his Fingers feven-
teen : I ask\i him then, what became of them; he
told me, they live, they dwell at my Nation.
This put new Thoughts into my Head ; for I
prefently imagin'd, that thefe might be the Men
belonging to the Ship that was call away in Sight
o£my Ifland,. as I now call it > and who, after the
Ship was ftruck on the Rock, and they faw her,
inevitably loft, had fav'd themfelves in their Boat,
and were landed upon that wild Shore, among the
Savages.
Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically
what was become of them ; he aflur'd me they.
hVd ftill there; that they had been there about;
four Years; that the Savages let them alone, and
gave them Viftuals to live. I ask'd him, how it
came to pafs they did not kill them andeat themj
he faid, No, they make Brother with themy that ic,
as I underftood him, a Truce : And then he ad-
ded, "They no eat Mans but when make the War fight:
That is to fay, they never eat any Men, but
 ' • fuch
flich as come to fight with them, and are taken
in Battle.
It was after this, fome confiderable Time, that
being on the Top of the Hill, at the Eaft Side
of the Ifland, from whence, as I have faid, I had
in a clear Day difcover'd the Main, or Continent
~6f America: Friday-, the Weather being very ferene,
looks very earneltly towards the m^in Land, and
in a kind of Surprize, fills jimping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at fome Diftance
frcra ftim : I ask'd him what was the Matter;
0, Joy! fay he, O Glad! There fee my Country,
{here my Naticnl
I obfetVd an extraordinary Senfe of Pleafure ap-
pear'd in his Face, 2nd his Eyes fparkled, and his
Countenance difcover'd a ftrange Eagernefs, as if
he had a Mind to be in his own Country again ;
and this Obfervaiion of mine put a great many
Thoughts into me, which made me at firft not fo
eafy about my new Man Friday as I was before;
and I made no Doubt, but that if Friday could get
Back to his own Nation again, he would not only
forget all his Religion, bpt all his Obligation to
me ; and would be forward enough to give his
Countrymen an Account of me, and come back per-
haps, with a hundred or two of them, and make a
Feaft upon me, at which he might be as merry as
he ufed to be with thofe of his Enemies, when
they are taken in War.
Bat I wrong'd the poor honeft Creature very
much, for which I was very forry afterwards;
However, as my Jealoufy increased, and held me
fome Weeks, I was a little more circumfped, and
not fo familiar and kind to him as before; in
which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the ho-
neft grateful Creature having no Thought about it,
but what confifted with the beft Principles, both
a*
as 3 religious Chriflian, and as a grateful Friend^
as appear'd afterwards to my full Satisfaction.
While my Jealoufy of him lafted, you maybe
fure I was every Day pumping him to fee if he
would difcovcr any of the ne\y Thoughts, which I
fufpedted were in him ,* but I found every Thing
he faid was fq honeft, and fo innocent, that I
could find nothing to nourifh my Sufpicion; and,
in fpite of all iny Uneafinefs, he made me at laft
entirely his owh again, nor did he in the leaft
perceive that I \ivas nneafy, and therefore I could
not fufped him of Deceit.
One Day walking up the fame Hill, but the
Weather being hazey at Sea, fo that we could not
fee the Continent, I calfd to him, and faid, Fri-
day, do you not wifli yourfelf in your own Coun-
try, your own Nation? Yes, he faid, Ibe muchQ
glad to be at ?ny own Nation. What would you do
there, faid I, would you turn wild again, eat Mens
Fiefli again, and be a Savage as you were before >
He look'd full of Concern, and fhaking his Head,
faid, No, no, Friday tell them to live good, tell them
to pray God> tell them to eat Corn-Bread, Cattle-Flejh,
Milk, no eat Man again : Why then, faid I to him,
l%ey will kill you ? He look'd grave at that, and
then faid, No, they no kill mey they willing love learn:
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn.
He added, they learn'd much of the Bearded-Mans
that come in the Boat. Then lask'd him if he
would go back to them ? He fmifd at that, and
told me he could not fwim fo far.T told him I
would make a Canoe for him. He told me, he
would go if I would go with him. I go! fays I»
why, they will cat me if I come there ? No, no,
fayes he, me make they no eat you, me make they much
love you. He meant, he would tell them how, I had
kiil'd his Enemies, and fav'd his Life, and fo he
would
would make them love me ; then he told me, as
well as he could, how kind they were to feventeen
white Men, or bearded Men, as he call'd them,
who came on Shore there in Diftrefs.
From this Time, I confefs, I had a Mind to >
venture over, and fee if I could poffiblyjoin with
thefe bearded Men, who, I made no Doubt, where
Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could,
we might find fome Method to efcape from
thence, being upon the Continent, and a good
Company together, better then I could from an
Ifland 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without
Help. So, after fome Days,., I took Friday to work
again, by way of Difcourfe, and told him I would
give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation ;
and accordingly I carry'd him to my Frigate,
whichjay on the other Side of the Ifland, and ha-
ving clear'd it of Water, for I always kept it funk
in the Water, I brought it out, fhew'dit him and
we both went into it.
I found he was a moft dextrous Fellow at ma-
naging it, would make it go almoft as fwift and
faft again as I could; fo when he was in, I faidto
him, Well, now, Friday, fliall we go to your Na-
tion ? He look'd very dull at my faying fo, which,
it feems was, becaufe he thought the Boat too
fmall to go fo far. I told him then I had a bigger;
fo the next Day I went to the Place where the
firfi Boat lay which I had made, but which I could
not get into Water: Hefaid that was big enough ;
but then, as I had taken no Care of it, and it had
lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun
had fplit and dry'd it, that it was in a Manner
rotten. Friday told me, fuch a Boat would do ve-
ry well, and would carry ynucb enough Vittle> Drink,
Bread, that was his Way of Talking.
Upon
Upon the whole, I was by this Time fo Bxd
tfpon my Defignof going over with him to the
Continent, that I told him we would go and make
one as big as that, and he fhould go home in it.
He'anfwer'd not one Word, butlook'd very grave
and fad: I ask'd him what was the Matter with
him; he ask'd me again thus, Why you angry mad
'^Friday, what me Aw Masked him what he
meant; I told him 1 was not angry with him at all.
No angry \ No angry \ fays he, repeating the Words
ieveral Times, Why fend Friday home away to my
Nation ? Why, fays I, Friday, did you not fay you
with d you were there ? Yes, yes, fays he, wifh be both
there, no wifo Friday there, no Mafler there. In a
Werd, he would not think of going there without
me: I go there, Friday, fays I, what fhalll do
there? He turned very quick upon me at this; Tcu
do great deal much Good, fays he, you teach wild Man?
be ^ood fiber tame Mans; you tellthem know God,
pra% God, and live new Life. Alas, Friday, fiysl,
thou know'ft not what thou fay'it, I am but an
ignorant Man myfelf. Tes, yes, fays he, you teacfye
me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no, Friday,
fays I, you fball go without me, leave me hereto
live by myfelf, as I did before. He loqk'd confus'd
again at that Word, and riming to one of the
Hatchets which he ufed to were, he takes it up
haftily, and gives it me, What mufti do with this?
fays I to him: Xnt take kill Friday, fays he :
What muft 1 kill you for ? Said I again. He re-
turns very quick, What you fend Friday away
for ? Take kit/Friday, no fend Friday away. This
he fpoke "fo earneftly," that I faw Tears ftand
in his Eyes, h a Word, I fo plainly dilcoverd
the utmoft A'ffefron in him to me, and aiirm Re-
ioiution in him, that I told him then, and often
alter, that I would never fend him away from me,
if he was willing to ftay with me. Up-
Upon the Wholes as I found by ail his Difc6urfe
a fettled Attention to me, and that nothing fhould
part him horn .me, fo 1 found all the Foundation
of his Defire to go to his own Country, was laid
in his ardent Affection to the Peeple, and his Hopes
of my doing them good $ a Thing which as I had
no Notion of myfelf, fo I had not the leaft Thought
or Intention, or Defire of undertaking it. But ftill
1 found a ftrong Inclination to my attempting an
Efcape, as above, founded on the Suppoiition-ga-
thered from the Difcourfe, (w'tc.) That there were
feveriteen bearded Men there; and therefore, with-
out any more Delay, I went to work with Friday
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage.
There were Trees enough in the Ifland to have
built a little Fleet, not of Periaguesand Canoes,
but even of good large Vefiels. But the main Thing
I looked at, was to get one fo near the Water that
we might launch it when it was made to avoid
the Miftake 1 committed at firfi
At laft Friday pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found he
knew much better than I what Kind of Wood was
fitteft for if, nor can I tell, to this Day; what Wood
to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the Tree we call F^/J/^ or between that
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for
a Boat: But I fhew'd him how rather to cut it out
with Tools; which, after I had (hew'd him how
to ufe, he did very handily, and in about a Month's
hard Labour, he finiflui.it, and made it very
handfome, efpecially when with our Axes, which I
fbew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the
Out-fide into the true Shape of a Boat; after this,
however^ it coft us neat a Fortnight s Time to get
her
her along, as it were Inch by Inch upon great
Rowlers into the Water. But when fhe was in,
fiie would have carry M twenty Men with great
Eafe.
When fhe was in the Water, and tho' flie was fo
big, it amaz'd me to fee with what Dexterity and
how fwift my Man Friday would manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along ; fo I ask'd him, if he
would, and if we might venture over in her; Yes, he
faid, he venture over in her very weSi thoy great blow
Wind. However, I had a farther Defign, that he
knew nothing of, and that was to make a Maft and
Sail, and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable: As
to a Maft, that was eafy enough to get; fo I pftch'd
upon a ftrait young Cedar-Tree, which I found
near the Place, and which there was great Plenty
of in the Ifland ; and I fet Friday to work to cut it
down, and gave him Direftions how to fliape and
order it, But as to the Sail, that was my particular
Care; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of
old Sails enough; but as I had had them now 26
Years by me, and had not been very careful to
preferve them, not imagining that 1 fiiould ever
have this kind of Ufe for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten, and indeed moft of them
were fo; however, I found two Pieces which ap-
pear'd pretty good, and with thefe I went to wprk,
and with a great deal of Pains, and awkwardiedi-
ous ftitching (you may be fure) for want of--Needles*
I at length made a three-corner'd ugly Thing, like
what we call in England, a Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with a Boom at Bottom, and a little
fliort Sprit at the Top, fuch as ufually our Ships
Long-Boats fail with, and fuch as I belt knew how
to manage; frecaufe it was fuch a one as I had to
the Boar in which I macle my Efcape from Barbw
ry, as related in the firft Part of my Story.
I was
I was near two Months performing this laft
Work, viz.. rigg.ng and fitting my M;ift and Sails;
for I finifh'd them very compleat, making a fmail
Stay, and a Sail, or Forefail to it, toaffift, if we
Biould turn to Windward; and which was more
then all, I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of hqr, to
fleer with; and tho'1 was but a bungling Ship-
wright, yet as I knew the Ufefulnefs, and even
Neceffity of fuch a Thing, I apply'd myfelf with
fomuch Pains to do it, that at laftl brought it to
pafs, tho' confidering the many dull Contrivances
I had for it that fail'd, I think it coil: me almoft as
much Labour as making the Boat.
After all this was done too, I had my Man Fri-
ddyto teach as to what belonged to the Navigation
of my Boat; for tho' he knew very well how to
paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to
a Sail and a Rudder, and was the mod amaz'd
when he faw me work the Boat too and again in
the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gy b'd, and
filled this Way or that Way, as the Courfe we failed
changed ,* I fay, when he faw this, he flood like
one aftonifh'd and amaz'd: However, with a little
Ufe, I made all thefe Things familiar to him; and
he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the
Compafs, I could make him underftand very little
of that. On the other hand, as their was very little
cloudy Weather, and feldom or never any Fogs in
thofe Parts, there was the lefs Occafion for a Com-
pafs, feeing the Stars were always to be ken by
Night, and the Shore by Day, except in the rainy
Seafons, and then no Body cared to ftir abroad, ei-
ther by Land or Sea.
I was now entered on the feven and twentieth
Year of my Captivity in this Place; tho* the
three laft Years that I had this Creature with me,
ought rather to be left out of the Account, my Ha-
bitation
t &1
bitation being quite of 'another Kind than all tl\6
i'eft,of the Time. I kept the Anniverfary bf toy
landing herewith the fame Thankfulnefs to God
for his Mercies, as at firft}' and if I had fuch Caufe
of Acknowledgment at firft, I had much more fo
now, having fuch additional Teftimonies of the
pare of Providence over me, and the great Hopes
I had of being cffe&ually and fpeediiy deliVer'd ;
for I had an invincible Impreffion upon my
Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and
that I fhould not be another Year in this Place :
However, I went on with my Husbandry, digging*
planting, fencing, as ufual; I gathered and curd my
Grapes, and did every neceflary Thing, as before.
• iThe rainy Seafon was in the mean Time upon
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other
Times ; fo I had ftow'd our new Veflel asfecureas
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where*
as I faid, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from
the Ship, and haling her up to the Shore, at High
Water Mark, 1 made my Man Friday dig a little
Dock, juft big enough to hold her, and juft deep e-
nough to give her Water enough to float-in,- and
then, when the Tide was out, we made a ftrong
Dan crofs the End of it, to keep the Water out;
and fo flie lay dry, as to the Tide, from the Sea ;
and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many
Boughs of Trees, ,fo thick, that (lie was as well
thatch'd- as a Houfe ;; and thus we waited for the
Month of November, and December, in which'. I de-
iign'd to make my Adventure.
When the fettled Seifon began to come in, as
the Thought of my Defign returned with the fair1
Weather, I was prepating daily for the. Voyage ;
and thefirfi Thing I did,, was to lay by a certain,
Qu'.n.:ity cf Provisions, being the Stores for our
Voyage; and in tended,.-in a Week or.a Fortnight's
 - ..-. : .*. ..Time,
Time^ to open thj Dock, and launch out our Boat.
I was bufy one Morning tfpon fome Thing of this
kind; when I call'd to Friday, and bid him go to the
Sea Snore, and fee if he could find a Turtle, or
Tottoifc, a Thing which we general]y got once a
Week, for the Sake of the Eggs as well as the?
Flefli: Fit day had not been Jong gone, when he
came running out, and flew over my outer Wall,
or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the
Steps he fct his Feet on; and before I had Time to
fpeak to him, he cries out to me, O Mafier ! Ma-
fieri 0 Sorrow! O bad! What's the Matter, Friday*
fays I; O yonder, tJme,S<iys he, one> two, three Came!
one, two, three!-% his w^ay of fpeaking, I conclu-
ded there were fix ; but on Enquiry I found it was
but three : Well, Friday, fays 1, do not be frighted ;
fo I hearten'dhim up as well asl could : However,
Ifawthc poor Fellow was mofttertibly fcar'd ; for
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to
look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat
him ; and the poor Fellow trembled fo> that I
fcauie knew what to do with him : I comforted him
as well as I could> and told him, I was in as much
Danger as he, and that they would eat me as-well as
him; but, fays I, Friday, wemuflrefoheto fighttbvn;
Canyon fight, Friday? Me fhoot, fays he, but there
come many great Number. No matter for that, faid
I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not
kill; fo I ask'd him, Whether if I refolv'dto defend
him, he would defend me, and ftand by me, and do
jnft as I bid him ? He faid, Me die, when you bid die,
Mafier; fo I went and fetched a good Dram of
Rum, and gave him * for I had been fogood a Huf*
band of my Rum, that I had a great deal left :
When he had drank it, Tuiade him take the two
Fowling-Pieces, which we always carry \J, and load
them with large Swan-Shot, as big as finall Piflol
T Bullets;
Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded them
with two Slugs, and fivefkall Bullets each; and
my two Piftols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets
•each ; I hung my great Sword as ufual, naked by
my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet.
1 When I had thus prepaid my felf, I took my
Perfpe&ive-Glafs, and went up to the Side of the
Hill, to fee what I.could difcover; and I found
quickly^by my Glafs, that there were one and twen-
ty Savages, three Prifoners, and three Canoes;
and that their whole Bufinefs feem'd to be the tri-
umphant Banquet upon thefe three human Bodies,
•{a barbarous Feaft indeed) but nothing more than
as I had obferv'd was ufual with them.
I obferv'd-alfo, that they were landed not where
they had done when Friday made his Efcape, but
nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and
where a thick Wood came clofe almoft down to the
Sea i This, with the Abhorrence of the inhuman
•Errand thefe Wretches came about, fill'd me with
fuch Indignation, that I came down again to Fri~
day> and told him, I was refolv'd to go down to
them, and kill themall; and askM him if he would
fland: by me? He had now gotten over his Fright,
and his Spirits being a little rais'd with the Dram
I had given him, he was very chearfnl, .and told
ine, as before, he would die, when J bid die.
In this Fit of Fury, I took firfl and divided the
Arms which I had cfiarg'd, as.before, between us:
I gave Friday one Piftol co ftick in hi, Girdle, and
three Guns upon his Shoulder ,* and I took one Pi-
ilol, and the other, three myfeif'; and in, this Po-
fture we march'd out: I. took a fmall Bottle of Rum
in my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag, with
more Powder and Bullet; and, as;tq Orders, I
charged him to keep clofe behind rap, and not to
-iliri-or flioot, or do any Thing, till I bid him ,* and
in
in the mean Time, not to (peak a Word : In this
Pofture I fctch'd a Compafs to my righr Hand of
iiear a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to
get into the Wood ; fo that I might come within
Shot of them before I fliould be difcovet'd, which
I had feeirby my Glafs it was eafy to do.
* While I was making this March, my former
Thoughts returning, I began to abate my Refla-
tion ; 1 do not mean, that I entertain'd any Fear
of their Number; for as they were naked, unarmM
Wretches, 'tis certain I was fuperior to them ,* nay,
though I had been alone; but it occut'd to my
Thoughts, What Call ? What Occafion ? Much
lefs, What Neceffity I was in to go and dip my
Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither
done, or intended me any Wrong? Who, as to me,
were innocent, and whofe barbarous Cuftoms were
their own Difafter, being in them a Token indeed
of God's having left them, with the other Nations
of that Part of the World, to fnch Stupidity and
to fuch inhuman Courfes; but did not call me to
take upon me to be a Judge of their A&ions, much
lefs an Executioner of his Juftice; that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the Caufe into his
own Hands, and by National Vengeance punifli
them as a People for National Crimes ; but that,
in the mean time it was none of my Bufinefs ; that
it was true, Friday might jullify it, becaufe he was
a declar'd Enemy, and in a State of War with thofe
very particular People; and it was lawful for him
to attack them; but I could not fay the lame with
refpefi: to me. Thefe Things were fo warmly
prefs'd upon my Thoughts, all the Way as I went*
that I refolv'd I would only go and place myfelf
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous
Feaft, and that I would aft then as God#fiiould
dircfit ; but that unjefs fomething ofrer'd that was
T a more
more a Call to me than yet I knew of, I would
not meddle with them.
With this Refolution I enter'd the Wood, and
with all poffible Warinefs and Silence, Friday fol-
lowing clofe at my Heels, I march'd till I came
to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was
next to them; only that one Corner of the Wood
lay between me and them •> here I call'd foftly to
Friday, and fhewing him a great Tree, which was
juft at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go to
the Tree, and bring me Word if he could fee there
plainly what they were doing; he did fo, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might
be plainly view'd there ; that they were all about
their Fire, eating the Flefli of one of their Prifo-
ners; and that another lay bound upon the Sand,
a little from them, which he faid they would kill
next, and which nYd all the very Soul within me;;
he told me it was not one of their Nation, but one
of the bearded Men, who he had told me of, that
came to their Country in the Boat.- I was fill'd
with Horror at the very naming the white-bearded
Man, and going to the Tree, 1 faw plainly, by my
Glafs, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with
Flags, or Things 1 ike Rufhesj and that he was an
European, and had Cloaths on.
There was another Tree, and a little Thicket
beyond it, about fifty Yards nearer to them thai*
the Place where I was, which by going a little way.
about, I faw I might come at undifcover'd, and
that then I fbould be within half Shot of them; fo
Iwith-held my Paffion, though I was indeed en-
rag'dto the higheft Degree, and gong back about
twenty Paces, I got behind fome Bufbes, which held
all the way, till fcame to the other Tree; and. then
I came to a little riling Ground, which gave me a
full
foil View of them, at the Pittance of about eigh-
ty Yards.
I had now not a Moment to lofe; for nineteen
of the dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground, all
ciofe huddled together, and had juft fent the other
two to butcher the poor Chriftian, and bring him,
perhaps, Limb by Limb, to their Fire, and they
\*rere ftoop'd do\yn to untie the Bands at his Feet;
I turn'd to Friday, now Friday, faid I, do as I bid
thee ; Friday faid he would ; then Friday, fays I,
do exactly as you fee me do, fail in nothing : So I
fet down one of the Muskets, and the Fowling-
PiecJe, upon the Ground, and Friday did the like
by his ; and with my oth*r Musket I took my
Aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like;
then asking him if he was ready, he faid, yes;
then fire at them, faid I; and the fame Moment
Jhr'dalfo.
Friday took his Aim fo much better than T, that
t>n the Side that he fhot, he kill'd two of them,
and wqunded three more ; and on my Side, I kilfd
one and wounded two They were, you may be
jure, in a dreadful Confternation ; and all of them,
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their Feet,
but did not immediately know which Way to run;
or which Way to look ; for they knew not from
whence their Deftruftion came: Friday kept his
Lyes clofe upon me, that as I had bid him, he
might obferve what i did-, fo, as foon as the firft
bnor was made, I threw down the Piece, and took
up the Fowling-Piece, and Friday did the like ; he
fee me cock and prefent, he did the fame again :
Are you ready, Friday ? faid I, Yes, fays he; let
fly then, fays I, in the Name of God, and with
that I fir'd again among the amazed Wretches, and
fo did Friday ; and as our Pieces were now loaden
with what I call'd Swan Shot, or fjnall Piftol Bul-
T 3 lets
lets, we found only two drop ; but fo many were
wounded, that they ran about yelling and skream-
ing likemad Creatures, all bloody, and miferably
wounded moft of them ; whereof three more fell
quickly after, tho* not quite dead.
Now, F/iday, fays I, (laying down the dif-
charg'd Pieces, and taking :ip the Musket, which
was yetloaden) follow me, fays I, which he did,
with a great deal of Courage ; upon which I rufh'd
out of the Wood, and fliew'd myfelf, and Friday
clofe at my Foot; as foon as I perceiv'd they faw
mc, I fhouted as loud as I could, and bad Friday
do fo too; and running as fall as I could, which,
by the Way, was not very faft, being lo&den with
Arms as I was, Imade direftly towards the poor
Vidrtn, who was, as I faid, lying upon the Beach,
or Shore, between the Place where they fate, and
the Sea; the two Butchers, who were juft going
to work with him, had left him, at the Surprize of
our firft Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright to the
Sea-iide, and had jump'd into a Canoe, and three
more of the reft made the fame Way : I turned to
Friday, and bid him ftep forwards, and fire at them;
he underftood me immediately, and running about
forty Yards to be near them, he flbot at them, and
1 thought he had kill'd them all, for 1 fee them all
fall of a Heap into the Boat; though I faw two of
them up again quickly : However, he kill'd two
of them, and wounded the third ; fo that he lay
down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been
dead.
While my Man Friday fir'dat them, I pull'd out
my Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor
Viftim, and looting his Hands and Feet, I lifted
bim up, and ask'd him, in the Portuguefe Tongue,
what he was ? He anfwer'd in Latin, Chrifiiamis ',
but was fo weak and fainr, that he could fcarce
. ,   \. :.•:. c , (land,
Hand or fpeak ; I took my Bottle out of my Poc-
ket, and gave it him, making Signs that he fliould
drink, which he did; and I gave him a Piece of
Bread, which he \eat: Then I ask'd him, What
Countryman he was ? And he faid, Efpagniole; and .
being a little recover'd, let me know by all the
Signs he could poffibly make, how much he was
in my Debt for his Deliverance : Seignior, faid I,
with as much Spanfo&s I could make up, we will
talk afterwards, but we muft fight now ; if you
have any Strength Jeft, take this Piflol and Sword,
jmd lay abput you. He took them very thankfully,
and no fooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but
as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew
upon his Murderers like a Fury, and had cut two
of them in Pieces m an Inftant; for the Truth is,
as the Whole was a Surprize to them, fo the poor
Creatures were fo much frighted with the Noife of
our Pieces, that they fell down for mere Amaze-
ment and Fear, and had no more Power to. at-
tempt their own Efcape, than their FleCi had to
refill our Shot; and that was the Cafe of thofe
five that Friday (hot at iij the Boat; for as three
of them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd, fo the o-
ther fell with the Fright.
I kept my Piece in my Hand ftill, without firing,
being willing to keep my Charge ready, becaufe I
had given the Spaniard my Piflol and Swords; fo I •
call'd to Friday, and bad him run up to the Tree,
from whence we firft fir'd, and fetch the Arms
which lay there, that had been difcharg'd, which
he did with great Swiftnefs; and then giving him
my Musket, I (at down myfelf to load all the reft
again, and bad them come to me when they want-
ed. While 1 was loading thefe Pieces, there hap-
pened a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard said
one of the Savages, who made at him with one of
T 4 their
their great wooden Swords, the fame Weapon that
was to have kill'd him before, if I had not pre-?
vented it: The Spaniard, who was as bold and as-
brave as could be imagined, though weak, had
fought this Indian a good whil?, and had cut him
two great Wounds on his Head; but the Savage
being a ftout lufty Fellow, doling in with him,
had thrown him down, being faint, and was
wringing my Sword out of his Hand, when the Span
niard, tho' undermoft, wifely quitting the Sword,
drew the Pifto! from his Girdle, (hot the Savage
through the Bed;/, and kill'd him upon the Spot,
before I, who was running to hdp him, could come
neat him.
Friday being now left to his Liberty, purfu'd the
flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand but
his Hatchet; and with that he difpatch'd thof^
three, who, as I faid before, were wounded at firft,
and fallen, and all the reft he could come up with;
and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave
him one of the Fowling-Pieccs, with which he;
purfu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them
both; but £$ he was net able to run, they both
got from him into the Wood, where Friday purfu'd
them, and kill'd one of them; but the other was
too nimble for him ; and tho' he was wounded, yet
hid plung'd himfelf into the Sea, and (Warn with
fill his Might off to thofe two who were left ,'n the
Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one wound-
ed, who we know not whether he dy'dor no, were
ail that efcap'd our Hands of one and twenty : The
Account of the reft is as follows:
3
KiilM at our firft Shot from the Tree.
2-KiiiM at the next Shot,
Kill'd by Fridy in the Boat.
Kilui by PittOy of thofe. £u firft woupded.

I Kill'd by Ditto in the Wood,
3 Kill'd by the Spaniard.
4 Kill'd, being found dropp'd here and there of
their Wounds, or kill'd by Friday in his Chafe
of them.
4 Efcap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded, if
not dead.
?i In all.
Thofe that were in the Canoe, work'd hard to
get out of Gun-Shot; and though Friday made two
or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them. Friday would fain have had me took
onp of their Canoes, and purfu'd them; and indeed
I was very anxious about their Efcape, leaft carry-
ing the News Home to their People, they fhould
come back, prehaps, with two or three hundred of
their Canoes; and devour us by meer Muftitude; fo
I confented to purfi.e them by Sea, and running to
one of their Canoes, I jump'd in, and bud Friday
follow me ; but when I was in the Canoe, I was
fui-pnVd to find another poor Creature lie there a-
liye, bound Hand $nd Fooc, as the Spaniard was,
jfor the Slaughter, and almoft dead with Fear, not
knowing what the Matter was; for he had not been
able tq look up over the Side of the Boat, he was
ty d fo hard, Neck and Heels, and had been ty'd fo
long, that he had really but little Life in him.
I immediately cut the twifted Flags, or Rufhes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up ; but he could not ftand, or fpeak,
but groan'd moft p|tioufly, believing (it feems) ftill
that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd.
When Friday came to him, I bad him fpeak to
him, and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling
put my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a
Dram,
Dram, which, with the News of his being deli-
vered, revived him, and he fat up in the Boat ; but
when Friday came to hear him (peak, and look
ia his Face, it would have mov'd any one to Tears,
to have Cccn how Friday kiff'd him, embrae'd him,
hugg'd him-, cry'd, langh'd, hoUow'd, jump'd a-
bout, dane'd, lung, then cry'd again, wrung'his
Hands, beat his own Face and Head, and then
lung, and jump'd about again, like a diftraded
Creature: Ic was a good while before I could make
himfpeak come, or tell me what was the Matter;
but when he came a little to himfelf, he told me,
that it was his Father.
It is not eafy for me to exprefs how it mov'd
me to fee what Exftafy and filial Affe&ion had
work'd in this poor Savage, at the Sight of his Fa-
ther, and of his being delivered from Death; nor
indeed can I defcribe half the Extravagancies of his
Aftefiion after this; for he went into the Boat and
out of the Boat a great many Times: When he
went in to him, he would Jit down by him, open
his Brcaft^and hold his Father's Head clofe to his
Bofom half an Hour together, to nourifh it; then
he took his Arm.*; and Ankles, which were numb'd
and ftiff with the Binding, and chafed and rubbed
them with his Hands ; and I perceiving what the
Cafe was gave him fomc Rum out of my Bottle
to rub them with, which did them a great deal of
Good'
This A ft i on put an End to our Purfuit of the
Canoe, with the other Savages, who were now
gotten altnoft out of Sight; and.it was happy for
us that wo did not; for it blew fo hard within two
Hours after, and before they could be gotten a
 Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing fo
hard ail5 Night, and that from the North-Weft,
which wa;-, a-tjanaft them, that I could nor fuppbfc
their
there Boat could live, or that they ever reached to
their own Coaft.
But to return to Friday, he was fo bufy about
his Father, that I could not find in my Heart to
take him off for fomc Time: But after I thought
he could leave him a little, I call'd him to me,
and. he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to
the lugheft Extream ; then I ask'd him, If he had
given his Father any Bread ? He fhook his Head,
and fa.'d, None: Ugly Dog eat all up felf; fo I gave
him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch I carry5d
on Purpofe •, I alfo gave him a Dram for himfelf,
but he would not talteit, but carry ?d it to his Fa-
ther: I had in my Pocket alfo two or three Bunches
of my Raifins, fo I gave him a Handful of them
for his Father. He had no fooner given his Fa-
ther thefe Raiiins, but I faw him come out of the
Boat, and run away as if he had been bewitch'd,
he ran at fuch a Rate; for he was the iwiheft Fel-
low of his Foot that ever I faw,* I fay, he run at
fuch a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were,
in an Inftant; and though I calfd, and hollow'd
too, after him, it was all one, away he went, and
in a Quarter of an Hour, I. faw him come back a-
guin, though not fo faft as he went; and as he
came nearer, I found his Pace was flacker, becaufe
he had fomething in his Hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite Home for an earthen Jugg or Pot to bring
his Father feme frcfli Water, and that he had got
two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread: The Bread
he gave me, but the Water he carry'd to his Father:
However, aslwas very thirfly too, I took a little
Sup of it. This water reviv'd his Father more
than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him; for
he was juft fainting with Thirft.
When
When his Father had drank, Icall'dto him to
know if there was any Water left; hefaid, yes,-
and I bad him give it to the poor Spaniard,
who was in as much want of it as his Father;
and I fent one of the Cakes, that Friday brought,
to the Spaniard too, who was, indeed, very weak,
and was repofing himfelf upon a green Place, under
the Shade of a Tree, and whofe Limbs were aJfo
very ftiff, and very much fweh'd with the rude
Bandage he had been ty'd with, When I faw that,
tipon Friday's coming to him with the Water, he
fate up and drank, and took the Bread, and began,
to ear, I went roliim, and gave him a Handful of
Raifins; he look'd up in my Face with all the To-
kens of Gratitude and Thankfulnefs that could ap-
pear in any Countenance; but was fo weak, not-
withftending he had fo exerted himfelf in the Fight,
that he could not itand upon his Feet* he try-d to
do it two or three Times, but was really notable,
his Ankles were fo fwell'd and fo painful to him -y
la I bad him fit (till, and caufed Friday to n\\> his
Ankles, and bath them with Rum, as he had done
his Father's.
I obferv'd the poor aftcdionate Creature every
two Minutes, or perhaps Ipfs, all the while h$
was here, turn*d his Head about, to fee if his Fa-
ther was in the fame Pface and Ppflure as he left
him fitting,* and at laft he found he was not to
he fcen ; at which lie iter ted up, and, without
fpeakjng a Word, flew with that Swiftnefsto him,'
that one could fcarce perceive his Feet to touch
the Ground as he went: But when he came, he
only found he had laid himfelf down to eafe his
limbs; fo Friday came back to me prefently, and
1 then fp.oke to the Spaniard to let Friday help
Ixim up if he could, and lead him ro the Boat, and
then he fhould carry him co our Dwell iV^,-' where
1 woi.ld
t wodd take care of .him: Bur Friday, a fully
itrong Fellow, cook the Spaniard quite up upoii
his Back, and carry'd him away to the Boar, and
fee him down lortiy upon, the Side or Gunnel of
the Canoe, with his Feet in the in/ide of it, and then
lifted him quite in, and fee him ciofe to his Fa-
ther, and prtfently fleppina: out again, launch'*!
the Boat oif, and paddled it aloug the Shore fafter
than I could walk, though the Wind blew pretty
hard too; fo he brought them both faf'e into our
Creek, and leaving them in the Boat, runs awav
to fetch the other Canoe. As he pafs'd me, I
fpoke 10 him, and ask'd him, whether he went,
he told me, Go fetch more Beat ; fo away he wenc
like the Wind; for fure never Man or Horfe rim
like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek
almoft as foon as I got to by Land; fo he wafted
me over, and then went to help our new Guefts
out of the Boat, which he did : but they were nei-
ther of them able to walk ; fo that poor Friday
knew not what to do.
To remedy this I went to work in my Thought,
and calling to Friday to bid them iic down on the
Bank while he came to me, I foon made a Kind
of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I
can-y'd^bcm up both together upon it between us ;
But when we had got them to the Outfideof our
Wall or Fortification, we were at a worfe Lofs than
before; for it was impoffible to get them over, and
I was refolv'd not to break it-down : So I fet to
Work again,.and Friday and I, in about two Hours
Time, made a very handfom Tent, cover'd with
old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees,
being in the Space without our outward Fence,
and between that and the Grove of young Wood
which I had planted : And here w? made them two
Beds of fuch Things as I had, (viz,.) of good Rice-
Straw,
Straw, with Blankets laid upon it, to lie on, and
janother to cover them on each Bed.
My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought my
felf very rich in Subjefts; and it was a merry Re-
fleftion which I frequently made, How like a King
I look'd. Firft of all, the whole Country was my
own mere Property ; fo that I had an undoubted
Right of Dominion. Secondly, My People were
perfectly fubje&ed: I was abfolute Lord and Law-
giver; they all ow'd their Lives tome, and were
ready to lay down their Lives (if there had been
Occafionofit) for melt was remarkable too, we
had but three Subjefts, and they were of three
different Religions. My Man Friday was a Proteft-
ant, his Father was a Pagan and a Cannibal^ and
the Spaniard was a Papift: However, I allowed Li-
berty of Conference throughout my Dominions :
But this is by the Way.
As foon I had fecur'd my two weak refcued
Prifoners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to
reft them upon, I began to think of making fome
Provifionfrom them: And the. firft Thing I did, I
order'd Friday to take a"yearling Goat, betwixt a
Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, to
be kill'd, when I cut off' the hinder Quarter, and
chopping it into fmall Pieces, 1 fat Friday to work
to boiling and dewing, and made them a very
goodie, Iaflure yon," of Flefli and Btoth, ha-
ving put fome Barley and Rice alfo into-the
Broth ; and as I cbok'd it without Doors, (fori
made no Fire within my inner Wall) fo I carry*d
it all into the new Tent; and having fat a Table
there for them, 1 fat down and eat my own Din-
ner alfo with them, and, as well as I could, chear'd
theixi and encourag'd them; Friday being my Inter-
nerrcr efpedallv to his Father, ar.d indeed to the
* ' * ' Spa-
Spaniard too; for the Spaniard fpoke the Language
of the Savages pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather flipped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the Canoes, and go and
fetch our Muskets and other Fire-Arms, which for
Want of Time we had left upon the Place -of Battle;
and the next Day I ordcr'd him to go aad bury
the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open ro
the Sun. and would prefently be offenfive; and I
alfo order'd him to bury the horrid Remains of
their barbarous Feaft, which I knew were pretty
much, and which I could not think of doing my
felf; pay, I could not bear to fee them, if I went
that Way; Ail which he punctually perform'd,.and
defac'd the very Appearance of the Savages being
there ; fo that when I went again, I could fcarce
known where it was, otherwife than by the Corner
of the Wood pointing to the Place.
I then began to enter into a little Converfation
with my two new Subjects ; and firft, I fat Friday
to enquire of his Father, what he thought of the
Efcape of the Savages in that Canoe,and whether we
might exped a Return of them with a Power too
great for us to refill. His fir ft Opinion was, that the
Savages in the Boat never could live out the Storm
which blew that Night they went oft-; but muft of
Neceffity be drown'd or driven South to thofe other
Shores, where they were as fure to be devour'd as
they were to be drown'd if they were caft away ;
but as to what they would do if they came fafe on
Shore, he fa id he knew not; but it was his Opini-
on that they were fo dreadfully frighted with the
Manner of their being attacked, the Noife and the
Fire, that he belicv'd they would tell their People
they were all kiii'd by Thunder and Lightning, not
by th-e Hand'of Man, and that the two which
appear'd, (viz,.) Friday and me, were two heavenly
Spirits
Spirits or Furies, come down to deftroy them and
not Men with Weapons This he faid he knew,
t>ecaufc he heard them all cry out in their Lan-
guage to one another ; for it wasimpoffible to them
to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and fpeak
Thunder, and kill at a diftanee without lifting up
the Hand, as was done now : And this old Savage
was in the right; for, as I underflood fince by
others Hands, theS ivages never attempred to go o-
ver to the Ifland afterwards; they were fo terrified
with the Accounts given by thofe four Men* (for it
Teems they didefcape thje Sea.) that they believed
whoever went to that enchanted Ifland would be
deftroy'd with Fire from the Gods-
This however I knew not, and therefore was un-
der continual Apprehenfior.s for a good while* and
kept always upon my Guard, we and all my Army;
for as we were now four of us, I would have ven-
tured upon a hundred of them fairly in the open
Field at any Time.
In a little Time, however, no more Canoes ap-
pearing, the Fear of their Coming wore eff, and
I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage
to the Main into Coniideration, being likewife af-
filed by Friday's Father, that I might depend upon
good Ufage from their Nation on his Account, if
1 would go.
But my Thoughts were a little fufpended, when
1 had a ferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and
when I underftood that there were iixteen more
of his Countrymen and Portuguefe> who having
been caft away, and made their Efcape to that
Side liv'd there at Peace indeed with the Sava-
ges, but were very fore 'put to it for Neceflaries,
and indeed for Life : 1 ask'd him all the Par-
ticulars of their Voyage, and found they were
a Spanijb Ship bound from the Rio de la Plata
fo the Havana, being dire&ed to leave their Load-
ing there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, an4
to bring back what European Goods they Could
meet with there; that they had five PortuguefeSea-
men on Board, whom they took out of anothec
Wreck ; that five of their own Men were drowned
when the firft Ship was loft, and thatthefeefcaped
thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards, and arrived al-
rtioft ftarv'd on the CannibalCoaft, where they ex-
pefted to have been devoured every Moment.
He told me, they had fome Arms with them,1
but they were perfectly ufelefs, for that they had
neither Powder or Ball, the Wafting of the Sea
having fpoil'd all their Powder, but a little, which
they ufed at their firft Landing to provide them-
felves fome Food.
I ask'd him what he thought would becoftie of
them there, and if they had form'd no Defign of
making any Efcape? He faid, They had many
Confutations about it, but that having neither
Veflel, or Tools to build one, or Provifions of any
Kind, their Counlels always ended in Tears and
Defpair.
I ask'd him how he thought they would receive
a Propofal from me, which might tend towards an
Efcape : And whether, if they were all here, it
might not be done ? I told him with Freedom, I
fear'dmoftly their Treachery and ill Ufage of me,
if I put my Life in their Hands; for that Gratitude
was no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man ; nor
did Men always fqitare their Dealings by the Obli-
gations they had received, fo much as they did
by the Advantages they expected. I told him, it
would be very hard, that I fhould be the Inftrumem:
of their Deliverance, and that they fhould after-
wards make me their Prifoner in New-Spainiwhspz
an EvgUfb^M&n vvas certain to be made a Sacri-
U ficc,
fice, What Neceflity, or what Accident foevet
brought him thither: And that I had rather be de^
liver d up to the Savages, and be devoured alive,
than fall into the mercilefs Claws of thePriefts,and
be carry'd into the Inquifition. I added, That o-*
therwife I was perfuaded, if they were all here,
we might, with fo many Hands build a Bark large
enough to carry, us all away, either to the Brafils
Southward, or to the Illands or SpanijJo Coaft
Northward : But that if in Requital they fliould,
when I had put Weapons into their Hands, carry
me by Force among their own People, I might be
ill ufed for my Kindnefs to them, and make my
Cafe worfe than it was before.
He anfwcr'd with a great deal of Candour and
Ingenuity, That their Condition was fo miferable,
and they were fo fenfiblc of it, that he believed
they would abhor the Thought of ufing any Man
unkindly that (hould contribute to their Delive-
rance •> and that, if I pleafed, he would go to them
with the old Man, and difcourfe with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their Anfwer:
That he would make Conditions with them upon
their folemn Oath, That they fliould be abfolute-
ly under my Leading, as their Commander and
Captain ; and that they fliould fwear upon the her
ly Sacraments and the Gofpel, to be true to me,
and to go to fuch Chriftian Country as that I
Ihould agree to, and no other; and to be direfted
wholly and abfolutely by my Orders, till they
were landed fafely in fuch Country as I intended;
and that he would bring a Con trad from them un-
der their Hands for that Purpofe.
Then he told me he would firft fwear to me
himfelf, That he would never ftir from me as long
as he liv'd, till I gave him Orders; and that he
would take my Side to the laft Drop of his Blood,
'if
If there fhould happen the leaft Breach of Faith a-
mon'g his Countrymen.
He told me,.they were all of them very civil
honeft Men, and they were under the greateft Di-
ftrcfs imaginable, having neither Weapons or
Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Di-
fcredon of the Savages ; out of all Hopes of ever
returning to thir own Country ; and that he was
furfe, if I would undertake their Relief, they would
live ,and die by me.
Uponthefe Aflfurances, I refolv'd to venture to
relieve them, if poffible, and to fend the old Savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat: But when
we had gotten all Things in a Readinefs to go, the
Spaniard himfelf ftarted an Obje&ion, which had
fo much Prudence in it on one Hand, and fo much
Sincerity on the other Hand, that I could not but
be very well fatisfy'd in it; and, by his Advice,
put off the Deliverance of his Comrades for at leaft
half a Year. The Cafe was thus :
He had been with us now about a Month; du-
ring which Time, I had let him fee in what Man-
ner I had provided, with the Affiftance of Provi-
dence, for my Support; and he faw evidently what
Stock of Com and Ricel had laid up; which, as
it was more than fufficient for myfeif, fo it was
not fufficient, at leaft without good Husbandry,
for my Family, now it was encreas'd to Number
four : But much lefs would it be fufficient, if
his Countrymen, who were, as he faid, fourteen
fliil alive, fiiould come over. And leaft of all
would it be fufficient to viftual our Veflel, if we
fhould build one, for a Voyage to any of the Chri-
ftian Colonies of America. So he told me, he thought
it would be more advifable, to let him and the
two other dig and cultivate fome more Land, as
touch as I could fpare Seed to fow; and that we
U z fhou-ld
{hould wait another Harveft, that we might have
a Supply of Corn for his Countrymen when they
fliould come ; for Want might be a Temptation to
them to difagree, or not to think themfelves deli-
vered, otherwife than out of one Difficulty into a-
norher. You know, fays he, the Children of If-
raely though they rejoye'd at firft for their being
deliver'd out of Egypt, yet rebelled even againit
God himfelf that deliver'd them, when they came
to want Bread in the Wildernefs.
His Caution was fo feafonable, and his Advice
fo good, that I could not but be very well pleafed
with his Propofal, as well as I was fatisfy'd with
his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us,
as well as the wooden Tools we were fnrnifh'd
with permitted; and in about a Month's Time, by
the End of which it was Seed-time, we had got-
ten as much Land cur'd and trimmed up, as we
fowed 22 Bufliels of Barley on, and 16 Jarrs of
Rice; which was, in fhort, all the Seed we had
to fpare; nor indeed did we leave our felves Bar-
ley fufftcient for our own Food, for the fix Months
that.^e had to expeft our Crop, that is to fay,
reckoning from the Time we fet our Seed afide for
lowing; for it is not to be fuppofed it is fix
Months in the Ground in the Country.
Having now Society enough, and our Number
being fufficient t6 put us out of Fear of the Sa-
vages, if they had come, unlefs their Number had
been very great, we went freely all over the Ifland,
where-ever we found Occafion; and as here we had
our Efcape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it
was impoffible, at hafl for me, to have the Means
of it out of mine; to this Purpofe, I mark'd out
feveral Trees which I thought fit for our Work,
and I fet Friday and his Father to cutting them
down; and then I caufed the Spaniard, to whom
I im-
I imparted my Thoughts on that Affair, to o-
verfee and direft their Work. I fhew'd them
with what indefatigable Pains I had hew'd a
large Tree into fingle Planks, and I caufed them
to do the like, 'till they had made about a Dozen
large Planks of good Oak, near two Foot broad,
thirty five Foot long, and from two Inches to four
Inches thick: What prodigious Labour it took up,
any one may imagine.
At the fame Time I contrived to increafe my lit-
tle Flock of tame Goats as much as I could; and
to this Purpofe, I made Friday and the Spaniard go
out one Day, and myfelf with Friday the next
Day, for we took our Turns; and by this Means
we got above 20 young Kids to breed up with the
reft ; for whenever we fhot the Dam, we faved
the Kids, and added them to our Flock : But a~
bovc all, the Seafon for curing the Grapes coming
on, I caufed fuch a prodigious Quantity to be
hung up in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at
Alicant, where the Raifins of the Sun are cur'd, we
could have fill'd fixty or eighty Barrels; and thefe,
with our Bread, was a great Part of our Food,
and very good living to, I affure you ; for it is an
exceeding nourifhing Food.
It was now Harveft, and our Crop in good
Order; it was not the moft plentiful Increafe I had
feen in the Ifland, but, however, it was enough to
anfwerourEnd ; for from our 22 Bufliels of Bar-
ley, we brought in and thrafhed out above 220
Bufhels, and the like in Proportion of the Rice,
which was Store enough for our Food to the next
Harveft, tho' all the 16 Spaniards had been on
Shore with me; or if we had been ready for a
Voyage, it would have very plentifully have victu-
alled 01: r Ship, to have carry'd us to any Part of the
World, that is to fay, of America.
U 3 When
When we had ttes hous'd and fccur'd our Ma<*
gamine of Com, we fell to work to make more
Wicker Work, viz,, great Baskets in which we kept
it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this Part, and often bUm'd me that I did not
make fome Things for Defence, of this Kind of
Work ; but I /aw no Need of it, '
And now having a full Supply of Food for all
the Guefts I expedted, I gave the Spaniard Leave
to go over to the Main, to fee what he could do
with thofe he had left behind him there.-* I gave
him a ftrid Charge in Writing, not to bring; any
Man with him, who would not firil fwear-in $he
Prefence of himfelf and of the old Savage, That
he would no Way injure, fight with, or attack the
yerfon he fhould find in the Ifland, who was fa
kind to fend for them in order to their Deliver
ranee; but that they would ftand by and defend
him againft all fuch Attempts, and where ever
they went, would be entirely under and fubje&ed
to his Commands ; and that this fhould be put in
Writing, and fign'd with their Hands : FJow we
were to have this done, when 1 knew they had
neither Pen or Ink, that, indeed, was a Queftion
which we never ask'd.
Under thefe Inftru&ions, the Spaniard^ and the
old Savage (the Father of Friday) went away in one
of the Canoes, which they might be faid to come,
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
Prifoncrs to be devoured by the Savages. /
I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock
on it, and about eight Charges of Powder and
Ball, charging them to be very good Husbands of
both, and not to ufe either of them but upon ur--
gent Occafion. .-.« .
This was a chcaful Work, being the firft Mea-
(ures ufed by mc in View of my Deliverance foj;
w how.
flow 27 Years and fome Days. I gave them Pro-
vfions of Bread, and of dry Grapes, fufficient for
themfelves for many Days, and fufficient for all
their Countrymen for about eight Days Time; and
wifliing them a good Voyage, I fee them go, a-
greeing with them about a Signal they fhould hang
out at their Return, by which I fhould know them
again, when they came back, at a Diftance, before
they came on Shore.
They went away with a fair Gale on the Day
that the Moon was at Full; by mj> Account in the
Month oi October 1 but as for an exa<5t Reckoning
of Days, after I had once loll it, I could never re-
cover it again ; nor had I kept even the Number
of Years fo pun&ually, as to be fure that I was right,
tho', as it prov'd,whenI afterwards examin'd my Ac-
count, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years.
It was no lefs than eight Days I had waited for
them, when a ftrange and unforefeen Accident in-
tervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in Hiftory. I was fait afleep in my Hutch
one Morning, when my Man Friday came running
in to me, and calfd aloud, Maflcr, Matter, they
are come, they are come.
I jurnp'd up, and, rcgardlefs of Danger, I went
out as foon 4s I could get my Cloaths on, thro'
my little Grove, which (by the Way) was by this
Time growp to be a very thick Wood : I fay, rc-
gardlefs of Danger, I went without my Arms,
which was not my Cuftom to do ; but I was fur-
priz'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I pre-
sently faw a Boat at about a League and a half's De-
fiance, Handing in for the Shore, with a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail, as they call it, and the Wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in ; alfo I obferv'd
prefent'y, that they did not come from that Side
which the Shoje lay on, but from the Souther-
U 4 moft
moftEnd of the Ifland: Upon this, I call'd Friday
in, and bid him lie clofe, for thefe were not the
People welook'dfor, and that we might not know
yet whether they were Friends or Enemies.
In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Per-
fpe&ive Glafs, to fee what I could make of them 5
and having taken the Ladder out, I ^lftnb'd up to
the Top of the Hill, as I ufed to do when I was
apprehenfive of any thing, and to take my View
the plainer, without being difcover'd.
I had fcarce fet my Foot on the Hill, when my
Eye plainly difcover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor,
at about two Leagues and a half's Diflance from
me South-South-Eaft, but not above a League and
4n half from the Shore. By my Obfervation, it
appeared plainly to be an Englifh Ship, and the
Boat appear'd to be an Englijlo Long-Boat.
I cannot exprefs the Contuiion I was in, tho' the
Joy of feeing a Ship, and one who I had Reafon
to believe, was mann'd by my own Countrymen,
and confequently Friends, was fuch as I cannot
defcribe; but yet I had fome fecret Doubts hung
about me, 1 cannot tell from whence they came,
bidding me keep upon my Guard. In the firft Place,
it occur'd to me to confider what Bufinefs an En-
glijh Ship could have in that Part of the World,
fince it was not the Way to or from any Part of
the World where the Englifb had any Traffick ; and
I knew there had been no Storms to drive them
in there, as in Diftrefs ; and that if they were En~
£lifh really, it was moft probable that they were
Jisre upon no good Defign; and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the Hands of
Thieves and Murderers.
Let no Man defpife the fecret Hints and Notices
of Danger which fometimes are given him,
when he may think there is no Polfibility of its
being
being real That fuch Hints and Notices are given,
us, 1 believe few that have made any Obfervations
of Things can deny; that they are certain Dif*
coveries of an invifible World, and a Converfeof
Spirits, we cannot doubt,• and if the Tendency
of them Teems to be to warm us of Danger, why
ftiould we not fuppofe they are from fome friendly
Agent, whether fupreme, or inferior and fubordi-
nate, is not the Queftion ; and that they are given
for our Good ?
The prefent Queftion abundantly confirm me in
the Juftice of this Reafoning, for had I not been
made cautious by this fecret Admonition, come it
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably,
and in a far worfe Condition than before, as you
will fee prefently.
I had not kept myfelf long in this Pofture, but
Ifaw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they
look'd for a Creek to thruft in at for the Conveni-
ence of Landing: However, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not fee the little Inlet
where I formerly landed my Rafts, but ran their
Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a
Mile fromme3 which was very happy for me,* for
otherwife, they would have landed juft (as I may-
fay) at my Door, and would foon have beaten one
out of my Caftle, and perhaps have plundered me
of all I had.
When they were on Shore, I was fully fatisfy'4
that they were Englijh Men, at leaft. moft of them
one or two I thought were Dutch ; but it did not
prove fo : There were in all eleven Men, whereof
three of them I found were unarmed, and, as I
thought, bound ; and when the firft four or five of
them were jump'd on Shore, they took thofe three
out of the Boat as Prifpners: One of the three I
could perceiveuiing the moft paffionate Geftures^f
Entreaty*
Intttaty, Aflliaioq and Defpair, even to a kind of
Extravagance; the other two, I could perceive*
lifted up their Hands fometimes, and appeared con-
cerned indeed, but not to fuch a Degree as the
I was perfe&ly confounded at the Sight, and
knew not' what the Meaning pf it fliould be. Fri-
day call'd out to me in Englijh, as well as he could,
O Mafieir! Tou fee Englifh Mans eat Prifoner as well
m Savage 'Mans. Why, fays I, Friday, do you
think they are a going to eat them then? Yes, fays
Friday^ T^hey will eat them \ No, no, fays I, Friday,
I'arn afraid they will murder them, indeed, but
you may befurethey will not eat them.
All this while I had no Thought of what the
Matter really was ; bu/ftood trembling with the?
Horror of the Sight, expedting every Moment when
the three Prifonei's fho.ild be kill'd; nay, oncelfaw
one of the Vidians lift up his Arm with a great Cut-
Ufti, (as the Seamen call it) or Sword, to ftrikeone
of the poor Men; ind I expefted to7fee him fall
every Montent,- at which all the Blood in my Body
feemfd to run chill in my Veins.
I wifli'd heartily now for' my Spaniard, and the
Savage thkt was gone with him i br that I had i~
ny Way to have come undifcover'd within Shot of
them, that I might 'have refcuM the three Men;
for 1 faw no Fire-Arms they had among them 5 but
It fell out to my Mind another Way.!1
After I had obferv'd the outragious Ufageof the
three Men Jlf by the infolent Seamen, I obferv'd the
Fellows run fcattering about the Land, as if they
wanted to fee the Country: I obferv'd that- the
three other Men had Liberty to go alfo where they
pteasM; but they fat' down all three upon the
Ground very pendve, and look'd like Men m
Defpair. „ .
1 Tms
This put me in Mind of the firft Time when J
came on Shore, and began to look about me ; ho#
I gave myfelf over for loft, how wildly 1 iook'd
round me, what dreadful Apprehenfions 1 had, and
how I lodg'd in the Tree ail Night for fear of be-
ing devoured by wild Beafts.
As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I
was to receive by the providential Driving of the
Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by
which I have fince been folong nourifli'd and fup-
ported ; fo thefe three poor defolate Men knew no-
thing how certain of Deliverance, and Supply they
were, how near it was to them, and how effectu-
ally and ready they were in a Condition of Safety,
at the fame Time they thought themfelves loft, and
their Cafe defperate.
So little do we fee before us in the World, and
fomuch Reafori have we to depend chearfully upon
the great Maker of the World, that he does not
leave his Creatures fo abfolutely deftitute, but that
In the worft Circumftances they have alwaysfome-
thing to be thankful for, andfometimes arc nearer
their Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even
brought to their Deliverance by the Means by
which they feem to be brought to their Deftru-
ftion.' ;  v  •.
It was juftatthe Top of High- Water when thefe
People cagie on Shore, and while partly they flood
parly ing with the Prifoners they brought, and part-
ly while they rambled about to fee what kind of a
Place they were in, they had carclcfly (laid till they
Tide was fpent, and the Water-was ebb'd confide-
rably away, leaving their Boat a-ground.
They had left two Men in t,he Boat, who as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
Ijrandy, fell a~flecp; however, one of ihctn waking
(boner than the other, and.finding the Boat too faft
.:..;:...... . . a.-gtound
a-ground for him to ftir it, hollow'd for the reft who
were ftraggling about, upon which they all foon
came to the Boat* but it was paft all their Strength
to launch her, thd Boat beiag very heavy, and the
Shore on that Side being a foft ouzy Sand, almoft
like a Quick-Sand.
In this Condition, like true Seamen, who are,
perhaps the leaft of all Mankind given to Fore-
thought, they gave it over, and away they ftroll'd
about the Country again ,* and I heard one of them
fay aloud to another, calling them off from the
Boat, Why, let her alone, Jack, cant ye, foe will float
next l*ide; by which I was fully confirm'd in the
main Enquiry, of what Countrymen they were.
Ail this while I kept myfelf very clofe, not once
daring to ftir out of my Caftle, any farther than to
my Place of Obfervation near the Top of the Hill;
and very glad I was, to think how well it was for-
tify *d : I knew it was no lefs than ten Hours before
the Boat could be on float again, and by that
Time it would be dark, and I might be at more
Libery to fee their Motions, and to hear their Dif-
courfe, if they had any.
In the mean time, 1 fitted myfelf up for a Bat-
tel, as before, tho'with more Caution, knowing
I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I
had at firft. I order'd Friday alfo, who 1 had made
an excellent Markfman with his Gun, to load him-
felf with Arms: I took myfelf two Fowling-Pieces,
and I gave him three Muskets ; my Figure indeed
was very fierce; and I had my formidable Goat-
Skin Cap on, with the great Cap I have mentioned,
a naked Sword by my Side, two Piftols in my Belt,
and a Gun upon each Shoulder.
It was my Defign, as I faid above, not to have
made any Attempt till it was dark : But about
two a Clock, being the Heat of the Day, I found
that
that in fliort they were all gone ftraggling into the
Woods, and, as I thought, were laid down to fleep.
The three poor diflrefled Men, too anxious for
their Condition to get any Sleep, we% however,
fet down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at zr
bout a quarter of a Mile from me, and, as I thought,
out of Sight of any of the reft.
Upon this I refolv'd to difcovet myfelf to them,
and learn fomething of their Condition : Immedi-
ately I march'd in the Figure, as above, my Man
Friday at a good Diftance behind me, as formi-
dable for his Arms as I, but not making quite fo
ftaring a SpeBre-Uke Figure as I did.
I came as near them undifcover'd as I could, and
then before any of them faw me, I call'd aloud to
them in Spanifh, What are ye Gentlemen ?
They ftarted up at the Noife, but were ten
times more confounded when they faw me, and
the uncouth Figure that I made. They made no
Anfwer at all; but I thought I perceiv'd them juft
going to fly from me, when I fpoke to them in
Englifo : Gentlemen, faid I, do not be furpriVd at
me; perhaps you may have a Friend near you
when you did not exped: it. He muft be fent di-
re&ly from Heaven then, faid one of them very
gravely to me, and pulling off his Hat at the fame "Time
to me, for our Condition is paft the Help of Man.
All Help is from Heaven, Sir, faid I But can
you put a Stranger in the Way how to help you,
tor you feem to me to be in fome great Diftrefs ?
1 faw you when you landed, and when you feem'd
to make Application to the Brutes that came with
you, 1 faw one of them lift up his Sword to kill
you.
The poor Man, with Tears running down his
Face, and trembling, looking like one aftonifh'd,
rcturn'd, Am I talking to God> or Man! Is it a real
Man
' "».
Man or an Angel \ Be in no feat about that, &*r<
jfed /, if God had fent an Angel to relieve you, he
would have come better cloath'd, and arm'd after
another Manner than you fee me in ; pray lay afide
your Fears, I am a Man, an Englifb Man, and dif-
•posM toaflift you, you fee* 1 have one Servant
only; we have Arms and Ammunition; tell us
freely, Can we ferve you ? -What is your
Cafes
Our Cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our Murderers are fo near; but, in fhort,
Sir* I was Commander of that Ship, my Men
have mutiny'd againft me; they have been hard-
ly prevailed on not to murder me, and at laft
havefet me bn Shore in this defolate Place, with
thefe two Men with me, one my Mate, the other
a Paflengeir, where we expefted to perifh, believ-
ing the Place to be uninhabited* and know not yet
what to think of it.
Where are thofe Brutes, your Enemies, faid I,
do you know where they are gone ? There they lye
Sir, faid he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees, my
Heart trembles Jqt fear they have feen us, and heard
you fpeak; if they have, they will certainly murder us
all
Have they any Fire-Arms, faid I, Heanfwer'd,
they had only two Pieces, and one which they
left in the Boat* Well then, faid I3 leave the rell
to me j I fee they are all afleep, it is an eafy
thing to kill them all ; but fhall we rather take
them Prifoners? He told me, there were two def-
pcrate Villains among them that it was fcarcG
fafeto fliew any Mercy to ; but if they were fe-
cur'd,, he believ'd all the reft would return to
their Duty. I ask'd him, which they v^ere ? He
told me, he could not at that Diftance defcribe
them ; but he would obey my Orders in any thing
I would
t 1°} ]
I would dired; Well, fays I, let us retreat out of
their View or Hearing, leaft they awake, and we
will refolve farther ; To they willingly went back
with me, till the Woods cover'd us from them.
Look you, Sir, faid I, if I venture upon your
Deliverance, are you willing to make two Condi-
tions with me; he anticipated my Propofals, by
telling me, that both he and the Ship, itrecover'd,
ftould be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thingjN^nd if the Ship was not recovered
he would live and die with me in what Part of the
World foever I would fend him i and the two other
Men faid the fame.
tVeUy fays I, my Conditions are but two. i. That
while you flay on this Ifland with me, you will not
pretend to any Authority here; and if I put Arms
into your Hands, you will upon all Occaf jons give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine,
upon this Ifland, and in the mean time be governed,
by my Orders.
2. That if the Ship is, or may be recovered,
you wrill carry me and my Man to England Paf-
fage-free.
He gave me all the Affurances that the Invention
and Faithof Man could devife, that he would com-
ply with thefe moft reafonable Demands^ and be-
sides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all Occfiaons as long as he liv'd.
Well then, faid Iy here are three Muskets for
you, with Powder and Ball* tell me next what you
think is proper to be done. He fhew'd all the
Teftimony of his Gartitude that he was able ;
but effer'd to be wholly guided by me. I told him>
I thought it was hard venturing any Thing,- but
the beft Method I could think of was to fire upon
them at once, as they lay; and if any was not
kiU'd at the firft Volley, and offered to fiibmit,
we>
We might fave them, and fo put it wholly upon
God's Providence to direft the Shot.
He faid very modeftly, That he was loath to
kill them, if he could help it; but that thofe two
Were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Au-
thors of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they
efcaped, wefhould be undone ftill; for they would
go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Com-
pany, and deftroyusalL WeUthm> fays I, Ne-
cetiity legitimates my Advice; for it is the only
Way to fave our Lives. However, feeing him ftill
cautious of (hedding Blood, I told him they fhould
go themfelves, and manage as they found con-
venient.
In the Middle of this Difcourfe, we heard fome
of them awake, and foon after we faw two of
them on their Feet. I ask'd him, if either of
them were the Men who he had faid were the
Heads of the Mutiny ? He faid, No': Well then,
faid I, you may let them efcape, and Providence
feems to have waken'd them on Purpofe to fave
themfelves. Now, fays I, if the reft efcape you,
it is your Fault.
Animated with this, he took the Musket I had
given him in his Hand, and a Piftol in his Belt*
and his two Comrades with him, with each Man
a Piece in his Hand, The two Men who were
with him going firft, made fome Noife, at which
one of the Seamen, who was awake, turn'd a-
bout, and feeing them coming, cry'd out to the
reft; but it was too late then ; for the Moment
he cry'd out, they fir'd ; I mean the two  Men, the
the Captain wifely refervinghis own Piece : They
had fo well aim'd their Shot at the Men they knew,
that one of them was kill'd on the Spot, and the
other very much wounded ; but not being dead, he
flatted up upon his Feet, and cail'd eagerly for
Help,
help to the other; but the Captain flepping to him,'
told him, 'twas to late to cry for help, hefhould
call upon God to forgive his Villany, and with that
Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his
Musket, fo that he never Spoke more : There were
three more in the Company, and one of them was
alfo (lightly wounded : By this Time I was come,
and when they faw their Danger, and that it was
in vain to refill, they begg'dfor Mercy: The Cap-
tain told them he would fpar? their Lives, if they
would give him any Affurance of their Abhorence
of the Treachery they had been guilty of,and would
fwear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship,
add afterwards m carrying her back to Jamaica,
from whence they came : They gave him all the
Proteftations of their Sincerity that could be defir'd,
and he was willing to believe them, andfpare their
Lives, which I was not againft ; only I oblig'd him
to-keep them bound Hand and Foot while they
were upon the lfland ^
While this was doing, I lent Friday with the
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to fecure
her, and bring away the Oars, and Sail, which
they did; and by and by, three {haggling Men that
were (happily for them) parted from the reft, came
back upon hearing the Guns fir'd, and feeing their
Captain, who before was their Prifoner, now their
Conqueror, they (ubmitted to be bound alfo; and
fo our Victory was compleat.
It now remained, that the Captain and I fhould
enquire into one another's Circumftances : I began
fuffc, and told him my whole Hiflory, which he
heard with an Attention even to Amazement,- and
particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being
furnith'd with Prcvilions and Ammunition; and
indeed, as my Story is a whole Colleftion of Won-
ders, ic affe&ed him deeply ; but when he reflected
: - X from
from thence upon himfelf, and how I feem'd to
have been prefeiVd there, on purpofe to fave his
Life, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could
notfpeak a Word more.
After this Communication was at an End, I car-
ry'd him and his two Men into my Apartment, lead-
ing them in, juft where I came ,out, viz,, at the
;Top of the Houfe, where I refrefli'd them with
flich Provifions as I had, and fhow'd them all the
Contrivances I Jiad made, duriag my long, long*
inhabiting that Place.
All I fhew'd them,, all I faid to them, was per-
fectly amazing; but above all, the Captain admir'd
iny Fortification, and how perfectly I hadconceafd
my Retreat with a Grove.of Trees, which having
been nowplanted near twenty Years, and the Trees
growing much fafter than in England, was become
a little Woody and fo thick, that it was unpaflable
inany^art of it, but at that one Side, where I
had referv'd my little winding Paflage into it: I
told him, this was my Caftle and my Refidence ;
but that I had a Seat in the Country, as moft Prin-
ces have, whither 1 could retreat upon Occafio'n,
and I would fliew him that too another Time -y
but at prefent, our Bufinefs was to confider how
to recover the Ship : He agreed with me as to that;
but told me> he was perfe&ly at Lofs what Mea-
sures to take; for that there were ftill'fix and twenty
Hands on board, who having entred into a curfed
Confpiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by
Defperation ; and would carry it on, knowingthat
if they were reduc'd, they fhould be brought to the
Gallows, as foon as they came to England, or to
any of the EngUJh Colonies; and that therefore
there would be no attacking them with fo fmall a
Number as we were,
I mus'd
I mus'd feribme Time upon what he had faid>
and found it was a very rational Conclusion,• and
that therefore fomething was to be refolv'd on ve-
ry fpeedily, as well to draw the Men on board in-
to fome Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their
Landing upon us, and deftroying us; upon this it
prefently occurr'd to me, that in a little while the
Ship's Crew wondring what was become of their
Comrades, and of the Boat, would certainly cOtfie
on Shore in their other Boat, to fee for them, and
that then perhaps they might come arm'd, and be
too ftrong for us; this he allowed was rational.
Upon this, I told him the firft thing we had td
do, was to ftave the Boat, which lay upon the
Beach, fo that they might not carry her off; and
taking every Thing out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs
as not to befit to fwim, accordingly we went on
board, took the Arms which were left on board,
out of her, and whatever elfe we found ttee,
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of
Rum, a few Bisket Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and
a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas; the
Sugar was five or fix Pounds; all which was ve-
ry welcome to me, efpecially the Brandy and
Sugar, of which I had had none left for many
Years-.
When we had carry'd all thefe Things on Shore
(the Oats;.Mail, Sail, and Rudder of the Boat,
were carry'd away before, as above) we knocked a
great Hok in her Bottom, that if they had come
ftrong enough to mailer us, yet they could not tar-
ry off the Boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that
we could be able to recover the Ship; but my View
was chat if they went away without the Boat, I
did not much q-treftion to make her fit again,to carry
tts away to the Leeward Iflands, and call upon our
i X 2 Friends
Friends, the Spaniards, in my way, fori had them
ftill in my Thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our Defigns, and
had firft, by main Strength, heav'd the Boat up up-
on the Beach, fo high that the Tide would not
fleet her of at High-Water-Mark; and befides,
had broke a hole in her Bottom, too big to be
quickly flopped, and were fat down mufing what
we fhould do ; we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and
faw her make a Waft with her Antient, as a Signal
for the Boat to come on Board; but no Boat ftir'd ;
and they fir'd feveral times, making other Signals
for the Boat.
At laft, when all their Signals and Firingsprov'd
fruitlefs, and they found the Boat did not flir, we
faw them by the help of my Glaffcs, hoift another
Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and we
found as they approached, that there was no lefs
than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire-Arms
with them.
As the Ship lay almoft two Leagues from the
Shore, we had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain fight of the Men, even of their Faces,
becaufe the Tide having fet them a little tp the Eafl
of the other Boat, they row'd up under Shore, to
come to the fame Place, where the other had land-
ed, and where the Boat lay.
By this means, I fay, we had a fulffiew of them,
and the Captain knew the Perfons and Charafters
of all the Men in the Boat, of whom he faid, that
there were three very honeft Fellows, who he was
fure were led into this Confpiracy by the reft, being
over-power'd and frighted.
But that as for the Boatfwain, who it feems was
the chief Officer among them, and all the reft, they
wereas outragious as any of the Ship's Crew, and
• were no doubt made defperate in their new Enter-
1309 1
prize, and terribly apprehenfive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I fmil'd at him, and told him, that Men in our
Circumftances were paft the Operation of Fear :
That feeing almoft every Condition that could be
was better than that which we were fuppos'd to
be in, we ought to expeft that the Confequence,
whether Death or Life, would be fure to be a De-
liverance : I ask'd him, What he thought of the
Circumftances of my Life? And, whether a Deli-
verance were not worth venturing for ? And where,
Sir, faid 1, is your Belief of my being preferv d here
on Purpofe to fave your Life, which elevated you
a little while ago ? For my Part, faid I, there feems
to be but one Thing amifs in all the Profpeft of
it; What's that} Says he; why, faid I, 'Tis, that
as you fay, there are three or four honeft Fellows
among them, which ftiould be fpar'd ; had they
been all of the wicked Part of the Crew, I fhould
have thought God's Providence had fingled them
out to deliver them into your Hands; for depend
upon it, every Man of them that comes a-fhore are
our own, and fiiall die, or live, as they behave to us.
As I fpoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful
Countenance, I found it greatly encourag'd .him ;
fo we fet vigoroufly to our Bufinefs: We had, up-
on the firft Appearance of the Boat's coming from
thcShip, confider'd of feparating our Prifoners, and
had indeed fecur'd them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the Captain was left af-
fur'd than ordinary, I fent with- Friday, and one of
the three (delivered Men) to my Cave, where they
were remote enough, and.out of Danger ,o£ being
heard or difcoverM, or of finding their Way out of
the Woods, if they could have delivered themfelves *
Here they left them bound, but gave them Proyifi*
pns, and prom Yd them, if they continuedtherejqni-
X 3 erly,
etly, to give them their Liberty in a Day or two;
but that if they attempted their Efcape, they fhould
be put to Death without Mercy: They promis'd
faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience,
and were very thankful that they had fuch good
Ufage, as to have Provisions, and a Light left them ,•
Soy Friday gave them Candles (fuch as we made our
felves) for their Comfort; and they did not know
but that he flood Sentinel over them at the En-
trance.
The other Prifoners had better Ufage; two of
them were kept pinion'd indeed, becaufe the Cap-
tain was not free to truft them; but the other two
were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Re-
commendation, and upon their folemnly engaging
to live and die with us; fo with them and the three
honeft Men, we were feven !Men, well arm'd ,• and
I made no doubt we ftould be able to deal well e-
nough with the Ten that were a coming, confir
dering that the Captain had faid, there were three
or four honeft Men among them alfo.
As foon as they got to the Place where their o-
ther Boat lay, they run their Boat into the Beach,
and came all on Shore, hailing the Boat up after
them, which I was glad to fee ; for 1 was afraid
they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor,
fome Diftance from the Shore, with fome Hands
in her, to guard her; and fo we fhould not be able
tofeize the Boat.
Being on Shore, the firft thing they did, they
ran all to their other Boat, and it was eafy to fee
that they were under a great Surprize, to find her
ftripp'd as above, of all that was -in her, and a great
Hole in her Bottom,
After they had mus'd a while upon this, they
fet up two or three great Shouts, hollowing with
all. their Might,. to py if they could make -theit
Com-
L}"1
Companions hear; but all was to no Purpofe •: Then
they came all clofe in a Ring, and fir'd a Volley of
their fmall Arms, which indeed we heard, and the.
Echoes made the Woods ring; but it was all one,
thofe in the Cave we were fure could not hear, and
thofe in our keeping, though they heard it well
enough, yet durft give no Anfwer to them.
, They were fo aftonifh'd at the Surprize^of this,
that as they told us afterwards, they refolv'd to go
all on board again to their Ship, and let them know
there, that the Men were all murder'd, and the
Long-Boat fta/d-, accordingly, they immediately
launched their Boat again, and got all of them on
board.
The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the Ship again, and fet Sail> giving their Comrades
for loft, and fo he fhould ftiil lofe the Ship, which
he was in hopes we fhould have recovered ; but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the Boat,
but we perceived them all coming on Shore again ;
but with this new Meafure in their Condud, which
it feems they confulted together upon, viz,. Tq
leave three Men in the Boat, and the reft to go on
Shore, and go up into the Country to look for their
Fellows,
This was a great Difappointmenttous; for now
we were at a Lofs what to do ; for our feizing
thofe feven Men on Shore would be no Advantage
to us, it we let the Boat efcape; becaufe they
would then row away to the Ship, and then the
reft of them would be fure to weigh and fet Sail,
and fo our recovering the Ship would be loft.
However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and
fee what the Iffue of Things might prdent; the
feven Men came on Shore, and the three who re-
X 4 mairui
main'd in the Boat, put her off to a good Di fiance
from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for
them; (o that it was impoffible for us to come at
them in the Boat.
Thofe that came on Shore, kept clofe together,
marching towards the Top of the little Hill, under
which my Habitation lay; and we could fee them
plainly, though they could not perceive us : We
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, fo that we might have fir'd at them,
or that they would have gone farther oft) that we
might have come Abroad.
But when they were come to the Brow of the
Hill, where they could fee a great Way into the
Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the North-
Eaft Part, and where the Ifland lay lowed, they
ftouted, and hollow'd till they were weary ; and
hot caring, it feems, to venture far from the Shore,
nor far from one another, they fat down together
under a Tree, to confider of it: Had they thought
fit to have gone to fleep there, as the other Party
of them had done, they had done the Jobb for us ;
but they were too full cf Apprehensions of Danger,
to venture to go to fieep, tho' they could not tell
what the Danger was they had to fear neither.
The Captain made a very juft Propofal to me,
upon this Confultarion of theirs, viz,. That per-
haps they would all fire a Volley again, to endea-
vour to make their Fellows hear, and that we
fliould all fally upon them, juft at the Jun&ure
when their Pieces were all difcharg'd, and they
would certainly yield, and we fliould have them
without Blood-flied : I lik'd the Propofal, provi-
ded it was done1 while we were near enough to
come up to them, before they could load their Pie-
ces again*
But
But this Event did not happen* and we lay ftill
a long Time, very irrefolute what Courfe to take;
at length I told them, there would be nothing to
be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they
did not return to the Boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the Shore, and fo
might ufe fome Stratagem with them in the Boat
to get them on Shore.
We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing; and were very uneafy, when,
after long Confultations, we faw them (tart all up,
and march down toward the Sea: It Teems they had
fuch dreadful Apprehenfions upon them of the
Danger of the Place, that they refolvM to go on
board the Ship again, give their Companions over
for loft, and fo go on with their intended Voyage
with the Ship.
As foon as I perceiv'd them go towards the Shore,
I imagin'd it to be as really it was, That they had
given over their Search, and were for going back
again ; and the Captain, as foon as I told him my
Thoughts, was ready to fiuk at the Apprehenfions
of it; but I prefently thought of a Stratagem to
fetch them back again, and which anfwer'd my
End to a Tittle.
1 order'd Friday, and the Captain's Mate, to go
over the little Creek Weft ward, towards the Place
where the Savages came on Shore, when Friday was
refcu'd; and as foon as they came to a little rifing
Ground, at about half a MileDiftance, I bad them
hollow, as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the, Seamen heard them; that as foon as ever
they heard the Seamen anfwer them, they fliould
return it again, and then keeping out of Sight, take
a round, always anfwering when the other hollowed,
to draw them as far into the Ifland, and among the
Woods,
Woods, as poffible, ^nd then wheel about again to
me by fuch Ways as I dire&ed them.
They were juft going into the Boat, when Fri-
day and the Mate hollow'd, and they prefently heard
them, and ahfwering, run along the Shore Weft-
ward, towards the Voice they heard, when they
were prefently ftopp'd by the Creek, where the
Water being up, they could not get over, and
call'd for the Boat to come up, and let them over,
as indeed I expefted.
When they had fet themfelves over, I obferv'd,
that the Boat being gone up a good Way into the
Creek, and as it were in a Harbour within the
Land, they took one of the three Men out of her
to go along with them, and left only two in the
Boat, having faftned her to the Stump of a little
Tree on the Shore.
This was what I wifli'd for; and immediately
leaving Friday and the Captain's Mate to their Bu-
finefs, I took the reft with me, and crofting the
Creek out of their Sight, we furpnVd the" two
Men before they were aware > one of them lying on
Shore, and the other being in the Boat*, the Fellow
on Shore was between deeping and waking, and go-
ing to ftart up, the Captain who was foremoll, ran in
upon him,aiid knocked him down, and then call'd out
to him in the Boat to yield, or he was a dead Man.
There needed very few Arguments to perfuade
a fingle Man to yield, when he faw five Men upon
him, and his Comrade knock'd down ,• befkics, this
wasitfeems one of the three who were not fo hear-
ty in the Mutiny as the reft of the Crew, and there-
fore was eafily perfuaded, not only to yield, but
afterwards to join very lincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and che Captain's Mate
fo well managed their Bufinefs with the reft, that
they drew them by hollowing and anfwering, from
one
pne Hill to another ; and from one Wood to ano-
ther, till they not only heartily tir'd them, but left
them, where they were very fore they could not
reach back to the Boat, before it was dark; and in-
deed they were heartily tir'd themfelves alfo by the
Time they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do, but to watch for
them in the dark, and to fall upon then?, fo as to
make fure work with them.
It was feveral Hours after Friday came back to
me, before they came back to their Boat; and we
could hear the foremoft of them long before they
came quite up, calling to thofe behind to come
along, and could alfo hear them anfwer and com-
plain how lame and tir'd they were, and not able
to come any fafter, which was very welcome News
to us. , , *
At length they came up to the Boat; but tis
impoffible to exprefs their Confufion, when they
found the Boat faft a-ground in the Creek, the
Tide ebb'd out, and their two Men gone: We
could hear them call to one another in a mod la-
mentable Manner, telling one another they were
gotten into an inchanted Ifland ; that cither there
were Inhabitants in it, and they fhould all be mur-
der'd, or elfe there were Devils and Spirits in it,
and they fhould all be carry'd away, and devoured.
They hollow'd again, and call a their two Com-
rades by their Names a great many times, but
no Anfwer. After fome time, we could fee
them, by the little Light there was, run about
wringing their Hands like Men in Defpair; and
that iometimes they would go and fet down in the
Boat to reft themfelves, then come a-fhore again.,
and walk about again, and fo the fame thing ove*
again.
Mv
My Men would fain have me give them Leave
to fail upon, them at once in the Dark; but I was
willing to take them at fome Advantage, fo to
fpare them, and kill as few of them as I could;
and efpecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing
any of our own Men, knowing the other were ve-
ry well arm'd. I refolv'd to wait to fee if they
did not feparate; and therefore to make fure of
them, I drew my Ambufcade nearer, and orcer'd
Fnday and the Captain to creep upon their Hands
and Feet as clofe to the Ground as theyv could,
that they might not be difcover'd, and get as^near
them as they could poffibly, before they oflrr'd to
fire.
They had not been long in that Poflure, but that
the Boatfwain, who was the principal Ringleader
of the Mutiny, and had now fliewn himfelf the
moft deje&ed and difpirited of all the reft, came
walking towards them with two more of their
Crew; the Captain was fo eager, as having this
principal Rogue fo much in his Power, that he
could hardly have Patience to let him come fo
near, as to be fure of him j for they only heard
his Tongue before : But when they came nearer,
the Captain and Friday flatting up on their Feet,
let fly at them.
The Boatfwain was kiil'd upon the Spot, the
next Man was (hot into the Body, and fell juft by
him, tho* he did not die till an Hour or two after;
aud the third run for it.
At the Noife of the Fire, I immediately ad-
vanced with my whole Army, which was now 8
Men, viz,. My felf General/ffimo, Friday my Lieu-
tenant-General, the Captain and his two Men, and
the three Prifoners of War, who we had nulled
with Arms.
We
We came upon them indeed in the Dark, fo that
'they could not fee our Number; and I made the
Man we had left in the Boat, who was now one
of us, call to them by Name, to try i( I could
bring them to a Parley, and fo might perhaps re-
duce them to Terms; which fell out juft as we de-
fir'd: For indeed it was eafy to think, as their
Condition then was, they would be very willing
to capitulate ; fo he calls out as loud as he could,
to one of them, Tom Smithy Tom Smith; Tom Smith
anfwer'd immediately, Who's that, Robinfon ? For
it feems he knew his Voice: T'other anfwer'd,^?/,
ay; for God's Sake, Tom Smith, throw down your
Arms, and yield, or, you are all dead Men this Mo-
ment.
Who muft we yield to ? Where are they? (fays Smith
again;) Here they are, fays he, here's our Captain,
and fifty Men with him, have been hunting you
this two Hours, theBoatfwain iskill'd3 WHlFrye
is wounded, and lama Prifoner; and if you do not
yield, you are all loft.
Will they give us Quarter then, (fays Tom
Smith) and we will yield? Vllgo and ask, if you
pomife to yield, fays Robinfon ; fo he ask'd the Cap-
tain, and the Captain then calls himfelf out, You
Smith, you know my Voice, if you lay down your
Arms immediately, andfubmit, you fhall have your
Lives all but Will Atkins.
Upon this, Will Atkins cry'd out, For God's fake,
Captain, give me Quarter, what have I dene ? They
have been all as bad as I, which, by the way, was not
true neither ; for it feems this Will Atkins was the
jfirft Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they
firft mutiny'd, and us'd him barbaroufly, in tying
his Hands, and giving him injurious Language.
However, the Captain told him he muft lay down
his Arms at Difcretion, and truft to the Gover-
nor's
nolir's Mercy, by which he Kfteant me ,• for they
all call'd me Governour.
In a word* they all laid down their Arms, and
begg'd their Lives; and I fent the Man that had
parly'd with them, and two more, who bound
them all; and then my great Army of 50 Men,
which particularly with thofe three, were all but
eight, came up and feiz'd upon them all, and upon
their Boat, only that I kept my felf and one more
out of Sight, for Reafotis of State.
Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and
think of feizing the Ship,* and as for the Captain,
now he had Leifure topirly with them: He expo-
stulated with them upon the Villany of their Pra-
ftices with him, and at length upon the farther
Wiekednefs of their Defign, arid how certainly it
muft bring themtoMiferyand Diftrefs in the End,,
and perhaps to the Gallows.
They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard
for their Lives: As for that, he told them they
were none of his Prifoners, but the Commander of
the Wand ; that they thought they had fet him on
Shore in a barren uninhabited Ifland, but it had
pleafed God fb to direft them, that the Ifland
was inhabited, and that the Governour was an
Englifh Man ; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleas'd; but as he had given them all Quarter,
he fuppofed he would fend them to England to be
dealt with there, asjuftice required, except At-
kins, who he was commanded by the Governour
to advife to prepare for Death ; for that he would
be hang*d in the Morning.
Though this was all a Fiftion of his own, yet
it had its defied Effeft > Atkins fell upon his Knees
to beg the Captain to intercede with the Gover-
nour for his Life; and all the reft begg'd of him
for
fot God's Sake* that they might n6t be fent to
England.
It now occur'd to me, that the time of our De-
liverance Was come, and that it would be a moft
eafy thing to bring thefe Fellows in> to be hearty
in getting Poffeffion of the Ship,* fo I retired in the
dark from them, that they might not fee what
kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the Cap-
tain to me. When I call'd, as at a good Diftance,
one of the Men was order'd to fpeak again, and fay
to the Captain, Captain^ the Commander calls for
you; and prefently the Captain reply 'd, Tell bis
Excellency I am jufi a coming: This more perfectly
amus'd them ; and they all believ'd that the Com-
mander was juft by with his fifty Men.
Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told hiita.
my Projeft for feizing the Ship, which he lik'd of
wonderfully well, and refolv'd to put it in Execu-
tion the next Morning.
But in order to execute it with more Art, and
Security of Succefs, I told him, we muft divide the
Prifoners, and that he ftiould go and take Atkins
and two more of the worft of them, and fend them
pinion'd to the Cave, where the others lay: This
was committed to Friday and the two Men who
came on Shone with the Captain.
They convey *d them to the Cave, as to a Prifon J
and it was indeed a difmal Place, efpecially to
Men in their Condition.
The other I ordered to my Bower, as I call'd it,
of which I have given a full Defcription; and as
it was fencM in, and they pinion'd, the Place was
fecure enough* considering they were upon their
Behaviour.
To thefe in the MorningI fent the Captain, who
was to enter into a Parley with thexta, in a Word
io.try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might
might be trufted or no, to go on Board and furprize
the Ship. He talked to them of the Injury done
him, of the Condition they were brought to; and
that though the Governour had given them Quar-
ter for their Lives, as to the prefent A&ion, yet
that if they were fent to England, they would all
be hang'd in Chains, to be fure ; but that if they
would join in fo juft an Attempt, as to recover the
Ship, he would have the Governour's Engagement
for their Pardon.
Anyone may guefs how readily fiich a Propofal
would be accepted by Men in their Condition ;
they fell down on their Knees to the Captain, and
promifed with the deepetl Imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the laft Drop, and
that they fliould owe their Lives to him, and
would go with him all over the World, that they
would own him for a Father to them as long as
they liv'd.
Well, fays the Captain, I muft go and tell the
Governour what you fay, and fee what I can do
to bring him to confent to it : So he brought, me
an Account of the Temper he found them in;
and that he verily believ'd they would be faith-
ful.
However, that we might be very fecure, I told
him he fliould go back again, and chule out thofe
five, and tell them, they might fee that he did not
want Men, that he would take out thofe five to be
his'Afliftants, and that the Governour would keep
the other two, and the three that were fent Pnfo-
ners to the Cattle (my Cave) as Hoftages, v for the
Fidelity of thofe five ; and that if they prov'd un-
faithful in the Execunion, the five Hoftages ftiould
be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.
This lookM fevere, and convinced them that the
• Governour
Governour was in Earneft; however they had no
Way left them, but to accept it; and it was now
the Bufinefs of the Prifoners, as much as of the
Captain, to perfuade the other five to do their
Duty.
Our Strength was now thus order'd for the Ex-
pedition : i. The Captain, his Mate, andPaffen-
ger. 2, Then the two Prifoners of the firft Gang,
to whom having their Chara&ers from the Captain,
I had given their Liberty, and trufted them with
Arms. 3. The other two who I had kept till now,
in my Bower, pinion'd; but upon the Captain's
Motion, had now released. 4. Thefe five released
at laft : So that they were twelve in all, befides five
we kept Prifoners in the Cave, for Hoftages.
I ask'd the Captain, if he was willing to ven-
ture with thefe Hands on Board the Ship ,• for
as for me and my Man Friday, I did not think
it was proper for us to ftir, having feven Men
left behind ; and it was Employment enough for
us to keep them afunder, and fupply them with
Vidua Is.
As to the five in the Cave, I refolv'd to keep
them faft,but Friday went in twice a Day to them^
to lupply them with Neceffaries* and I made the
other two carry Provisions to a certain Diftance,
where Friday was to take it.
When 1 (hew'd myfelf to the two Hoftages, ft
was with the Captain, who told them, I was the
Perfon the Governour had order'd to look after
them', and that it was the Governour's Pleafure
they fhould not ftir any where but by my Directi-
on j that if they did, they fhould befetch'd into
the Caftle, and be laid in Irons 3 fo that as we
never fuffcr'd them to fee me as Governour, fo I
now appeared as another Perfon, and (poke of the
Y Cover-
"Governour, and Garrifon, the Caftle, and the iike;<
upon all Gceafions.
The Captain now had no Difficulty before hinv
'-but to £utnifh his two Boats, flop the Breach off
one, and Man them. He made his Paflenger
'Captain of one, . with foiir other Men ; and him-*
Telf, and his Mate, and five mote went in the o-
<tHer ; And they contrived their Bufinefs very well;
•for they came up to the Ship about Midnight: As-
foon as they came within call of the Ship, he made
Robmfm\kXft them, and tell them they had brought
'off the Men arid Boat, but that it was a long
time -before they had found them, and the like ;
fcoldingthemin1 a Chat till they came to the Ship's
fide; -when the Captain and the Mate, entring
firft with their Arms, immediately knocked down
the fecond Mate and Carpenter with theBut-end
-of their Muskets- Being very faithfully fetonded
by their Men, they fecur'd all the reft that were
rjpon'the :Maiirarid Quarter Decks, and began to
fafteirthe ;HatcItestoteep them down w^ho were
belo;w, when the other Boat and their Men entring
^t the Fore-Chairis, fecur'd theFore-Caftle of the
Ship, and the Scuttle which went down into the
Gobk-Rbom, making three.Men they found there
Prisoners. ^ - ' •
. When this was done, land all fafe upon Deck, the
Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break
Into the Round-Hau fe, where the new Rebel Cap-
tain-lay, a;id leaving taken the Alarm, was gotten
up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire
Arms in their Hands, and when the Mate with a
Crow fplitopp'n the Door, the new Captain arid
his Men fir'd boldly among them, and wounded the
Mate with a Musket Ball, \vhich broke his Arm,
and wounded two riiore of thfc Men, but kill'd
no'Body.
The
The Mate calling for Help, rufh'd however in-
to the Round-Houfe, wounded as he was, and
with his Piftol fhot the new Captain thro' the
Head, the Bullet cntring at his Mouth, and came
out again behind one of his Ears; fo that he never
fpoke a Word ; upon which the reft yielded, an4
the Ship was taken effectually, without any more
Lives loft.
As foon as the Ship wras thus fecur'd, the Cap-*
tain order'd feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
of his Suceefs, which you may be fure J was very
glad to hear, having fat watching upon the Shore
for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning.
Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a Day of great Fatigue
to me, I flept very found, till I was fomething fur-
priz'd with the Noife of a Gun ; and presently
flatting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name
of Governouy, Governour,and prefently I knew the
Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of
the Hill, there he flood, and pointing to the Ship,
he embrac'd me in his Arms, My dear Friend and
Deliverer xhy she, there's your Ship, for (he is all yoursy
and foare we and all that belong to her. I caft my Eyes
to the Ship, and there fhe rode within little more
than half a Mile off the Shore -> for they ha^f weigh-
ed her Anchor as foon as they were Matters ofher;
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an
Anchor juft againft the Mouth of the little Creek;
and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought
the Pinnace in near the Place where I at firft land-
ed my Rafts, and fo landed juft at my Door.
I was at firft ready to fink down with the Sur-
prize. Forlfawmy Deliverance indeed vifibly
put into my Hands, all Things eafy, and a large
Ship juft ready to carry me awav whither I plea-
Y 2 fed
fed to go. At firft, for fome Time, I was not able
to anfwer him one Word; but as he had taken me
in his Arms, I held faft by him, or I fhould have
fallen to the Ground.
He perceived the Surprize, and immediately
pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a
Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pofe for me; after I had drank it, I {at down up-
on the Ground ,• and tho5 it brought me to my
felf, yet it was a good while before I could (peak
a Word to him.
All this while the poor Man was in as great an
Extafy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was;
and he faid a thoufand kind tender Things to me,
to com pofe me, and bring me to myfelf; but fuch
was the Flood of Joy in my Breaft, that it put all
my Spirits into Confufion ; at Iaft it broke out in-
to Tears, and in a little while after, I recovered
my Speech.
Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as
my Deliverer; and we rejoic'd together. I told
him, I looked upon him as a Man fent from Heaven
to deliver me, and that the whole Tranfa&ion
feem'd to be a Chain of Wonders; that fuch Things
as thefe were the Testimonies we had of a fecret
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could
iearch into the remoteft Corner of the World, and
fend Help to the Miferable whenever he pleafed.
I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankful-
r.efs to Heaven, and what Heart could forbear to
blels him, who had not only in a miraculous Man-
ner provided for one in fuch a Wildernefs, and
in fuch a defolate Condition, but from whom eve-
ry Deliverance mull: always be acknowledged to
proceed.
When
When we had talkM a while, the Captain told
me he had brought me fome little Refrefhment,
fuch as the Ship afforded, and fuchas the Wretches
that had been fo long his Matters had not plun-
dered him of: Upon this he cail'd aloud to the
Boat, and bid his Men bring the Things a-ftiore
that were for the Governour ; and indeed it was
a Prefent, as if I had been one not that was to be
carry'd away along with them, but as if I had
been ro dwell upon the Ifland ftill, and they were
to go -without me. ^
Firft, he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full
of excellent Cordial Waters, fix large Bottles of
Madera Wine; the Bottles held two Quarts a-
piece; two Pound of excellent good Tobacco,
twelve good Pieces of the Ship's Beef, and fix Pie-
ces of Pork, with a Bag of Peafe, and about a hun-
dred Weight of Bisket.
He brought me alfo a Box of Sugar, a Box of
Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of
^ime-juice, and abundance of other Things: But
befides thefe, and what was a thoufand times more
ufeful to me, he brought me fix clean new Shirts,
fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves,
one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stock-
ings, and a very good Suit of Cloaths of his own,
which had been worn but very little : In a word,
he cloathed me from Head to Foot. ,
It was a very kind and agreeable Prefpnt, as any
one may imagine, to one in my Circumftances. But
never was any thing in the World of that Kind fo
unpleafanr, aukward, jmd uneafy, as it was to me
to wear fuch Cloaths at their firft putting on. ^
After thefe Ceremonies paft, and after all his
good Things were brought into my little Apart-
ment, we began to confult what was to be done
Wivh ih; Prifoners we had ; fpc it was worth con-
y 3 iidering;
fidcring, whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them, whe*
we knew to be incorrigible and refraftory to the
laft Degree ; and the Captain faid, he knew they
were fuch Rogues, that there was no obliging
them, and if he did carry them away, it mult be
in Irons, as Malefa&ors to be delivered over toju-
ftice at the firft Englijh Colony he fliould come at;
and I found that the Captain himfelf was very an-
xious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that if he defied it, I
dnrft undertake to bring the two Men he fpoke of,
to make it their own Requcft that he fhould leave
them upon the Ifland : I fhould be very glad of that,
fays the Captain, with all my Heart.
Well, fays I, I will fend for them up, and talk
with them for you ; fo I caufed Friday and the two
Plottages, for they were now difcharg'd, their
Comrades having perform'd their Promife ; I lay,
I caufed them to go to the Cave, and bring up.the
five Men pinion'd, as they were, to the Bower,
and keep them there till i came.
After feme Time, 1 came thither drefs'd in my1
new Habit, and now I was call'd Govcrnouragain \
being all met, and the Captain with me, I caufed
the Men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full Account of their villainous Beha-
viour to the Captain, and how they had run away
with the Ship, and, were preparing to commit
farther Robberies, but that Providence had en-
ii-a/ci them in their own Ways, and that they
were fallen into the Pit which they had digged for
others.
I let them know, that by my Direction the Ship
had been feis'd, that (he lay now in the Road ; and
::;-y might fee by and by, that their new Captain
had
had received the Reward of his Villany; for that;
they might fee him hanging at the Yard-Arm.
That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to fay, why 1 fhould not execute them as Pi-
rates taken in the Fad, as by my Commiffion they,
could not doubt I had Authority to do.
One of them anfwer'd in the Name of the reft,
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken, the Captain promised them their
Lives, and they hubbly implor'd my Mercy : But
I told them, I knew not what Mercy to fhew them,-'
for as for myfclf, I had rcfolv'd to quit the Ifland'
with all my Men, and had taken Paifagc with the
Captain to go for England : And as for the Cap-
tain, he could not carry them to England other than
asPrifoners in Irons, to be try VI for Mutiny, and
running away with the Ship; the Confeqqcucc of
which, they muft needs know, would be the Gal-
lows ; fo that I could not tell which was beft for
them, unlefs they had a Mind to take their Fate
in the Ifland; if they defir'd that, I did not care*
As I had Liberty to leave it, I had fome Inclina-
tion to give them their Lives, if they thought they
could fliift on Shore.
They feem'd very thankful for it, faid, they
would much rather venture to flay there, than to
be carryM to England to be hang'd, fo I left it op
phac Ifkic.
However, the Captain feem'd to make fomc
Difficulty of it, as if he d.uril not leave them
rhcrc : Upon this I feem'd a little angry with the
Captain, and told him, That they weremyPrifo-
iiei>>, not his ; ' and that feeing I had offer'd them
fo much Favour, I would be as good as my Word ;
and that if he did not think fit ro confent to it, I
would fct them at Liberty as I found them; and
Y 4 if
if he did not like it, he might take them again if
he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and J
accordingly fet them at Liberty, and bad them re-
tire into the Woods to the Place whence they came,
and I would leave them fome Fire Arms, fome
Ammunition, and fome Dire&ions how they fliould
Jive very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship,
but told the Captain, that I would flay that Night
to prepare my Things, and defir'd him to go on
Board in the mean Time, and keep all right in the
Ship, and fend the Boat on Shore the next Day
for me; ordering him in the mean Time to caufe
the new Captain, who was kill'd, to be hang'd at
the Yard-Arm, that thefe Men might fee him.
When the Captain was gone, I fent for the Men
up to me to my Apartment, and entred ferioufiy
into Difcourfe with them of their Circumftances.
J told them, I thought they had made a right
Choice ; that if the Captain carry'd them aw^iy,
they would Certainly be hanged. I fhew'd them
the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-Arm of the
Ship, and told them they had nothing lefs to expect-
When they had all declared their Willingnefs to
flay, I then told them, I would let them into the
Story of my living there, and put them into thq
Way of making it eafy to them. Accordingly I
gave them the whole Hifiory of the Place, and of
my coming to it; fhew'd them my Fortifications,
the Way I made my Bread, planted my Corn, cu-
red my Grapes,- and, in a word, all that was
neceflfary to make them eafy: I told them the
Story alfo of the fixteen Spaniards, that were to be
expe&ed; for whom I left a Letter, and made
them promife to treat them in common with
themfelves,.
X left
I left them my Fire-Arms, viz. Five Muskets,
three Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had
above a Barrel and half of Powder left; for after
the firft Year or two, I us'd but little, and wafted
Done. 1 gave them a Defcription of the Way I
managed the Goats, and Dire&ions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both Butter and Cheefe.
In a word, I gave them every Part of my own
Story ; and I told them, I would prevail with the
Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder
ijiore, and fome Garden-Seeds, which I told them
I would have been very glad of; alfo I gave them
the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had brought
me to eat, and bid them be furetofow andencreafe
them.
Having done all this, I left them the next Day,
and went on Board the Ship: We prepared imme-
diately ro fail, but did not weigh that Night:
The next Morning early, two of the five Men
eamefwimming to the Ship's. Side, and making a
rpoft lamentable Complaint of the other three, beg-
ged to be taken into the Ship, for God's fake, for
they fliould be murdered, and begg'd the Captaiu
to take them on board, tho' he hang'd them im-
mediately.
Upon this the Captain pretended to have no
Power without me; but after fome Difficulty,
and after fome folemn Promifes of Amendment,
they were taken on board, and were fome time af-
ter foundly whipp'd and pickl'd,- after which, they
prov'd very honeft and quiet Fellows.
Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on
Shore, the Tide being up, with the Things promi-
fed to the Men, to which the Captain, at my Inter-
ceffion, caus'd their Chefls and Cloaths to be add-
ed, which they took, and were very thankful for;
I alfo pneourag'd them, by telling them, that if
it
it lay In my way to fend any Veflel to take them i%
I would not forget them.
When I took leave of this Ifland, I carry'don
board for Reliques, the great GoatVSkin-Cap I
had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot,• alfo I
forgot not to take the Money I formerly mention^
which had lain by mc (o long ufelefs, that it was
grown rufty, or tarnifh'd, and could hardly pafs
for Silver, till it had been a little rubb'd, and han-
dled ; as alfo the Money I found in the Wreck of
the Sfanijlo Ship.
* And thus 1 left the Ifland, the Nineteenth of
Decemberyas I found by the Ship's Account, in
the Year 168^, after I had been upon it eight and
twenty Years, two Months, and 15? Days,* being,
delivered from thisfecond Captivity, the fame Day
of the Month thatl firft made my Efcape in the
Barco-Longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this Ve'flcl, after a' long Voyage, 1 arriv'd
• in England the Eleventh of June, in the Year 1687,
having been thirty and five.Yeats abfent.'
When I came to England, I was as perfedt a
Stranger to all the World,' as if I had never bee*)
known there. My Benefa&or and faithful Stew-
ard, who I had left in Truft with my Money, was
alive, but had had great Misfortunes, in the World;
was become a Widow the fecond time, and very low
in the World: I madehereafy as to whatflieow'd
me,alluring her,I would give her no Trouble; but
on the contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care
and Faithfulncfs to me, I reliev'd her, as my little
Stock would afford, which at that Time would
indeed allow me to do but little for her ; but laf-
iiir'd her, I would never forget her former Kindnefs
to me \ nor did I forget her, when I had fufficient
to help her, as fhall be obferv'd in its place.
I went
[JJI.]
I went clown afterwards into York/hire; but my
Father was dead, and my Mother, arid ail the Fa-
mily extinct, except that I found two Sifters, and
two of the Children of one of my Brothers, and as
I had been long ago given over for dead', there had
been no Provision made for me ,• fo that in a word,
I found nothing to relieve, or affift me; and that
little Money I had, would not do much forme, as
to fettling in the World.
I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which
I did not expert; and this was, That theMafter
of the Ship, who I had fo happily delivered, and
by the fame Means fav'd the Ship afrd Cargo, ha-
ving given a very handfome Account to the Own-
ers, of the Manner how I had fav'd the Lives of
the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and fome other Merchants concerned, and
all together made mc a very handfome Compliment
upon the Subject, and a Prefent of almoft two
hundred Pounds Sterling.
But after making feveral Reflections upon the
Circumftancesof my Life, and how little way this
would go towards fettling me in the World, I re-
fold to go to Lisbon, . and fee if I might not come
by fome Information of the State of my Plantation
in the Brajils, and of what was become of my Part-
ner, who I had reafbn tofuppofe had fome Years
now given me over for dead.
. With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon,
wherp I arrived in April following; my Man ivz-
day accompanying me very honcftly in all thefe
Ramblings, and proving a moft faithful Servant
upon all Occafions, .
When I came to Lisbon, I found out by Enquiry,
and to my particular Satisfaction, my old Friend
the Captain of the Ship, who firft took mc up at
Sea^ off of the Shore of Africk: He was now
: grown
grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put
His Son, who was far from a young Man, into his
Ship -, and who ftill us'd the Brafil Trade. The
old Man did not know me, and indeed I hardly
knew him ; but I foon brought him to my Remem-
brance, and as foon brought my felf to his Remem-
brance, when I told him who I was.
After feme paffionare Expreffions of the old Ac-
quaintance, I enquir'd, you may be fure, after my
Plantation and my Partner: The old Man told me
he had not been in the Brafils for about nine Years;
but that he could affure me, that when he came
away my Partner was living; but the Truftees,
who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of
my Part, were both dead ,* that however, he be-
liev'd that I would have a very good Account of
the Improvement of the Plantation; for that upon
the general Belief of my being caft away, and
drown'd, my Truftees had given in the Account of
the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the
Procurator Fifcal, who had appropriated it, in
cafe I never came to claim it; one Third to the
King, and two Thirds to the Monaftery of St. Au-
gafline> to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor,
and for the Converfion of the Indians to the Catho-
lick Faith; but that if I appeared, or any one for
me, to claim the Inheritance, it fhould be reftor'd;
only that the Improvement, or annual Produ&ion,
being diflributed to charitable Ufes, could not be
reftor'd \ but he aflur'd me, that the Steward of
the King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Provedi-
clore, or Steward of the Monaftery, had taken great
Care all along, that the Incumbent, that is to fay,
my Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account
ot the Produce, of which they receiv'd duly my
Moiety.
Iask'd
I ask'd him if he knew to what Height of Im-
provement he had brought the Plantation ? And,
whether he thought it might be worth looking af-
ter ? Or, whether on my going thither, I fhould
meet with no Obftru&ion to my poffeffing my juft
Right in the Moiety ?
He told me, he could not tell exa&Iy to what
Degree the,Plantation was improv'd; but this he
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying but one half of it; and that to
the beft of his Remembrance, he had heard, that
the King's Third of my Part, which was it feems
granted away to fome other Monaftery, or religious
Houfe, amounting to above two hundred Moi-
dores a Year; that as to my being reftor'd to a
quiet Pofleffion of it, there was no queftion to be
made of that, my Partner being alive to witnefs my
Title, and my Name being alfo enrolled in the
Rigifter of the Country 5 alfo he told me, That
the Survivors of my two Truftees were very fair
honeft People, and very wealthy; and he believ'd
I would not only have their Affiftance for putting
me in Pofleffion, but would find a veryconfiderable
Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Account ;
being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers
held the Truft, and before it was given up as a-
bove, which, as he remembered, was for about
twelve Years.
I fhew'd my felf a little concern'd, and uneafy
at this Account, and enquired of the old Captain,
How it came to pafs, that the Truftees fhould thus
difpofemyEffefts, when he knew that I had made
my Will, and had made him, the Portuguefe Cap-
tain, my univerfal Heir, &c.
He told me, that was true; but that as there
was no Proof of my being dead, he could not a&
as Executor, until fome certain Account fliould
come
come of my Death, and that befides, he was not
willing to intermeddle with a thing fo remote ;
that it was true he had regifter'd my Will,
and ,put in his Claim ^ and could he have giveii
any Account of my being dead or alive, he would
have acted by Procuration, and taken Poffeffion of
ih$ Ingenio, fotheycalfd theSugar-Houfe, and had
given his Son, who was now at the Brajtls, Order
;o do it.
v But, fays the old Man* I have one Piece of
News to tell you, which perhaps may not be fo
acceptable to you -as the reft, and that is9 That
believing you were loft, and all the World believ-
ing .fo alfo, your Partner and Truftees did of-
fer ;tp account to me in your Name, for fix. or
eight of the firft, Years of Profits, which I received;
but there being at that time, fays he, great.Dif-
burfements for encreafing the Works, building an
IngeniOy and buying Slaves, it did not amount to
near fo jnuch as afterwards it produc'd : However,
fays the old Man, I (hall give you a true Account
of what I have reeeiv'd in ail, and how Ihavedif-
pos-d of it.
After a few Days farther Conference with this
ancient Friend, he brought me an Account of the fix
firft Years Income of my Plantation, fign'd by my
Partner and the Merchants Truftees, being al-
ways delivered in Goods, viz,. Tobacco in Roll,
and Sugar in Chefts, befides Rum, Molofliis, &c.
which is the Confequence of a Sugar Work > and
I foirnd.by this Account, that every Year the In-
come conhderably encreas'd; but as above, the
JDisburfement being large, the Sum at firft was
fmall : However, the old Man let me fee, that he
was Debtor to me 470 Moidores of Gold, befides
60 Chefts of Sugar, and ,15 double Rolls of To-
bacco which .were, loft in his. Ship; he having been
Ship-
Shlp-wreck'd coming Home ro Lisbon about If
Years att-er my leaving the Place.
> The good Man then began to complain of his
Misfortuues, and how he had been obliged to make
"Ofe of toy Money to recover his Lofles, and buy
him a Share in a new Ship: However, my old
'Friend* fays he, you Avail net want a Supply in your
Neceffity; and as foon as my Son returns, you ftatt-
be fully fatisfy'd.
Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and
gives me 160 Portugal Maidores in Gold; and gi-
ving me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, which
his Sort was gone to the Brafils in, of which he
was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another,
he puts them both into my Hands lor Security of
the reft; ; ^
I was too much mov'd with the Honefty and
Kindnefs of the poor Man, to be able to bear this;
and remembring what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at Sea, and howgeneroufly he
had us'd me on all Occasions, and particularly,
how fineere a Friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he faid to me:
Therefore firft I ask'd him, if his Circumftances
admitted him to (pare fo much Money at that time,
and if it would not ftraiten him? He told me, he
could not fay but it might ftraiten him a little; but
however it was my Money, and I might want it
Hiorethanhe.
Every thing the good Man faid was full of Af~
feftion, and I could hardly refrain from Tears
while he fpoke : In fhort, I took ioo of the Moi-
dores, and call'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a
Receipt for them, then I returned him the reft, and
told him, If ever I had Poffeffion of the Plantation,
I would return the other to him alfo, as indeed I af-
terwards did > and that as to the Bill of Sale of
his
his Part in his Son's Ship, I would not take it by
any Means; but that if I wanted the Money, I
found he was honeft enough to pay me,* and if I
did Hot, but came to receive what he gave me rea-
fon to expedt, I would never have a Penny more
from him.
When this was pafs'd, the old Man began to ask
me. If he fhould put me into a Method to make my
Claim to my Plantation ? I told him, I thought to
go over to it my felf: He faid, I might do fo if I
pleas'd; but that if I did not, there were Ways e-
nough to fecure my Right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the Profits to my Ufe; and as there were
Ships in the River of Lisbon, juft ready to go away
to Brafily he made me enter my Name in a publick
Regifter, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath
that I was alive, and that I was the fame Perfon
who took up the Land for the planting the faid
Plantation at firft.
This being regularly attefted by a Notary, and
a Procuration affix'd, he dire&ed me to fend it with
a Letter of his Writing,: to a Merchant of his Ac-
quaintance at the Place, and then proposed my
flaying with him till an Account came of the re-
turn.
Never any Thing was more honourable, than
the Proceedings upon this Procuration; for in left
than feven Months I received a large Packet from
the Survivors of my Truftees the Merchants, for
whofe Account I went to Sea, in which were the
following particular Letters and Papers, enclosed.
Firft^ There was the Account current of the
Produce of my Farm, or Plantation, from the Year
when their Fathers had ballanc'd with my old Por-
tugal Captain, being for fix Years; the Ballance ap-
pearM to be 1174. Moidores in my Favour.
"... Secondly i
Secondly, There was the Account of four Years
more while they kept the Efle&s in their Hands*
before the Government claim'd the Adminiftra-
tion, as being the Effe&s of a Perfon not to be
found, which they call Civil Death; and the Ba-
lance of this, the Value of the Plantation encrea-
fing, amounted to Cruifadoes, which made
3241 Moidores.
Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Augufiine's
Account, who had received the Profits for above
fourteen Years; but not being to account for what
was difpos'd to the Hofpital, very honeftly de*
clar'd he had 872 Moidores not distributed, which
he acknowledged to my Account; as to the King's
Part, that refunded nothing.
There was a Letter of my Partner's congratu-
lating me very affectionately upon my being alive,
giving me an Account how the Eftate was im-
prov'd, and what it produced a Year* with a Par-
ticular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it
contained; how planted, how many Slaves there
were upon it, and making two and twenty Croffes
for Bleffings, told me he had faid fo many Ave Ma-
rias to thank the Bleffed Virgin that I was alive;,
inviting me very paffionately to come over and
take Pofleffion of my own; and in the mean Time
to give him Orders to whom he ftiould deliver my
Effe&s, if I did not come myfelf; concluding
with a hearty Tender of his Friendship, and that
of his Family, and fent me, as a Prefent, (even
fine Leopard's Skinsi which he had it feems recei-
ved from Africa, by fome other Ship which he had
fent thither, and who it feems had made a better
Voyage than I: He fent mealfo five Chefts of ex-
cellent Sweet-meats, and an hundred Pieces of Gold
uncoinM, not quite fo large as Moidores.
Z By
By^the fame Fleet, 'my twd Merchant Truftees
Jhipp'd me 1200 Chcfts of Sugar, 800 Rolls of To-
bacco, and the reft of the whole Atrcompt in Gold.
I might well fay, now indeed, That the latter
End of Job was better than the Beginning. It is
impoffible to exprefs the Flutterings of my very
Heart, when I look'd over thefe Letters, and efpe-
cially when I found all my Wealth about me; for
as the Brafil Ships come all in Fleets, the fame
Ships which brought my Letters, brought my
Goods y and the EfFefts were fafe in the River be-
fore the Letters came to my Hand. In a word, I
turn'd pa'e, and grew ficky and had not the old
Man runand fetch'd me a Cordial, I believe the
fudden Surprize of Joy had overfet Nature, and I
had dy'd upon the Spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was
fo fome Hours, 'till a Phyfician being fent for, and
fomething of the real Caufe of my Illnefs being
known, he order'd me to be let Blood, after
which, I had Relief, and grew well: But I verily
believe, if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given
in that Manner to the Spirits, I fhould have
dy'd.
I was now Matter, all on a fudden, of above
5000/. Sterling in Money, and had an Eftate, as
I might well call it, in the Brajils, of above a
thoufand Pounds a Year, as fure as an Eftate of
Lands in England: And, in a word, I was in a
Condition which I fcarce knew how to' underftand,
or how to compofe myfelf, for the Enjoyment of
it.
The firft Thing I did, was to recompenfe my
original Benehiftor, my good old Captain, who
had been firft charitable to me in my Diftrefs,
kmd to me in my Beginning, and honeft to me at
the End: I 11kw'd him all that was fent me, I
told
told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven,
which difpofes all Things, it was owing to him;
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
I would do a hundred Fo!d: So I firft return'd to
him the hundred Moidores I had received of him,
then I fent for a Notary, and caufed him to draw
up a general Releafe or Difcharge for the 470
Moidores, which he had acknowledge he ow'ci
me in the fulleft and firmed Manner pdifible ; af-
ter which, I caufed a Procuration to be drawn,
impowering him to be my Receiver of the annual
Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my Part-
ner to accompt to him, and make the Returns by
the uftial Fleets to him in my Name; and a Claufe
in the End, being a Grant of xoo Moidores a Year
to him, during his Life, out of the Effe&s, and
50 Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for his
Life : And thus I requited my old Man.
I was now to confider which Way to fleer my
Courfe next, and what to do with the Eftate that
Providence had thus put into my Hands ,* and in-
deed I had more Care upon my Head now, than
I had in my filent State of Life in the Ifland,
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and
had nothing but what I wanted: Whereas I had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs
was how to fecure it. I had ne'er a Cave now to
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye
without Lock or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and
tarnifh'd before any Body would meddle with it:
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or
who to truft with it. My old Patron, the Cap-
tain, indeed was honeft, and that was the only Re-
fuge I had.
In^ the next Place, my Intereft in the Brafils
feem'd to fummon me thither, but now I could
not tell how to think of going thither, 'till I had
Z 2 fettled
fettled my Affairs, and left my Effe&s in fome fafe
Hahds behind me. At firft I thought of my old
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honeft, and
would be juft to me ; but then fee was in Years,
and but poor, and for ought I knew, might be in.
Debt; fo that, in a word, I had ho Way but to
go back to England myfelf, and take my Eftefts
with me.
It wasibme Months however before I refolded
upon this; and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old Captain fully, and to his Satisfafiioft, who had
been my former Benefaftor, fo I began to think of
my poor Widow, whcjfe Husband had been my
firft Benefa&of, and fee, while it was in her Pow1-
er, my faithful Steward and Inftru&or, So the firft
Thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write
to his Correfpondent in London, not only to pay
a Bill, but to go $nd her out, and carry her in Mo-
ney an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her
ftefeould, if I liv'd, have a farther Supply : At
the fame Time I fent my two Sifters in the Coun-
try, each of them an hundred Pounds, they being,
though not in Want, yet not in very good Cir-
cumftances; one having been marry'd, and left a
Widow; and the other having a Husband not fo
kind to her as he feould be.
But among ail my Relations, or Acquaintances,
I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durft
commit the Grofs of my Stock, that I might go
away to the Brafth, and leave Things fafe behind
me; and this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brafih>
and have fettled, myfelf there \ for I was, as it
were, naturahVd to the Place; but i had fome lit-
tle Scruple in my Mind1 about Religion, which
infenffbly drew me back, "of. which'I (hall fay
/ more
more prefently. However, it was not Religion
that kept me from going there for the prefent;
and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of
the Religion of the Country, all the while I was
among them, fo neither did I yet; (only that now
and then having of late thought more of it, than
formerly) when I began to think of living and dy-
ing among them, I began to regret my having pro-
fefs'd myfelf a Papift, and thought it might not be
the beft Religion to die with.
But, as I have faid, this was not the main Thing
that kept me from going to the Brafils, but that re-
ally I did not know with whom to leave my Efte&s
behind me; fo I refolv'd at laft to go to England
with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I Ihould
make fome Acquaintance, or find fome Relations
that would be faithful to me ; and accordingly I
prepaid to go for England with all my Wealth.
In order to prepare Things for my going Home,
I firft, (the Brafil Fleet being juft going away) refol-
ved to give Anfwers fuitable to the juft and faithful
Account of Things I had from thence; and firft to
the Prior of St. Augufline I wrote a Letter full of
Thanks for their juft Dealings, and the Offer of the
872 Moidores, which w.as undifpofed of, which I
defied might be given 500 to the Monaftery, and
372 to the Poor, as the Prior ftiould dire£c, deft-
ring the gopd Padres Prayers forme, and the like.
I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two
Truftees, with all the Acknowledgment that fo -
much. J Lift ice and Honefty call'd for; as for fend-
ing them any Prefent, they were far above having
any Occafion of it.
Laftly, I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging
his In.duftry in the improving the Plantation, and
his Integrity in encreafing the S.tqck of the Work^
giving him Inftru&ions for his future Govern-
Z 3 mcnt
ment of my Part, according to the Powers I had
left with my old Patron, to whom I defir'd him to
fend whatever became due tome, 'till he fliould
hear from me more particularly ; afluring him that
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but
to fettle myfelf there for the Remainder of my
Life : To this I added a very handfom Prefent of
fome Italian Silks for his Wife, and two Daugh-
ter's, for fuch.the Captain's Son inform'd mejhad;
with two Pieces of fine Englljh Broad-Cloath, the
beft I could get in Lisbon, five Pieces of black Bays,
and fome Flanders Lace of a good Value.
 Having thus fettled my Affairs, fold my Cargoe,
and turn'd all my Efte&s into good Bills of Ex-
change ; my next Difficulty was, which Way to
go to England, I had been accuftom'd enough to
the Sea, and yet I had a ftrange Averfion to going
- to England by Sea at that time mr and tho' I could
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encreasM
upon me fo much, that though I had once fliipp'd
my Baggage, in order to go, yet I altered my Mind,
and that not once, but two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea,
and this might be fome of the Reafons : But let
no Man flight the ftrong Impnlfes of his own
Thoughts in Cafes of fuch Moment: Two of the
Ships which 1 had fingled out to go in, I mean,
more particularly fingled out than any other, that
is to fay, fo as in one of them to put my Things on
Board, and in the other to have agreed with the
Captain ; I fay, two of thefe Ships mifcarry'd, viz,.
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was
caft away on the Start near Tor bay9 and all the
People drown'd except three; fo that in either of
thofe Vefiels I had been jnade miferable ; and in
which moft, it was hard to-fay. ,
Having
Having been thus harafs'd in my Thoughts, my
old Pilot, to whom I communicated ever thing,
prefs'd me earneftly not to go by Sea, but either
to go by Land to the Groyne, and crofs over the
Bay of Bijcay to Rochell, from whence it was but
an eafy and fafe Journey by Land to Parte, and fo
to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and
fo all the Way by Land thro' France,
In a word, I was fo prcpoflfefs'd again ft my going
by Sea at ail, except from Calais to Dover, that
1 refolv'd to travel all the Way by Land ; which
as I was not in Hafle, and did not value the
Charge, was by much the pleafanter Way; and to
make it more fo, my old Captain brought an En-
glish Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon,
who was willing to travel with me : After which,
we pick'd up two more Englifu Merchants alfo, and
two young Portuguese Gentlemen, the laft going to
Paris only ; fo that we were in all fix of us, and
five Servants; the two Merchants and the two
Portuguefe, contenting tnemfelves with one Servant
between two, to fave the Charge; and as for me,
I got an EvgUjh Sailor to travel with me as a Ser-
vant, befides my Man Friday, who was too much
a Stranger to be capable of fupplying the Place of
a Servant on the Road.
In this Manner I fet out from Lisbon; and our
Company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the
Honour to call me Captain, as well bccaufe I
was the oldeft Man, as becaufe I had two Ser-
vants, and indeed was the Original of the whole
journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my Sea-
Journals, fo I fhall trouble you now with none of
my Land-Journal: But fome Adventures that hap-
Z 4 per/d
pen'd to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I
mud not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
Strangers to Spain, were willing to flay fome time
to fee the Court of Spain, and to fee what was
worth obferving; but it being the latter Part of
the Summer, we haften'd away, and fet out from
Madrid about the Middle of October: But when we
came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm'd at
feveral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the
Mountains, that feveral Travellers were obliged
to comeback to Pampeluna, after having attempted
at an extream Hazard to pafs on.
When we came to Pampeluna it felf, we found it
fo indeed ,* and to me that had been always ufed
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where
we could fcarce bear any Cloaths on, the Cold was
infufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than
it wasfurprizing, to come but ten Days befqre out
of the OldCaftile, where the Weather was not only
warm, but very hot; and immediately to feel a
Wind from the Pyrenean Mountains, fo very keens
fo feverely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en-
danger benumbing and perifhing of our Fingers
and Toes.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the
Mountains all covered with Snow, and felt cold
Weather, which he had never ken or felt before
in his Life.
To mend the Matter, when we came to Pam-
peluna, it continued fnowing with fo much Vio-
lence, and fo long, that the People faid, Winter
was come before its time, and the Roads which
were difficult before, were now quite impaffible:
For in a word, the Snow lay in fome Places too
thicjk for us to travel j and being not hard frozen, as
is
is the C^fe in Northern Countries: There was no
going without being in Danger ot being bury'd
alive every ftep. We flayed no lefs than twenty
Days ztPampeluna •, when feeing the Winter com-
ing on, and no likelihood of its being better; for
it was the fevereft Winter all over Europe that had
been known in the Memory of Man. I proposed
that we fhould all go away to Fontarahi'a, and there
taking Shipping for Bourdeaux> which was a very
little Voyage.
But while we were confidering this; there came
in four French Gentlemen, who having been flopped
on the French Side of the Pafies, as we were on
the Spanifh, had found out a Guide, who traverfing
the Country near the Head of Languedocy had
brought them over the Mountains byfuch Ways,
that they were nor inuch incommoded with the
Snow; and where they met with Snow in any
Quantity, they faid it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their Horfes.
We fent for this Gaide, who told us, he would
Undertake to carry us the fame Way with no Ha-
zard from the Snow, provided we were armed fuf-
ficiently to proteft us from wild Beafts; for he
faid, upon thefe great Snows, it was frequent for
fome Wolves to fhow themfelves at the Foot of
the Mountains, being made ravenous for Want
of Food, the Ground being covered with Snow :
We told him, we were well enough prepared for
fuch Creatures as they were, if he would enfure
us from a Kind of two-legged Wolves, which we
were told we were in moft Danger from, efpeci-
ally on the French Side of the Mountains.
He fatisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind
in the Way that we were to go; fo we readily a-
greed to follqw him, as did alio twelve other Gen-
tlemeo,
tlemen,with their Servants, fome French, fome Spa-
uifhy who, as I faid, had attempted to go, and
were oblig'd to come back again.
Accordingly, we all fetout from Pampeluna, with
cur Guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in-
deed, I was furpriz'd, when inftead of going for-
ward, he came dire&ly back with us, on the fame
Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
Miles ; when being pafs'd two Rivers, and come
into the plain Country, we found our felves in a
warm Climate again, where the Country was plea-
fant, and no Snow to be feerj; but on a fudden,
turning to the Left, he appfoach'd the Mountains
another Way; and thought it is true, the Hills and
Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made fo marly
Tours, fuch Meanders, and led us by fuch wind-
ing Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the
Height of the Mountains, without being much
incumbred with the Snow; and all on a fudden,
he fliew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provences of Lan-
guedoc and Gafcoigny all green and flourifliing; tho*
indeed it was at a great Diftance3 and we had fome
rough Way to pafs yet,
We were a little uneafy however, when we found
it fnow5d one whole Day, and a Night, fo faft,
that we could not travil; but he bad us be eafy,
we fliould foon be paft it all, We found indeed,
that we began to defcend every Day, and to come
more North than before ; and fo depending upon
our Guide, we went on.
It was about two Hours before Night, when
our Guide being fomething before us, and not juft
in Sight, out rufiied three monftrous Wolves, and
after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoin-
ing to a th'ck Wood ,- two of the Wolves flew up-
on the Guide, and had he been half a Mile before
U6, he had been clevour'd indeed, before we could
 have
have help'd him : One of them faftned upon his
Horfe, and the other attacked the Man with that
Violence, that he had not Time, or not Prefence
of Mind enough to draw his Piftol, but hollow'd
and cry'd out *to us moft luftily; my Man Friday
being next to me, I bid him ride up, and fee what
was the Matter; as foon as Friday came in Sight
of the Man, he hoilow'd as loud as t'other, O Ma-
fter I 0 Mafter! But like a bold Fellow, rode di-
re&ly up to tbe-poot Man, and with his Piftol
{hot the Wolf that attacked him into the Head.
It was ha^py for the poor Man, that it was my
Man Friday ; for he having been us'd to that kind
of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon
him; but went clofe up to him, and fhot him as
above ; whereas any of us, * would have fir'd at a
farther diftance, and have perhaps either mifsM the
Wolf, or endangered fhooting the Man.
But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder
Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd our Compa-
ny, when with the Noife of Friday's Piftol, we
heard on both Sides the difmalleft Howling of
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Eccho of
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had
been a prodigious Multitude of them; and per-
haps indeed there was not fuch a few, as that we
had no Caufe of Apprehenfions.
However, as Friday had killed this Wolf, the o-
ther that had faftned upon the Horfe, left him im-
mediately, and fled; having happily faftned upon
his Head, where the Boffes of the Bridle had ftuck
in his Teeth ; fo that he had not done him much
Hurt: The Man indeed was moft Hurt; for the
paging Creature had bit him twice, once on the
Arm, and the other time a little above his Knee ;
and he was juft as it were tumbling down by the
Difordcr
Difordet oft his Horfe, when Friday came up and
fliot the Wolf.
It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the Noife of Fri-
days Piftol, weall mended our Pace, and rid up as
fail as the Way (which was very difficult) would
give us leave, to fee what was the Matter ; as foon
as we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us
before, we faw clearly what had been the Cafe,
and how Friday had difengag'd the poor Guide ;
though we did not prefently difcern what kind of
Creature it was he had kill'd.
But never was a Fight manag'd fo hardly, and
in fuch a furprizing Manner, as that which followed
between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all
(though at firft we were furprizM and afraid for
him) the greateft Diverfion imaginable: As the
Bear is a heavy, clumfey Creature, and does not
gallop as a Wolf does, who is fwifc and light ;
io he has two particular Qualities, which generally
are the Rule of his Aftions; Firft, As to Men, who
are not his proper Prey,-1 fay, not his proper Prey;
becaufe tho'I can't fay what exceffive Hunger might
do, which was now their Cafe, the Ground being all
cover'd with Snow; but as to Men, he does not u-
fually attempt them, unlefs they firft attack him :
On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if
you don't meddle with him, he won't meddle with
you; but then you muft take Care to be very civil
to him, and give him the Road ; for he is a very
nice Gentleman, he won't go a Step out of his Way
for a Prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your
belt way is to look another Way, and keep going
on; for fome times if you flop, and ftand ftill, and
lookfleadily at him, he takes it for an Affront; but
if you throw ortefs any Thing at him, and it hits
him, though it were but a bit of a Stick, as big as
your Finger, he takes it for an Affront, andfets all
his
his other Bufinefs afide to purfue his Revenge; for
he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour; that
is his firft Quality: The next is, That if he be
once affronted, he will never leave you, Night or
Day, till he has his Revenge; but follows at a good '
round Rate, till he overtakes you.
My Man Friday had delivered our Guide, and
when he came up to him, he was helping him off
from his Horfe; for the Man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the firft;
when on the Hidden, wefpy'd the Bear come out of
the Wood, and a vaft monftrous one it was, the big-
geft by far that ever I faw. We were all a little fur-
priz'd when we faw him; but when Friday (aw him,
it was eafy to fee Joy and Courage in the Fellow's
Countenance , 0! 0! 0! fays Friday, three times,
pointing to him; 0 Mafter; You give me te Leave, me
fiakee te Hand with him; me make you good laugh.
I was (urpriz'd to fee the Fellow fo pleas'd ,* Ton
Fool you, fays I, he will eat you up: Eatee me up !
Eatee me up! fays Friday, twice over again; Me
eatee him up : Me make you good laugh : Tou all flay
here, me (loozv you good laugh ; fo down he fits, and
gets his Boots oft in a Moment, and put on a Pair
of Pumps, (as we call the flat Shoes they wear)
and which he had in his Pocket, gives my other
Servant his Horfe, and with his Gun away he flew
fwift like the Wind.
The Bear was walking fofriy on, and offer'd to
meddle with no Body,, till Friday coming pretty
near, calls to him, as if the Bear could underftand
him; Hark ye, hark ye, fays Friday, me fpeakee wit.
you: V/e followed at a Diftance ,* for now being
come down on xhzGafcoign fide of the Mountains,
we were enter'd a vaft great Foreft, where the
Country was plain, and pretty open, though many
Trees in it fcatter'd here and there.
* Friday
Friday, who had as we fay the Heels of the Bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
Stone, and throws at him, and hit him juft on the
Head; but did him no more harm, than if he had
thrown it againft a Wall; but it anfwer'd Friday's
End •, for the Rogue was fo void of Fear, that he
did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and
(hew us fome Laugh, as he call'd it.
As foon as the Bear felt the Stone, and faw him,
he turns about., and comes after him, taking dcvi-
lifli long Strides, and fhuffling along at a ftrange
Rate, fo as would have put a Horfe to a middling
Gallop > away runs Friday, and takes his Courfe, as
if he run towards us for Help; fo we all refolv'd to
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man;
though I was angry at him heartily, for bringing
the Bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own Bufinefs another Way; and efpecially I
was angry that he had turn'd the Bear upon us, and
then run away; and I call'd out, You Dog, faid I, is
this your making us laugh? Come away, and take your
Horfe, that we may jhoot the Creature; he hears me,
and cries out, No Jhoot, no /boot, (land fiill you get
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two
Foot for the Bead's one, he turn'd on a fudden, on
one fide of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree fit for
his Purpofe, he beckoned to us to follow, and dou-
bling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying
his Gun down upon the Ground, at about five or
iix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.
The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we fol-
io w'd at a Diftancc ; the firft thing he did, he
ftopp'd at the Gun, fmelt to it, but let it lye, and
up he fcrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat,
though fo monftruoufly heavy : I was amaz'dat the
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could not
for my Life fee any thing to laugh at yet, till fee-
ing
ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rode hearer
to him.
When we came to the Tree, there was Friday
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb of the
Tree, and the Bear got about halfway to hifti;
as foon as the Bear got out to that Part where the
Limb of the Tree was weaker, Ha, fays he to tls,
now you fee me tenchee the Bear dance; fo he fails a
jumping and fluking the Bough, at which the B^ar
began to totter, but flood flill, and began to look
behind him, to fee how he fhould get back; then
indeed we did laugh heartily: But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal; when he fees him
Hand flill, he calls out to him again, as if he had
fuppos'd the Bear could fpeak Englijh; IVbdt, you
no come farther 1 Pray you come farther ; fo he left
jumping and fhaking the Bough; and the Bear, juft
as if he had underftood what he faid, did come a
little farther, then he fell a jumping again, and the
Bear ftopp'd again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the Head, and I call'd "to Friday to ftand flill,
and we would (hoot the Bear ; but he cry'd out
carneftly, 0 pray ! 0 pray ! No {hoot, me {hoot by
and then; he would have (aid, by', and by. Howe-
ver, to fhorten the Story, Friday dane'd fo much,
and the Bear flood fo ticklifh, that we had laugh-
ing enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine
what the Fellow- would do ; for firft we thought
he depended upon fhaking the Bear off; and we
found the Bear was too cunning for that too ; for
he would not go out far enough to be thrown
down* but clings faft with his great broad Claws
and Feet, fo that we could not imagine what
would be the End of it, and where the Jeft would
be at laft.
Bii:
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for
feeing the Bear cling faft to the Bough, and that
he would not be perfuaded to come any farther;
Welly welly fays Fridayy you no come farther, me goy
me go > you no come to me, me come to you ; and upon
this, he goes out to the fmalleft End of the Bough,
where it would bend with his Weight, and gently
let himfelf down by it, Aiding down the Bough,
till he came near enough to jump down on his Feet,
and away he run to his Gun, takes it up^ and ftands
ftill.
Well, faid I to him, Friday, What will you do
now? Why don't you fhoot him? No fhoot, fays
Fridayy no yet, me fhoot now, me no kill, me flay,
give you one more laugh; and indeed fo he did, as you
will fee prefently; for when the Bear fee his Ene-
my gone, he comes back from the Bough where he
flood, but did it mighty leifurely, looking behind
him every Step, and coming backward till he got
into the Body of the Tree; then with the fame
hinder End foremoft, he came down the Tree,
grafping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot
at a time5 very leifurely j at this Juncture, and juft
before he could fet his hind Feet upon the Ground,
Friday ftept up clofe to him, clapt the Muzzel of
his Piece into his Ear, and fhot him dead as a
Stone.
Then the Rogue turn'd about, to (fee if we did
not laugh, and when he faw we were pleasM by
our Looks, he fails a laughing himfelf very loud;
So we kill Bear in my Country, fays Friday : So you
kill them, fays I, why you have no Guns : No,
fays!he, no Gun, but fhoot, great much long Arrow.
This was indeed a good Diverfion to us ; but
we were ftill in a wild Place, and our Guide very
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew j. the..
Howling of Wolves run much, in my Head; and in *
deed
deed, except the Noife I once heard on the Shore
of Africa, of which I h^ve faid fomething already*
I never heard any thing chat filfd me with fo much
Horror.
Thefe things, and the Approach of Night, cal-
led us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us>
we fliould certainly have taken the Skin of this
monflrous Creature off, which was worth faving;
but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide
haften'd us, fo we left him, and went forward on
our Journey.
The Ground was ftill covered with Snow, tho'
not fo deep and dangerous as on the Mountains,
and the ravenous, Creatures, as we heard after-
wards, were come down into the Foreft and plain
Country, prefs'd by Hunger to feek for Food; and
had done a great deal of Mifchief in the Villages,
where they furpm'd the Country People, kill'd a
great many ot their Sheep and Horfes, and fome
People too.
We bad one dangerous Place to pafs, which
.our Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves
in the Country, we fliould find them there> and
this was in a fmall Plain, furrounded with Woods
on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane,
which we were to pafs to get through the Wood,
and then we fliould come to the Village where we
were to lodge.
It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we
enter'd the firft Wood; and a little after Sun-fer,
when we came into the Plain, we met with no-
thing in the firft Wood, except that in a little
Plain within the Wood, which was not above two
Furlongs over, we faw five great Wolves crofs the
Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had
been in Chafe of fome Prey, and had it in View,
A a they
. ;C 3S4-3
they toQJk no Notice of us, and were gone, and
put of our Sight in a few Moments. .
Upon this our Guide, who by the Way was a
wretched faiiited-hearted Fellow, bid us keep in a
ready. Pofture ; for he believ'd there were more
Wpives a coming.
%J jWe kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us,
rgfeut we faw no more Wolves, 'till we came thro*
vtt;hat Wood, which was near half a League, and en-
' ter'd the Plain ; as foon as we came into the Plain,
we had Occafion enough to look about us: The
firft Obje-ft we met with, was a dead Horfe;
that is to fay, a poor Horfe which the Wolves
had kill'd, and at leaft a Dozen of them at wort;
, we could not fay eating of him, but picking of his
Bones rather; for they had eaten up all the Fk(h
before.
We did not think fit to diftnrb them at their
£eaft., neither did they take much Notice of
us: Friday would have let fly at them, but I
.would not fufrerhim by any Means ; for I found
we were like to have more Bufinefs upon our
Hands than we were aware of. We were not
gone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the
Wolves houl in the Wood on our Left, in a fright-
ful Manner, and 'prefently after we faw about a
"hundred coming on dire&Iy towards us, all in a
Body, and molt of them in a Line, as regularly as
an Army drawn up by experienced Officers. I
fcarce knew in wnat Manner to receive them ;
but found to draw our felvcs in a clofe Line was
the only Way : So wc formed in a Moment: But
that we might not have too much Interval, I or-
der'd, that only every other Man fhouid fire, and
that the others who had not fir'd fliould Hand rea-
dy to give them a fecond Vo.iey immediately, if
'they continu'd to advance upon us, and that then
thofe
thofe who had fir'd at firft, fiiould not pretend to
load their Fuzees again, but ftand ready with every
one a Piftol; for we were all arm^d with a Fu?ee,
and a Pair of Piftols each Man ; (o we were by
this Method able to fire fix Volleys, half of us at
a Time; however, at prefent we had no Necefli-
ty •> for upon firing the firft Volley, the Enemy
made a full 'top, being tcrrify'd as well with the
Noife, as with the Fire; four of them being (hot
into the Head,dropp'd,feveral others were wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by the
Snow : I found they ftopp'd, but did not im-medi*
atelv retreat; whereupon remembring that I had
been told, that the fierceft Creatures were terri-
f y'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Com-
pany to hollow as loud as we could; and 1 found
the Notion not altogether miftaken; for upon
our Shout, they began to retire, and turn abouti
then lorder'd a fecond Volley to be fir'd, in cheir
Rear, which put them to the Gallop, and away,
they went to the Woods.
This gave us leifure to charge our Peices again,
and that we might lofe no Time, we kept going;
but we had but little more than loaded our Fu-
zees, and put our felves into a Readinefs, when
we heard a terrible Noife in the fame Wood, on
our Left, only that it was farther onward the
fame Way we were to go.
The Night was coming on, and the Light be-
gan to bedirky> which made it worfeon our Side;
but the Noife encreafing, we could eafily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of thofe heJ-
lifli Creatures; and on a fudden, we perceiv'd a or
3 Troops of Wolves, one on our Left, one behind
us, and one on our Front •, fo that we feem'd to
be furrounded with 'em * however5 as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our Way forward, as faft as
A a a we
we could make our Horfesgo, which the Way be-
ing very rough, was only a good lar^e Trot; and
in this Manner we came in View of: the Entrance
of a Wood, thro' which we were to pafs, at the
farther Side of the Plain ; but we were greatly fur-
prizM, when coming near the Lane, or Pafs, we
few a confus'd Number of Wolves {landing juft at
the Entrance.
On a fudden, at another opening of the Wood,
we heard the Noife of a Gun; and looking that
Way, out rufh'd a Horfe, with a Saddle, and a
Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and fixteen or
feventeen Wolves atter him, full Speed ; indeed,
the Horfe had the Heels of them; but as we fup~
pos'd that he could not hold it at that rate, we
doubted not but they would get up with him at
laft, and no queftion but they did.
But here we had a moft horrible Sight; for ri-
ding up to the Enterance where the Horfe came
out, we found the Carcafs of another Horfe, and of
two Men, devoured by the ravenous Creatures, and
one of the Men was no doubt the fame who we
heard fir'd the Gun; for there lay a Gun juft by
him fir'd off; but as to the Man, his Head, and
the upper Part of his Body, was eaten up.
This fill'd us with Horror, and we knew not
what Courfe to take, but the Creatures refolv'd us
foon; for they gather'd about usprefently, in hopes
of Prey ; and I verily bel'eve there were three hun-
dred of them : It happened very much to our Ad-
vantage, that at the Entrauce into the Wood, but
a little Way from it, there lay fome large Timber
Trees, which had been cut down the Summer be-
fore, and I fuppofe, lay there for Carriage ; I drew
my little Troop in among tbofe Trees, and placing
our felves in a Line, behind one long Tree, I ad-
vis'd them all to light,, and keeping that Tree be-
fore
fore us, for a Bread-Work, to ftand in a Tri-
angle, or three Fronts, enclofmg our Hories in
the Center. ... .
We did fo, and it was well we did •, for never
was a more furious Charge than the Creatures
made upon us in the Place j they came on us with
a growling kind of a Noife and mounted the Piece
ofTimbcr, (which as 1 faid, was ourBreaft-Work)
as if they were only ruQiing upon their Prey; and
tjiis Fury of theirs, it feems, was principally occa-
fiori'd by their feeing our Horfes behind m, which
was the Prey they aim'd at: Iorder'd our Men to
fire as before, every other Man; and they took
their Aim fofure, that indeed they kill d (everal
of the Wolves at the firft Volley v but there was
a Ncceflity to keep a continual Firing ; for they
came on like Devils, thofebehind, puQiing on
thofe before. .,, ,. r
When we had fir'd our fecond Volley of our
Fuzees, we thought they ftopp'd a little, and I
hop'd they would have gone ofT; but it was but
a Moment; for others came forward again ; fo
we fir'd two Volleys of our Piflols, and 1 believe
in thefc four Firings, we kill'd feventeen or eigh-
teen of them, and lam'd twice as many; yet they
came on again. .
I was loath to fpend our laft Shot too haltily •, fo
I cill'd my Servant,not my Man Friday, for he was
better employ'd-, for with the grcatett Dexterity
imaginable, he had charg'd my Fuzee arid his
own, while we were cngag'd, but as 1 laid, I call d
my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder,
1 bad him lay a Train, all along the: Piece of Tim-
ber, and let it be a large Train; he did fo, and had
but juft Time to get away, when the Wolvescame
up to it, and fome were got up upon it •, when
I mapping an uncharg'd Piftol, dole to the Pow-
- A a 3 dcr,
der,fet it on fire-,thofe that were upon the Tim-
ber were fcorch'd with ir, and fix or (even of
them fell, or rather jump'd in among us, with
the Force and Fright of the Fire, wc difpatch'd
thefe in an Inftant* and the rdt were fa frighted
\tflth the Light, which the Night, for it was
bow very near dark, made more terrible, that
tihey drew back a little.
Upon which I ordered our laftPiftols to be fir'd
offid one Volley, and after chat we gave a Shout •,
upon this, the Wolves curn'd Tail, and we fal-
ly'd immediately upon near twenty lame One?,
who we found ftruggling on the Ground, and
fell a cutting them with our Swords^ which an-
fwer'd our Expectation •> for the Crying and Howl-
ing they made, was better underftood by their
Fellows, fothat they all fled and left us.' ,;:
We had, firfl: and laft, kill'd about threefcore
of them-, and Jbad it been Day-Light,; we had
kiird many more: The field of Battle being thus
clear'd,wemade forward again ; for we had ftili
near a League to go. We heard the ravenous
Creatures houland yell in the Woods as we went^
Several Times-, and fometimeswefancy'd wefaw
fome of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes,
we were not certain ^ fo in about an Hour more^
we came to the Town, where we were to lodge,
which we found in a terrible Frigtit* and all in
Anns-, for it feems. that the Night before, the
Wolves and fome Bears had broke into the Vil-
lage, and put them in a terrible Fright •, and
they were obliged to keep Guard Night and Day,
but efpecially in the Night, to preserve their Cat-*
tie, and indeed their People. =
I, ThenextMorningour Guide was fo ill, and his
JLtmbs fwell'd with theranklingof his twoWounds
|hat he could go no fanhet; fo we were obliged to
>.-.: ,  • ; . take
take a new Guide there, and go to Tholoufe, whete
we found a, wariri Climate, a fruitful pleafarit Coun-
try, and no Snow, no WolveS, or any Thing like
/them j but when we told our Story at Iholoufe^ they
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary ih the
great Foreft at the Foot of the Mountains, efpeci-
ally when the Snow lay on the Ground. But they
enquitM much what kind of a Guide we had got-
ten, that would venture to bring us that Way in
fuch a fevere Seafon ; and told us, it was very much
wc were not all devoured. When we told them how
we plac'd oqr felves, and the Horfes in the Middle,
they blamM us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty
to one but we had been all deftroy 9d; for it was the
Sight of the Horfes which made the Wolves fo fu-
rious, feeing their Prey 5 and that at other Times
they are really afraid of a Gun; but they being ex-
ceflive hungry, and raging on that Account, the
Eagernefs to come at the Horfes had made them
fcnf.efs of Danger,- and that if we had not by the
continue Fire, and at laft by the Stratagem of the
Train of Powder, mafter'd them, it had been great
Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces; where-
as had we been content to have fat ftill on Horfe-
back, and fir'das Horfemen,- they would not have
taken the Horfes for fo much their own when Men
were on their Backs, as otherwife; and withal
they told us, that at laft, if we had flood all toge-
ther, and left our Horfes, they would have been fo
eager to have devoured, them, tjhit we might have
come off fafe, efpecially having our Fire Arms in
our Hands, and being fo many in Number.
For my Part, I was never fo: fenfible of Danger
in my Life ; for feeing above three hundred Devils
come roaring and open-mottthM to devour lis, and
having nothing to fhelter us, or retreat to, I gave
xny felf over for loft \ and as it was, I believe, I
A a 4 fliall
fhall never care to crofs thofe Mountains again ; I
think I would much rather go a thoufand Leagues
by Sea, though I were fure to meet with a Storm
once a Week.
I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in
my Paffage through France \ nothing but what o-
ther Travellers have given an Account of, with
much more Advantage tb4n I can. I traveled from
T'houloufe to Paris, and without any considerable
Stay, came to Caliais, and landed fafe at Dover, the
fourteenth of'January, after having had a fevere
cold Seafon to travel in.
I was now come to the Center of my Travels,
and had in a little Time all my new difcover'd fi-
liate fafe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I
brought with me having been very currently paid.
My principal Guide, and Privy-Counfellor, was
my good ancient Widow, who in Gratitude for the
Money I had fent her, thought no Pains too much,.
or Care top great, to employ for me; and I trufted
her fo entirely with every Thing, that I was per-
fectly eafy as to the Security of my Effe&s; and in-
deed, J was veL*y happy from my Beginning, and
now to the End, in the unfpotted Integrity of this
good Gpntlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my Effe&s
with this Woman, and fetting put for Lisbon, and
fo to the Brafils; but now another Scruple came in
my Way5 and that was Religion,- fpr as J had en-
tertain'd fome Doubts abcjut the Roman Religion,
even while I was abroad, efpecially in my State of
Solitude ; fo I knew there was no going to the Bra-
fils for me, much lefs going to fettle there, unlefs I
refolv'd to embrace th^Roman Catholick Religion,
without any Referve; unlefs on the other harid, I
refolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my Principles, be a
Jtfartyr for Religion, and die in the Incjuifition , (o
I re-
I refolv'd to ftay at Home, and if I could find
Means for it, to difpofe of my Plantation.
To this Purpofe I wrote to my old. Friend at
Lisbon, who in Return gave me Notice, that he
could eafily difpofe of it there: But that if I
thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my
Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors of my
Truftees who liv'd in the Brafils, who muft fully
underftand the Value of it,wholiv'd juft upon the
Spot, and who I knew were very rich, fo that he
believed they would be fond of buying it; he did
not doubt, but I (hould make 4 or 5000 Pieces of
Eight the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer
it to them, and he did fo; and in about 8 Months
more, the Ship being then return'd, he fent me ah
Account, that they had accepted the Offer, and
had remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Cor-
refpondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In Return, I fign'd the Instrument of Sale in the
Form which they fent from Lisbon, and fent ir to
my old Man, who fent me Bills of Exchange for
328000 Pieces of Eight to me, for the Eftate; re-
serving the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, the o'd Man, during his Life, and 50 Moi-
dores afterwards to his Son for his Life, which I
had promised them, which the Plantation was to
make good as a Rent-Charge. And thus I have
given the firft Part of a Life of Fortune and Ad-
venture, a Life of Providence's Checquer-Work,
and of a Variety which the World will feldom be
able to fliew the like of: Beginning foolifhly, but.
clofing much more happily than any Part of it ev$r
gave me Leave fo much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this State of com*-
plicated good Fortune, I was pad running any
more Hazards; and fo indeed I had been, if other
Cir-
T.3<fr ]
Circtiraftances had concurred, but I was inur'd to
a wandring Life, had no Family, not many Rela-
tions, nor however rich had I contracted much Ac-
quaintance ; and though I had fold my Eftate in
the Erajils, yet I could not keep the Country out
of my Head, and had a great Mind to be upon
the Wing again, efpecially I could not refift the
itrong Inclination I had to fee my Ifland, and to
know if the poor Spaniards were in Being there,
and how the Rogues I left there had ufed them.
My true Friend, the Widow, earneftly difwa-
ded me from it, and fo far prevailed with me, that
for almoft feven Years fee prevented my running
abroad; during which Tijne, I took my two
Nephews, the Children of one of my Brothers,
into my Care : The eldeft having fomething of
his own, I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave
him a Settlement of fome Addition to his Eftate,
after my Deceafe; the other I put out to a Cap-
tain of a Ship ; and after five Years, finding him
a fenfible bold, enterprising young Fellow, I put
him into a good Ship, and fent him to Sea :
And this young Fellow afterwards drew me in, as
old as I was, to farther Adventures myfelf.
- In the mean time, I in part fettled myfelf here,-
for;firft of all I marry'd, and that not either to my
Difadvantage or Diffatisfa&ion, and had three
Children,' two Sons a.nd one Daughter: But my
Wife dying, and my Nephew coming Home with
good Succcfs'from a Voyage to Spain, my Inclina-
tion to go abroad; and his Importunity, prevailed
and engag'dmetogo in his Ship, as a private Tra-
der to the Eajl-Indies: This was in the Year 169^
In this Voyage I vifited my new; Colony in the
Ifland, faw my Succeifors the Spaniards, had the
whole Story of their Lives, and of the Villains I
left there *, how at iirft they infultcd the poor Spa-
niards
wards, liow they afterwards agreed, difagreed, li-
nked, fepatated, and how at laft the Spaniards
were oblig'd to ufe Violence with them, how they
were fubje&ed to the Spaniards, how honeftly the
Spaniards us'd them ; a Hiftory, if it were enter'd
into, as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents,
as my own Part, particularly alfo as to their Bat-
tles with the Carribeans, who landed feveral times
upon the Ifland, and as to the Improvement they
made upon the Ifland it felf, and how five of
them made an Attempt upon the main Land,
and brought away eleven Men and five Women
Prifoners, by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young Children on the Ifland.
Here I ftay'd about 20 Days, left them Sup-
plies of all neceflary things, and particularly of
Arms, Powder, Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two
Workmen, which I brought from England with
me, viz,, a Carpenter and a Smith.
Befides this, I flur'd the Ifland into Parts with
'em, referVd to my felf the Property of the whole,
but gave them fuch Parts refpeftively as they a-
greed on; and having fettled all things with them,
and engag'd them not to leave the Place, I left
them there.
From thence I touched at the Brafils, from whence
I fent a Bark, which I bought there, with more
People to the Ifland,- and in it, befides other Sup-
plies, I fent feven Women, being fuch as I found
proper for Service, or for Wives to fuch as would
fake them : As to the £»$/(/& Men, I promised them
to fend them fome Women from England, with a
good Cargoeof Neceffaries, if they would apply
themfelves to Planting* which I afterwards per-
form'd. And the Fellows provM very honefl
and diligent after they were mafter'd, and had
their Properties fet apart for them. I fent them
alfo
B<% ]
alfo from the Brafils five Cows, three of them be-
ing big with Calf, fome Sheep, and fome Hogs,
which, when I came again, were confiderably en-
creas'd.
But all thefe Things, with an Account how 300
Carribbes Oimc and invaded them, and ruin'd their
Plantations, and how they fought with that whole
Number twice, and were at firft defeated, and
three of them kill'd; but at lafta Storm deftroying
their Enemies Canoes, they famifh'd or deftroy'd
almoft all the reft, and renew'd and recovered the
Poflfeffion of their Plantation, and ftill liv'd upon
the Ifland.
All thefe Things, with fome very furprizing In-
cidents in fome new Adventures of my own, for
ten Years more, I may perhaps give a farther Ac-
count of hereafter.
