DANIEL DEFOE.

 

Ts: author of Robinson Crusoe would be entitled to a prominent
place in the history of our literature, even had he never given to the
world that truly admirable production; and yet we may reasonably
question whether the name of Defoe would not long ago have sunk into '
oblivion, or at least have been known. like those of most of his cotem-
poraries, only to the curious student, were it not attached to a work
whose popularity has "on rarely equaled--never, perhaps, excelled.
Even as it is, the reputation due to the writer has been nearly altogether
absorbed in that of his hero, and in the all-engrossing interest of his ad-
ventures; thousands who have read Robinson Crusoe with delight, and
derived from it a satisfaction in nowise diminished by repeated perusal,
have never bestowed a thought on its author, or, indeed, regarded it in the
light of a literary performance. While its fascination has been univer-
sally felt, the genius that conceived it. the talent that perfected it, have
been generally overlooked, merely because it is so full of nature and
reality as to exhibit no invention or exertion on the part of the author,
inasmuch as he appears simply to have recorded what actually happened,
and consequently only to have committed to paper plain matter of fact,
without study or embellishment. We wonder at and are struck with
admiration by the powers of Shakspeare or Cervantes; with regard to
Defoe we experience no similar feelings: it is not the skill of the artist
that enchants us. but the perfect naturalness of the picture, which is
such that we mistake it for a mirror: so that ev'ery reader persuades him-
self that he could write as well, perhaps better, were be but furnished
with the materials for an equally interesting narrative.

There are many circumstances in Defoe's own history that would
recommend it to the notice of the biographer, independently of his
claims as the author of Robinson; among which are the variety and
extraordinary number of his literary performances, amounting to no
fewer than two hundred and nine difl'erent publications; and the no less

("1)Vlll BIOUIiAl'lIlCAL SKETCH 0F

singular fact, that the masterpiece of his genius was not only his first
essay in that species of composition. but was not produced till he was far
advanced in years, he having then arrived at a period oflife when the gen-
erality of authors close their literary career; and when the powers of
imagination either lose much of their vigor, or become altogether torpid.
Nor will our surprise at Defoe's industry. and the almost unprecedented
fertility of his pen, be at all diminished by considering that he was not a
recluse student or professed scholar, but was engaged in trade and various
other speculations. In one respect, however, his mercantile occupations
contributed to lay the foundation of his excellence as a novel-writer,
since there can be little doubt that it is to his actual experience of the
sea, and his acquaintance with other countries. we are indebted for that
truth and spirit which animate the more interesting parts of Robinson
Crusoe; while his manly good sense, unafl'ected earnestness, and fund of
native intelligence. have placed him very far above those who presumed
to undervalue his literary acquirements.

According to the latest and most copious of all his biographers, Daniel
Defoe was born in 1661, two years earlier than the generally assigned date
of his birth. His father was a butcher in the parish of St. Giles, Cripple-
gate; and appears to have been a citizen in easy circumstances, although
his trade was one that confers no particular luster on a pedigree. It is
usual to sheet some degree of astonishment when we read of men whose
alter fame presents a striking contrast to the humility of their origin;
yet we must recollect that it is not ancestry and splendid descent, but
education and circumstances, which form the man; and in this respect
the middling classes possess a decided advantage over those either below
or above them: for if the former are precluded from cultivating their
talents and abilities, the latter generally consider themselves exempt
from the necessity of doing so, and accordingly content themselves with
cultivating mere extemal accomplishments, in preference to exercising
their mental energies. Those on the contrary who are placed in a middle
station, while they are not debarred from the means of application, feel
that stimulus to exertion which arises from the desire of acquiring for-
tune or fame. The history of such men as Ximenes, Wolsey, Alberoni,
and Napoleon, may indeed justly excite our wonder;--when, too, we
behold unlettercd genius emerging, in spite of every obstacle, from the
obscurity to which it seemed condemned as in a Ferguson, a Duvsl, 3
Burns, and an Opie, we may be permitted to express our astonishment;
but as regards his origin. the history of Defoe is that of thousands who
have afterward raised themselves into comparative elevation by the
display of their powers. The solicitude, thereforc,so generally displayed
by biograpliers, on similar occasions, to trace some consanguinity with a
more dignified branch of their families, for those whose native obscurity
seems to demand some apology, betrays a rather mistaken policy. How-
ever this may be, it is certain that it is quite as honorable for Defoe to
have ascended from a butcher, as it would have been to have descended
from the Conqueror himself.

One undoubted and very great advantage, for which Defoe was indebwd
to his parents. who were nonconformists, was an education superior to
what it was then usual for persons in their station to bestow upon their
children; and they were careful also to implant in his youthful mind that.
regard for religion, and that strict moral integrity, which afterward dis-
played themselves not only in his writings, but in his conduct through
life. And this rectitude of principle be most unequivocally evinced when
his misfortunes put it so seveme to the proof. At about the age of four-
teen he was placed under the tuition of the Rev. Charles Morton of
Newhigton Green, who was afterward vice-president of Harvard College.
New-England; and from various incidental remarks in his own works, it
appears that young Defoe now entered upon an extensive course of
studies, and made considerable proficiency in languages, mathematics,
philosophy, history. and theology; although the natural liveliness of his
disposition unfitted him for that severe application which is necessary to
form a profound scholar in any one of those pursuits.

It was the intention of his parents that he should embrace the clerical
profession, which their religious feelings. and probably a v'ery pardonable
ambition, induced them toselect for him; yet, notwithstanding bisregard
for the sacred oflice, he was unwilling to embrace it himself; or events at
least, diverted his talents into another channel. The political and
religious excitements of that period were contagious for one of Defoe'a
temper: he assumed the character of the patriot as soon as he cast off
that of the boy, and espoused the side of the popular party with all the
ardor of youth; nor was it long before he had opportunities of dis-
tinguishing himself. He was a warm advocate for the Bill of Exclusion,
passed by the Commons to prevent the succession of the Duke of York to
the throne: and regarded with abhorrence that spirit of despotism which
sentenced Sydney and so many others to the scaffold. At the age of
twenty-one be commenced author, which employment he continued for
nearly half a century. and that, too, almost uninterruptedly, notwith-
standing his various speculations of a difl'srent nature. It can not be
expected that in a sketch of this nature we should attempt to give any
thing like a connected account of Defoe's various literary performances,
they being too numerous and multifarious for us to advert to them sepa-
rately, even if we conceived that by so doing we should greatly interest
the readers ot'this--the most distinguished of them all. But the truth is,
the majority of them are of that class which it is rather the province of
the bibliographer than the critic to describe. We may, however, here
mention the first production of his pen, which, under the singular title
of '.' Speculum Crape-gownorum," was a reply to a publication of Roger
L'Estrange's. a noted party-writer of that day. In this work Defoe in-
dulged in rather intemperate ianguagc, and while vindicating the dis-
senters,relleeted in too hostile and indiscriminate a manner upon the
established clergy. This was succeeded by a "Treatise against the
Turks," occasioned by the war between them and the Imperialism; and
was penned by Defoe for the purpose of showing his countrymen that, if
it was the interest of Protestantism not to increase the influence of a
Catholic power, it was infinitely more so to oppose a Mohammedan one;
which, however debatable it might appear to politicians, was almost too
obvious a truism to be entitled to any merit for its sagacity. It is the fate
of political publicationsquickly to fall into oblivion after the events which
call them forth have passed away: the reputation derived from them is as
transitory as the events themselves, or it the fame of the writer occa-
sionally descends to posterity, it is more than can be aflirmed of his
writings. -

Shortly after this, Defoe proved that he was ready to support the
doctrines he advocated by the sword as by the pen: he accordingly joined
the standard of the Duke of Monmouth. when the latter landed in Eng-
land with the view of expelling a Catholic prince from the throne, and
seating himself upon it as the defender of Protestantism. The issue of
that adventure, and the subsequent fate of the unfortunate, if not perfectly
innocent Monmouth. are well known. Happier than the leader of the
enterprise, it was Defoe's better luck to escape; he returned to the metro-
polis, in safety; and, abandoning politics and warfare, was content for a
while to turn his attention to the more humble but less stormy pursuits
of trade.

He now began a hosier, or rather a hose-factor, that is. a kind of agent
between the manufacturer and retailer; and according to Mr. Chalmers,
he continued to carry on this concern from 1685 to 1695. It was about
two years after he had thus established himself that he was admitted a
liveryman of London, on the 26th ofJanuary, 1687-8. Business, however,
did not so entirely absorb his attention but that he found time to engage
in the various controversies that agitated the public mind, and which
were occasioned by the arbitrary measures of James, who, feeling himself
secure alter the removal of so dangerous an enemy as Monmouth. began
more openly to favor the Catholics, and to dispense with the tests intended
to prevent their accepting commissions in the army. This, of course,
excited both the alarm and indignation of the Protestants, which were by
no means allayed by the temporizing servility of their own clergy, who
exerted their eloquence in favor of the king's prerogative. Among those
who attacked the doctrine.ol' the dispensing power was Defoe; nor, as
may well be imagined, was he afterward an unconcerned spectator of the
Revolution. whose progress he had minutely watched, and whose anni-
versary he continucd yearly to celebrate as a day marked by the deliver-DANIEL pesos. xi

ance of his country from political and religious tyranny. His attachment
to the new sovereign was confirmed by the personal notice shown him
both by that prince and his consort; for the " butcher's son" had had the
honor of an early introduction to the royal presence.

At this period Defoe resided at Tooting in Surrey, and he had now
launched out into more extensive commercial speculations, having em-
barked in the Spanish and Portuguese trade, so that he might fairly claim
the title of merchant. The precise time of his going to Spain, whether
before or alter the Revolution, can not be ascertained: but he not only
made a voyage thither, but stayed some time in the country, and acquired
a knowledge of the language. sincere as was his attachment to the purer
tenets of Protestantism, it did not degenerate into blind prejudice, nor
prevent him from doing justice to Catholics; he has accordingly, in his
Robinson Crusoe, represenbd the Spanish character under its most ami-
able traits, and in a tone that'mey almost pass forpanegyric. This voyage,
as we have already remarked,doubtlessly contributed to store his obwrvant
mind with many materials for those descriptions of the perils and adven-
tures common to a seaiaring life, theme strongly excite the sympathy of
those who follow this hero across the .trackless deep. Nor was he without
some experience of shipwreck, if not actually in his own person, by
the loss of a vessel in which he was a shareholder, and which was
wrecked in a violent storm 011' the coast of Biscay. It was about this
period also that he traded with Holland; probably for civet, as one ofhis

enemies has sneeringly styled him a "civet-cat merchant." Beside this,-

he visited some other parts of the continent, particularly Germany; he
did not, however, relinquish his hose-agency business in consequence
of his other engagements. But commercial enterprise did not prove for
him the road to wealth: on the contrary, his speculations involved him
in such cmharrassments, that. in 1692, he was obliged to abscond from his
creditors. A commission of bankruptcy was taken out against him, yet
it was afterward superseded, those to whom he was most in debt agreeing
to accept a composition on his own bond; and he not only punctually dis-
charged these claims. but after he had somewhat retrieved his circum-
stances, voluntarily repaid the remainder. 'this is so much the more to
his honor, since, so far from having met with many precedents of similar
probity in others, his misfortunes had been in some degree occasioned by
the knavery of unprincipled men, who, availing themselves of the impu-
nity held out to them by the supineness or the impotence of the law.

were then accustomed to set their creditors at defiance in the most hare"

faced manner.

lt was Defoe himself who first called the attention of the legislature to
the intolerable abuses which arose [tom those sanctuaries, as they were
termed, for criminals and debtors, which then existed in the metrop-
olis; and to him, consequently, may we be said to be indebted for the

M i" _'
abatement of a nuisance as disgraceful totho national character as it
was injurious to the industrious and honest portion of the community.

With the view of assisting him in his distress, some of his friends now
came forward and oll'ered to settle him as a factor at Cadiz; yet,advan-
tageous as the proposal was, he declined it, preferring to endeavor to re-
trive his finances by his pen. The country then being engaged in an
expensive war with France, Defoe proposed a scheme to assist the govern-
ment in raising " the ways and means;" and some time afterward he re-
ceived the appointment of accountant to the commissioners of the glass
duty; but it proved only a temporary one,as the duty was repealed in
August, 1699. Probably it was also about the same period that he became
secretary to the tile works at Tilbury. in which concern he embarked
some money, and was again a sufferer. His "Essay on Projects,"
published in January, 1696-7, shows him to have been, if not a very suc-
cessful speculator himself, at least a very ingenious and fertile deviser of
theoretical plans; most of which must be allowed to have the welfare of
society in view; nor have they been without influence in leading to many
improvements of later times: among those which have been practically
adopted we may mention his scheme for Friendly Societies and Savings'
Banks. Were any testimony required in favor of this work, it would be
sutficient to quote that of the celebrated Franklin, who confesses that the
impressions he received from it gave a strong bias to his own pursuits.

If not invariably employed in the active defense of public morals,
Defoe's pen was too honest to betray their interests on any occasion: it
was not always that his topics called for, or even admitted. any direct
illculoation of virtue, but whenever they did, he displayed his earnestness
in its behalf. His publication entitled "The Poor Man's Plea." is a very
keen piece of satire, with a considerable touch of humor, leveled against
the vices of the upper classes of society. in which he urges them to dis~
countenance by their own conduct .the immorality they deem so repre-
hensible in the vulgar. The stage, too, did not escape his castigation:
and really its transgressions were at that time so barefaced and audacious,
so offensive even to common decency, that whatever infamy there may
have been in either tolerating or in attempting to defend such a system of
lewdness, there could be no great triumph in exposing that which did not
even attempt to conceal itself.

We have now to notice our author in a somewhat different character--
namely, as a candidate for poetical fame. His satire, entitled the "True
horn Englishman," which was written for the purpose of averting fron
the king the abusive reflections cast upon him as a foreigner, had indeed
a very great run at the time; more, however, on account of the matter
than of the manner; since both that and all Defoe's other attempts of the
kind convince us. that. like the great Roman orator, he was an intolerably
bad poet, and not even a decent versifier. Yet, could gratitude andmxmt. neroc. xiii

enthusiastic devotion to his prince have supplied that inspiration which
the muses denied him. Defoe's poetry would have been of first-rate
excellence, so sincere was his admiration of, so zealous was his devotion
to, William Ill. The various ctl'usinns in rhyme, and numerous political
pamphlets and tracts which he published at this interval, we must pass
by, and come directly to an event that obtained for our author a rather
unenviablc species of distinction. The reign of Anne commenced with
much violence, and with cabals between the respective church parties.
leading to controversies that rather fanned than alloyed the public
ferment. On such an occasion, it was not to be expected that Defoe
would remain passive; assuming the furious tone ofthe high-churchmen
of the day against the dissenters, he published a small pamphlet, which
was in realityasatire upon the. writings which that party had issued from
the press; but the irony w'as so fine, and the imitation so exact. that
while it was supposed by them to utter the real sentiments of the writer,
it was also interpreted by those whom it was intended to serve," coming
from a violent enemy. The "Shortest Way with the Dissenters"-such
was its title, created an amazing sensation; and on its real object being
exposed, the high-church party became as fierce in their indignation as
they had before been warm in their applause. The author was detected,
a reward olfered for his apprehension, and he himself sentenced to'be
imprisoned in Newgate, and to stand in the pillory; but the attendance
of his friends, and the enthusiasm of the populace in favor of the chem-
pion of religious liberty, converted an ignominious punishment into a
triumph, so that his enemies had as little reason to exalt in their victory,
as to be proud of the sagueity they had displayed. If, however, this
event rather increased than diminished Defoe's reputation, it had a
different effect upon his pecuniary aflEtirs; his confinement in Newgate
prevented his attending any longer to his concern at Tilbury, the conse-
quence of which was that it was obliged to be given up; and thus Defoe
saw himself deprived at once of what had been the source ofa handsome
income. for before this alfair he was in such thriving circumstances as to
be able to keep his coach. According to his own statement. he lost three
thousand five hundred pounds, a far more considerable sum at that
period than it would be now. There was indeed one way of both
speedily and safely repairing his finances, namely, by accepting the over-
tures made him by the ministry, who would gladly have enlisted in their
own cause that pen which had proved so powerful against them; but
Defoe was too independent of soul and too higlhprincipled to purchase
his release upon terms that would inflict upon him the disgrace the
pillory had failed to effect.

Although a prison is not the most congenial place for literary pursuits,
our author availed himself of the time which the loss of his liberty
afforded him,ofoccupying his unwelcome leisure from all other businessxiv BIOGRAPHICAL sne-rcn or

in writing both in verse and prose. It was here that he published his
poem on the " Reformation of Manners," a sutiiciently copious theme in
every age, and afterward continued the subject in another, entitled
" More Reformation :" in which he alludes to his own situation in the
following nervous lines, describing himself as
" A modem tool.

To wit. to parties, and himself. a fool;

Etnhmil'd with states to do himself no good.

And by his friends themselves misunderstood ;

hlisconstrued first in every word he said--

By these unpitied. and by those unpaid."

Here we may truly sayfacit inrtignatio verses, for the caustic tone and
antithesis are not unworthy of Pope himself. The political controver.
sial pieces which he sent forth to the world from his "place of durance
vile" were too numerous for us to specify them; we therefore prefer
speaking of a work of more permanent interest, one in which he may be
regarded as the immediate predecessor of two of the most popular and
admired of our classic writers in the days of Anna--namely. Steele and
Addison. Defoe's "Review," which commenced Feb. 19. 1704, deserves
to be considered as the prototype of our Tatlers and Spectators; and
ma'y earn for its author the appellation of the Father of English Essay-
ists; since notwithstanding that political intelligence and discussion
constituted a great portion of its contents, it touched upon a variety of
other topics bearing upon literature, manners. and morals; while it was
itself hardly in any degree indebted for this part of its plan to preceding
or cott-mporary publications. Uniformly assailing vice, or exposing to
just ridicule the follies and foibles of society, Defoe varied his mode of
attack. at one time employing grave reasoning and serious rcmonstrancc;
at another, substituting sarcasm, humor, wit, and pleasantry for monitory
rcproof. To a modern reader, indeed, many of the topics might seem to
lack invention, and to be rather commonplace, merely because they have
been so repeatedly handled by later writers, that both the wit and argu-
ment displayed in them have lost their freshness. This circumstance,
however, does not detract from Defoc's intrinsic merit, or from the praise
due to him as an originator: on the contrary, he in this respect, only
shares the fate common to all those who open a new path in literature or
art, inviting imitators whose numbers oppress, if they do not overwhelm
them: that Defoe has not since been surpassed in this species of writing
is liir more than we can venture to assert; yet it should he rccnllcctvd
that It is the first navigator of the Atlantic, not those who cross it in a
modern steamboat, who claims the homage of our admiration.

Those who are unacquainted with Detbe the essayist as well as Defoe the
novelist, will not be able to appreciate the extent of our author's powers,
and the variety of his information. But we have already dwelt upon theDANIEL DEL-'03. XV

' Review" at greater length than is consistent with the brevity we must
oert'orce observe; it is time therefore to proceed with our narrative. Mr.
ilarley. afterward Earl of Oxford, happened by a change in the ministry
to come into power,after Defoe had been about two years in confinement:
and being able to appreciate his abilities--perhaps anxious to secure them
in his own support, he represented his case to the queen. who generously
sent a sum of money to his wife and family, and another to discharge his
fine and prison expenses. Immediately upon his liberation Defoe retired
to liury St. Edmund's. It was there that he wrote his masterly treatise,
entitled " Giving Aims no Charity," in which he displays great practical
knowledge, with enlarged and sound views on the causes of potter!) . and
on the employment of the poor. In the intervals of these and rther
occupations, for it should be observed that he had been sent in 1715 by
Harley on a secret mission to the continent, the express object of r Ihich
has not transpired,--he found leisure to employ his pen on other suhiccts,
and anticipating his future character of a romance writer. he inventtd the
"true narrative" of Mrs. Veal's apparition, which was prefixed to a trans-
lation of Drelincourt on Death. The supposed stranger from the other
world is made to recommend that performance; and, as such supernatural
testimony was irresistible, the whole impression,which had before lain on
the booksellers' shelves, was quickly sold, and was succeeded by many
others, the work having since passed through forty ditferent editions.
This stratagem certainly does honor to Defoe's ingenuity and penetration;
yet whether it be entirely justifiable, considering the tendency of the
deception. may bedoubted.

Leaving for a while the account of his literary career, we must now
briefly notice a very important national subject, namely, the Union with
Scotland, in which, beside warmly advocating the measure with his pen,
Defoe was personally employed. At the recommendation of Harley and
Lord Godolphin, by whom he had been recommended to the queen, he was
sent on a mission to Edinburgh, in which city he arrived in October, 1708.
llere, it should seem, he was chiefly employed in making calculations re-
lating to trade and taxes. for the information of the committees of parlia-
ment; he also occupied himself in collecting those documents relative
to the Union which he afterward published. Beside this, he proposed
several plans for encouraging the manufactures. and for promoting the
trade. wealth, and maritime resources of Scotland. After an absence of
about sixteen months, he returned to England in 1708. when his services
obtained for him, from the ministry, an appointment with a fixed salary;
and as it does not appear what was the nature of the otlice he held, we
may conclude it to have been merely a s'inecure. Almost immediately
afterward his patron Harley was dismissed from otiice, through the
perseVering intrigues of the Duchess of Marlborough, whom he had sup-
planted in the queen's favor; an event that suddenly overclouded Defoe'a
political proxpects. Without compromising his principles, however, he
espoused the interests of the succeeding ministry; but although Gadol-
phin treated him with consideration, he suffered his pension to fall into
arrears, perhaps in consequence of Dcfoe's long absence in Scotland,
whither he was again dispatched, a few months afterward, upon some
secret business. In the following year, I709, Defoe published a work which,
to use the words ot'an eminent living critic, " places him among the sound-
est historians of the day;" and which, according to the testimony of
another, would have handed down his name to posterity. even had he not
immortalized himself by Robinson Crusoe. This was his "History of the
Union," which is as interesting for the minute description it gives of the
actors and incidents in that important event, as for the documents it
furnishes.

Still engaged in politics, Defoe's continued and severe attacks against
the Tories and the high-church party so exasperated them that they
attempted to suppress his writings. and even threatened him with prose-
cutions: their animosity, however, did not procure for him, from those
whose cause he defended, a degree of favor and support at all commen-
surate with his long and able service. He had also to contend with fresh
pecuniary losses in some concern in which he was engaged (1712) with Mr.
Wood, a mercer of Coleshill in Warwickshire; and with the personal
abuse with which his character was assailed by writers who reflected '
upon him as being a knavish bankrupt. But his political career was now
drawing to its close: having carried on his " Review" for more than nine
years, he finally relinquished it in May, 171:). when he was again I
prisoner in Ncwgate upon an indictment preferred against him by .his
friends the whigs. as the author of three treasonable Jacobitical pain-
phlets; whereas the publications in question were of a directly opposite
tendency. The queen once more bestowed a free pardon on him, and the
malice of his numerous enemies was defeated. From this time he em-
ployed his pen only occasionally on political subjects. By the accession
of George 1, to the throne. Defoe gained nothing. although his writings
had strenuously pleaded the cause of the House of Hanover during the
late reign; and although he had superior claims upon public gratitude
for the zen! with which, during nearly thirty years, he had not only advo-
cated religious and political independence, but endeavored to call atten-
tion to subjects of paramount importance to the national prosperity.
That. this neglect should, in spite of all his philosophy, have occasioned
him considerable mortitication. is not much to be wondered at: and to
the effect it had upon his health was attributed an apoplectic attack in
the year His. from which he continued to suffer for six months.

After so serious a blow to his constitution, and at his advanced period
of life. it might have been expected that he would now lay aside his
pen,--at least remit in his exertions. Yet it was subsequently to thisman-n. pesos. xvii

apparently cloudy epoch ot'his career that the brightest and most durable
of his literary wreaths was won. Great versatility of talent is not oflen
accompanied by an equal degree of vigor and raciness of intellect; when,
however, such does happen to be the case, it should seem that the former
Is rather beneficial than otherwise to its possessor, and that change of
subject serves to recruit the mental energies. Defoe at least may be
quoted as an extraordinary instance at rejuvencscency of mind in the
decline of years. We do not here allude to his "Family Instructor,"
although that performance is one of the most valuable and useful sys-
tems ol practical morality in our language, and has. doubtless, been far
more beneficial to society than many works of even splendid celebrity.
It is the series of novels which now appeared in quick succession from
his pen, that have won for him an imperishable reputation among the
worthies of English literature; nor will his claims upon our admiration be
diminished byconsidering the extravagant, unnatural system of romance
writing .which had till then prevailed, where every thing was eitherso
artificial or so shadowy, that not a glimpse ot'real life was to be discerned.
ln Det'oc's narratives. on the contrary, there is such an air of downright
Inaller--of-I'act and unadorned truth, as to amount to actual deception;
thereby preventing us from crediting the author with any merit on the
score of imagination, contrivance, or invention. Of this the reader will
be amply convinced by the perusal of the present work, on which it is
not necessary that we should expatiate, and we shall therefore merely
advert to the circumstances connected with its origin and publication.
The History of Robinson Crusoe was first published in the year 1719, and
its popularity maybe said to ha\e been established immediately,sinee
{our editions were called for in about as many months, a circumstance at
that time almost unprecedented in the annals of literature. It rarely
happens that an author's expectations are surpassed by the success ot'his
Work. however astonishing it may seem mothers; yet perhaps even Defoe
hintselt'did not venture to look forward to such a welcome on the part of
the public, atter the repulses he had experienced on that of the book-
sellers; for, incredible as it now appears, the manuscript of the work had
been ofl'ered to, and rejected by. every one in the trade; in which respect
its destiny was not only similar to that of Paradise Lost, but of two of
the most celebrated literary productions of the present day, namely,
Waverly and Childe Harold; the former of which remained in manu-
script ten years, without any probability ofever seeing the light, although
its fame has since extended itself wherever the English language is
known--nay, more, has even penetrated the wilds of Siberia.
Astonishing as was the success of Defoe's romance, it did not deter the
envxous from attempting to disparage it. The materials, it was said,
were either furnished by or surreptitiously obtained from Alexander
Selkirk,a mariner who had resided for {our years in the desert island

2xviii mocnarntcat. sxcrcu or

of Juan Fernandez, and returned to England in 1711. Very probably,his
story, which then excited considerable interest and attention,did suggest
to Defoe the idea ot'.writing his romance; but all the details and incidents
are entirely his own. Most certainly Defoe had obtained no papers or
written documents from Selkirk, as the latter had none to communicate.
So far, however, have others been from taxing our author with plagiarism,
that they have. on the contrary, charged him with putting on paper a
heap of chimeras, to impose upon public credulity. Thus these two
contradictory charges reciprocally destroy each other. An attempt has
also been made to rob him entirely of the brightest jewel in his literary
crown, by denying him to have been the author of Robinson Crusoe,
which has been ascribed, by some, to Arbuthnot; by others, to Det'oo's
patron, the first Earl of Oxlitrd. Those who have wished to gain credit
for the latter opinion, assert that it was composed by that nobleman
during his imprisonment in the Tower, in 1715, on a charge of high
treason: and they have argued that the whole tone of the work,especially
of that part toward the conclusion, where an account is given of the
exiled nobles of Muscovy. is what would naturally be suggested by the
solitude of a prison. Yet, as far as internal evidence is concerned. that.
is, indisputably. much stronger in favor of Defoe: for he had not only
been familiar with imprisonment, but was also. by his acquaintance with
foreign countries, and his experience in business and traffic. much better
qualified to produce a work which displays so much practical knowledge
of things, as well as of man. Indeed, nothing short of the most conclu-
sive and undeniable testimony of facts to the contrary. can at all invali-
date his claims to be considered as the real author. Had Robinson
Crusoe been the only production of the kind that proceeded from his
pen, there might be better reason for doubting whether he wrote it: but
the various other novels. or rather pieces of fictitious biography, which
he produced, form an additional reason for attributing it to him.

Of these latter we must here speak for more briefly than they deserve:
the "History of Moll Flanders," which was published in 1721, is an
admirably drawn picture of life, and contains an excellent moral lesson,
although many of the scenes it necessarily discloses are coarse and
revolting. The " Life of Colonel Jaque" contains also much able deline-
ation of real life; and in that part of the narFative which gives an
account of the hero's residence in Virginia, Defoe has hulnanely advocated
the cause of the negro slaves. His "Memoirs ofa Cavalier," which work
is supposed to have been written about the same time, is rather history,
attired in the form of an imaginary piece of biography, than a romance.
Indeed, all the details are so circumstantial and accurate. that it has been
mistaken for a genuine narrative of the events of the civil wars in Eng-
land and Germany; and it was actually recommended as the very best
account of them by the great Lord Chatham, with whom it was a favorite
book. In like manner our author's "History of the Plague" imposed
upon Dr. Mead, and since upon others, who have referred to it as an
authentic document. and a true recital of that great national calamity.
Here he is the rival ofThucydidcs and Boccccio; and depicts the horrors
of pestilence as vividly and as masterly as Poussin. It may however be
imagined by some, that this is rather suspicious praise, and that the work
of fiction which can pass as true history must be cold, matter-of-fact, and
tame, repulsive and dry. It is not, however, in the formal gravity of
3er that these works resemble history; but they imitate and reflect the
features of the past in their most interesting, if not their most engaging
aspect.

Beside the preceding. and one or two other' productions of a similar
cast, Defoe produced that very excellent and popular work entitled
"Religious Courtship." which was first published in 1722, and afterward
went through numerous editions. This and his " Family Instructor" are
replete with lessons of the soundest practical wisdom, and ,place their
author among the most extensively useful of our English moralists.

Here, however, we must terminate our sketch, having barely let! our-
selves room to mention a few particulars relative to the close of his life.
Although the profits accruing from his publications had of late been
considerable, and he had been able to give a portion to his daughter
Sophia, who married Mr. Baker, the celebrated natural philosopher, in
1729. yet he was still doomed to contend with misfortune. In addition
to the affliction of bodily infirmity and severe pain, he again fell into
great pecuniary difficulties, and was even arrested. He appears, how-
ever, to have recovered his liberty within a short time; but the unnatural
conduct of his son, who refused to give up the property that had been
intrusted to him, with the view of securing a provision to his mother and
two unmarried sisters, was a heavier blow than any he had before ex-
perienced; and the mental anguish it occasioned doubtless accelerated
his death, which occurred on the 24m of April, 1731. Since that period
more than a century has now elapsed; and in that interval many names
of considerable eminence in their day have sunk into irretrievable ob-
livion; Defoe, also, has lost some portion of the celebrity he enjoyed with
his cotempomries; yet, otter every deduction, enough remains to entitle
hiln to a place among the Worthiea of English literature, for should all

his other productions be forgotten. his Robinson Crusoe must remain
imperishable.
LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

S E C T I O N I .
loam-son's rum, m.---ms "ovum-no): ms nan-rs.

I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though
not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, named
Kreutznaer. who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchan-
dise, and leaving 03' his trade. lived alterward at York; tron: whence he
had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson. a very
good family in that country, and after whom I wasso called, that is to
any, Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in
England, we are now called. nay, we call ourselves, and write our name,
Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an
English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous
Colonel Lockhart. and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the
Spaniards. What became of my second brother, 1 never know, any more
than my father and mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third son of the thmily, and not bred to any trade, my heed
began to be tilled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who
was very aged, had given me a competent share of learning," three
house education and a country free-school generally go, and designed me
for the law: but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and
my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the corn
mands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that

propenaion of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to
befall me. (81 )22 ADVENTURES 01?

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel
against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into
his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated \'ery
warmly with me upon this subject: he asked me what reasons more than
a more wandering inclination, I had for leaving his house, and my native
country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising
my fortune, by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.
He told me it was men of desperate fortunes, on the one hand, or of
superior fortunes. on the other, who went abroad upon adventures,
aspiring to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in under-
takings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all
either too far above me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle
state, or what might be called the upper station of low life. which he had
found by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited
to human happiness; not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the
labor and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar-
rassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of
mankind: he told me, I mightjudge nfthe happiness of this state by one
thing,viz: that this was the state of life which all other people envied;
that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being
born to great things. and wished they had been placed in the middle of
two extremes, between the mean and the great: that the wise man gave
his testimony to this,as the just standard of true felicity, when he prayed
to have "neither poverty nor riches."

He bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamities
of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind; but
that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to
so many vicissitudes asthe higher or lower part of mankind: nay, they
were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of
body or mind, as those were, who, by vicious living, luxury and extrava-
gances, on the one hand, or, by hard labor, want of necessaries, and mean
and insuflicient diet. on the other, bring distempcrs upon themselves
by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle
station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues, and all kind ofenjoy-
meats; that peace and plenty were the handmaids ot' a middle fortune;
that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable
diversions and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the
middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly
through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with tho
labors of the hands or of the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily
bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of
peace. and the body of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or
secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy circum-
stances, sliding gently tbrougb the world, and sensibly tasting the sweetsaosmsos causes. 23

of hvmg, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning,
by every day's experience, to know it more sensibly.

Alter this. he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate man-
ner. not to play the young man. nor to precipitate myself into miseries
which nature and the station of life [was born in, seemed to have pro-
vided against; thatl was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that
he would do well for me. and endeavor to enter me fairly into the station
of life which he had been just recommending to me: and that if I was
not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate. or fault,
that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, hav-
ing thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he
knew would be to my hurt: in a word. that as he would do very kind
things for me if] would stay and settle at home as he directed ; so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encourage-
ment to go away: and, to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for
an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep
him from going into the Low Country wars; but could not prevail, his
young desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed;
and though, he said, he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would
venture to say to me, that if I did take this'foolish step. God would not
bless me; and I would have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel. when there might be none to assist in my recovery.

I observed, in this last part of his discourse. which was truly prophetic,
though, I suppose. my father did not know it to be be so himself; I say. I
observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he
spoke of my brother who was killed; and that, when he spoke of my
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me. he was so moved, that he
broke ott' the discourse, and told me his heart was so full, he could say no
more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse; as, indeed, who could be
otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to
settle at home. according to my father's desire. But, alas! a few days
wore it all ofl': and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further impor-
tunities. in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However I did not act so hastily. neither, as my first heat of resolution
prompted; but I took my mother, at a time when I thought hers little
pleasanter than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely
bent upon seeing the world, that I should never settle to any thing wuh
resolution enough to go through with it. and my father had better give
me his consent than force me to go without it; that l was now eighteen
years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an
attorney; that l was sure, ifl did, I should never serve out my time, and
I should certainly run away from my master before my time was out. and
so to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me make but one24 anvssruass or

voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no
more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time
I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion: she told me she knew it
would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such a subject;
that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to any
thing so much to my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of
any thing. after such a discourse as I had from my father, and such kind
and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me: and that.
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but 1 might
depend I should never have their consent to it: that for her part, she
would not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have
it to say, that my mother was willing when my father was not.

Though my mother refused tomove it to my father, yet as! have heard
afterward, she reported all the discourse to him; and that my father, after
showing a great concern at it, said to her with a sigh. That boy might be
happy, if he would stay at home; but, if he goes abroad, he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose; though in the
meantime I continued obsti'naIer deaf to all proposals of settling to
business, and frequently expostulaling with my father and mother about
their being so positively determined against what they knew my ineli-
nations prompted me to. But, being one day at Hull, whither I went casu-
ally, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time, and
one of my companions then going to London by sea in his father's ship,
and prompting me to go with them by the common sliurements of sea-
tbring men. viz: that it should cost me nothing for my passage. 1 con-
sulted neither father nor mother any more, norso much as sent them
word ofit; but lefl. them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's
blessing or my father's, without any consideration of circumstances or
consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows.

 

SECTION II.

Ill-5T ADVENTURE AT SEA, AND muses OF A KARI"!!! "WVOYAGI
1'0 GUINEA.

ON the 1st of September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for
London. ' Never any young adventurer's misfortunes. I believe, began
younger, or continued longer, than mine. The ship had no sooner got
out of the Humber, than the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise,
in a most frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I wasnonxxsox cnusos. 25

most inexpressibly sick 'in body and terrified in mind: I began now
seriously to reflect upon what I had done. and how justlyI was overtaken
by the judgment of Heaven, for wickedly leaving my father's house.
All the good counsels of my parents. my father's tears, and my mother's
entreatics, came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience. which
was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since,
reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the abandonment of
my duty. '

All this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had never been
upon before. went very high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but, such as it was,
enough to affect me then, who was buts young sailor,and had never known
any thing of the matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed
us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough
or hollow of the sea. we should never rise more; and in this agony of '
mind I made many vows and resolutions, that it' it would please God to
spare my life this voyage, if ever 1 got my foot once on dry land, I would
go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I
lived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such mise'
rics as these any more. Now l saw plainly the goodness of his observa-
tions about the middle station of life; how easy. how comfortable, he had
lived all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or
troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting pro-
digal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued during the storm, and indeed
some time after; but the next day," the wind was abated, and the sea
calmer, I began to be inured to it. Howaver. I was very grave thit day,
being also a little sea-sick still: but toward night the weather cleared up,
the wind was quite over. and a charming fine evening followed; the sun
went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having
little or no wind. and a smooth sea. the sun shining upon it. the sight was,
as I thought, the most delightful that I ever saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very
cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible
the day before, and could be so calm and pleasant in a little time after.

And now. lost my good resolutions should continue. my companion,
who had indeed enticed me away, came to me and said, Well, Bob. clap-
ping me on the shoulder, how do you do alter it'! I warrant you were
frightened, wa'nt you. last night, when it blew but a cap--full of wind 1--
A cop-full. do you call it! said I; 'twas a terrible storm--A storm, you
fool! replies he, do you call that a storm? Why. it was nothing at all
give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a
squall of wind as that: you are but a fresh-water sailor, Bob; come, let

us make a bowl of punch, and we 'll forget all that. D'ye see what
3
charming weather 'tis now! To make short this sad part of my story,
we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made. and l was made
drunk with it: and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my
repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct. and all my resolu-
tions for the future. in a word. as the sea was returned to its smooth-
ness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of the sternum
the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of
being swallowed up by the sea forgotten. and the current of my former
desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises I had made in
my distress. I found. indeed. some intervals of redaction; and serious
thoughts did, as it were, endeavor to return again sometimes; but I
shook them oil' and roused myself from them. as it were from a distem-
per, and applying myself'to drink and company, soon mastered the
return of those tits,---for so I called them} and 1 had in live or six days
got as complete a victory over conscience as any young sinner, that
resolved not to be troubled with it. could desire. But i was to have
another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it
does. resolved to leave me entirely without excuse: forifl would not take
this for a deliverance. the next was to be' such a one as the worst and
most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the
mercy of. The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into Yarmouth
Roads: the wind having been contrary. and the weather calm, we had
made but little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to
an anchor, and here we lay. the wind continuing contrary, viz: at south-
west, for seven or eight days, during which time a great uiany ships from
Newcastle came into the same roads. as the common harbor where the
ships might wait for a wind for the river Thames. We had not, however,
ridden here so long. but we should have titled up the river, but that the
wind blew too fresh: and, after we had lain four or five days, blew very
hard. However. the roads being reckoned as good as a harbor, the anchor-
nze good. and our ground tackle very strong. our men were unconcerned,
and not in the. least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and
mirth. aller the manner of the sea. But the eighth day, in the morning,
the wind increased. and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts,
and make every thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as
possible. By noon the sea went very high indecd,and our ship rode fore-
castle in. shipped several seas, and we thought. once or twice, our anchor
hzid come home: upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor:
so that we. rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the
better end.

lty this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now i began to see
terror and amazement in the faces of even the seamen themselves. The
master was vigilant in the business of preserving the ship: but.as he
went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him sonly say to himnomxsos CRUSOE. 2'!

self seveml times. Lord, be merciful to us! we shall be all lost; we shall
be all undone! and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid,
lying still in the cabin, which was in the slot-rage. and can not describe
my lt'lllpt'l'. I could ill reassume the first penitence, which I had so
nppflrclllly trampled upon, and hardened myself against; I thought that
the bitterness ofdeath had been past. and that this would be nothing too.
like the Iirst: but when the master himself came by me, as I said just
now. and said we should be all lost. I was dreadfully frightened. I got
up out'ot' my cabin.and looked out; but such a dismal sight I neversaw:
the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four
minutes. When I could look about, I could see nothing but distress
around us: two ships that rid near us, we found had cut their masts by
the board, being deeply laden; and our men cried out that a ship. which
rid about a mile ahead of us, was foundered. Two more ships. being
driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all ad- '
ventures, and that with note mast standing. The light ships fared the
best, as not so much laboring in the sea; but two or three of thorn drove.
and came close by us, running away. with only their spritsails out,
before the wind. Toward evening. the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cut away the foremast, which he was very
loth to do; but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the
ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away the
forcmast, the gainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they
were obliged to cut it away also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was
but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright heforeat but a little.
But in can express. at this distance, the thoughts I had about me at that
time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former
convictions. and the having returned fl'om them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the
terror of the storm, put me into such a. condition, that I can by no words
describe it, but the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with
such fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
known a worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and so
wallowed in the sea. that the seamen every now and then cried out, she
would founder. It was my advantage. in one respect, that I did not
know what they meant by founder, till I inquired. However. the storm
was so violent, that Isaw, what is not often seen, the master, the boat-
swain, and some others, mtue sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and
expecting every moment the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle
of the night. and under all the rest of our distresses, one ofthe men, that
had been down on purpose to see. cried out'we had sprung a leak:
another said, there was four feet water in the hold. Then all_ hands were
called to the pump. At that very word. my heart, as I thought, died
within me; and I fell backward upon the side of my bed, where I satin
the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me, that I, who was
able to do nothing, before, was as well able to pump as another: at which
I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this
was doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out
the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not come
near us, ordered us to fire a gun, as a signal ofdistress. I, who knew no-
thing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had
broke, or some dreadful thing had happened. In a word, I was so sur-
prised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody
had his own life to think of, no one minded me. or what was become of
me: but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside
with his foot, let me lie, thinkingl had been dead; and it was a great
while before I came to myself.

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent
that the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little,
yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a port, so
the master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, which had rid.
it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the
utmost hamrd the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get
on board. or for the boat to lie near the ship's side; tilt at last the men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast
them a rope over the stem with a buoy to it, and then'veered it outa
great length, which they, after great labor and hazard, took hold of, and
we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was
to no purpose for them or us, atter we were in the boat, to think of reach-
ing their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in
toward shore as much as we could; and our master promised them, that
if the boat was stavcd upon shore, he would make it good to their master;
so partly rowing, and partly driving. our boat went away to the north-
ward, sloping toward the shore almost as far as Winterton-Ness.

We were not much more than a quarter ofan hour out of our ship
when we saw her sink; and then I understood, for the first time, what was
meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge, I had hardly
eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for, from that
moment, they rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to
go in. My heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright,
partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at the oar to
bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when, our boat mounting the
waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along
the strand, to assist us when we should come near; but we made slow way
toward the shore; nor were we able to reach it. till being past the light-
house at Winterton, the shore falls otI' to the westward, toward Cromer.
and so the land broke ofl' a little the violence of the wind. Here we got
in. and though not without much diflicully, got all safe on shore. and
walked afterward on foot to Yarmouth; where, as unfortunate men, we
were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates or the town,
who assigned us good quarters. as by the merchants and owners ofships;
and had money given as sufficient to carry us either to London or back to
Hull. as we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone home,I had been happy: and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed
the timed calf for me; for, hearing the ship I went in was castaway in
Yurmouth Roads. it was a great while before he had any assurance that I
was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy that nothing could re-
sist: and though I had several times loud calls from my reason, and my
more com posed judgment, to go home. yet I had no power todo it.--I know
not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret, overruling decree,
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even
though it be before us. and that we rush upon it with our eyes open.
Certainly, nothing but some such decreed, unavoidable misery attending,
and which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me for-
ward against the calm rcasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with in
my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the
master's son, was now less forward than I: the first time he spoke to me
alter we were at Yarmnuth, which was not till two or three days, for we
were separated in the town to several quarters; Isay, the first time he
saw me. it appeared his tone was altered, and, looking very melancholy
and shaking his head, he asked me how I did: telling his father who
I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial. in order to go far-
thcr abroad. His father, turning to me, with a grave and concerned tone,
Young man, says he, you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought
to take this for a plain and visible token, that you are not to bea seafaring
mam--Why, sir'! said I, will you go to sea no morel--That is another
case, said he; it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made
this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what
you are to expect ifyou persist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your
account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish.--Pray, continues he. what
are you, and on what account did you go to sea? Upon thatI told him
some of my story: at the end of which he burst out with a strange kind
of passion. What had I done, said he, that such an unhappy wrelch
should come into my ship! I would not set my foot in the same ship with
thee again for a thousand pounds. This indeed was, as I said, an excur-
sion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and
was farther than he could have authority to go.--However, he afterward
talked very gravely to me; exhorted me to go back to my father, and not
tempt Providence to my ruin; told me, I might see a visible hand of
Heaven against me; and, young man. said he, depend upon it. if you do
not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters
and disappointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you.

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I saw him no
more; which way he went,I know not: as for me, having some money
in my pocket, I traveled to London by land; and there, as well as on the
road, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take,
and whetherI should go home or go to sea. As to going home shame
opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts; and it immediately
occurred to me howI should be laughed at among the neighbors, and
should be ashamed to see. not my father and mother only, but even every
body else. I-'rom whence l have often since observed, that men are not
ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the
action, for which they oughtjustly to be esteemed fools; but are ashamed
of the returning, which only can make them be. esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however,I remained some time uncertain what
measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible reluc-
tance continued to going home; and as I stayed awhile. the remembrance
of the distress I had been in were oil; and, as that abated, the little
motion I had in my desires to a return wore 011' with it, till at last I quite
laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage. That evil
influence which carried me first away from my father's house, that hur-
ried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune, and
that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me. as to make me deafto
all good advice, and to the entreaties. and even the commands of my
father; I say the same influence, whatever it was, presented the most
unfortunate of all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel
bound to the coast ot'Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to
Guinea.

It was my great misfortune. that in all these adventures I did not ship
myself as a sailor; whereby, though I might indeed have waited a little
harder than ordinary, yet, at the same time, I had learned the duty and
otlice of a foremast-man, and in time might have qualified myself for a
mate or lieutenant, if not a master: but as it was always my fate to
choose for the worse, so I did here; for having money in my pocket, and
good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit of
a gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship. nor learned
to do any. It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty good company in
London; which does not always happen to such loose and misguided
young fellows as I then was; the devil,-generally, not omitting to lay
some snare for them very early. But it was not so with me: I first fellnotirssoa gnnsos. 31

acquainted with the master of a ship, who had been on the coast of
Guinea. and who, having had very good success there, was resolved to go
as II. He, taking a fancy to my conversation, which was not at all dis-
agreeable at that time, and hearing me say I had a mind to see the world,
told me, that if! would go the voyage with him, I should be at no
expense: Ishoutd be his messmate and his companion; and if I could
carry any thing with me. I should have all the advantage ofit that the trade
would admit; and perhaps! might meet with some encouragement. I
embraced the odor, and, entering into a strict friendship with this captain,
who was an honest and plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him.
and carried a small adventure with me; which. by the disinterested
honesty of my friend the captain,I increased very considerably; for I
carried about forty pounds in such toys and trifles as the captain directed
me to buy. This forty pounds I had mustered together by the assistance
of some of my relations whom I corresponded with; and who, I believe,
got my father, or, at least, my mother. to contribute so much as that to
my first adventure. This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and
honesty of my friend the captain; under whom also I gota competent
knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learned how
to keep an account of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short,
to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor;
for, as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a
word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant: for] brought
home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which
yielded me in London, at my return, almost three hundred pounds, and

this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed
my ruin.

 

SECTION III.

BOBIXSON'S Cm"? AT SAuEP--BSCAPE WITH XUBY--ABBNAL AT THE
sauna.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great
misfortune, dying soon alter his arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage
again; and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate in
the former voyage. and had now got the command of the ship. This was
the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not carry
quite a hundred pounds of my new-gained wealth, so that I had two
hundred pounds left, and which I lodged with my friend's widow, who
was very just to me. yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage;
and the first was this.viz:--our ship, making her course toward the32 awn-runes or

Canary Islands. or rather between these islands and the African shore,
was surprised. in the gray ot' the morning. by a Turkish rover. of Sallee,
who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also
as much canvas as our yards would spread. or our tnasls carry, to get
clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us. and would certainly come
up with us in a few hours. we prepared to light, our ship having twelve
guns. and the rover eighteen. About three in the atternoou he came up
with us; and bringing to, by mislake,just athwart our quarter. instead
of athwart our stern, as he Intended. we brought eight of our guns to
bear on that side. and poured in a broadside upon him. which made him
sheer oll'again, alter returning our lire, and pouring in also his small shot
from near two hundred men which he had on board. However. we had
not a man touched. all our men keeping close. lie prepared to attack us
again. and we to defend ourselves; but laying us on board the next time
upon our other quarter. he entered sixty men upon our decks, who
immediately fell to cutting and hacking the sails and riggin". We plied
them with small shut. half-pikes. powder-chests, and such like. and
cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy
part of our story. our ship being disabled, and three of our men killed
and eight Wounded. we were obliged to yield. and were carried all
prisoners into Sallee. a port belonging to the Moors.

The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended: nor
was] carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest of our
men were. but was kept by the captain ot' the rover as his proper prize,
and made his slave, being young and nimble, and lit for his business.
At. this surprising change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a.
miserable slaveJ was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now looked back upon
my father's prophetic discourse to me. that I should be miserable, and
have none to relieve me; which I thought was new so effectually brought
to pass. that it could not be worse: that now the hand of Heaven had
overtaken me. and I was undone. without redemption. But, alas! this
was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as will appear in the
sequel of this story.

As my new patron. or master. had taken me. home to his house,so I
was in hopes he would take me with him when he went to sea again,
believing that it. would. some time or other. be his fate to be taken by a
Spanish or Portuguese man or war, and that then I should be set at
liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went
to sea, he lel't me on shore. to look alter his little garden, and do the com-
mon drudgery of slaves about his house; and when he came home again
from his cruise. he ordered me to lie in the cabin. to look alter the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might
take to efl'ect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it.
Nothing presented to make the supposition of it. rational; for I had
nobody to communicate it to that would embark with me: no fellow-slave,
uo Englishnmn, Irishman, or Seutclimun there hut myself; so that tiir
two years, though i oflcn pleased myself with the imagination, yet i
never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.

Alter about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put
the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head.
My patron lying at home longer than usual, without titting out his ship,
which, as I heard. was for want of money, he used constantly once or
twice a week, sometimes oftener, it' the weather was fair, to take the ship's
pinnacc,and go out into the road a fishing; and as he. always took me and
a young Moresco with him to row the boat. we made him very merry,
and 1 proved very dextrous in catching fish, insoinueh that sometimes
he would send me with a ltluor, one of his kinsmen. and the youth, the
Moresco, as they called him. to catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm morning, the
fog rose so thick that though we were not half a league from the shore,
we lost sight of it; and rowing, we knew not whither, or which way, we}.
labored all day and all the next night, and when morning came, we found
we had pulled otl' to sea, instead of pulling in for the shore, and that we
were at least two leagues from the shore: however, we got well in again.
though with a great deal of labor, and some danger, for the wind began to
blow pretty fresh in the mornii g; but particularly we were all very
hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of
himself for the future; and having lying by him the long-boat of our
English ship he had taken, be resolved he would not go a fishing any
more without a compass and some provision; so he ordered the carpenter
of the ship, who was an English slave, to build a little stateroom or cabin
in the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand
behind it, to steer and haul home the main sheet, and room before for a
hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed with what we call a
shoulder-of-mutton sail, and the boom jibbed over the top of the cabin,
which lay very snug and low, and had in it a room for him to lie, with a
slave or two and a table to eaten, with some small lockers to put in some
bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to drink, and particularly his
bread, rice, and cofl'ee.

We went frequently out with this boat a fishing. and as I was most deb
trans to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened.
that he had appointed to go out in this boat.either for pleasure or for fish.
with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for whom
he had provided extmordinarily,and ltad therefore sent on board the boat,
overnight, 3 larger store of provisions than ordinary, and had ordered me
to get ready three fusees, with powder and shot, which were on board his
ship, for that they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.
I got all things ready as he directed, and waited the next morning with
the boat washed clean, her ensign and pendants out, and every thing to
accommodate his guests: when by-and-by, my patron came on board
alone, and told me his guest had put off going, upon some business that
fell out, and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with
the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his friends Were to sup at his
house; and commanded, that as soon as I had got some fish, I should
bring it home to his house: all which I prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my
thoughts, for now] found I was like to have a little ship at my command;
and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for a fishing
business, but for a voyage; though I knew not. neither did I so much as
consider, whither I should steer; for anywhere, to get out of that place,
was my way.

My first contrivance was to make a pretense to speak to this Moor, to
get something for our subsistence on board; for I told him we must not
presume to eat of our patron's bread: he said, that was true; so he brought
a large basket of melt or biscuit, of their kind, and three jars with fresh
water in the boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood,which
it was evident, by the make, were taken out of some English prize, and I
conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had
been there before for our master. I conveyed also a great lump of bees-
wax into the boat, which weighed above half a hundred weight, with a
parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which
were of great use to us atterward, especially the wax to make candles.
Another trick I tried upon him. which he innocently came into also: his
name was Ishmael, whom they call Muley, or Moley: so I called to him,
Moley, said 1, our patron's guns are on board the boat. can you not get a
little powder and shot! it may be we may kill some alcamies (fowls like
our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the gunner's stores in the
shin--Yes, says he, I will bring some; and accordineg he brought a
great leather pouch, which held about a pound and a half of powder, or
rather more, and another with shot, that had five or six pounds. with
some bullets, and put all into the boat: at the same time I found some
powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which 1 filled one of the
large bottles in the case, which was almost empty. pouring what was in
it into another; and thus furnished with every thing needful, we sailed
out of port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew
who we were,and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out
of the port, before we hauled in our sail.and set us down to fish. The wind
blew N. N. E., which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly,
I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at last reached to
the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I
would be gone from the horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate.
After we had tlshed some time and eatehed nothing. for when I had fish
on my book I would not pull them up, that he might not see them, I said
to the Moor, This will not do; our master will not be thus served; we
must stand farther 011'. He, thinking no harm,agreed; and being at the
head of the boat, she set sails; and as I had the helm, I ran the boat near
a league farther, and then brought to, as it' I would fish. Then giving the
boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the Moor was, and I took him
by surprise, with my am under his waist, and tossed him clear overboard
into the see. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork. and called to
me, begged to be taken in, and told me he would go all the world over
with me. He swam so strong after the boat, that he would have reached
me very quickly, there being but little wind: upon which I stepped into
the cabin. and fetching one of the fowling-piecesJ presented it at him.
and told him. I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet, I would
do him none: but. said I. you swrm well enough (0 reach the shore. and
the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore, and I will do you
no harm: but it' you come near the boat, I will shoot you through the
head; for I am resolved to have my liberty. So he turned himself about.
and swam for the shore; and I make no doubt but he reached it wrth
ease, for he was an excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me and have
drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was
gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him.
Xury, If you will be faithful to me I will make you a great man; but
If you will not stroke your face to be true to me (that is, swear by
Mahomet and his fither's beard), I must throw you into the sea too.
The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently. that I could not
mistrust him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world
with me.

While 1 was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out
directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they
might think me gone toward the Stmit's mouth (as indeed any one that
had been in their wits must have been supposed to do); for who would
have suppoged we were sailing on to the southward. to the truly Bar-
barian coast. where whole nations of Negroes were sure to surround us'
with their canoes, and destroy us; where we could never once go on shore
but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more merciless savages
or human kind!

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and
steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little toward the
cast, that I might keep in with the shore; and having a fair fresh gale of
wind and a smooth, quiet sea,l made such sail, that I believe by the next
day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I made the land, I could not be
less than one hundred and titty miles south of Sallee, quite beyond the36 anvss'runss 0?

Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabout:
for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors,and the dreadful
apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or
go on shore, or come to an anchor, the wind continuing fair, till I had
sailed in that manner tlve days; and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward,l concluded also that ifany ofour vessels were in chase one, they
also would now give over: so I ventured to make to the coast, and came
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river: I know not what or where,
neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what river. I
neither saw, nor desired to see, any people; the principal thing I wanted
was fresh water. We came into this creek in the evening, resolving to
swim on shore as soon as it was dark. and discover the country: but as
soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the barking.
roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, that
the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on
shore till day. Well, Xury, said I, then I will not; but it may be we may
see men by day. who will be as bad to us as those lions.--Then we may
give them the shoot-gun, says Xury, laughing; make them run away.
Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. However,I
was glad to see the boy so cheerful. and I gave him a dram out of our
patron's case of bottles to cheer him up. Alter all, Xury's advice was
good. and I took it. We dropped our little anchor. and lay still all night:
I say. still, for we slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast
creatures (we knew not what to call them), of many sorts. come down to
the seashore. and run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves,
for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made such hideous howl-
ings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was I too; but we were
both more frightened when we heard one of these mighty creatures
swimming toward our boat: we could not see him, but we might'hear
him. by his blowing. to be a monstrous. huge, and furious beast. Xury
said it was a lion, and it might be so, for aught I know; but poor Xury
cried to me to weigh the anchor, and row away. No. says I, Xury: we
can slip our cable with a buoy to it,and go oll'to sea: they can not follow
us far. I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it
was) within two oars' length, which something surprised me however, I
immediately stepped to the cabin door, and, taking up my gun, fired at
him: upon which he immediately turned about and swam to the shore
again.

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hideous cries
and howlings that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as
higher within the country, upon the noise or report of the gun; a thing,
I believe, those creatures had never beard before. This convinced me
there was no going on shore for us in the night upon that coast; and how
to venture on shore in the day, was another question too; for to have
fallen into the hands of any of the savages. had been as bad as to have
fallen into the paws of lions and tigers; at least, we were equally appre-
hensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other
for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat: when and where to get it
was the point: Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with one of the
jars, he would find if there was any water, and bringsome to me. I asked
him why he would go; why! should not go. and he stay in the boat.
The boy answered with so much affection, that he made me love him ever
nfler. Says he. 1! wild mans come, they eat me, you go away.--Well,
Xury, said I, we will both go; and if the wild mans come, we will kill
thorn ; they shall eat neither of us. So I gave Xury a piece of melt bread
to eat, and a dram out of our patron's ease of bottles, which I mentioned
before; and we hauled in the boat as near the shore as we thought was
proper. and so waded to shore, carrying nothing but our arms, and two
jars for water.

1 did not care to go out ofsight of the boat, fearing the coming ofcanoes
with savages down the river: but the boy, seeing a low place about a mile
up the country, rambled to it; and. by-and-by,l saw him come running
toward me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or frightened by
some wild beast. and I therefore ran forward to help him; but when I
came near to him,l saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in color, and
longer legs: however, we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat:
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found
good water and seen no wild mans.

But we found afterward. that we need not take such pains for water;
for a little higher up the creek where we were, we found the water fresh
when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our
jars, slid. having a fire, feasted on the hare we had killed: and prepared
to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature in that
part of the country.

As I had been one voyage to this coast before. I lmew very well that the
islands of the Canaries, and the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far
from the coast. Butas I had no instruments to take an observation, to
find what latitude we were in; and did not exactly know, or at least re-
member. what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for them,
or when to stand 08' to sea toward them, otherwise I might now have
easily found some of these islands. But my hope was, that ifI stood
along this coast till I came to the part where the English traded. I should

find some of their vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would
relieve and take us in.
By the best ofmycalculation, the place where I now was, must be that
country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and
the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited. except by wild beasts; the
Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther south, for fear of the
Moors. and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its
barrenness: and, indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious num-
bers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbor
there: so that the Moors use it for their hunting only. where they go like
an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and, indeed, for near a
hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw nothing but a waste unin-
habited country by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of
wild beasts by night.

Once or twice, in the day-time,l thought I saw the Pica of Teneriffe,
being the top of the mountain Tenerill'e in the Canaries, and had a great
mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having tried twice,
I was forced in again by contrary winds; the sea also going too high for
my little vessel; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along
the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, alter we had left
this place; and once, in particular, being early in the morning, we came
to an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty high; and the
tide beginning to flow, we lay still, to go further in. Xury. whose eyes
were more about him than, it seems, mine were, calls softly to me. and
tells me. that we had best go farther ofl' the shore: for, says he, Look,
yonder lies a dreadml monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep.
I looked where he pointed. and saw a dreadful monster indeed. for
it was a terrible great lion, that lay on the side of the shore. under the
shade ofa piece of the hill, that hung,as it were, over him. Xury, says I,
you shall go on shore and kill him. Xury looked frightened, and said, Me
kill! he eat me at one mouth: one mouthml he meant. However, I said
no more to the boy, but bade him be still; and I took our biggest gun,
which was almost musket bore, and loaded it with a good charge of pow-
der, and with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with.
two bullets; and a third, for we had three pieces, I loaded with five smaller
bullets. [took the best aim I could with the first piece, to have shot
him in the head; but he lay so, with his leg raised a little above his nose,
that the slugs hit his leg about the knee. and broke the bone: he started
up, growling at first, but finding his leg broke. fell down again, and then
got up upon three legs. and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard.
l wuss-little surprised that! had not hit him on the head; however. I
took up the second piece immediately; and though he began to move
otl', fired again.and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to see him
drop, and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Then Xury
took heart, and would have me let him go on shore. Well, q, said I: so
the boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam
to shore with\the other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the
muzzle ofthe'piece to his car, and shot him in the head againrwhich dis-
patched him quite.

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food; and I was very sorry
to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good
for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him; so
he comes on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet: For what
Xury! said I. Mo cut 08' his head, said he. However, Xury could not
cut nfl' his head; but he cut ofl'a foot, and brought it with him, and it
was a monstrous great one. I bethought myself, however, that perhaps
the skin of him might, one way or other, be of some value to us; and I
resolved to take at? his skin, in could. So Xury and Iwent to work
with him: but Xury was much the better workman at it, lol- I knew very
ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole day; but at last we
got 011' the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun
ell'eetually dried it in two days' time and it atterward served me to lie
upon.

Alter this stop we made on to the southward continually, for ten or
twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to abate
very much, and going no ottener into the shore than we were obliged to for
fresh water. My design in this was to make the river Gambia, or Senegal;
that is to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to
meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what
course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish among the
Negroes. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to
the coast of Guinea, or to Brazil.or to the East Indies, made this caps, or
those islands: and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship, or must perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, an I have
said,I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three
places. as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us:
we could also perceive they were quite black,and stark naked. I was once
inclined to have gone on shore to them: but Xury was my better coun-
solar. and said to me. No 50, no go. However,I hauled in nearer the
shore. thatI might talk to them; and I found they ran along the shore by
me a good way. I observed they had no weapons in their hands, except
one, who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that
they would throw them a great way with good aim ; sol kept atadistance,
but talked to them by signs, as well as I cofild. and particularly made
signs for something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and
they would fetch me some meat: upon this, I lowered the top of my
sail, and lay by. and two of them ran up into the country; and in less
than half an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of dry
flesh and some com,such as is the produce of their country; butwe
neither knew what the one or the other was: however, we were willing
to accept it. But how to come at it was our next dispute, for l was not.
for venturing on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us: but
they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore, and. laid .
it down, and went and stood a great way ofl' till we fetched it on board,
and then came close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them. for we had nothing to make them
amends: but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them
wonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore, came two mighty
creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury, from the
mountains toward the sea; whetherit was the male pursuing the female,
or whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell any more than
we could tell whether it was usual or strange; butl believe it was the
latter, because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear
but in the night; and, in the second place, we found the people terribly
frightened, especially the women. The man that had the lance. or dart,
did not fly from them, but the rest did; however,a.s the two creatures
ran directly into the water. they did not seem to offer to run upon any of
the Negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if
they had come for their diversion: at last, one of them began to come
nearer our boat than I at first expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had
loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired and shot him
directly in the head: immediawa he sank down into the water. but rose
instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he was struggling for life. and
soindeed he was: he immediawa made to the shore; but between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he
died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures, at
the noise and fire of my gun; some of them were even ready to die for

fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the
creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that! made signs to them to

come to the shore, they took heart and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. I found him by his blood staining the water;
and by the help ofa rope, which I slung round him, and gave the Negroes
to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curious
leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the Negroes held
up their hands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed him
with.

The other creature, frightened with the flash of tire and the noise of
the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from
whence they came; nor could I, at that distance. know what it want. I
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature. so I
was willing to have them take it as a favor from me; which.when I made
signs to thorn that they might take him, they were very thankful for.
Immediately they fell to work with him; and though they had no knife,
yet with a sharpened piece of wood, they took oll' his skin as readily, and
much more readily. than we could have done with a knife. They olfered
me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would give it them,
but made signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provisions, which, though I did not under-
stand, yet I accepted. I then made signs to them for some water, and
held ou'. one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that
it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They called imme-
diately to some of their friends, and there came two women, and brought
a great vessel made ofearth,and burnt as I suppose in the sun; this they
set down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and
filled them all three. The women were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished .with roots and corn, such as it was, and water;
and leaving my friendly Negroes,l made forward for about eleven days
more, without ofi'ering to go near the shore, till I saw land run out a great
length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues before me;
and the sea being very calm,I kept a large ofling, to make this point. At
length. doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land,I saw
plainly-land on the other side, to see-ward: then Iconcldded, as it was
most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands,
called, from thence. Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a
great distance, and I could not,well tell what I had best to do; for if!
should be taken wit: a. gale of wind, I might neither reach one nor the
other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive,I stepped into the cabin, and
sat me down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried
out, Master, master, a ship with a sail! and the foolish boy was frightened
out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships sent
to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach.
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but
what she was, viz: that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was
bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But, when I observed the
course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound some other
way. and did not design to come any nearer to the shore: upon which, I
stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them if
possible. '

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in
their way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any signal
to them: but alter I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair,
they, it seems. saw me, by the help of their perspective glasses, and that

it was some European boat, which, thev supposed, must belong to some
4
ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was
encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ensign on board, I made
a wait ofit to them, for asignal ofdistress. and fired a gun, both of which
they saw; for they told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear
the gun. Upon these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for
me: and in about three hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what 1 was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in
French, but I understood none of them; but, at last, a'Scotch sailor who
was on board called to me, and Ianswered him. and told him I was an
Englishman, that I had made my escape outof slavery from the Moore: at
Sallee: they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and all my goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I
was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable. and almost
hopeless, condition as I was in; and I immediately ofl'ered all I had to the
captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he generously
told me he would take nothing from me. but that all I had should be
delivered safe to me, when I came to Brazil. PM, says he, I have sued
your life on no other terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and
it may, one time or other,_be my lot to be taken up in the same con-
dition. Beside, said he, when I carry you to the Brazils,so great a way
from your own country, if I should take from you what you have, you
will be starved there, and then I only take away that lifeI have given.
No, no, Senhor Inglez (Mr. Englishman), says he, I will carry you thither
in charity, and these things will help to buy your subsistence there, and
your passage home again.

AND IS WWI").

As he was charitable in this proposal,so he was just in his performance,
to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen, that none should ofi'er to touch any
thing I had: then he took every thing into his own possession and gave
me back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even so
much as my three earthen Jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me
he would buy it of me for the ship's use; and asked me what lwould
have for it. I told him. he had been so generous to me in every thing,
that I could not ofler to make any price of the boat, but let! it entirely to
him: upon which. he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay
me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any
one ofl'ered to give more,he would make it up. He ofl'ered me also sixty
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not that
I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to sell
the poor boy's liberty who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own. However, when I let him know my reasons, he owned it to be just,
and od'ered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to
set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon this, and Xury
saylng he was willing to go to him, I letthe captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay de
Todos los Santos. or All Saints' Bay. in about twenty-two days alter.
And now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all con-
ditions of life: and what to do next with myself, I was now to consider.

' The generous treatment the captain gave me,I can never enough re-
member; he would take nothing of me for my pamge, gave me twenty
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in
my boat, and caused every thing I had in the ship to' be punctually
delivered to me; and what I was willing to sell, he bought of me; such as
the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-

,--for that! made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about two
hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock,

I went on shore' in the Brazils.

I had not been long there, before I was recommended to the house of a
good honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio as they call it (that' is,
a plantation and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time, and'
acquainted myself, by that means, with the manner of planting and of
making sugar: and seeing how well the planters lived. and how they got
rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a license to settle there, I would
turn planter among them; endeavoring, in the meantime, to find out some
way to get my money, which I had let! in London, remitted to me. To
this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I purchased as
much land that was uncured as my money would reach,and formed a
plan for my plantation and settlement; such a one as might be suitable
to the stock which I propmd to myself to receive [tom England.

I had a neighbor, a Phrtuguese of Lisbon but horn of English parents,
whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as Iwas. I call
him my neighbor. because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on
very sociahly together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we
rather planted for food than any thing else, for about two years. How-
ever, we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so that
the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large
piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come: but we
both wanted help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong
in parting with my boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no great won-
der. I had no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment
quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted
in. and for which I forsouk my father's house. and broke through all his
good advice; nay,l was coming into the very middlc station. or upper
degree of low life, which my father advised me to before; and which, if
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have staid at home. and never have
fatigued myself in the world,asI had done: and I used alien to say to
myself, I could have done this as well in England, among my friends, as
have gone five thousand miles ofi' to do it among strangers and savages,
in a wilderness, and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of
the world that had the least knowledge of me.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost
regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbor;
no work to he done, but by the labor of my hands: and I used to say, I
lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that bad
nobody there but himself. But how just has it been! and how should all
men reflect. that when they compare their present~eonditions with others
that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be
convinced of their former felicity by their experience: I say, how just
has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on. in an island of mere
desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with
the life which I then led, in which, had I continued,l had in all probabil-
ity. been exceedingly prosperous and rich.

I was, in some degree. settled in my measures for carrying on the plan-
tation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up at
sea, went back; for the ship remained there, in providing his lading, and
preparing for his voyage, near three months; when, telling him what
little stock I had let! behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and
sincere advice: Senhor Inglez, says he, (for so he always called me), if
you will give me letters, and a procuration here in form to me, with
orders to the person who has your money in London, to send your effects
to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are
proper for this country,l will bring you the produce of them, God willing,
at my return: but, since human ad'airs are all subject to changes and dis-
asters, ! would have you give orders for but one hundred pounds sterling,
which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the first,
so that if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way; and, if it
miscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for your
supply. This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly. that
I could not but be convinced it was the best course I could take;
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I
left my money; and a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he
desired me.
I wrote the English captain's widow a our account of all my adven-
tures; my slavery. escape, and how } had met with the Portuguese
captain at sea, the humanity of his behavior, and what condition I was
now in. with all other necessary directions for my supply; and when this
honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English
merchants there, to send over, not the order only. but a full account of
my story to s merchant at London, who represented it elfectually to her;
whereupon she not only delivered the money, but. out of her own pocket,
sent the Portuguese captain a very handsome present for his humanity
and charity to me.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in_English
goods, such as the captain had wrote for, sent them dimetly to him at
Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me at the Brazils; among which.
without my direction (for l was too young in my business to think of
them), he had taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils,
necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me. When
this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised
with the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid out the
five pounds, which my friend had sent him as a present for himself, to
purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years' service,
and would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which
1 would have him accept, being of my own produce. Neither was this
all: but my goods being all English manufactures, such as cloths, stulfi,
balls, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the country,I
found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that 1 might say,
I had more than four times the value of my first cargo, and was now
infinitely beyond my poor neighbor,l mean in the advancement of my
plantation; for the first thing I did,l bought me a Negro slave, and a
European servant also; I mean another beside that which the captain
brought me from Lisbon.

Butasabused prosperity is oftentimes made the means ofour adversity,
so was it with me. I went on the next year with great success in my
plantation; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my own ground, more
than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbors; and these
titty rolls, being each of above one hundred pounds weight, were well
cured, and laid by against the return 'of the fleet from Lisbon: and now,
increasing in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects
and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are, indeed, ofien the ruin
of the best heads in business. Bad I continued in the station I was now
in. I had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which
my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and which he
had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full of: but
other things attended me, and I was still to be the willful agent of all my
own miseries; and, particulary,to increase my fault, and double the
reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should have
leisure to make, all these miscar'iages were procured by my apparent
obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering about. and
pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of doing
myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and these
measures of life, which nature and providence concurred to present me
with, and to make my duty. .

As I had once done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I could
not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of
being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a
rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing
admitted; and thus [cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with
life, and a state of health in the world.

To come, then, by just degrees, to the particulars of this part of my
story :--You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the
Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my planta-
tion, I had not only learned the language, but had contractedan acquaint-
ance and friendship among my fellow-planters. as well as among the
merchants of St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in my dis-
courses among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two
voyages tn the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase on the crest for tritles--such as
beads, toys, "nives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like--not only
gold dust. Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, etc., but Negroes for the ser-
vice ot' the Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on those heads,
but especially to the part which related to buying Negroes; which was a
trade, at that time, not only not far entered into. but, as far as it was, had
been carried on by the astienloa, or permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed from the public; so that few Negroes were
bought. and those excessively clear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of
my acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly. three or them
came to me next morning. and told me they had been musing very much
upon what I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came
to make a secret proposal to me: and, alter enjoining me to secresy, they
told me that they had a mind to tit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they
had all plantations as well as l. and were straitened for nothing so much as
servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because
they could not publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so they
desired to make but one voyage. to bring the Negroes on shore privately,
and divide them among their own plantations: and. in a word, the ques-
tion was, whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the
trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they ofl'ered me that I should
' have an equal share of the Negroes, without providing any part of the
stock. \

This was a fair proposal. it must be confessed. had it been made to any
one that had not a settlement and plantation of his own to look alter,
which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with a
good stock upon it. But for me, that was just entered and established,
and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for three or four years
more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from England; and
who. in that time, andwvith thatlittle addition, could agree have failed
of being worth threeyr four thousand pounds sterling, "and that inc'reab
ing too; for mo to thinK'ot' such avoyge, was the most preposterous
thing that ever mw',in.m'SSi'F-"lmmfiafcdeguld be guilty. of.

But I, that was mm sanguin- d'estroyerwould no more resist the

all my heart, if the wow undertake to look alter my plantation in my
absence. and wou disuse of it to such as I should direct, it' I miscarried.
This they all engged "Q3. and entered into writings or covenants to do
so; and I made a to will, disposing of my plantation and etl'ects, in
case of my death; ma ' the captain of the ship that had saved my life,
as before, my universal heir; but obliging him to dispose of my efliacts as
I had directed in my": one half of the produce being to himself. and
the other tort); shipped to England. In short, I took all possible caution
to preserve my efi'ects, and to happy my plantation: had I used half as
much prudence to have looked into iny own interest, and have made a
judgment of what I ought to have done'nd not to have done. I had cer-
tainly never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking. leaving all
the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage to sea,
attended with all its common hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had
to expect particular misfortunes to myself.

But I was hurried on and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy,
rather than my reason: and accordingly, the ship being titted out, and
the cargo furnished. and all things done as by agreement, by my partners
in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour again, the first of Septem-
ber, 1659, being the same day eight years that I went from my parents at
Ilull in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own
Interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six
guns, and fourteen men. beside the master, his boy, and myself; we had
on board no large cargo of goods except of such toys as were tit for
our trade with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and

oldd trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets and
I Is like.
The very same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the
northward upon our own coast, with ll design to stretch over for the

that of the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great River; rind began
to consult with me what course he should take. for the ship was leaky
and very much disabled, and he was for going directly back to the coast
of Brazil.

I was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the sea-
coast of America with him. we concluded there was no inhabited country
for us to have recourse .to, till we came within the circle of the Caribhee
islands and therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes: which. by

might easily perform. as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail: whereas

saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by
savages than ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men
early in the morning. cried out, Land! and we had no sooner run out of
the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being
so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven
into our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the
sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition, to
describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances : we
knew nothing Where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven,
whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and
as the rage of the wind was still great. though rather less than at first,
we could noted much as hope to have the ship held many minutes with-
out breaking in dpiecesgunless the wind, by a kind of miracle, should
immediately tup about. its a word, we sat looking upon one another,
and expecting deaflsge'veiy moment, and every man acting accordingly,
as preparing for another world; for there was little or nothing more for
us to do in this: ths'iewhich was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was, that. contrary to our expectation, the shindid not break
yet and that the master said. the wind began to abate. . '

Now,though we thought that tbewihd did a little abate, yet the ship
having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect
her getting 03'. we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing
to do but to think ofsaving our lives as well as we could. We had a boat
at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by dashing
against the ship's rudder. and, in the next place, she broke away, and
either sank, or was driven ofl' to sea: 'so .there was no hope from her; we
had another boat on board. but how us get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing; however, there was no room to debate, for we fancied the
ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us she was
actually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and with
the help of the rest of the'rnen, they got her flung over the ship's side;
and getting all into her, let her go, and committed ourselves, being eleven
in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea: for though the storm was
abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon the shore, and
mittht be well called den wild 2:2, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly, that
the sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should be
Inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none; nor, if we had.

could We have done any thing with it; so we worked at the oar toward
5
the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution: for we
all knew that when the boat came nearer to shore, she would be dashed
in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed
our souls to God in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us
toward the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, pull-
ing as well as we could toward land.

What the shore was--whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal--we
knew not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow
of expectation, was, if we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the
mouth of some river, where by great chance we might have run our boat
in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.
But there was nothing of this appeared; and as we made nearer and
nearer the share, the land looked more frightful than the sea

After we had rowed or rather driven, about a league and a half, as we
reckoned it, a raging wave, mountainlike, came rolling atom of us, and
plainly bade us expect the coup de grace. In sword, it took us with
such a fury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us, as well
from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say, " Oh
God!" for we were all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I
sank into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver
myself from the waves so as to draw my breath, till that wave having
driven me, or rather carried me,a vast ,way on toward the shore, and
having spent itself, went back, and let! me upon the land almost dry, but
half dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as
wellas breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I ex-
pected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to make on toward the land
as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take me up
again; butl soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea
come after me as high as agreat hill, and as furious as an enemy which I
. had no means or strength to contend with: my business was to hold my
breath,and raise myself upon the water, it'l couldzand so, by swimming,
to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself toward the shore, if possible;
my greatest concern now being, that the wave, as it would carry me a
great way toward the shore when it came on, might not carry me back
again with it when it gave back toward the sea

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty
feet deep in its own body; and I could feel myself carried with a mighty
force and swinness toward the shore,a very great way; but I held my
breath, and assisted myself hoswim still forward with all my might. I
was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising
up, so, to my immediate relief. I found my head and hands shoot out
above the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time Illat I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me
breath and new courage.' I was covered again with water a good while,
but not so long but I held it out: and finding the water had spent itself.
and began to return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, and
felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few moments, to recover
breath, and till the water went from me, and then took to my heels, and
ran with what strength I had farther toward the shore. But neither
would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in
alter me again; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried
forward as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me; for the sea
having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me against
a piece of a rock, and that with such force, that it left me senseless, and
indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow taking my side
and breast, beat the breath, as it were, Quite out of my body; and had it
returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water;
but I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I should
again be covered with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now
as the waves were not so high as the first, being nearer land, I held my
hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which brought
me so near the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did
notso swallow me up as to carry me away; and the next run I took, I got
to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of
the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite
out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore; and began to look up and thank
God that my life was saved, in a case wherein there were, some minutes
before, scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to
the life, what the eestaciee and transports of the soul are, when it is so
saved, as I may say, out of the grave: and I did not wonder now at the
custom, viz: that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck,
is tied up, and just going to be turned 01?, and has a reprieve brought to
him; I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him
blood that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not
drive the animal spirits from the heart, and overwhelm him.

For sudden Joya, like grids, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being,
as I may say, wrapped up in the contemplation of my deliverance; mak-
ing a thousand gestures and motions, which I can not describe; reflecting
upon my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one
soul saved but myself. for, as for them, I never saw them afterward, or

any sign of them, except three of the hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel--when the breach and froth of the
sea being so big! could hardly see it, it lay so IaroE--end considered,
Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore. 7

AflerI bad solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition,
I began to look round me, to see what kind of a place I was in, and what
was next to be done: and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in
a word, I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to
shift me, nor any thing either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither
did I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with hunger. or
being devoured by wild beasts: and that which was particularly amicting
to me was, that I had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for
my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature that might
desire to kill me for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife,
a tobacco~pipe, and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision;
and this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that, for a while I
ran about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
heart, to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous
beasts in that country, seeing at night they always come abroad for their
prey.

AU the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time. was, to get up
into a thick bushy tree, like a. fir, but thomy--which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night--and consider the next day what death I
should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong
from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I
did, to my great joy; and having drank. and put a little tobacco into my
mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, en-
deavored to place myself so,as that if lshould fall asleep, I might not
fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defense, I
took up my lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast
asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my
condition; and found myself the most refreshed with it that I think I
ever was on such an occasion.

Want I waited it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm
abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that which
surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted 011' in the night {tom the
sand where she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost
as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised
by the wave dashing me against it. This being within about a mile Rom
the shore where Iwas, and the ship seeming to stand upright still. I
wished myself on board, that at least I might save some necessary things
for my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree. I looked about me
again. and the first thing I found was the boat; which lay, as the wind
and the sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my
right hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her;
but found a neck, or inlet. of water, between me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more
intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my
present subsistence.

A little alter noon I found the see very calm, and the tide ebbed so far
out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship: and here I
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for! saw evidently that if we had
kept on board, we had been all safe; that is to say. we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be lelt entirely. destitute of
all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears from my eyes
again; but as-there was little relief in that. I resolved, if poaible, to get
to the ship; so I pulled of my clothes, for the weatherwas hot to ex.
tremity. and toolr the water: but when I came to the ship, my difficulty
was still greater to know how to get on board; for asshe lay aground, and
high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold of.
I swam around her twice. and the second time I spied a small piece of a
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hanging down by the fore-
chains so low, as that with great dimculty. I got hold of it, and by the help
of that rope got into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found that the ship
was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her bold; but that she lay so
on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth. that her stern lay lined
up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water. By this means.
all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was dry; for you may
be sure my first work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what
was flee: and, first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry and
untouched by the water; and, being very well dispoud to eat, I went into
the bread-room, and filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it all went
about other things. for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in
the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had indeed
need enough of, to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted
nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me. .

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and this
extremity rousg my application: we had several spare yards. and two
or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship; I
resolved to fall to work with these, and flung as manyoverboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope. that they might not
drive away. When this was done, I went down the ship's side, and pull-
ing them to me. I tied four of them fast together at both ends, as well as
I could, in the form of a raft. and laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it
was not able to bear any great Weight, the pieces being too light: so I
went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cuta spare topmast into three
lengths and added them to my ran, with a great deal of labor and pains.
But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me to
go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another
occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My
next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what! laid upon
it Item the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this. I first
laid all the planks or boards upon it that Icould get, and having con-
sidered well whatI most wanted, I got three of the seamen's chests, which
I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my ran;
these I filled with provisions. viz: broad, rice. three Dutch cheeses, five
piews of dried goat's fiesh (which we lived much upon),_and a little re~
mainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls which
we had brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There had been
some barley and wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, I found
afierward that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors,I found
several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some cor~
dial waters; and, in all. about five or six gallons of rack. These I stowed
by themselves, there being no need to put them into the chests, nor any
room for them. While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow,
though very calm; and I had the mortificstion to see my coat, shirt, and
waistcoat, which I had left on shore. upon the sand. swim away ; as for my
breeches, which were only linemand open-kneed, I swam on board in them,
and my stockings. However, this put me upon rummaging for clothes,
of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use,
for! had other things which my eye was more upon; as. first, tools to
work with on shore: and it was after a long searching that 1 found the
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much
more valuable than a shm-lading of gold would have been at that time.
I got it down to my raft, even whole as it was. without losing time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two
very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols; these I
secured first. with some powder-horns. and a small bag of shot, and two
old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship,
but knew not where the gunner nad stowed them; but vmh much search

'42ROBINSON causoe. 55

I found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water.
These two~I got to my ran, with the arms. And now I thought myself
pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with
them, having neither' sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capfull of wind
would have overset all my navigation.

I had three encouragements: let, A smooth calm sea: 2dly, The tide
rising and setting in to the shore: 3dly, What little wind there was, blew
me toward the land. And thus having found two or three broken oars
belonging to the boat, and beside the tools which were in the chest, 1'
found two saws, an ax, and a hammer; and with this cargo I put to see.
For a mile, or thereabouts, my ran went very well, only that I found it
drive a little distant from the place where I had landed before; by which
I perceived that there was some indrait of the water, and consequently I
hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might make use of as a
port to get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was: there appeared before me a little opening of
the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided
my raft, as well as I could, to get~into the middle of the stream. But here I
had like to have sull'ered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily
would have broken my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my ralt
ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal. and not being aground at the
other end. it wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped ofl' toward
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost,
by setting my back against the cheats, to keep them in their places, but
could not thrust 03' the raft with all my strength; neither durst I stir from
the posture I wasin, but holding up the cheats with all my might, I stood
in that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the water
brought me a little more upon a level; and a little after, the water still
rising, my ran floated again, and I thrust her otl' with the oar I had. into the
channel, and then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the
mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or
tide running up. I looked on both sides fora proper place to get to shore.
for I was not willing to be driven too high up the river; hoping in time,
to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself-s near the
coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which,
with great pain and difficulty, I guided my ralt, and at last got so lieu,
as that reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in; but
here I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that '
shore lying pretty sleep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to land.
but where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and
the other sink lower,as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All
that I could do, was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the
ran with my car like an anchor, to hold the side of it fist to the shore

.0-
'56 svvas'rmzss or

near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow over;
and so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for my ran drew about
a foot of water,I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there
fastened or moored her, by sticking my two broken cars into the ground,
one on one side, near one end, and one on the other side, near the other
end: and thus I lay an the water ebbed away, and let! my raft and all my
cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my
habitation. and where to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent,
or onan island; whether inhabited, or not inhabited: whether in danger
of wild beasts, or not. There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which
rose up very swep and high, and which seemed to overtop some other
hills, which lay as in a ridge (tom it northward. I took out one of the
feasting-pieces, and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus
armed, I traveled for discovery up to the top of that hill; where, alter I
had, with great labor and ditiiculty. got up to the top, I saw my fate, to
my great aflliction. viz: that I was in an island, environed every way with
the see, no lend to be seen, except some rocks, which lay a great way ofi',
and two small islands, less than this, which lay about three leagues to the
west.

1 found also that the island Iwas in was barren, and. as I saw good
reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of whom, however,
I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds:
neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was fit for food, and what
not. At my coming back, I shot a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a
tree, on the side of a great wood. I believe it was the first gun that had
been fired there since the creation of the world: I had no sooner fired, but
from all parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls,
of many sorts, making a confused screaming, and crying, every one
according to his usual note; but not one of them of any kind that I knew.
As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of s hawk, its color and
beak, resembling it, but it had no talons or claws more than common. Its
flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my run, and fell to work
to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day: what
to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest: for I
was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast

' might devour me; though, as I atterward found. there was reslly no need
Ibr those fears. However, as well as I could. I barricadoed myself round
with the cheats and boards that I had brought on shore and made a kind
of a hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures, like hares,
run out of the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out
of the ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the '
rigging and the sails, and such other things as might come to Iuml: and I
resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel. if possible. And us
I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in
pieces. I resolved to set all other things apart, till I got every thing out of
the ship that Icould get. Then [called a council. that is to say. in my
thoughts, whether I should take back the raft; but this appeared im-
practicable: so I resolved to go as before, when the tide was down; and
I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my but: having nothing
on but a checkered shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps on
my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft; and hav-
ing had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor
loaded it so hard, but yetI brought away several things very useful to
me: as, first, in the carpenter's stores, I found two or three bags of nails
and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets; and above all.
that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these I secured together,
with several things belonging to the gunner; particularly, two or three
iron crews, and two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and
another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of powder more; a
large bag mu of small shot, and a great roll of sheet lead; but this last
was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side. Beside
these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could find, and a spare
foretopsail, a hammock, and some beddingzand with this I loaded my
second ratt, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great
comfort.

I was under some apprehensions lest, during my absence from the land.
my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I came back I
found no sign of any visitor; only there sat a creature like a wild cat
upon one of the chests, which, when I came toward it, ran away a little
dietance.'and then stood still. She sat very comm and unconcerned.
and looked full in myface, as if she had a mind to be acquainwd with
me. I presented my gun to her, but, as she did not understand it, she
was perfectly unconcerned at it. nor did she error to stir away; upon
which I tossed her a bit of a biscuit, though, by the way, I was not very
free of it, for my store was not great; however, I spared her a hit, I say,
and she went to it, smeJled of it, and ate it, and looked (as pleased) for
more; but I thanked her, and could spare no more; so she marched nfl'.

Having got my second cargo on shorhthough I was thin to open the
barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,
being large cash--I went to work to make me a little tent. with the sail,
and some poles, which I cut for that purpose; and into this tent I brought

. every thing that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun; and I piled

.A' A'a x -
all the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it
from any sudden attempt either from man or beast.

When I had done this.I blocked up the door of the tent with some
boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without: and spread-
ing one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my
head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first time and
slept very quietly all night. for I was very weary and heavy; for the night
before I had slept little, and had labored hard all day, as well to fetch all
those things from the ship, as to get them on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I
believe, for one man: but I was not. satisfied still; for while the ship. sat
upright in that posture. I thought I ought to have every thing out of her
that! could: so every day, at low water, I went on board, and brought
away something or other: but particularly, the third time I went, I
brought away as much of the rigging as I eould,as also all the small
ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which
was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpow-
der. In a word. I brought away all the sails first and last; only that
I was fain to cut them in pines, and bring as much at a time as I could;
for they were no more useful to be sails, but as mere canvas only.

But that which comforted me still more was, that, last of all,aflerI
had made live or six such voyages as these, and thought! had nothing
more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with; I say,
alter all this, I found a great hogahead of bread. and three large runlets
of rum or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was
surprising to me. because I had given over expecting any more provi-
sions. except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogs-
head of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel. in pieces of the
sails, which I cut out; and. in a word, I got all this safe on shore also.

The next day I made another voyage, and now having plundered the
ship of what was portable and fit to hand out,I began with the cables,
and cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two
cables and a hawser on shore, with an the iron work I could get; and hav.
ing cut down the spritsail-yard,and the miuen-yard, and every thing I
could. to makes large ralt,I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and
came away: but my good luck began now to leave me; for this ratt was
so unwieldy, and so overladen, that alter I was entered the little cove.
whereI had landed the rest of my goods, not being able to guide itso
handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into
the water; as for myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore;
but as to my cargo, it was a great part of it lost, especially the iron, which
I expected would have been of great use to me: however, when the tide
was out,l got most of the pieces of cables ashore. and some of the iron,
though with infinite labor; for I was fain to dip for it into the water. anoemsou season. 59

work which htigued me very much. After this I went every day on
board, and brought away what I could get.

lhad been new thirteen days ashore, and had been eleven times on
board the ship: in which time I had brought away all that one pair of
hands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I believe verily,
had the calm weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship,
piece by piece; but preparing, the twelllh time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however, at low water, I went on board; and
though I thought I had rummaged the cabin so efl'eetually, as that
nothing could be found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in
one of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large scissors,
with some ten ora dozen of good knives and tbrks; in anotherI round
about thirty-six pounds value in money, some European coin, some
Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold. and some silver. .

tsmiled to myself at the eight of this money: 0h drug! I exclaimed,
what art than good for! Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking
on' the ground; one of those knives'is worth all this heap: I have no man-
ner of use for thee, e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a
creature whose life is not worth saving. However, upon second thoughts,
1 took -it away; and wrapping .all this in a piece of canvas, I began to
think of making another rain but while I was preparing thia,I found the
sky overcast, and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it
blew a flesh gale from the shore. lt presently occurred to me, that it
was in vain to pretend to make a rat! with the wind 03' shore; and that
it was my business to be gone before the tide or flood began, or otherwise
I might not be able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly, I let myself
down into me water, and swam across the channel whichlay between
the ship and the sands, and even that with dimculty enough, partly with
the weight of the things I had about me, and partly the roughness of the
water; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high water
it blew a storm. .

But I was get home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth
about me very secure. It blew very hard all that night, and in the mom-
ing, when I looked out, behold, no more ship was to be seen! Iwasa
little surprised, but recovered myself with this satisfactory reflection,
viz: that I had lost no time. nor abewd no diligence, to get every thing
out of her that could be useful to me. and that, indeed, there was little
left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

'1 now gave over any more thoughts of the ship. or of any thing out of
her, except what might drive on shore, from her wreck: as. indeed, divers
pieces of her anerward did; but those things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against
either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts. if any were in the
island; and 1 had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what
kind of dwelling to make, whether I should make me a cave in the earth,
or a tent upon the earth: and in short, I resolved upon both; the manner
and description of which, it may not be improper to give an account of.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particularly
because it was upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed
it would not be wholesome: and more particula'rly because there was no
fresh water near it: so I resolved to find a more healthy and more con-
venient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be
proper for me: first. air and fresh water, I just now mentioned: secondly,
shelter from the heat of the sun: thirdly, security from ravenous crea-
tures. whether men or beasts: fourthly, a view to the see, that if God sent
any ship in sight, I might not lose any advantage for my deliverance, of

~ which 1 was not willing to banish all my expectation yet.

In search for a place proper for this, 1 found a little plain on the side at
a rising hill, whose front toward this little plain was steep as a house side.
so that nothing could come down upon me from the top. 0n the side of
this rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance
or door ofa cave; but there was not really any cave, or way into the
at all. '

0n the list of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to
pitch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and
about twice as long, and lay like a green before my door; and. at the end
of it, descended irregularly every way down into the low ground by the
seaside. It was on the N. N. W., side of the hill; so that it was sheltered
from the heat every day, tiu it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
which, in those countries, is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle before the hollow place.
which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and
.twenty yards in its diameter, them its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes. driving them
into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being
out of the ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top.
The two rows did not stand above six inches n-om one another.

Then I took the piews of cable which I cut in the ship, and laid them
in rows one upon another, within the circle, between these two rows of
stakes, up to the top. placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against
them. about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence
was so strong, that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it.
This cost me a great deal of time and labor, especially to cut the piles in,
the woods. bring them to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to he not by a door, but by a short
ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in. I lined over alter
me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought, fromnonmsox 030802. 61

I could not have done; though, as it appeared alien-ward, there was no
need at all this caution against the enemies that I apprehended danger
from.

INN this fence or fortress, with infinite labor, I carried all my riches,
all my provisions, ammunition,and stores, of which you have the account
above, and I made a large tent, which, to preserve me than: the rains, that
in one part of the year are very violent there, I made double, viz: one
smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it, and covered the upper-
most with s large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had brought on
shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and
belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing that would
spoil by the wet; and having thus inclosed all my goods, I made up the
entrance,which tiflnowlhadleltopemandsopaasedandrepassed, asl
said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and
bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent. I
laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised
the ground within shout a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave,
just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. It cost
me much labor and many days, beam all these things were brought to per-
fection; and therebrs I must go back to some other things which took up
some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, alter I had laid my
scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of
rain falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning hap-
pened, and alter that, a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the eflbct o!
it. I was not so much surprised with the lightning, as I was with a
thought which darted into my mind asswitt as the lightning itself: on my
powder! My very heart sank within me when I thought, that at one
blast, all my powder might be destroyedgou which, not my defense only,
but the providing no food as I thought, entirely depended. I was nothing
near so anxious about my own danger, though, had the powder took fire,
I had never known who had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me, that afier the storm was over,
I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself
to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and keep it a little and a
little in a parcel, in hope that whatever might come, it might not all take
fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make
one part fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; and I
think my powder, which in all was about two hundred and forty pounds
weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel
that had been wet, I did not apprehend any dan'ger from that; so I placed
it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen, and the rest
I hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come
to it, marking very carefully where I laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out at least once
every day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I could
kill any thing fit for food; and as near as I could, to acquaint myself
with what the island produwd. The first time I want out,I presently
discovered that there were goats upon the island, which was great satin.
faction to me; but then it was'attended with this misfortune to me, viz:
that they were so shy,so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most
diflicult thing in the world to come at them; but I was not discouraged
at this, not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap-
pened; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this man-
ner for them: I observed, if they saw me in the valleys, though they '
were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright; but if
they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks. they took no
notice of me; from whence 1 concluded, that by the position of their
optics, their sight was so direct downward, that they did not readily see
objects that were above them; so, afterward, I took this method--I always
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently a fair
mark. The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat,
which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved mo
heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her, till I
came and took her up; and not only so, but when Icarried the old one with
me, upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my inclosure; upon
which, I laid down the dam. and took the kid in my arms, and carried it
over my pus, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not eat; so
Iwas forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These two supplied me with
flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly, and preserved my provisions (my
bread especially) as much as possibly 1 could. .

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to pro-
vide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for that,
as also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall
given full account of it in its proper place: but! must first give some
little account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which, it may
well be supposed, were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition: for as I was not castaway
upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a violent storm
quite out of the course ofour intended voyage, and a great way, viz: some
hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course of the trade of mankind,
I had great reason to consider it as a determination of Heaven, that in
this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I should end my life.
The tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these reflec-
tions: and sometimes I would expostulate with myself why Providence
should thus completely ruin its creatures, and render them so absolutely
miserable; soabandoned without help,so entirely depressed, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.

Butsomething always rstumed swift upon me to check these thoughts,
and to reprove me: and particularly, one day, walking with my gun in
my hand, by the seaside, I was very pensive upon the subject of my
present condition, when reason, as it were, expostnlated with me the
other way, thus: Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true; but
pray remember where are the rest ofyou'! Did not you come eleven of
you into the boat! Where are the ten! Why were not they saved, and
you lost! Why were you singled out! Is it better to be here or there!
And then I pointed to the see. All evils are to be considered with the
good that is in them, and with what worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for my subsist-
ence, and what. would have been my case if it had not happened (which
was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated from the place
where she first struck, and was driven so near to the shore, that I had
time to get all these things out of her: what would have been my case,
if I had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first came on
shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to supply and procure
them! Particularly, said I aloud (though to myself), what should I have
done without a gun. without ammunition, without any tools to niake any
thing, or to work with, without clothes, bedding,a tent, or any manner
of covering! and that now! had all these to a sumcieut quantity. and
was in a fair way to provide myself in such a manner as to live without
my gun, when my ammunition was spent: so that I had a tolerable view
of subsisting, without any want, as long as I lived; for I considered, from
the beginning, how I would provide for the accidents that might happen,
and for the time that was to come, not only alter my ammunition should
be spent, but even after my health or strength should decay.

l confess,l had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being
destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being blown up by lightning;
and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me, when it lightened
and thundered, as I observed just now.

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent
life, such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall take
it from its beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my
account, the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above said,l first
set foot upon this horrid island; when the sun being to us in its autum-
nal equinox, was almost just over my head: for l reckoned myself, by
observation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty-two minutes
north of the line.

Ann I had been there about ten or twelve days. it came into my
thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of books, and
pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days fiom the working
days: but, to prevent this, I cut it with my knife upon a large post. in
capital letters: and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the shore
where I firstlsnded, viz: "I came on shore here on the 30th of September,
1659." Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and
every first day of the month as long again as that long one: and thus!
kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.

But it happened. that among the many things which I brought out of
the ship, in the several voyages which, as above mentioned, I made to it,
I got several things of less value, but not at all less useful to me. which I
found, some time after, in rummaging the chests; as, in particular. pens.
ink, and paper; several porcelain the captain's, mate's, gunner's and ear-
penter'a keeping; three or four compasses, some mathematical instru-
ments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation: alehich I
huddled together, whether I might want them or no: also I found three
very good Bibles, which came to me in my cargo fiom England, and
which I had packed up among my things; some Portuguese books also,
and among them, two or three popish prayer~books. and several other
books, all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget, that we had
in the ship adog, and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have occa-
sion to say something, in its place: forI carried both the cats with me;
and as for the dog.he jumped out of the ship himself, and swam on
shore to me the day after I went on'shore with my first cargo, and was a
trusty servant to me for many years: I wanted nothing that he could
fetch me. nor any company that he could make up to me. I only wanted
to have him talk to me, but that would not do. As I observed before. I
found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and I
shall show that while my in]: lasted.I kept things very exact, but after
that was gone. I could not; for I could not make any ink, by any means
that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding
all that I had amassed together; and of these, this of ink was one; as also
a spade, pickax, and shovel. to dig or remove the earth ; needles, pins, and
thread; as for linen, I soon learned to want that without much dimculty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily; and it was
near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or sur-

rounded my habitation. The piles or stakes which wereas heavyas I .

could well liit, were along time in cutting and preparing in the woods,
and more, by tar, in bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days
in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third day in driv-
ing it into the ground; for which purpose, I got a heavy piece of wood at
first, but at last bethought myself of one of the iron crows: which,
however, though I found it answer, made driving these posts or piles
very laborious and tedious work. But what need I have been con-
cerned at the tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had time
enough to do it in! nor had I any other employment, if that had been
over, at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for
food; which I did, more or less every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstance
I was reduced to; and I drew up the state or my aflhim in writing. not
so much to leave them to any that were to come alter me (for I was like
to have but few heirs), as to deliver my thoughts (torn daily poring upon
them,and afliicting my mind; and as my reason began now to master
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could. and to set
the good against the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my
case from worse; and I stated very impartially, like debtor and creditor,
the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I sufl'ered thus:

Upon the whole. here was an undoubted testimony that there was
scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but there was something
negative, or something positive, to be thankful for in it: and let this stand
as a direction, from the experience of the most miserable ofall conditions
in this world, that we may always find in it something to comfort our-
selves from. and to set, in the description of good and evil, on the credit
side of the account.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given
over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over
these things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of living,
and to make things as easy to me as I could.

I have already described my habitation. which was a tent under the
side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables; but I
might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall against it of
turflr, about two feet thick on the outside : and alter some time (I think it
was a year and a halt) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock. and
thatched or wvered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could
get to keep out the rain; which I found, at some times of the year, very
violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and
into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observe. too,
that at first this was a confused heap of goods which, as they lay in no
order, so they took up all my place, I had no room to turn myself: so I
set myself to enlarge my cave. and work farther into the earth 3 for it was
a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labor ['bestowed on it:
and when I found I was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey,I worked
sideways, to the right hand, into the rock, and then turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside
of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back way to my
tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I
found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these
I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world; I could not
write, or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure. without a table:
so I went to work. And here I must needs observe, that as reason is the
substance and original of the mathematics. so by stating and squaring
every thing by reason, and 'by making the most rational judgment of
things, every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic art. I had
never handled a tool in my life; and yet, in time, by labor, application.
and contrivance, I found. at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have
made, especially if I had had tools. However, I made abundance of
things, even without tools; and some with no more tools than an atlas and
a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, and that with
infinite labor. For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but
to cut down a tree, set it on an edge before me, and hew it list on either
side with my ax, till I had brought it to he as thin as a plank, and then
dub it smooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I could make but
one board of awholo tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience,
any more than I had fora prodigious deal of time and labor which it took
me up to make a plank or board: but my time or labor was little worth.
and so it was as well employed one way as another.

However,I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the
first place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought
on my rail. from the ship. But when I wrought out some boards, as
above, I made large shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over
another, all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron
work on: and, in a word, to separate every thing at large in their places,
that I might easily come at them. I knocked pieces into the wall of the
rock, to hang my guns, and all things that would hang up; so that had
my cave been men, it looked like a general magazine of all necessary
things; and I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it was a great
pleasure to me to see all my goods in such order and especially to find my
stock of all uecessuies so great. '

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's employ-
ment; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and not only as to
labor, but in much discomposure of mind; and my journal would, too,
have been full of many dull things; for example, I must have said thus--
" Sept. 30th. A r I had got to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead
of being than I to God for my deliverance, having first vomited with
the great quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach, and
recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and
beating my head and face,exclsiming at my misery, and crying out. I was
undone, undone! nu, tired and him, I was forced to lie down on the
ground to repose; but durst not sleep, for fear of being devoured."

Some days after this, and alter I had been on board the ship and got all
that I could out of her, I could not forbear getting up to the top ofa little
mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship: then fancy
that, at a vast distance, I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it,
and, after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit
down and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by my folly.

But, having gotten over these things in some measure, and having set-
tled my household stutf and habitation, made me a table and a chair,
and all as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal: of
which I shall here give you the copy (though in it will be toldsu these
particulars over again) as long as it lasted; for, having no more ink, I was
forwd to leave it ofi:

Sunless 30th, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the ofllng,came on shore on this
dismal, unfortunate island, which I called the Issue or Dsspaln; all the
rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of that day! spent in amicting myself at the dismal cir-
cumstances I was brought to, viz: I had neither food, house, clothes,
weapon, nor place to fly to ; and, in despair ofany relief, saw nothing but
death before me; that I should either be devoured by wild beasts, mur-
dered by savages, or starved to death for want of food. At the approach
of night! slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.

Oman 1. In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, thership had
floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer the
island; which, as it was some comfort on one hand (for seeing her sit up-
right, and not broken in pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get
on board, and get some food and necessaries out of her for my'relien, so,
on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of n? 'comrades. who,
I imagined, if we had all staid on board, might have save the ship. or, at
least, that they would not have been all drowned, but they wife: and that
had the men been saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat. out of
the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other part of the world.
I spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on these things; but, at
length, seeing the ship almost dry,I went upon the sand as nearss l '
could. and then swam on board. This day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all.

From the 1st ofOctober to the 24th. All these days entirely spent in
many several voyages in get all I could out of the ship; which I brought
on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in these days,
though with some intervals affiir weather: but it seems, this was the
rainy season. '

001220. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but
being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered
many of- them when the tide was out.

001.25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind; during
which time the ship broke in pieces (the wind blowing a little harder
than before) and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her, and
that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and securing the
goods which I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.

001'. 23. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place to
fix my habitation; greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack
in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Toward night I fixed upon
a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encamp-
ment; which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall or fortification,
made of double piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.

From theesth to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying all my goods
to my new habitation, though some part of the time it rained exceedingly
herd.

The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gulf, to
seek for some food. and discover the country; when I killed a she-goat,
and her kid followed me home, which I afterward killed also, because it
would not feed.

Nomasa l. I set up my tent under a rock. and lay there for the first
night; making itas large as I could, with stakes driven in toswing my
hammock upon.

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and hoards,and the pieces of timber
which made my rails; and with them formed a fence round me, a little
within the place I had marked out for my tbrtiflcation.

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks,
which were very good food. In the alternoon I went to workto make
me a table. WP... ._ .

Nov. 4. This morning I beganto order my times of w6rk of going out
with my gun, tilne of sleep, and time of diversion; viz: every morning I
walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then
employed myself to work till about eleven o'clock; then ate what I had
to live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
exceuivo hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The working
part of this day and the next was whouy employed in making my table,
for I was yet but a very sorry workman: though time and necessity made
me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would any
one else. - _

Nov. 5. This day, went abroad with my gun and dog, and killed a wild
cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing: ofevery creature
that I killed I took at! the skins, and preserved them. Coming back by
the seashore, I saw many sorts of seafowl which I did not understand:
but was surprised, and almost frightened, with two or three seals; which,
while I was gazing at them (not well knowing what they were), got into
the sea, and escaped me for that time.

Nov. a. After my morning walk, I went to work with my table again,

and finished it. though not to my liking: nor was it long before I learned
to mend it.
Nov. 1. Now it began to be settled fair weather. 'Bhe 7th, 8th,9th
10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday, according to my
reckoning),,l took wholly up to make me a chair. and with much ado
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and, even in the
making, I pulled it in pieces several times.

Nora. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark
for them on my post. I forgot which was which.

Nov. 13. This day it rained; which refreshed me exceedingly, and
cooled the earth: but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and
lightning, which frightened me dreadfufly. for fear of my powder. As
soon as it was over,I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as
many little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days! spent in making little square chests
or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most of
powder: and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure
and as remote from one another as possible. On one of these three days
I killed a large bird that was good to eat; but I knew not what to call it.

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent, into the rock to make
room for my farther convenience.

Non. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, viz: a pickax,
ashovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket: so I desisted ltom my work. and
began to consider how to supply these wants, and make me some tools.
As for a pickax, I made use of the iron crows, which were proper enough,
though heavy: but the next thing was a shovel or spade; this was so
absolutely necessary. that, indeed, I could do nothing etfectually without
it; but what kind of one to make I knew not.

Nov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that
wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils. they call the iron tree, (tom its
exceeding hardness: of this, with great labor, and almost spoiling my ax,
I cut a piece; and brought it home, too, with difl'iculty enough, for it was
exceedingly heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having
no other way. made me a long while upon this machine: for I worked it
etl'ectually, by little and little, into the form ofa shovel or spade; the
handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part
having no iron shod upon it at the bottom, it would not last me so long:
however, it served well enough for the uses which I had occasion to put'
It to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made alter that fashion orso
long a making.

I was still deficient: for I Wanted a basket, or a wheelbarrow. A basket
I could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that
wouldbend to make wicker-wars: at least. none yet found out: and as to -
the wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel. but that I had
no notion of; neither did I know how to go about it: beside,I had no
possible way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel
to run in; so I gave it over: and. for carrying away the earth which I dug
out or the cave, I made me a thing like a hod, which the laborers carry
mortar in for the bricklayers. This was not so dimcult to me as the
making the shovel: and yet this and the shovel, and the attempt which I
made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took me up no less than four days.
I mean, always excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I seldom
omitted, and very seldom thiled also bringing home something lit to eat.

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, because of my making
these tools, when they were finished I went on; and working every day,
as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in
widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods com-
modiously.

Non. During all this time, I worked to make thls room or cave.
spacious enough to accommodate the as a warehouse or magazine, a
kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar. As for a lodging, I kept to the tent.
except that sometimes, in the wet season of the year, it rained so hard
that I could not keef myself dry; which caused me afterward to cover all
my place within my pale with long poles, and in the form of rafters,
leaning against the rock, and load them with flags and large leaves or
trees, like a thatch.

Decauaaa 10. I began now to think my cave or vault finished; when
on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth
fell down from the top and one side: so much, that, in short, it frightened
me, and not without reason too: for it] had been under it,I should never
have wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster,l had a great deal of
work to do over again, for I had the loose earth to carry out, and which
was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up. so that I might be
sure no more would come down.

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly; and got two
shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two. pieces of boards
across over each post: this I finished the next day; and setting more posts
up with boards. in about a week more I had the root secured; and the
posts standing in rows. served me for partitions to part 06' my house.

Dec. 17. From this day to the 30th. I placed shelves, and knocked up
nails on the posts, to hang every thing up that could be hung up: and
now I began to be in some order within doors.

DEC. 20. I carried every thing into the cave, and began to furnish my
house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a dresser, to order my
victusls upon; but boards began to be very scarce with me: also I made
me another table. >

D30. 24. Much rain all night and all day: no stirring out.

Dec. 25. Rain all day.

Dec. 26. No rain; and the earth much cooler than before, and
pleasanter.~

72 ADVENTURES or-

Dsc. 27. Killed a young goat; and lomed another, so that I catched it,
and led it home in a string: when I had it home, I bound and splintered
up its leg, which was broke.

N. B. I took such care of it that it lived; and the leg grew well, and as
strong as ever; but, by nursing it so long. it grew tame, and fed upon the
little green at my door, and would not go away. This was the first time
that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures, that I
might have food when my powder and shot was all spent.

Duo. 28, 29, 30,31. Great heats, and no breeze; so that there was no
stirring abroad, except in the evening, for food; this time I spent in
putting all my things in order within doors.

JANUARY 1. Very hot stiu: but! went abroad early and late with my
gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going farther
into the valleys which lay toward the center of the island, I found there
was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and hard to come at; how-
ever. I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.
Accordingly, the next day,l went out with my dognnd set him upon the
goals: but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog: and he
knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.

Jan. 3. l bcgan my fence or wall; which, being still jealous of my
being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit what was said
in the journal: it is suflicient to observe, that I was no less time than
from the 3d of January to the 14th of April, working, finishing. and per-
fecting this wall; though it was no more than about twenty-five yards in
length, being a half circle, from one place in the rock to another place,
about twelve yards from it, the door of the cave being in the center,
behind it.

All this time I worked very hard: the rains hindering me many days.
nay, sometimes weeks together: but I thoughtI should never be perfectly
secure till this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what inexpres-
sible labor every thing was done with, especially the bringing piles out of
the woods, and driving them into the ground; for I made them much
bigger than I needed to have done.

When this wall wasfinished and the outside double fenced. with a turf
wall raised up close to it, 1 persuaded myself that if any people were to
come on shore there they would not perceive any thing like a habitation:
and it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very
remarkable occasion.

During this time, I made my rounds in the woods for game every day,
when the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries, in these
walks, of something or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a
kind of wild pigeons, who build, not as wood-pigeons, in a tree, but
rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rocks: and, taking some
young ones,I endeavored to breed them up tame and did so; but when
they grew older, they flew all away; which, perhaps, was at first for want
of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them: however, I frequently
found their nests. and got their young ones, which were very good meat.

And now, in the managing my household aflairs. I found myself want-
ing in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible for me to
make; as indeed,as to some of them, it was; for instance, I could never
makea cask to be hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed
before; but I could never arrive to the capacity of making one by them,
though lspent many weeks about it: I could neither put in the heads,
nor join the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so
I gave that also over. In the next place, I was at a great loss for candles;
so that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I
was obliged to go to bed. I remember the lump of beeswax with which
I made candles in my African adventure; but I had none of that now:
the only remedy I had was, that when I had killed a goat, I saved the
tallow; and with a little dish made of clay, which I baked in- the sun, to
which 1 added a wick of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave
me light, though not a clear, steady light like a candle. 1n the middle of
all my labors it happened, that in rummaging my things, 1 found a little
bag; which, asI hinted before, had been filled with corn, for the feeding
of poultry; not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship
came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had been in the bag
was all devoured with the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks
and dust; and being willing to have the bag for some other use (i think,
it was to put powder in, when 1 divided it for fear of the lightning, or
some such use).l shook the husks of corn out of it, on one side of my
fortification, under the rock. .

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, that I threw
this stutf away: taking no notice of any thing, and not so much as

'remembering thatI had thrown any thing there: when about a month
alter, I saw some few stalks of something green, shooting out of the
ground, which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen: but I was
surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, alter a little longer time, I saw
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfectly green barley of
the same kind as our European, nay, as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and conflrsion of my
thoughts on this occasion: I had hitherto acted upon no religious founda-
tion at all; indeed, I had very few notions ofrcligion in my head, nor had
entertained any sense of any thing that had befallen me otherwise than
as chance. or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without so much as
inquiring into the end of Providence in these things, or his order in
governing events in the world. But after! saw barley grow there, in a
climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and especially as I knew

7
not how it came there, it startled me strancgly; and I began to suggest,
that God had miraculously caused this grain to grow without any help of
seed sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance, on that
wild miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyes; and
I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen
upon my account: and this was the more strange to me, because I saw
near it still, all along by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks
which proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen
it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence for my
support, but, not doubting that there was more in the place, I went over

all that part of the island where I had been before, searching in every
corner, and under every rock, for more of it; but I could not find any.

At last it occurred to my thoughts, that I had shook out a bag of chicken's
meat in that place, and then the wonder began to cease: and I must con-
fem, my religious thankfulness to God's providence began to abate too,
upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what was common;
though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a
providence," if it had been miraculous: 'for it was really the work of
Providence, as to me, that should order or appoint that ten or twelve
grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all
the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven; as also, that I should
throw it out in that particular place. where. it being in the shade ofa
high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas, in had thrown it any.
where else, at the time, it would have been burned up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you my be sure. in their season,
which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn.I resolved
to sow them all again; hoping. in time, to have some quantity suflicient
to supply me with bread. But it was not till the fourth year that I could
allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but '
sparingly,as I shall show afterward in its order; for I lost all that I sowed
the first season. by not observing the proper time; as I sowed just before
the dry season. so that it never came up at all, at least not as it would
haVe done; of which in its place.

Beside this barley. there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice,
which I preserved with the same care; and whose use was of the same
kind. or to the same purpose. viz: to make me bread. or rather food; for
I found ways to cook it up without baking. though I did that also alter
some timc.--But to return to my Journal.

I worked excessively hard these three or four months, to get my wail
done; and the 14th of April I closed it up; contriving to get into it
nnt'by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign
on the outside of my habitation?
Amt. 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up with the ladder to the
top. and then pulled it up after me,aud let it down in the inside: this
was a complete inclosure to me; for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount my
wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost all my
labor overthrown at once and myself killed; the casewas thus:--As I
was busy in the inside ofit, behind my tent,just at the entrance into my
cave, I was terribly frightened with a most dreadful surprising thing
indeed; for, all on a sudden, I found the earth come crumbling down
from the roof of my cave. and from the edge ot'the hill over my head, and
two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner.
I was heartily scared; but thought nothing of what really was the cause,
only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had
done before: and for fear! should be buried in it.I ran forward to my
ladder, and not thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall for
fear of the pieces of the bill which lexpected might roll down upon me.
1 had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground, than I plainly saw
it was a terrible earthquake: for the ground I stood on shook three times
at about eight minutes' distance, with three such shocks as would have
overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have stood
on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about
half a mile from me next the sea. fell down, with such a terrible noise as
I never heard in all my life. I perceived also that the very sea was put

into a violent motion by it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.

1 was so muchamazed with the thing imelf(having never felt the like. her
discoursed with any one that had) that I was like one dead or stupehed;
and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was
tossed at sea: but the noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, as it
were; and rousing me from the stupetled condition I was in, filled me
with horror, and I thought of nothing but the hill falling upon my tent
and my household goods, and burying all at once; this sank my very
soul within me a second time.

Atter the third shock was over. and I felt no more for some time,I
began to take courage; yet [had not heart enough to go over my wall
again for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground greatly
cast down. and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this while I
had not the least serious religious thought; nothing but the common,
Lord, have mercy upon me! and when it was over, that went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy. as if it
would rain; and soon after the wind row by little and little, so that in
less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane: the sea was, all
on a sudden. covered with foam and froth; the shore was covered with a
breach of the water; the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible
storm it was. This held about three hours, and then began to abatennd
in two hours more it was quite calm, and began to rain very hard. All
this while I set upon the ground, very much terrified and dejected; when,
on a sudden, it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and
over, andI might venture into my cave again. With this thought my
spirits began to revive; and the rain also helping to persuade me,I went
in, and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so violent, that my tent
was ready to be beaten down with it; and I was forced to get into my
cave, though very much afraid and uneasy, for fearit should fall on my
head. This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz: to cut a hole
through my new fortification, like a sink. to let the water go out, which
would else have drowned my cave. Alter I had been in my case for some
time, and found no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be
more composed. And now to support my spirits, which indeed wanted
it very much, I went to my little store, and took a small sup of rum:
which, however, I did then, and 'always, very sparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone. It continued raining all that night,
and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad: but my
mind being more composed. I began to think of what I had best do;
concluding, that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there
would be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building me
some little hut in an open place, which I might surround with a wall, as
1 had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men: for
if I staid where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be buried
alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place
where it now stood, being just under the hanging precipice of the hill,
and which, if it should be shaken again. would certainly fell upon my
tent. I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in con-
triving where and how to remove my habitation. The fear of being
swallowed alive afl'ected me so, that I never slept in quiet; and yet the
apprehension of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost equal to it:
but still, when I looked about, and saw how every thing was put in order,
how pleasantly I was concealed, and how safe from danger. it made me
very loth to remove. In the meantime, it occurred to me that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this; and that I must be con-
tented to run the risk where I was, till I had formed a convenient camp,
and secured it so as to remove to it. With this conelusionl composed
myself for a time; and resolved thatI would go to work with all speed to
build me a wall with piles and cables, etc., in a circle as before, and set
up my tent in it when it was finished; but that I would venture to stay
where I was till it was ready, and fit to remove to. This was the 2m.
Ava". 22. The next morning I began to consider of means to put this
measure into executionz'but I was at a great loss about the tools. I had
three large axes. and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets
for traffic with the Negroes); but with much chopping and cutting knotty
hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull: and though I had a
grindstons, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. This caused mean
much thought as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point
of politics,ora judge upon the life and ,death ofa man. At length I
contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have
both my hands at liberty.

Nora. I had never seen any such thing in England, or at least not to
take notice how it was done, though since I have observed it is very com-
mon there: beside that, my grindstone was very large and heavy. This
machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.

APRIL 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my
machine for taming my grindstone performing very well.

APRIL 30. Having perceived that my bread had been low a great while.
I now took a survey of it, and reduced-myself to one biscuit-cake a day,
which made my heart very heavy.

ROBINSON OBTAINS KOBE ARTICLE max 11!: WEEK--E18 nurse AND
AFFLICTION.

MAY 1. In the morning, looking toward the seaside, the tide being low,
I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked like
a cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel,and two or three pieces
of the wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurri-
cane; and looking toward the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel that
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder; but
it had taken water, and the powder was cake-d as hard as a stone: how
ever, I rolled it farther on the shore for the present, and went on
upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to look for
more.

When I came down to the Ihip,I found it strangely removed. The
forecastle, which lay before buried in the sand. was heaved up at least
six feet: and the stern (which was broketo pieces, and parted from the
708'. by the force of the sea. soon after I had left rummaging of her) was
tossed, as it were. up, and cast on one side: and the sand was thrown so
high on that side next her stern, that I could now walk quite up to her78 ADVEKTUBEB 0?

when the tide was out; whereas there was a great piece of water before,
so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without
swimming. I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must
be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence the ship was more
broke open than formerly.>> many things came daily on shore. which
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by degrees
to the land. -

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my
habitation: and I busied myself mightily. that day especially. in search-
ing whether I could make any way into the ship: but I found nothing
was to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked
up with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair of any thing, I
resolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the ship, con-
cluding that every thing I could get from her would be of some use or
other to me.

MAY 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through,
which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together:
and when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could
train the side which lay highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to
give over for that time.

MAY 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that Idurst eat of, till
I was weary of my sport; when,just going to leave 03', I caught a young
dolphin. I had made me a long line of some ropeyam, but I had no
books; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as Icared to eat;
all which I dried in the sun, and ate them dry.

MAY 5. Worked on the wreck: cut another beam asunder,and brought
three great fir planks of from the decks: which I tied together, and made
swim on shore when the tide of flood came on.

MAY 6. Worked on the wreck; got several iron bolts out of her, and
other pieces of iron-work; worked very hard, and came home very much
tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.

MAY 7. Went to the wreck again. but not with an intent to work; but
found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down. the beams being
cut; that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose; and the inside
of the hold lay so open that I could see into it; but almost full of water
and sand.

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the
deck, which lay now quite clear of the water and sand. I wrenched up
two planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I let! the iron
crow in the wreck for the next day.

MAY 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the
body of the wrcck,and felt several canks. and loosened them with the
crow. but could not break them up. I felt also a roll of English lead,and
could stir it; but it was too heavy to remove.
' MAY 10 to 14. Went every day to the wreck; and got a great many
pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred weight
of iron. w

Ma! 15. I carried two hatchets. to try if I could not cut a piece of the
roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the
other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could not make
any blow to drive the hatchet.

Mn 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more
broken by the force of the water: but I stayed so long in the woods. to
get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that
day.

Mar 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great
distance, two miles off me, but resolved to see what they were. and found
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to bring away.

Mn 24. Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with
hard labor I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first
blowing tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests:
but the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but
pieces of timber, and a hogshesd, which had some Brazil pork in it; but
the salt water and the sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every
day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food; which I
always appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the
tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out: and by this
time I had gotten timber. and plank, and iron-work, enough to have built
a good boat, if I had known how: and I also got, at several times, and in
several pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet-lead.

June 16. Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise. or turtle.
This was the first I had seen; which, it seems, was only my misfortune,
not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to be on the
other side of the island, I might have had hundreds of them every day, as
I found afterward: but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

Just: 17. I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threesoore eggs;
and her flesh was to me. at that time, the most savory and pleasant that
I ever tasted in my life; having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls,
since I landed in this horrid place.

Jess 18. Rained all that day, and I stayed within. I thought. at this
time, the rain felt cold, and I was somewhat chilly; which I knew was
not usual in that latitude.

Jim: 19. Very ill. and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.

Jose 20. No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.

Julia 21. Very ill: frightened almost to death with the apprehensions
of my sad condition, to be sick, and no help: prayed to God, for the first
time since the storm ofl' Hull; but scarce knew what I said, or why, my
thoughts being all confined.
J on: 22. A little better; but under dreadful apprehensions ofsickned.

Just: 23. Very had again; cold and shivering, and then a violent
headache.

JUN: 24. Much better.

Jose 25. An ague very violent: the fit held me seven hours; cold fit,
and hot, with faint sweats after it.

JUNE 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun. but
found myself very weak: however,I killed a she-goat, and with much
ditficulty got it home. and broiled some of it, and ate. I would fain have
stewed it, and made some broth, but had no pot.

Just: 27. The ague again so violent that I lay abed all day. and neither
ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God
again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that
I knew not what to say; only lay and cried. Lord, look upon me! Lord,
pity me! Lord have mercy upon me! I suppose I did nothing else for
two or three hours; till the fit wearing 08', I fell asleep, and did not wake
till far in the night. When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but
weak, and exceeding thirsty: however,as I had no water in my whole
habitation, l was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In
this second sleepl had this terrible dream: I thought that 1 was sitting
on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm
blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great
black cloud. in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground: he was
all over as bright as a flame,so that I could but just hear to look toward
him: his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for
words to describe: when he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I
thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake;
and all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with
flashes of fire. He had no sooner landed upon the earth. but he moved
forward toward me, with a lung spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me;
and when he came to a rising ground. at some distance, he spoke to me,
or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of
it: all that I can say I understood. was this: Seeing all these things have
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die; at which words, I
thought he lined up the spear that was in this hand, to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account, will expect thatI should be
able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision,I mean, that
even while it was a dream,I even dreamed of those horrors; nor is it any
more possible to describe the impression that remained upon my mind
when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.

I'had. alas! no divine knowledge: what I had received by the good
instruction of my father was then worn out, by an uninterrupted series,
for eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation, with

a

a
none but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last
degree. I do not remember that I had, in all that time. one thought that
so much as tended either to looking upward toward God. or inward
toward a reflection upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity of soul,
without desire ofgood, or consciousness of evil, hnd entirely overwhelmed
me; and I was all that the most hardened. unthinking, wicked creature
among our common sailors, can be supposed to be; not having the least
sense, either of the fear of God, in danger, or of thankfulness to him, in
deliverances.

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more
easily believed, when I shall add, that through all the variety of miseries
that had to this day befallen me, I never had so much as one thought of
its being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment for my sin;
either my rebellious behavior against my father, or my present sins, which
were great: or even as a punishment for'the general course of my wicked
life. When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of
Miles, I never had so much as one thought of what would become' of me;
or one wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or to keep me from
the danger which apparently surrounded me, as well from voracious
creatures as cruel savages; but I was quite thoughtless of a God or a
Providence; acted like a mere brute, from the principles of nature, and
by the dictates of common sense only; and indeed hardly that. When I
was delivered and taken up at sea by the Portuguese captain, well used,
and dealt with justly and honorably,>> well as charitably, I had not the
least thanklhlness in my thoughts. When again, I was shipwrecked,
ruined, and in danger of drowning, on this island, I was as far from
remorse or looking on it as a judgment: I only said to myself often, that
I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable.

It is true, when I first got on shore here, and found all my ship's crow
drowned, and myself spared. I was surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and
some transports ofsoul. which, had the grace of God assisted, might have
come up to true thankfulness: but it ended where it began, in a mere
common flight of joy; or,as I may say, being glad I was alive, without
the least reflection upon the distinguished goodness of the hand which
had preserved me, and had singled me out to be preserved when all the
rest were destroyed, or an inquiry why Providence had been thus mercio
ful to me: just the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have.
alter they are got safe ashore from a shipwreck; which they drown all in
the next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over: and all
the rest ofmy life was like it. Even when I was, afterward, on due con-
sideration, made sensible of my condition.--how I was cast on this dread-
ful place, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or
prospect of redemption,--as soon as I new but a prospect of living, and
that I should not starve and parish for hunger, all the sense of my
affliction were of, and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the
works proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough from
being afilicted at my condition," a judgment from Heaven, or as the
hand of God agath me: these were thoughts which very seldom entered
into my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had, at first,
some little influence upon me, and began to atl'ect me with seriousness,
as long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as
that part of the thought was removed, all the impression which was
raised from it wore off also, as I have noted already. Even the earth-
quake, though nothing could be more terrible in its nature, or more
immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs such
things, yet no sooner was the fright over, but the impression it had made
went of also. I had no more sense of God, or his judgments, much less
of the present affliction of my circumstances being from his hand. than
if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life. But now. when
I began to be sick, and a leisure view of the miseries of death came to
place itself before me; when my spirits began to sink under the burden
ofa strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of the
fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake; and l re-
proached myself with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by
uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under
uncommon strokes. and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. These
reflections oppressed me for the second or third day of my distemper;
and in the violence. as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of
my conscience, extorted from me some words like praying to God : though
I can not say it was a prayer attended either with desires or with hopes;
it was rather the voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts were
confused; the convictions great upon my mind: and the horror of dying
in such a miserable condition. raised vapors in my head with the mere
apprehension: and, in these hurries of my soul. I knew not what my
tongue might express: but it was rather exclamation, such as, Lord,
What a miserable creature am I! If I should be sick,l shall certainly
die for want of help; and what will become of me? When the tears
burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. In this
interval, the good advice of my father came to my mind, and presently
his prediction, which I mentioned at the beginning of this story, viz:
that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me; and I should
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counnl. when
there might be none to assist in my recovery. Now, said l,aloud. my
dear father's words are come to pass; God's justice has overtaken me,
and I have none to help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a station of life wherein I might have
been-happy and easy; but I would neither see it myself, nor learn fromROBINSON 030803. 83

my parents to know the blessing of it. I left them to mourn over my
folly; and now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it: I
refused their help and assistance, who would have pushed me in the
world, and would-have made every thing easy to me; and now I have
difficulties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support;
and no assistance, no comfort, no advice. Then' I criedput, Lord, be my
help, for I am in great distress. This was the first prayer, if I may call
it so, that I had made for many years. But I return to my Journal.

JUN: 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleepI had had,
and the fit being entirely otf. I got up; and though the fright and terror
of my dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague
would return again the next day; and now was my time to get something
to refresh and support myself when I should be ill. The first thing I did
was to till a large square ease bottle with water, and set it upon my table,
in reach of my bed: and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them
together. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the
coals, but could eat very little. I walked about; but was very weak, and
withsl very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my miserable con-
dition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day. At night, I
made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs; which I roasted in the
ashes, and ate. as we call it, in the shell: and this was the first bit of meat
I had ever asked God's blessing to, as I could remember, in my whole lite.
Alter I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found myselt'so weak; that I could
hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without that); so I went but a
little way. and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon the sea, which
was just before me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such
thoughts as these occurred to me: What is this earth and sea, of which I
have seen so much! Whenee is it produced? And what am I, and all
the other creatures. wild and tame, human and brutal! Whence are
we'! Surely, we are all made by some secret power, who formed the
earth and sea, the air and sky. And who is that! Then it followed most
naturally,it is God that has made all. Well, but then, it came on, if God
has made all these things, he guides and governs them all, and all things
that concern them; for the power that could make all things, must car-

a lainly have power to guide and direct them: if so, nothing can happen in
the great circuit of his works, either without his knowledge or appoint-
ment.

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows that I am
here, and am in this dreadful condition: and if nothing happens without
his appointment, he has appointed all this to befall me. Nothing
occurred to my thought, to contradict any of these conclusions: and
therefore it rested upon me with the greatest force, that it must needs be
that God had appointed all this to befall me; that I was brought to this
miserable circumstance, by his direction, he having the sole power, not
of me only, but of every thing that happens in the world. Immediately
it followed, Why has God done this to me'! What have I done to be thus
used! My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had
blasphemed: and methought it spoke to me like a voice, Wretch! dost
Ihowask what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadtul misspent life,
and ask thyself, what thou hast not done! Ask, why is it that thou wert

not long ago destroyed! Why wert than not drowned in Yarmouth
Roads; killed in the fight when the ship was taken by the Sallee man-of-
war; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Attica; or drowned
here, when all the crew perished but thyself? Dost thou ask what thou
hast done'! I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one astonished,
and had not a word to say; no, not to answer to myself; and, rising up
pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went over my wall, as if
I had been going to bed: but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and 1
had no inclination to sleep: sol sat down in the chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return
of distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the
Brazilians take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers; and
I had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite
cured; and some also that was green, and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt: for in this chestI found a cure
both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked for,
viz: the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took
out one of the'Bibles which I mentioned before, and which to this time I
had not found leisure, or so much as inclination. tolook into. I say, I
took it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as to my distemper, nor
whether it was good for it or not; but I tried several experiments with it,
as if I was resolved it should hit one way or other. I first took a piece
of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth; which, indeed, at first, almost
stupcfied my brain; the tobacco being green and strong, and such asl
had not been much used to. Then I took some and steeped it an hour or
two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose ofit when I lay down: and,
lastly, l burned some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over
the smoke of it as long as I could bear it; as well for the heat, as almost
for sufl'ocation. In the interval of this operation,l took up the Bible, and
began to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the tobacco to
bear reading, at least at that time; only, having opened the hook casually,
the first words that occurred to me were these: " Call on me in the day
of trouble. and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." These
words were very apt to my case; and made some impression upon my
thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as they did
afterward; for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I may
say, to me; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension
of things, that, as the'children of Israel said when they were promised
flesh to eat, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness!" so I began to
say. Can even God himself deliver me from this place! And asjt was
pot for many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very onen
upon my thoughts: but, however, the words made a great impression
upon me. and I mused upon them very often. It now grew late; and the
tobacco had, as I said, closed my head so much, that I inclined to sleep:
so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want any thing in the
night, and went to bed. But before I lay down, I did what I never had
done in all my life; I kneeled down and prayed to God to mlflll the
promise to me, that if I called upon him in the day of trouble, he would
deliver me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank
the rum in which I had steeped the tobacco: which was so strong and
rank of the tobacco. that indeed I could scarce get it down: immediately
upon this I went to bed. I found presently the rum flew up into my
head violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till, by
the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon the
next day: nay, to this hour I am partly of opinion, that I slept all the
next day and night, and till almost three the day alter; for otherwise, I
know not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the
week. as it appeared some years afler I had done; for if I had lost it by
crossing and recrossing the line. I should have lost more than one day;
but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.
Be that, however, one way or the other, when I waked I found myself
exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up,
I was stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach better, for I
was hungry; and, in short,l had no fit the next day, but continued much
altered for the better. This was the 29th. .

The 30th was my well day. ofcourse; and I went abroad with my gun,
but did not care to travel too far. I killed a seafowl or two, something
like a brand goose, and brought them home; but was not very forward
to eat them; so I ate some more of the turtlo's eggs, which were very
good. This evening I renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did
me good the day before, viz: the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not
take so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my head
over the smoke: however. I was not so well the next day, which was the
lst of July, as I hoped I should have been; for I had a little of the cold
tit, butit was not much.

JULY 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself
with it as at first. and doubled the quantity which I drank.

JULY 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my
full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering strength,
my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture. " I will deliver the ;"
and the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar
of my ever expecting it; but as I was discouraging myself with such
thoughts, it occurred to my mind that! pared so much upon my deliver-
ance from the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had
received; and lwas,as it were, made to ask myself such questions as
these, viz: Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness;
from the most distressed condition that could be, and that was so fright-
ful to me! and what notice have I taken of it'! Have I done my part!
God has delivered me, but I have not glorified him; that is to say, I have
not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance: and how can I
expect a greater deliverance! This touched my heart very much; and
immediately I knelt down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery
from my sickness.

Jou'4. In the morning I took the Bible; and beginning at the New
Testament, I began seriously to read it; and imposed upon myself to read
a while every morning and every night; not binding myself to the
number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage me. It
was not long~afier I set seriously to this work. that I found my heart
more deeply and sincerely atfected with the wickedness of my past life.
The impression of my dream revived; and the words,All these things
have not brought thee to repentance, ran seriously in my thoughts. I
was earnestly begging of God to give me repentance, when it happened
providentially, the very same day, that, reading the scripture, I came to
these words, " He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour; to give repentance,
and to give remission." I threw down the book; and with my heart as
well as my hands lifted up to heaven. in a kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried
out aloud, Jesus, thou son of David! Jesus, thou exalted Prince and
Saviour! give me repentance! This was the first time, in all my life I I
could say,in the true sense of the words. that I prayed; for now I prayed
with a sense of my condition, and with a true scripture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the word of God: and from this time,
I may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, "Call on me. and
I will deliver thee," in a difl'erent sense n-om what I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of any thing being called deliverance, but my
being delivered from the captivity I was in: for though I was indeed at
large in the place. yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that
in the worst sense in the world. But now i teamed to take it in another
sense: nowI looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my
sins appeared so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God but
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort. As
for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so much as pray to be
delivered from it or think of it; it was all of no consideration, in com-
parison with this. And I add this part here, to hint to whoever shall
read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of things, they will
find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from
affliction.

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my way
or' living. yet much easier to my mind: and my thoughts being directed,
by constantly reading the scripture and praying to God, to things of a
higher nature,! had a great deal of comfort within, which, till now, I
knew nothing of: also." my health and strength returned, I bestirred
me to furnish myself with every thing that I wanted, and make my way
of living as regular as I could.

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in walking
about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man
that was gathering up his strength alter a fit of sickness: for it is hardly
to be imagined how lowI was,and to what weakness 1 was mdueed.
The application which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps
what had never cured an ague before; neither can I recommend it to any
one to practice, by this experiment: and though it did carry ofl'the flt,
yet'it rather contributed to Weakening me; for 1 had frequent convul-
sions in my nerves and limbs for some time: I learned from it also this,
in particular; that being abroad in the rainy season was the most per-
nicious thing to my health that could be, especially in those rains which
came attended with storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain
which came in the dry season was almost always accompanied with such
storms, so I found that this rain was much more dangerous than the rain
which fell in September and October.

1 had now been in this unhappy island above ten months; all possi-
bility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from
me; and I firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot upon
that place. Having secured my habitation,asi thought, fully to my mind,
1 had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and
to see what other productions I might find, which 1 yet knew nothing of.

It was on the Ilsth of July that I began to take a more particular
survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted,
I brought my nits on shore. I found, alter I came about two miles up,
that the tide did not flow any higher; and that it was no more than a
little brook of running water, very flesh and good: but this being the dry
season,.there was hardly any water in some parts of it: at least not any
stream. 0n the banks of this brook I found many pleasant savannas
or meadows, plain.smoath,and covered with grass: and on the rising
parts of them. next to the higher grounds (where the water, as it might
be supposed, never overllowed),l found a great deal of tobacco, green,
and growing to a very great and strong stalk: and there were divers other
plants, which I had no knowledge of, or understanding about. and that
might, perhaps, have virtues of their own, which I could not find out. I
searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate. make
their bread of; but I could find none. I saw large plants or aloes, but
did not understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild; and. for
want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries
for this time; and came back, musing with myself what course I might
take to know the virtue and goodness ofany of the fruits or plants which
I should discover; but could bring it to no conclusion; for. in short,l
had made so littte observation while Iwas in the Brazils, that I knew
little of the plants in the field; at least, very little that might serve me to
any purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and after going
something farther than I had gone the day before. I found the brook and
the savannas begin to cease, and the country become more woody than
before. In this part I found difl'erent fruits; and particularlyl found
melons upon the ground. in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees:
the vines, indeed, had spread over the trees, and the clusters of grapes
were now just in their prime. very ripe and rich. This was a surprising
discovery, and I was exceedingly glad of them, but I was wamod by my
experience to eat sparingly of them; remembering that when I was
ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our Englishmen,
who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes and fevers. I found,
however, an excellent use for these grapes: and that was. to cure or dry
them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept;
which I thought would be (as indeed they were) as wholesome and as
agreeable to eat, when no grapes were to be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation:
which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say,I had lain from
home. At night I took my first eontrivance, and got up into a tree, where
I slept well; and the next morning proceeded on my discovery. traveling
near four miles," I might judge by the length of the valley; keeping
still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north sides of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the country
seemed to descend to the west: and a little spring of flesh water, which
issued out of the side of the bill by me, ran the other way, that is, due
east; and the country appeared so fresh,so green.so flourishing, every
thing being in a constant verdure, or flourish ofspring, that it looked likeI planted garden. I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale,
surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with other
afllicting thoughts). to think that this was all my own: that I was king
and lord of all this country indefensibly. and had a right of possession;
and, in could convey it. I might have it in inheritance as completely as
any lord of a manor in England. Isaw here abundance of cocoa-trees,
and orange, lemon, and citron-trees, but all wild, and very few bearing
any fruit; at least not then. However, the green limes that I gathered
were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their
juice afterward with' water, which made it very wholesome. and very
cool and refreshing. I found now I had business enough, to gather and
carry home; and I resolved to lay upa store. as well of grapes as limes
and lemons,to furnish myself for the wet season. which I knew was
approaching. In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one
place,a lesser heap in another place; and a great parcel of limes and
lemons in another place; and, taking a few of each with me,[ traveled
homeward; and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what
Ieould make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three
days in this journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my
cave): but betbre I got thither. the grapes were spoiled; the richness of
the fruits, and the weight of the juice, having broken and bruised them,
they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were good, but
I could bring only a few.

The next day being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small
bags to bring home my harvest; but Iwas surprised, when,coming to
my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I ythered them, I
found them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about. some
here. some there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I con-
cluded there were some wild creatures thereabouts which had done this,
but whatdhey were I knew not. However," I found there was no laying
them up in heaps, and no carrying them away inasack: but that one
way they would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed
with their own weight, 1 took another course; I then gathered a large
quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out-branches of the
trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great
pleasure the fruitfulness of that valley. and the pleasantness of the
situatlon; the security from storms on that side; the water and the
wood: and concluded that 1 had pitched upon a place to fix my abode
in, which was by far the worst part of the country. Upon the whole, I
began to consider of removing my habitation. and to look out for a place
equally safe as where I was now situate: if possible, in that pleasant
fruitful part of the island.

8
This thought ran long in my head; and I was exceedingly fond of it
for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me: but when I
came to a nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the sea-side.
where it was at least possible that something might happen to my
advantage, and, by the same ill fate that brought me hither, might bring
some other unhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was
scarce probable that any such thing should ever happen, yet to inclose
myself among the hills and woods in the center of the island, was to
anticipate my bondage, and to render such an afl'air not only improb-
able, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to
remove. However,I was so enamored of this place. that I spent much
of my time there for the whole remaining part of the month of July;
and though. upon second thoughts,l resolved, as above stated. not to
remove, yetI built me a little kind of a bower. and surrounded it at a
distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge,as high as I could
reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood. Here I lay very
secure, sometimes two or three nights together; always going over it
with a. ladder,as before: so that I fancied nowI had my country and
sea-coast house. This work took me up till the beginning ofAugust.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labor, when
the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation: for
though I had made a tent like the other. with a piece of sail, and spread
it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,
nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August." I said,I had finished my bower,
and began to enjoy myself. The ad of August. I found the grapes I had
hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed was excellent good raisins of
the sun; so I began to take them down from the trees; and it was very
happy that I did so, as the rains which followed would have spoiled them,
and I should have lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above
two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all
down, and carried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain,
and [tom hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less,
every day till the middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I
could not stir out of my cave for several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my family.
I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from
me, or, as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more of her. till, to
my astonishment, she came home withrthree kittens. This was the more
strange to me, because. about the end of August, though I had killed a
wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a differ-
ent kind fmm our European cats: yet the young cats were the same
kind of houwbmd as the old one; and both of my cats being females, I
thought it very strange. But from these three, I afterward came to be so
pestered with cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild
beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible.

From the Nth of August to the 26th, incessant rain: so that I could
not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this contine-
ment, I- began to be straitened for food: but venturing out twice, I one
day killed a goat, and the last day, which was the 28th, found a very large
tortoise, which was a treat to me. My food was now regulated thus; I
ate a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of
the turtle, broiled. for my dinner (for, to my great misfortune,I had no
vessel to boil or stew any thing): and two or three of the turtle's eggs for
my supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two
or three hours at enlarging my cave: and by degrees worked it on toward
one side, till I came to the outside of the hill; and made a door, or way
out, which came beyond my fence or wall: and so I came in and out this
way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so ope'r'i': forss I had managed
myself before,I was in a perfect inclosure; whereas now,l thought I lay
exposed; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to
fear; the biggest creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a
goat.

San-rants 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my
landing; I cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on
shore three hundred and sixty-live days. I kept this day as a solemn
fast; setting it apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the
ground with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, .
acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying to him to
have mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least

.ectreshment for twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then
ate a biscuit and a bunch of grapes,and went to bed, finishing the day as
I began it. I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day: for as at first I
had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted
to distinguish'the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for
the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the days were;
but now having cast up the days,as above, I found I had been here a
year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a
Sabbath: though I found. at the end of my account, I had lost a day or
two in my reckoning. A little alter this, my ink beginning to fail me. I
contented myself to use it more sparingly; and to write down only the
most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memoran-
dum of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,
and I teamed to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but I
bought all my experience before I had it; and what I am goin'g to relate
was one of the moat discouragfirg experiments that I had made at all.92 aovauruuns or

I have mentioned that I had saved the few cars of barley and rice,
which I had so surprisingly found sprung up,as I thought, of themselves.
I believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of bar-
ley; and nowI thought it a proper time to sow it alter the rains; the sun
being in its southern position,going from me. Accordingly I dug a piece
of ground,as well as I could, with my wooden spade; and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but. as I was sowing, it casually
occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first. because I did
not know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed about two-thirds
of the seed, leaving about a handful of each; and it was a great comfort
to me atterward that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed this time
came to any thing; for the dry month following. and the earth having
thus had no rain alter the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist its
growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had come again, and
then it grewas it' it had been but newly sown. Finding my first seed
did not grow, which I easily imagined was from the drought, I sought for
a moister piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug up a piece
of ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in
February, a little before the vernal equinox. This having the rainy
months of March and April to water it. sprung up very pleasantly. and
yielded a very good crop; but having only part of the seed left, and not
daring to sow all that I had, I got but a small quantity at last, my whole
crop not amounting to above halt' a peek of each kind. But by this
experiment I was made master of my business, and knew exactly when
was the proper time to sow;and that I might expect two seed-times, and
two harvests, every year.

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which was of
use to me alterward. As soon as the rains were over, and thoweathu
began to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit
up the country to my bower: where, though I had not been for some
months, yet I found all things just as I let! them. The circle or double
hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which
I had cutout of some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out and
grown with long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the
first year alter lapping its head; but I could not tell what tree to call it
that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very well
pleased. to see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them
to grow as much alike as I could: and it is scarce credible how beautiful
a figure they grew into in three years: so that, though the hedge made a
circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I
might now call them. soon covered it, and it was a complete shade,
sufficient to lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to
cut some more stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle
round my wall (I mean that of my flr't dwelling), which I did; and
placing the tree's or stakes in a double row, at about eight yards' distance
from my first fence: they grew presently; and were at the first a fine
cover to my habitation, and afterward served for a defense also; as I shall
observe in its order.

BASKET MAKING.

I sonar) now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided,
not into summer and winter, as in Europe. but into the rainy seasons and
the dry seasons. which were generally thus: From the middle of Febru-
ary to the middle of April, rainy; the sun being then on or near the
equinox. From the middle of April to the middle of August, dry; the
sun being then north of the line. From the middle of August till the
middle of October, rainy; the sun being then come back to the line.
From the middle of October till the middle of February, dry; the sun
being then to the south of the line.

The rainy seasons held sometimes longer and sometimes shorter, as
the wind happened to blow; but this was the general observation I
made. After I had found, by experience, the ill consequences of being
abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions before-
hand, that I might not be obliged to go out: and I sat within doors as
much as possible during the wet months. This time I found much
employment, and very suitable also to the time; for I found greet ocea-
sion for many things which I had no way to furnish myself with, but by
hard labor and constant application: particularly, I tried many ways to
make myself a basket: but all the twigs I could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent
advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to take a great
delight in standing at a basket-maker's in the town where my father
lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as>> boys usually
are, very oflicinus to help, and a great observer of the manner how they
worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these
means full knowledge of the methods of it, so that I wanted nothing but
the materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree
from whence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the
allows, willows, and osiers in England; and I resolved to try. Accor-
dingly, the next day, I went to my country-house, as I called it; and
cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much
as I could desire: whereupon I came the next time prepared with a
hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great
plenty of them. These I set up dry within my circle or hedge: and
when they were fit for use. I carried them to my cave: and here, during
the next season.I employed myself in making, as well as I could, several
baskets; both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had
occasion for. Though [did not finish them very handsomely. yet I made
them sufliciently serviceable for my purpose: and thus, allerward.I took
care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed. I made
more; especially strong, deep baskets, to place my corn in, instead of
sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about
it,I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two other wants.
I had no vessel to hold any thing that was liquid, except two runlets
which were almost full of rum; and some glass bottles. some of the
common size. and others (which were case-bottles) square. for the holding
of water, spirits, etc. I had not so much as a pot'to boil any thing,
except a great kettle, which I saved out of the ship. and which was too
big for such use as I desired itI viz: to make broth,and stew a bit of meat
by itself. The second thing I would fain have had, was a tobacco pipe;
but it was impossible for me to make one; however,I found a contrivance
for that too at last. I employed myself in planting my second row of
stakes or piles, and also in this wicker-working, all the summer or dry
season; when another business took me up more time than it could be
imagined I could spare.

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the whole island;
and that I had traveled up the brook. and so on to where I had built my
bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of
the island. I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore, on that
side: so taking my gun. a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usual; with two biscuit-cakes. and a great bunch
of raisins in my pouch. for my store: I began my journey. When I had
passed the vale where my bower stood. as above. I came within view of
the sea, to the west; and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land,
whether an island or continent I could not tell; but it lay very high,
extending from W. to W. S. W. at a very great distance; by my guess, it
could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues otf.

[could not tell what part of the world this might be; otherwise than
that I knew it must be part of America; and. as I concluded, by all my
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions; and perhaps was all
inhabited by savages, where, if I should have landed, I had been in a
worse condition than I was now. I therefore acquiesced in the disposi-
tiona of Providence. which I began now toown and to believe ordered
every thing for the best: I say. I quieted my mind with this, and left of!
afllicting myself with fruitless wishes of being there. Beside, after some
pause upon this attain! considered that if this land was the Spanish
coast,I should certainlywne time or other, see some vessel pass or repose
one way or the other; but ifnot. then it was the savage coast between the
Spanish country and the Brazils, whose inhabitants are indeed the worst
of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to murder
and devour all human beings that fall into their hands.

With these considerations, walking very leisurely forward, I found this
side of the island, where I now was, much pleasanter than mine; the
open or savanna fields sweetly adorned with flowers and grass, and full
of very tine woods. I saw abundance of parrots; and fain would have
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame. and taught it to speak
to me. I did, after taking some pains, catch a young parrot; for I
knocked it down with a stick, and, having recovered it, I brought it
home; but it was some years before I could make him speak; however,
at last I taught him to call me by my name very familiarly. But the
accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its
place.

I was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in the low
grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes: but they difl'ered
greatly from all the other kinds I had met with; nor could I aatisly
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to be
venturous: for I had no want of food, and of that which was very good
too; especially these three sorts, viz: goats, pigeons, and turtle, or
tortoise. With these, added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not
have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the company: and
though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thank-
fulness; as I was not driven to any extremities for food, but had rather
plenty, even to dainties.

I never traveled on this journey above two miles outright in a day, or
thereabout; but I took so many turns and returns, to see what discoveries
I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I resolved to
sit down for the night; and then I either reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
rounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright in the ground. either
from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come at me
without waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had
taken up my lot on the worst side of the island: for here indeed the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles: whereas. on_ the other side, I had
found but three in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite number
of fowls of many kinds: some of which I had seen, and some of which I
ha, not seen before, and many of them very good meat; but such as I
knew not the names of. except those called penguins.

I confess. this side of the country was much pleasantcr than mine; yet
I had not the least inclination to remove; for as I was fixed in my habita-
tion, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here to
be as it were upon a journey, and from home. However,I traveled along
the sea-shore toward the cast, I suppose about twelve miles; and then
setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark,I concluded I would
go home again; and that the next journey I took should be on the other
side of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my
post again; of which in its place.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could
easily keep so much of the island in my view, that I could not miss my
'first dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself mistaken; for
being some about two or three mils-,1 found myself descended into a
very large valley. but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered
with wood, that I could not see which was my way by any direction but
that of the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the position of the
sun at that time of the day. And it happened to my farther misfortune,
that the weather proved hazy for three or four days while I was in this
valley; and not being able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncom-
fortable, and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post,
and come back the same way 1 went: and then by easy journeys I turned
homeward. the weather being exceedingly hot, and my gun, ammunition,
hatchet, and other things very heavy.

IN this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and
running to take hold of it, I caught it. and saved it alive from the dog. I
had a great mind to bring it home if I could; but I had often been
musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise
a breed of iame goats. which might supply me when my powder and
shot should be all spent. 1 made a collar for this little creature, and with
a string which I had made of some rope-yarn. which I always carried
about me, I led him along. though with some difliculty, till I came to my
bower, and there I inclosed him and left him; for I was veryimpatient
to be at home, from whence I had been absent above a month.

I can not express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old
hutch. and lie down in my hammock bed. This little wandering journey,
without a settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my
own house. as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me,
compared to that; and it rendered every thing about me so comfortable.-
that I resolved I would never go a great way from it again, while it
should be my lot to stay on the island.
l reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long
Journey: during which, most of the time was taken up in the weighty
. affair of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be more domestic,
and to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of
the poor kid which I had penned within my little circle, and resolved to
fetch it home, or give it some food: accordingly! went, and found it '
where I lelt it (for indeed it could not get out), but was almost starved
for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees. and branches of such
shrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I
did before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I
had no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog: and as I con-
tinually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that
it was from that time one of my domestics also, and would never leave
me afterward.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept
the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the
anniversary of my landing on the island; having now been there two
years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day I came
there. I spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments
for wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave
humble and hearty thanks to God for having been pleased to discover to
me, that it was possible I might be more happy even in this solitary con-
dition, than I should have been in the enjoyment of society,'1d in all
the pleasures of the world: that he could fully make up to me the defl-
ciencies of my solitary state, and the want of human society, by his
presence, and the communications of his grace to my soul; supporting,
comforting. and encouraging me to depend upon his providence here,
and to hope for his eternal presence hereafier.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy the life
I now led was. with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked,
cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days: and nowI
changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my
afl'ections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new item
what they were at my first coming. or indeed for the .two years past.
Before. as I walked about, either on my hunting. or for viewing the
country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon
me on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the
woods. the mountains, the deserts I was in; and how I was a prisoner.
locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean.in an uninhabited
wilderness. without redemption. In the midst of the greatest oom-
posures of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and
make me wring my hands, and weep likeachild: sometimes it would
take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit down

9
and sigh. and look upon the ground for an hour or two together: this
was still worse to me; hut in could burst into tears, or give vent to my
feelings by words, it would go 03'; and my grief being exhausted, would
abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I daily read
the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words,"I
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Immediately it occurred that
these words were to me.- why else should they be directed in such a
manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as
one forsaken ofGod and man'! Well then, said I, if God does not lbrsalre
me.of what ill consequence can it he, or what matters it, though the
world should forsake me; seeing, on the other hand, if I had all the
world, and should lose the favor and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss!

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind, that it was possi-
ble for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it
was probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in the
world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for
bringing me to. this place. I know not what it was, but something
shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.
New canst thou be such a hypocrite, said I, even audibly, to pretend to
be thankful for a condition, which however thou mayat endeavor to be
contentefivith, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from!
Here I stopped: but though I could not say! thanked God for being here,
yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever
afllicting providences, to see the timner condition of my life, and to
mourn for my wickedness. and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut
it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in
England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods;
and for assisting the afterward to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and
though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an
account of my works this year as the first, yet in general 'it may be
observed, that I was very seldom idle; but having regularly divided my
time, according to the several daily employments that were before me;
such as, first, My duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I
constantly set apart some time for. thrice every day: secondly, Going
abroad with my gun for food. which generally took me up three hours
every morning. when it did not rain: thirdly. Ordering, curing, presen--
ing. and cooking what! had killed or catched for my supply: these took
up a gre'at part of the day;'also it is to be considered, that in the middle
of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was
too great to stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all theaosrssox 030503. 99

time I could be supposed to work in; with this exception, that sometimes
I changed my hours of hunting and working. and went to work in the
morning, and'abroad with my gun in the aflcrnoon.

To this short time allowed for labor. I desire may be added the exceeds
ing lsboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of tools,
want of help, and want of skill, every thing I did took up out of my
time: for example. I was full two and forty days making me a board for
a long shell', which I wanted in my cave: whereas, two sawyers, with
their tools and a saw-pit, would have out six of them out of the same
tree in half a day.

My case was this; it was a large tree which was to be cut down,
because my board was to be a bread one. This treeI was three days
cutting down, and two more in cutting oh" the boughs, and reducing it
to a log, or a piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing, 1
reduced both the sides of it into chips, till it was light enough to move;
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board. from
end to end; then turning that side downward. cut the other side, till I
brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both
sides. Any one may judge the labor of my hands in such a piece of
work; but labor and patience earried me through that, and many other
things: I only observe this in particular. to show the reason why so much
of my time went away with so little work, viz: that what might be a
little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labor. and required a
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. Notwithstanding this, with
patience and labor I went through many things; and, indeed. every thing
that my circumstances made necessary for me to do,as will appear by
what follows. .

I was now in the months of November and December, expecting my
crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured or dug up for them
was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the
quantity of half a peek, having lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry
season: but now my crop promised very well; when, on a sudden. I
found I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts.
which it was searee possible to keep from it; as, first. the 'goats, and wild
creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade,
lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up. and ate it so close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

I saw no remedy for this. but by making an inclosnre about it with
a hedge. which I did with a great deal of toil; and the more. because
it required speed. However, as my arable land was but small. suited
to my erop.l got it tolerably well fenced in about three weeks' time;
and shooting some of the creatures in the daytime. I set my dog to
guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate. where he
would stand and bark all night long; so in. a little time the enemies
forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to
ripen space. .

But as the beasts mined me before, while my corn was in the blade.
so the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear: for
going along by the place to see how it throve. I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls, I know not of how many sorts, who stood, as it
were, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them
(for I always had my gun with me); I had no sooner shot, but there rose
up a little cloud of tbwls, which I had not seen at all, from among the
corn itself. ' o

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would
devour all my hopes; thatI should be starved, and never be able to raise
a crop at all; and what to do I could not tell: however, I resolved not to
lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the
first place,I went among it, to see what damage was already done, and
found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too green
for them, the loss was not so great, but that the remainder was likely to
be a good crop, if it could be saved>>.

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see
the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited till
I was gone away; and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked ofi', as
if gone, I was no sooner out of their eight, than they dropped down, one
by one, into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not have
patience to stay till more cams on, knowing that every grain they ate
now was,as it might be said. a peck loat' to me in the consequence; so
coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This
was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served them as we serve
notorious- thieves in England, viz: hanged them in chains, for terror to
others. It is impossible to imagine that this should have such an efi'ect
as it had; for the {owls not only never came to the corn, but, in short,
they foonsook all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird near
the place as long as my seareerows hung there. This I was very glad of,
you may be sure; and about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my com.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down: and all I
could do was to make one as well as I could, out of one of the broad
swords, or outlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship.
However, as my first crop was but small. I had no great difliculty to cut
it down: in short, I reaped it my way, for I cut nothing of but the ears,
and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so rubbed it
out with my hands: and at the end of all my harvesting. I found that out
of my half peek of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two

bushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess, forI bad no
measure.
However, this was great encouragement to me: and I foresaw that. in
time. it would please God to supply me with bread; and yet here I was
perplexed again; for l neither knew how to grind. or make meal of my
corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor if made into meal, bow
to make bread of it; and if bow to make it, yetl knew not how to bake
it: these things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this
crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season: and, in
the meantime, to employ all my study and hours of working to accom-
plish this great work of providing myself with corn and bread.

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It isa little
wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much upon, viz:
the strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing, pro-
dueing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily dis-
couragement, and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after I
had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up
unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.

First, I had no plow to turn up the earth: no spade or shovel to dig
it: well, this I conquered, by making a wooden spade, as I observed
before; but this did my work in buts wooden manner; and though it
cost me a great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only
wore out the sooner, but made my work the harder, and performed it
much worse. However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out
with patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. When the
corn was sown, I had no barrow. but was forced to go over it myself, and
drag a great heavy bough ofa tree over it, to scratch it,as it may be
called, rather than rake or barrow it. When it was growing and grown,
l have observed already how many things I wanted to fence it, to secure
it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chafl',
and save it; then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and
salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; and yet all these things
I did without, as shall be observed; and the corn was an inestim'sble
comfort and advantage to me: all this,as I said, made every thing labori-
ous and tedious to me. but that there was no help for; neither was any
time so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it
was every day appointed to these works; and asI resolved to use none
of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next
six months to apply myself wholly, by labor and invention, to furnish
myself with utensils proper for the performing all the operations neces-
<<try for making corn lit for my use.

801' now I was to prepare more land; for] had seed enough to sow
above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's work at least
to make me a spade; which, when it was done, was but a sorry one
indeed, and very heavy, and required double labor to work with it: how-
ever, I went through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of
ground, as near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced
them in with a good hedge; the stakes of which were all cut olf that
wood which 1 had set before, and knew it would grow: so that, in one
year's time, I knewl should have a quick or living hedge, that would
want but little repair. This work took me up full three months: because
a great part of the time was in the wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I found
employment on the following occasions: always observing, that while I
was at work,I diverted myself with talking to my parrot. and teaching
him to speak; and I quickly learned him to know his own name. and at
last to speak it out pretty loud, Poll; which was the first word I ever
heard spoken in the island by any month but my own. This, therefore,
was not my work, but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said. I had
a great employment upon my hands, as follows: I had long studied, by
some means or other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed
I wanted much, but knew not where to come at them : however.consider~
ing the heat of the climate, 1 did not doubt but if I could find out any
clay,l might botch up some such pot as might, being dried in the sun.
be hard and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any thing that
was dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the
preparing corn, meal, etc., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to
make some as large as I could. and fit only to stand like jars, to hold
what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how
many awkward ways I took to raise this pastil; what odd, misshapen,
ugly things I made; how many of them fell in, and how many fell out,
the clay not being stifi'enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked
by the over violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily: and how
many fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as alter they were
dried: and, in a word. how, after having labored hard to find the clay, to
dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it. I could not make above
two large earthen ugly things (I can not call them jars) in about two
months' labor.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them
very gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets,
which I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and
as between the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, l
stufi'ed it full of the rice and barley straw: and these two pots being to
stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the
meal. when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yetI made
several smaller things with better success; such as little round pots. fiat
dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand turned to; and the
heat of the sun baked them very hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot
to hold liquids, and bear the fire, which none of these could do. It hap-
pened some time alter, making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat,
when I went to put it out after I had done with it,! found a broken piece
of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and
red as a tile. 1 was agreeably surprised to see it; and said to myself, that
certainly they might be made to burn whole, it they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some
pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing
them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but! placed three
large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon another, and
placed my firewood all around it, with a great heap of embers under
them. I plied the fire with fresh the! round the outside, and upon the
top, tiu I saw the pots in the inside red hot quite through, and observed
that they did not crack at all: when] saw them clear red; I let them
stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one of them, though
it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand which was mixed with the
clay melted by the violence of the heat, and would have run into glass,
if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually, till the pots began to
abate of the red color; and watching them all night, that I might not let
the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I will not
say handsome, pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt ascould
be desired; and one ofthem perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort of earthen-
ware for my use: but I must needs say, as to the shapesof them, they were
very indifferent, as one may suppose, as I had no way of making them
but as the children make dirt pics, or as a woman would make pies that
never learned to raise paste. No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was
ever equal to mine. when I found I had made an earthen pot that would
hear the fire; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold. before
I set one on the fire again, with some water in it, to boil me some meat,
which it did admirably well; and with a piece ofakid I made some
very good broth; though I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingwdients
requisite to make it so good as I would have had it to be.
My next concern was to get a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn
in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to that perfection
of art with one pair ofhsnds. To supply this want I was at a great loss;
for, of all trades in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-
cutter as for any whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I
spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and
make fit for a mortar; but could find none at all. except what was in the
solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out: nor, indeed, were
the rocks in the island of sufi'rcient hardness, as they were all of a sandy,
crumbling stone, which would neither bear the weight of a heavy pestle.
nor would break the corn without filling it with sand: so, aflara great
deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to
look out a great block of hard wood, which I found indeed much easler;
and getting one as bigas I had strength to stir. I rounded it. and formed
it on the outside with my ax and hatchet : and then, with the help of fire,
and infinite labor, made ahollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make
their canoes. After this,I made a greet heavy pestle, or heater, of the
wood, called iron-wood: and this I prepared and laid by against I had
my negt crop of com. when I proposed to myself to grind or rather pound,
my corn into meal, to make my bread.

My next difliculty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress my meal,
and to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see it
possible I could have any bread. This was a most difiicult thing, even
but to think on; for I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it; I
mean fine thin canvas or stufi', to search the meal through. Here I was
at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do; linen
I had none leit, but whatwas mere rags; I had goats' hair. but neither
knew how to weave it nor spin it: and had I known how, here were no
tools to work it with : all the remedy I found for- this was, at last recol-
lecting I had. among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of the
ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; with some pieces of these I
made three small sieves, proper enough for the work; and thus I made
shift fir some years: how I did afterward, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should
make bread when I came to have corn: for, first, I had no yeast: as to
that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself
much aboutjt; but for an oven I was indeed puzzled. At length I found
out an expedient for that also, which was this: I made some earthen vw
sels, very broad, but not deep, that is to say,about two feet diameter, and
not above nine inches deep: these I burned in the fire, as I had done the
other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire
upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own
making and burning also; but I should not call them square. When the
firewood was burned into embers, or live coals, I draw them forward upon
the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there let them lie till the hearth
was very hot; then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf,
or loaves, and covering them with the earthen pot, drew the embers all
round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat; and thus, as
well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my barley loaves, and be-
came, in a little time, a good pastry-cook into the bargain; forl made
myself several cakes and puddings of the rice; but made no pies, as I
had nothing to put into them except the flesh of fowls or goals.

It need not to be wondered at, if all these things took me up most part '
of the third year of my abode here; for, it is to be observed. in the inter-
vals of these things, 1 had my new harvest and husbandry to manage: I
reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I could, and
laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for
I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build
my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in; for the increase of the
corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty
bushels, and of rice as much or more, insomuch that now I resolved to
begin to use it fwely; for my bread had been quite gone a great while: I
resolved also to see what quantity would be suflicient for me a whole year,
and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were
much more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sowjust the
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would hilly provide me with bread, etc.

Am. the while these things were doing. you may be sure my thoughts
ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the
other side of the island; and I was not without some secret wishes that I '
was on shore there; fancying, that seeing the main land, and an inhab-
ited country, I might and some way or other to convey myself farther,
and perhaps at last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a con-
dition, and that I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps such
as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of
Africa; that it"! once came in their power, I should run a hazard of more
than a thousand to one of being killed and perhaps of being eaten; for I
had heard that the people of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals, or
man-eaters; and I knew, by the latitude. that I could not be far ofi' from
that shore. Then supposing they were not cannibais, yet that they
might kill me, as they had many Europeans who had fallen into their
hands, even when they have been ten or twenty together; much more I,
who was but one, and could make little or no defense ; all these things, I

say, which I ought to have considered well of, and did east up in my
' thoughts afterward, took up none of my apprehensions at first; yet my
head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to the shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoulder-
of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast
of Africa; but this was in vain: thenI thought I would go and look at
our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a
great way, in the storm, when we were first cut away. She'lay nearly
where she did at first, but not quite; having turned, by the force of the
waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of
beachy rough sand; but no water about her, as before. If I had had
hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into the water, the
boat would have done very well, and I might have gone back into the
Brazils with her easy enough: but I might have foreseen, that I could no
more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove
the island; however, I went to the woods, and cut levers and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do: suggesting to
myself, that if I could but turn her down, and repair the damage she had
received, she would be a very good boat. and I might venture to sea in
her.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I
think, three or four weeks about it: at last, finding it impossible to heave
her up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to under-
mine her, and so as to make her fall down, setting pieces of wood to
thrust and guide her right in the fall. But when I had done this. I was
unable to stir her up again, or to get under her, much less to move her
forward toward the water: so lwas forced to give it over: and yet,though
I gave over the hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over the main
increased, rather than diminished," the means for it seemed impossible.

At length, I began to think whether it was not possible to make myself
a canoe, or periagus, such as the natives of those climates make, even
without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk of a great
tree. This I not only thought possible. but easy, and pleased myself
extremely with the idea of making it, and with my having much more'
convenience for it than any of the Negroes and Indians; but not at all
considering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than
the Indians did, viz: the want of hands to move it into the water when it
was made, a dificnlty much harder for me to surmount than all the
consequences of want of tools could be to them : for what could it avail
me, if, alter I had chosen my treo,.and with much trouble cut it down,
and might be able with my tools to how and duh the outside into the
proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow,
so as to make a boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it just where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the water'!

One would imagine, if I had had the least reflection upon my mind of
my circumstances while I was making this boat, I should have immedi-
ately thought how I was to get it into the sea: but my thoughts were so
intent upon my voyage in it, that I never once considered how I should
get it off the land; and it was really, in its own nature, more easy for me
to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than the forty-live lhthoms of land,
where it lay to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did,
who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design,
without determining whether I was able to undertake it; not but that the
difliculty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I put a
stop to my own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer: Let me first
make it; I warrant I will find some way or other to get along when it is
done. .

This was a most preposterous method: but the eagerness of my fancy
prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tree, and I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple
at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part
next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty-two feet, where it lessened, and then parted into branches. It
was not without infinite labor that I felled this tree; I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at the bottom, and fourwen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it, cut 03': alter this, it cost me
a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the
bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost
me near three months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to
make an exact boat of it: this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet
and chisel, and by the dint of hard labor, till I had brought it to be avery
handsome periegua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men,
and consequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with
it. The boat was really much bigger than ever i saw a canoe or a peris-
gua, that was made of one tree, in my life. Many a weary stroke it had
cost, you may be sure; and there remained nothing but to get it into
the water; which, had I accomplished, I make no question but I should
have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed,
that ever was undertaken.108 awareness or

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost
me inexpressible labor too. It lay about one hundred yards from the
water. and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill
toward the creek. Well. to take away this discouragement, I resolved to
dig into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivlty: this I began.
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains that
have their deliverance in view?): when this was worked through, and
this difliculty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no more
stir the canoe than I could the other boat. Then I measured the distance
of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or cahal, to bring the water up to
the canoe. seeing! could not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I
began this work; and when I began to enter upon it. and calculated how
deep it was to be dug. how broad, how the stufl' was to be thrown out. I
found by the number of hands I had, having none but my own, that it
must have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone through
with it; for the shore lay so high. that at the upper end it must have been
atleast twenty feet deep; this attempt, though with great reluctancy, I
was at length obliged to give over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of
beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly
of our own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work, I finished my fourth year in this place, and
kept my anniversary with the same'devotion,and with as much comfort
as before; for. by a constant study and a serious application to the word
of God, and by the assistance of his grace, I gained a difl'erent knowledge
from what I had before; I entertained difl'erent notions of things; I
looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do
with. no expectations from, and, indeed. no desires about: in a word, I had
nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely to have; I thought it looked. as
we may perhaps look upon it hereafter. viz: as a place I had lived in, but
was come out of it; and well might I say. as lather Abraham to Dives,
" Between me and thee is a great gulf fixed." .

In the first place, I was here removed from all the wickedness of the
world; I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye. nor the
pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now capable
of enjoying: I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased. I might
call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had posses--
sion of; there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to dispute sover-
eignty or command with me: I mighthave raised ship-loadings of corn.
but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for
my occasion. I had tortoise or turtle enough,hut now and then one was
as much as! could put to any use: I had timber enough to have builta
fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have
cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been built.
But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to
eat and supply my wants, and what was the rest to me! If I killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; it'I sowed
more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down
were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them than
for fuel, and that I had no other occasion for but to drees my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon
just reflection, that all the good things of this world sre of no farther good
to us than for our use; and that whatever we may heap up to give others,
we only enjoy as much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous
griping miser in the world'would have been cured of the vice of covetous-
ness. if he had been in my case; tor I possessed infinitely more than I knew
what to do with. I had no room for desire. except it was for things which
I had not. and they were comparatively but trifles, though indeed of great
use to me. I had, as I hinwd before, a parcel of money,ss well gold as
silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless
stuff lay: I had no manner of business for it; and I often thought within
myself, that I would have given a'handml of it for s gross of tobacco
pipes, or for a hand-min to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all
for six-penny-worth of turnip and carrot seed h'om England. or for a hand-
ful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not the least
advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer, and grew
mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet seasons; and if I had had
the llrawer full of diamonds, it had been the same cam--they had-been
no manner of value to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much more comfortablein
itself than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my
body. I frequently sat down to meat with thankfitlness, and admimd the
hand of God's providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilder-
ness: I learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and
less upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what
I wanted: and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I can
not express them; and which I take notice of bees, to put those discon-
tented people in mind of it, who can not enjoy comfortably what God
has given them, because they see and covet something that He has not
given them. All our discontents about what we want, appeared to me'to
spring from the want'of thankfulness for what we have.

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtleu would be so to
any one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was, to
compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would be;
nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence of
God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up near to the shore.
where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got out of
her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I had wanted110 ' swam-ones or
for tools to work, weapons for defense, and gunpowder and shot for. get-
ting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself,
In the most-lively colors, how I must have scwd if I had got nothing out
of the'ship. I could not have so much as got any food, except fish and
turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must have
perished; that I should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere
savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any contrivance. I had no
way to day or open it, or part the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or
to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my claws,
like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence
to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships
and misfortunes; and this part also I can not but recommend to the
reflection of those who are apt, in their misery. to say, Is any amic-
tion like mine! Let them consider how much worse the cases of
some people are, and their case might have been, if Providence had
thought (it. '

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind
with hopes; and this was, comparing my present condition with what I
had deserved, and had therefore reason "respect from the hand of Provi-
dence. I had lived a dreadfhl life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge
and fear of God. I had been well instructed by my father and mother;
neither had they been wanting to me, in their endeavors to infuse an early
religious awe of God in my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the
nature and end of my being required of me. But, alas! falling early into
the seafaring life, which, of all lives, is the most destitute of the fear of
God, though his terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into
the seahring life, and into seafaring company. all that little sense of
religion which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my mess-
mates; by a hardened despising ofdangers, and the views of death, which
grew habitual to me; by my long absence from all manner of oppor-
tunities to converse with any thing but what was like myself, or to hear
any thing that was good, or tending toward it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least sense of
what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverancesl enjoyed (such
as my escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese master
of a ship, my being planted so well in the Brazils, my receiving the cargo
from England, and the like), I never had once the words, Thank God, so
much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I
so much as a thought to pray to him, or so much as to say, Lord, have
mercy upon me! no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to
swear by, and blaspheme it.

' Ihad terrible reflections upon my mind for many months,as I have
already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened Iil'e past; and
when I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had
attended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt
bountifully with me,--had not only punished me less than my iniquity
and deserved, but. had so plentifully provided for me,--this gave me great
hopes that my repentance was accepted,and that God had yet mercies in
store for me.

With these reflections, I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation
to the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but
even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was yet
a living man, ought notto complain, seeing I had not the due punishment
or my sins; that-I enjoyedso many mercies which I had no reason to
have expected in that place, that I ought never more to repine at my con-
dition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily bread, which
nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought; that I ought to
consider I had been fed by a miracle, even as great as that of feeding
Elijah by ravens; nay, bya long series of miracles: and that I could
hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world where
I could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where, as I had no
society, which was my amiction on one hand, so I found no ravenous
beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous or
poisonous creatures, whichI might feed on to my hurt; no savages, to
murder and devour me. In a word; as my life was a life of sorrow one
way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing to make it
a life of comfort. but to make myself sensible of God's goodness to me,
and care over me in this condition; and alter I did make a just improve-
ment or these things, I went away, and was no more sad.

I had now been here so long, that many things which I brought on
shore for my help were either quite gene, or very much wasted, and near
spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time,sll but avery little,
which I eked out with water. a little and a little, till it was so pale, it
scarce lelt any appearance of black upon the paper. As long as it lasted,
I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any
remarkable thing happened to me: and, first, by casting up times past, I
remember that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various
providences which befall me; and which, if I had been auperstitiously
inclined to observe days so fatal or unfortunate, I might have had reason
to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away from my
father and my friends, and ran away to Hull. in order to go to sea, the
same day afterward I was taken by the Sallee man-of-wsnand made a
slave; the same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of the
ship in Yarmouth Roads, that same day a year alterward I made my
escape fiom Sallee in the boat; and the same day of the year I was born
on, viz: the 80th of September. that same day I had my life so miracu-
lously saved twenty-six years alter, when I was cast on shore in this
island; so that my wicked life and my solitary life began both on one
day.

The next thing to' my ink being wasted. was that of my bread, I mean
the biscuit which I brought out of the ship: this I had husbanded to the
last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a
year; and yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I get any
corn of my own; and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at
all, the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes, too, began to decay mightily: as to linen,I had none for a great
while, except some checkered shirts which I found in the cheats of the
otherseamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times I could
bear no clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me that I
had among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen ofshirts.
There were also, indeed,several thick watcheoats ofthe seamen's which
were lett, but they were too hot to wear: and though it is true that the
weather was so violently hot that there was no need ofclothes, yet I could
not go quite naked, no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not,
nor could I abide the thought of it, though I was all alone. The reason
why [could not go quite naked was, I could not hear the heat ofthe sun so
well when quite naked as with some clothes on; nay, the very heat fre.
quently blistered my skin: whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made
some motion, and, whistling under the shirt. was twofold cooler than
without it. No more could I ever .bring myself to go out in the heat of
the sun without a cap or hat; the heat of the sun heating with such vio-
lence as it does in that place, would give me the headache presently. by
darting so directly upon my head. without a cap or hat on, so that I could
not hear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would presently go away. .

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,
which'I called clothes. into some order: I had worn out all the waist-
coats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make jackets
out of the great watchcoats that I had by me, and with such other
materials as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed. a-botch-
ing, for I made most piteous work of it. However, I made shit]. to make
two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while: as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shin. indeed,
till aflerward.

I have mentioned, that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I
killed, I mean four-rooted ones; and I had hung them up, stretched out
with sticks, in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and
hard that they were fit for little, but others I found very useful. The first
thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the
outside, to shoot oh' the rain: and this I performed so well, thatsner this I
made me a suit of clothes wholly of the skins, that is to say, a waistcoat,
and breechea, open at the knees, and both loosez'for they were rather
wanting to keep me cool than warm. I must not omit to acknowledge
that they were wretchedly made: for if I was a bad carpenterJ was a
worse tailor. However, they were such as I made a very good shit! with;
and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat
and cap being uppermost, I was kept very dry.

After this, I spent a. great deal of time and pains to make me an
umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind to
make me one; I had seen them made in the-Brazils, where they were
very useful in the great heats which are there; and I felt the heats'every
jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the equinox: beside, as I
was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me. as well
for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a great
while before I could make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind;
but at last, I made one that answered inditl'erently well, the main difliculty
I found was to make it to let down: Icould make it spread, but if it did
not let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but
just over my head, which would not do. However, at last, as I said,I
made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair upward, so that it
cost on' the rain like a pent-house. and keptofl'the sun so etfectually, that
I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage
than I could before in the coolest: and when I had no need of it, could
close it, and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entime composed
by resigning to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the
disposal of his providence. This made my life better than sociable; for
when I began to regret the want of conversation, I would ask myself,
whether thus conversing naturally with my own thoughts, and, as I hope
I may say, with even God himself; by ejaculations, was not better than
the utmost enjoyment of human society in the world!

THE ISLAND--HIS PERM!!! SITUATION AT SEA--El EMBED nous.

I can now say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing
happened to me, but I lived on in the same course. in the same posture
and place,just as before; the chief things I was employed in, beside my
yearly labor of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of

avoiding it: so that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by
the sea. for that was calm enough. but of starving for hunger. I had in-
deed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had
tossed it into the boat; and I had a greatjar of fresh water, that is to say,
one ofmy earthen pots; but what was all this to being driven into the vast
ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no main land or island,
for a thousand leagues at least! '

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make
even the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked
back upon my desolate, solitary island, as the most pleasant place in the
world; and all the happinws my heart could wish for was to be but there
again. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes: Oh happy
desert! said I, I shall never see thee more. Oh. miserable creature!
whither am I going! Then I reproached myself with my unthankful
temper, and how I had repined at my solitary condition: and now what
wouldI give to be on shore there again! Thus we never see the true
state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know
how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. Itis scarce possible
to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven nom my beloved
island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost
two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering again. How-
ever Iworked hard, till indeed my strength was almost exhausted, and
kept my boatas much to the northward, that is toward the side of the
current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon. as
the sun passed the meridian.I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in
my fries, springing up from S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and
especially when, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale.
By this time I was get at a frightful distance from the island, and had the
least cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way
too; for I had no compass on board, and should never have known how to
have steered toward the island. if I had but once lost sight of it: but the
weather continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and
spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to get
out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail,and the boat began to stretch away, I
saw even by the clearneee of the water some alteration of the current was
near; for where the current was so strong, the water was foul; but per-
ceiving the water clear. I found the current abate; and presently I found
to the east, at about halfa mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks;
these wcks I found caused the current to part again, and asthe main
stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east,
so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy,
which ran back again to the north-west, with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the
ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such-like extremities, may guess what my presentaurpriso
of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy;
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.

'l'his eddy carried me about a league in my way back again, directly
toward the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the
current which carried me away at first: so that when] came near the
island, I lbund myself open to the northern shore ofit, that is to say, the
other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way by the help
of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no farther.
However, I found that being between two great currents, viz: that on
the south side. which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which
lay about aleague on the other side; I say, between'these two, in the wake
of the island, I found the water at least still. and running no way; and
having still a brews of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for
the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of the
island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster,
stretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting of
the current more southerly. had, of course, made another eddy to the
north; and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my
course lay, which was due west, but almost mu north. However, having

_a fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west: and, in
about an hour, came within about a mile of the shore, where, it being
smooth water. I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my
deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of,my deliverance by my
boat; and refreshing myself with such things as 1 had, I brought my boat
close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some trees, and
laid me down to' sleep, being quite spent with the labor and htigue of the
voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to'get home with my boat; I had
run so much hazard, and knew too much of the easeh to think of
attempting it by the way I went out; and what might be at the other
side (I mean the west side) I knew not. nor had I' any mind to run any
more ventures: so I only resolved in the morning to make my way west-
ward along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay
up my frigate in safety, seal to have her again, if! wanted her. In
about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very .
good inlet or bay, about a, mile over, which narrowed till it came to a
very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbor for
my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
avoiding it: so that I had no prospect before me but of porishing, not by
the sea. for that was calm enough. but of starving for hunger. I had in-
deed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as 1 could lift, and had
tossed it into the boat; and I had a greatjar of fresh water, that is to say,

very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbor for
my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on
purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I
went on shore, to look about me. and see whereI was.

I soon found I had butalittls passed by the place where I had been
before, when I traveled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of
my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my
march. The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had
been upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening. where I found
every thing standing as I let! it; for I always kept it in good order, being,
as I said before, my country house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade, to rest my limbs,
for I was very weary, and fell asleep: butjudge you, if you can, that read
my story, what a surprise I must be in, When I was awaked out of my
sleep by a voice, calling me by my name several times, Robin, Robin,
Robin Crusoe; poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe!
Where are you! Wherehave you been!

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or paddling,
as it is called, the first part of the day, and with walking the latter part,
that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing between sleeping and
waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but as the voice
continued to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to wake
more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started up in
the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes open, but l saw
my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge; and immediately knew it was he
that spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk
to him, and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly, that he would
sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my fice, and cry, Poor Robin
Crusoe! Where are you! Where have you been! How came you
here! and such things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot. and that indeed it
could be nobody else. it was a good while before I could compose myself.
First, I was amazed how the creature got thither. and then, how he should
just keep about the place, and nowhere else: but as l was well satisfied
it could be nobody but honest Poll,l got over it: and holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name. Poll, the sociable creature came to
me, and set upon my thumb, as-he used to do, and continued talking to
me. Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here! and where had I
been! just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again: and so I carried
him home along with me.

I now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough
to do for many days, to sit still, and reflect upon the danger! had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side
of the island: but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about. As
to the east side of the island, which 1 had gone round,I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and myA0. Int. I begun to vuko non pctfuclly. And In: u but dutifully fright-

very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of the
island, I did not know how it might be there{ but supposing the current
ran with the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on
the other, I might run the same risk of being driven down the stream.
and carried by the island, as I had been before of being carried away
from it; so, with these thoughts,l contented myself to be without any
boat. though it had been the product of so many months' labor to make
it, and ofao many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a year, lived a very
sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being
very much compowd, as to my condition, and fully comforted in resign-
ing myself to the disposition of Providence, I thought I lived really very
happily in all things, except that of society.

I improved myselfin this time in all the mechanic exercises which my
necessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I could, upon
occasion, have made a very good carpenter especially considering how few
tools I had.

Beside this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware,
and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found
infinitely easier and better; because I made things round and shapeable,
which before were filthy things indeed 5 look on But I think I was
never more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for any thing I
found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though
it was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned red,
like other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the
smoke,I was exceedingly comforted with it; for] had been always used
to smoke: and there were pipes in the ship, but I forget them at first,
not thinking that there was tobacco in the island; and afterward, when
I searched the ship again, I could not come at any pipes at all.

In my wickerware also 1 improved much, and made abundance of
necessary baskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very
handsome, yet they were such as were very handy and convenient tbr
my laying things up in, or fetching things home. For example, if I killed
agoat abroad,l couldhang it up inatree.tlay it,dress it,and cutitlnpieces,
and bring it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle: I could cut it up,
take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh. which was enough for
me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also
large deep baskets were the'receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a
want which it was impvsible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to
say. how I should do to kill any goats. I had, as is observed, in the third
year of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her-up tamerand I
was in hopes of getting a hegoat: but I could not by any means bring it
to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and as I could never an it. my
heart to kill her, she died at last of mere age.

Bantu now in my eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have said,
my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and
share the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and
particularly,l wanted a she-goat great with young. For this purpou, I
made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more than
once taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
I always found them broken. and my bait devoured. At length I resolved
to try a pitfall: so I dug severfl large pits in the earth, in places where I
had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles.
of my own 'making too, with a great weight upon them; and several

. times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I
could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn,
for I could see the marks of their feet. At length I set three traps in one
night, and going the next morning, I found them all standing, and yet the
bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging. However. I altered my
traps; and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to see
my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-g'oat, and in one of the
others three kids, a male and two females.

As to the old one, I lines! not what to do with him; he was so fierce, I
dunt not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted; I could have killed him, but that
was not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him out,
and he ran away, as if he had been frightened out ofhie wits. But I had
forgot then, what I had learned afterward, that hunger will tame a lion.
If I had let him stay there three or four days without food, and then
have carried him some water to drink. and then a little corn. he would
have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious,
tractable creatures, where they are well used. However, for the pment
I let him go, knowing no better at that time: then I went to the three
kids and taking them one by one, I tied them with strings together, and
with some diflEculty brought them all home.80 um. flu: my inclolun Wu flnhhod' and l lei. them Icon. they would

It was a good while before they would reed; but throwing them some
sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to he tame. And now I
found that if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh when I had
no powder or shot lelt. breeding some up tame was my only way: when,
perhaps,I might have them about my house like s flock of sheep. But
then it occurred to me, that I must keep the tame from the' wild, or else
they would always run wild when they grew up; end the only way for
this was, to have some inclused piece of ground, well fenced, either with
hedge or pus, to keep them inso efl'ectuslly, that those within might not
break out or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking lbr one pair of hands; yet as I sew there
was an sbmlute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out e
proper piece of ground. where there was likely to be herbage for them to
eat, water for them to drink-and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such inclosnree will think I had very little cona
trivance, when I pitched 'upon e place very proper for ell these (being a
plain open piece-of meadow lend, or savanna, as our people cell it. in the
western colonies), which had two or three little drills of flesh water in it,
and at one end wasvery woody; I say, they will smile at my forecast, when
Ishsll tell them, r began my inclosing this pieoeofgroundin such-a man-
ner, that my hedge or pale must have'been at least two miles sbont. Nor
was the madness of It so great as to the compass, {or if it was ten miles
about, I was like to have time'enough to do it in; but] didnot'conslder
that my goats would beaswild in somuchoompeuas it'they had bed the
whole island, and I should have so much room to chase them in, that I
should never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I'beliese about titty yards, when
this thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, end, for the
first beginning, I resolved to inclose s piece of about one hundred and
tiny yards in length. end one hundred yerds in breadth; which,es it would
maintain as men'xas I should have in any ressonable time, sores my
stock increased, I could add more ground to my incloeure.

This was acting with some prudencemnd I went to work with courage.
I was about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done
it, I tethered the three kids in the best pertof it, and need them to feed
as near me as possiblento make them fimiliar; and very often I would
go and carry them some ears of barley, or e handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand, so that alter my incloeure was finished, end I let
them loose they would follow me up end down blasting alter me for a
handful of corn. 9

This'enswered my end; and in about a year and a half I had a flock of
sbout-iwelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had three-end-
forty, beside several thet I took and killed for my food. After that I

inclosed flve several pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to
11
drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of
ground into another.

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's flesh to feed on
when l pleased, but milk too; a thing which indeed. in the beginning. I
did not so much as think of. and which, when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable surprise: for now I set up my dairy, and had
sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives
supplies of food. to every creature. dictates even naturally how to make
use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen
butter or cheese made, only when I was a boy, after a great many essays
and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at least, and also salt
(though I found it made tomy hand by the heat of the sun upon some
or the rocks of the sea), and never wanted it atterward. How mercifully
can our Creator treat his creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seem to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can he sweeten the bitter-
est providenees, and give us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons!
What a table was here spread for me in awildemess, where I saw nothing,
at first but to perish for hunger!

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my little family
sit down to dinner: there was my majesty, the prince and lord of the
whole island; 1 had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command;
I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away: and no rebels among
all my subjects. Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my servants: Poll. as if he had been "my fluorite; was the
only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, now grown very old and
crazy, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side of the
table, and one on the other, exmcting now and then a bit from my hand,
as a mark of special fiver.

But these were not the two cat: which I brought on shore at first; for
they were both or them dead, and had been interred near my habitation
by my own hand; but one of them having multiplied (by I know not
w hat kind of creature, these were two which I had pmerved tame .
whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome
to me at last; for they would often come into my house, and plunder me
too. till at last I was obliged to shoot them and did kill a great many; at
length they let! me. With this attendance. and in this painml manner, I
lived; neither could I be said to want any thing but society: and of that,
some time alter this. I was like to have too much.

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my
boat, though very loth to run any more hazards; and therefore some.
times I sat contriving ways to get her about the island. and at other times
i sat myself down contented enough without her. But I had a strange
uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as I
have said, in my last ramble,I went up the hill to see how the shore lay,In dinner. ' ' ' Poll. 3: if he hm! been my favorite. wtfi 1h"

and how the current set, that I might see_what1 had to do: this incli-

thither by land, following the edge of the shore. I did so; but had any
one in England encountered such a man as I was, it must either have
frightened him. or raised a great deal of laughter: and as I frequently

stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my >>.

traveling through Yorkshire, with such an equipage, and in such a dress.
Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows:

I had a. great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a flap
hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the
rain ofl' from running into my neck: nothing being so hurtful in these
climates as the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes.

I had a short jacket ofgoat's skin, the skirts coming down to about the
middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same; the
breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down
such a length on either side, that like pantaloons, it reached to the
middle of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me a
pair of something, I scarce know what to call them, like huskins, to flap
over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashee: but of a most
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together with
two thongs of the same, instead of buckles: and in a kind of a frog on
either side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and a
hatchet; one on one side and one on the other. I had another belt. notao
hroad,and fistenod in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder. and
at the end of inunder my lett arm,hung two pouches, both made of goat's
akin too; in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my

. back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun; and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella, but which, after all, was
the most necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As for my
ties, the color of it was really not so mulatto--like as one might expect
item a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees
of ms equinox. My heard I had once suEered to grow till it was about
a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissors and razors suficient,
I had cut it pretty short, except what grewon my upper lip. which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen
worn by some Turks at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear such, though
the Turks did : of thesemustachioes or whiskers, I will not say they were
long enough to hang my' hat upon them, but they were of a length and
shape monstrous enough, and such as, in England, would have paved
for frightful.

But all this is by-the-by; for,as to my figure, I had so few to observe
me that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say no more to that
part. In this kind of figures] went my new journey, and was out five
or six days. Itraveled first along the seashore, directly to the place
where I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; and
having no boatnow to take care of, 1 went over the land, a nearer way,
to the same hight that! was upon before; when looking forward to the
point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with
my boat. as is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and
Quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there than in any
other places. I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved
to spend some time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of
the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently convinced how it was,
viz: that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the cur-
rent of waters from some great river on the shore, must be the occasion
of this current: and that according as the wind blew more forcibly flom
the west, or from the north, this current came nearer, or went farther
from the shore; for waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the
rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current
again as before, only that it ran farther off, being near half a league from
the shore; whereas, in my case, it set close upon the shore, and hurried
me and my canoe along with it; which, at another time, it would not
have done.

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do but to observe
the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my
heat about the island again: but when '1' began to think of putting it in
practice, I had such a terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the
danger I had been in, thatI could not think of it again with any patience;
but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe,
though more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or rather make
me another periagua or canoe; and so have one for one side of the island,.
and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two planta-
tions in the island; one, my little fortification or tent. with the wall
about it, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time, I
had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another. One
of these, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the
rock, was all filled up with the large earthen pots, of which I have given
an account. and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold
five or six bushels each, where I laid up my store of provision. especially
my corn, some in the ear, out of short from the straw, and the othe.
rubbed out with my hand.

As for my wall. made. as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles
grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so
very much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one's view, at
any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little firther within the land, and
upon lower ground. lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly
cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its
season: and whenever I had occasion for more corn,I had more land
adjoining as fit as that.

Beside this, I had my country seat; and I had now a tolerable planta-
tion there also; for, first,l had my little bower," I called it, which I
kept in repair; that is to say,I kept the hedge which encircled it con-
stanty fitted up to its usual hight, the ladder standing always in the in-
side; I kept the trees, which at first were no more than my stakes, but
were now grown very firm and tall. always cut so, that they might spread
and grow thick and wild. and make the more agreeable shade; which
they did efl'ectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my tent
always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles. set up for that
purpose, and which never wanted any repair or renewing: and under
this I had made me a aquab or couch, with the skins of the creatures I
had killed, and with other soft things: and a blanket laid on them. such
as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved. and a great watch-
cnat to cover me; and here, whenever] had occasion to be absent from
my chief seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my inelosures for my cattle, that is to say, my
goats; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and
incloso this ground, I was so anxious tosee it kept entire, lest the goats
should break through. that I never leh oll', till, with infinite labor, I stuck
the outside of the hedgeso full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put
a hand through between them; which afterward, when those stakes grew,
as they all did in the next rainy season. made the inclosure strong like a.
wall,--indeed, stronger than any wall. _

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pain!
to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support;
for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my
hand would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me
as long as I lived in the place. if it were to be forty years; and that keep-
ing them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my inclosures
to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping them together; which,
by this method, indeed, I so efl'ectually secured, that when these little
stakes began to grow, I had planted them so yery thick, that l- was forced
to pull some of them up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally
depended on for my winter store of raisins. and which I never failed to
preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my
whole diet: and, indeed, they were not only agreeable, but medicinal,
wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the
place where I had laid up my host, I generally stayed and lay herein my
way thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat; and lLept-sll things
about, or belonging to her, in very good order: sometimes I went out in
her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor
scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so appre-
hensive of being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents, or
winds, or any other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my life.

11' happened one day, about noon, going toward my boat, I was
exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore.
which was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunder-
Itruck, or as if I had seen an apparition; i listened, I looked round me,
but I could hear nothing, nor see any thing; I went up to a rising ground,
to look farther; I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was all'
one; I could see no other impressions but that one. I went to it again to
see if there were any more. and to observe if it might not be my fancy;
but there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot,
toes, heel, and every part of a foot: how it came thither I knew not, nor
could I in the least imagine; but aflerinnumerahle fluttering thoughts.
likea man perfectly confused and out of myself,l came home to my
fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to
the last degreef looking behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking
every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to he a man.
Nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes my afl'righted
imagination represented things to me in,_how may wild ideas were found
every moment in my fancy. and what strange unaccountable whimsiea
came into my thoughts by the way. '

When [came to my castle (forso 1 think I called it ever after this), I
fled into it like one pursued; whether] went over by the ladder, as first
contrived, 'or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called a door, I
can not remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning; for
never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of
mind than I to this retreat.

I slept none that night; the farther [was from the occasion of my
fright, the greater my apprehensions were; which is something contrary
to the nature of such things and especially to the usual practice ofallingly surprised with the print of : man's Inked foot on the and. 1 mod

creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas
of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself.
even though I was now a great way 08' it. Sometimes I fancied it must
be the Devil, and reason joined in with me upon this supposition; for
how should any other thing in human shape come into the place! Where
was the veuel that brought them! What marks were there of any
other footsteps! And how was it possible a man should come there!
But then to think that Satan should take human shape upon him in
such a place, where there could he no manner of occasion for it, but to
leave the print ofhis foot behind him, and that even foano purpose too,
for he could not be sure I should see it,--this was an amazement the
other way. I considered that the Devil might have found out abundance
of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot;
that as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never have
been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where itwas ten thousand to
one whether I should eversee it or not, and in the sand too, which the
first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced entirely:
all this seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all the notions
we usually entertain of the subtlety of the Devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all
apprehensions of its being the Devil; and I presently concluded then,

, that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz: that it must be some
of the savages of the main land over against me, who had wandered out
to sea in their canoes. and either driven by the currents or by contrary
winds, had made the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away
again to sea; being as loth, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate
island as I would have been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very thank-
ful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that
time, or'that they did not see my boat, by which they would have con-
cluded that some inhabitants had been in the place,and perhaps have
searched fisrther for me: then terrible thoughts racked my imagination
about their having found my boat and that there were people here; and
that if so, I should certainly have them come again in greater numbers,
and devour me: that if" should happen so that they should not find me,
yet they would find my incloeure. destroy all my corn, and carry away
all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that formeroonfldence
in God, which was founded upon such wonderful experienceas I had had
of his goodness, as if he that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not

' preserve by his power, the provision which he had made tbr me by his
goodness; I reproeched myself with my lazinws, that would not sow
any more corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as
i! no accident would intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was
upon the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for
the future to have two or three years' corn beforehand; so that whatever
might come, I might not perish for want of bread.

How strange a checkir-worlr of Providence is the life of man; and by
what secret difi'erent springs are the atl'ections hurried about, as difl'erent
circumstances present! Today we love what to-morrow we hate; to-
day we seek what to-morrw we shun; to--day we deslre what to-morrow
we fear, nay. even tremble at the apprehensions of; this was exemplified
in me, at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable; for I, whose
only amiction was that I seemed banished from human society, that! was
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean. cut off from mankind. and
condemned to what I called silent life; that l was as one whom Heaven
thought not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear among
the rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of my own species
would have seemed to me a raising me from death to life. and the greatest
blessing that Heaven itself. next to the supreme blessing of salvation,
could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions
of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow
or silent appearance of a man's having set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it atf'orded me a great
many curious speculations atterward, when I had a little recovered my
first surprise. I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely
wise and good providence of God had determined for me; that as I could
not foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was
not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an
undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as
he thought fit: and who, as I was a creature that had olfended him, had
likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment he thought
fit; and that it was my part to submit to hear his indignation, because I
had sinned against him. I then reflected, that as God, who was not only
righteous, but omnipotenghad thought tit thus to punish and afflict me,
so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think tit to do so, it was
my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to his
will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray
to him. and quietly to attend the dictates aid directions of his daily
providence.

These thoughts tool: me up many hours, days; nay, I may say, weeks
and months: and one particular efl'ect of my cogitations on this occasion
I can not omit: One morning early, lying in my bed. filled with thoughts
about my danger from the appearances of savages,l found it discom-
poaed me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture came
into my thoughts: "Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my
bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged
to pray earnestly to God for deliverance: when I had done praying. I took
up my Bible, and opening it to read. the that words that presented to me
were, "Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer. and he shall strengthen
thy heartzwait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to express the com-
fort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and was
no more sad. at least on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it
came into my thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of
my own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I
came on shore from my host: this cheered me up a little too and I began
to persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own foot: and why might I not come that way from the boat. as well as I
was going that way to the boat'! Again, I considered also, that I could
by no means tell, for certain, where I had trod, and where I had not; and
that if. at last, this was only the print of my own foot. I had played the
part of those fools who try to make stones of specters and apparitions,
and then are frightened at them more than anybody.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not
stirred out ofmy castle forthree days and nights, so that I began to starve
for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but some barley
cakes and water: then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked
too, which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor creatures
were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it
almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk. Encouraging
myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the print of one
of my own feet, and that I mightbe truly said to start at my own shadow,
I began to go abroad again, and went to my country house to milk my
dock: but to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready every now and then, to lay down my basket, and
run for my life, it would have made any one thought I was haunted with
an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly frightened ; and
so, indeed, I had. However, as I went down thus two or three days, and
having seen nothing, I began to be a little holder, and to think there was
really nothing in it but my own imagination: but I could not persuade
myself fully of this till [should go down to the shore again. and see this
print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see if there was any
similitude of fitness. that I might be assured it was my own foot: but
when I came to the place, first, it appeared evidently to me, that when
I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore anywhere there-
about: secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own foot, I
found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these things tilled my
head .with new imaginations, and gave me the vapors again to the
highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one in an ague: and
I went home again, filled with the belief that some man or men had been
on shore there; or, in short, that the island was inhabited, and I might
be surprised before I was aware; and what course to take for my security
I knew not.

On what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear!
It deprives them of the use of those means which reason oflers for their
relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my
inclosures. and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the
enemy should find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of
the same or the like booty: then to the simple thing of digging up my
two corn fields, lest they should find such a grain there, and still be
prompted to frequent the island: then to demolish my bower and tent,
that they might not see any vestiges of habitation,and be prompted to
look farther, in order to find out the person inhabiting.

These were the subjects of the first night's cogitations after I was come
home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind
were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapors asabove. Thus fear
of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when
apparent to the eyes: and we find the burden ofanxiety greater by much,
than the evil which we are anxious about: and, which was worse than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble. from the resignation I used to
practice, that I hoped to have. I looked. I thought, like Saul, who com-
plained not only that the Philistines were upon him, but that God had
forsaken him; for i did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by
crying to God in my distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had
done before, for my defense and deliverance; which, if! had done,l had at
least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and per-
haps carried through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the
morning' I fell asleep: and having, by the amusement of my mind, been,
as it were tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and
waited much better composed than! had ever been belore. And now!
begun to think sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with myself. 1 con-
cluded that this island, which was so exceeding pleasant. fruitful. and no
farther from the main land than as! had seems-as not so entirely aban-
doned as I might imagine; and although there were no slated inhabitants
who lived on the spot. yet that there might sometimes come boats 08' from
the shore, who either with design, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by cross winds. might come to this place; that 1 had lived here
fineen years now, and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any
people yet; and that if at anytime they should be driven here, it was
probable they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they
had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most I could
suggest any danger from, was from any casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven
hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went
ofi' again with all possible speed; seldom staying one night on shore, lest
they should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again; and
that therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat.
in case I should see any savages land upon the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to
bring a door through again, which deer, as I said, came out beyond where
my fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering this,
therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the same
manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my well, just where I had
planted a double row of twee about twelve years befors,ot' which I made
mention: these trees having been planted so thick before. they wanted
but few piles to be driven between them, that they might be thicker and
stronger. and my wall would he soon finished: so that I had nowa double
wall; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber. old cables,
and every thing I could think of, to make it strong: having in it seven
little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of
this, I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with continually bring-
ing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walk-
ing upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the
muskets, of which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the
ship; thesel planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that
held them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two
minutes' time: this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet
never thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a
great length every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like
wood.which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; inaornuch,
that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a
pretty large space between them and my wall. that I might have room
to see an enemy. and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if
they attempted to approach my outer wall.

Thus in two years' time, I had a thick grove; and in five or six years'
time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and
strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no men, of what
kind soever, would imagine that there was any thing beyond it, much
lessa habitation. As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in
and out (for I lett no avenue). it was by setting two ladders, one to a port
of the rock which was low, and then broke in,and lelt room to place
another ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down, no
man living could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and
if they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thusl took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my
own preservation; and it will be seen, at length, that they were fit
altogether without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time
more than my mere fear suggested to me.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other afliirs;
- for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goals: they
were not only a ready supply to'me on every occasion, and began to be
suflicient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also
without the fatigue of hunting alter the wild ones; and I was loth to
lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.

For this purpose, atter long consideration, I could think of but two
ways to preserve them : one was, to find another convenient place to dig
a cave under ground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other
was, to inclose two or three little bits of land, remote item one another,
and as much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half a dozen
young goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock
in general,I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and
time: and this. though it would require a great deal of time and labor, I
thought was the most rational design.

Accordingly,l spent some time to find out the most retired parts of
the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as
my heart could wish for: it was a little damp piece of ground, in the
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed.l almost
lost myself once before, endeavoring to come back that way from the
eastern part of the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near three
acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an inclosure by
nature; at least, it did not want near so much labor to make it so as the
other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.

I molars" went to work with this piece of ground, and in less than
a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my dock, or herd. call it
which you please, who were not so wild now as at first they might be
supposed to he, were well enough secured in it: so, without any farther
delay, I removed ten young she goats and two he goats to this place; and
when they were there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it
as secure as the other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took
me up more time by a great deal. All this labor I was at the expense of,
purely from my apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's
not which I had seen; for, as yet, I never saw any human creature come
near the island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness,
which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before,
as may be well imagined by any one who knows what it is to live in the
constant snare of the fear of man. And this! must observe, with grief
too, that the discomposure of my mind had too great impressions also
upon the religious part of my thoughts: for the dread and tenor of
falling into the hands of savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits,
that lseldom found myself in a due temper for application to my Maker,
at least not with the sedate calmness and resignation ofsoul which I was
wont to do: I rather prayed to God as under great aflliction and pressure
of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night of being
murdered and devoured before morning; and I must testify from my
experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and afi'ection, is
much the more proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discom-
posure; and that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no
more tit fora comforting performance of the duty of praying to God,
than he is for a repentance on a sick bed; for these discomposures afl'ect
the mind, as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the mind
must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and much
greater; praying to God being properlyan act of the mind, not of the
body.

But to go on: after! had thus secured one part of my little living
stock. I went about the whole island, searching for another private place
to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west point
of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought
I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship,
but I had it not about me; and this was so remote, that I could not tell
what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able to
hold to look any longer: whether it was a boat or not,I do not know, but
as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it over;
onlyl resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in my
pocket. When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where,
indeed,I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the seeing
the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the island as I
imagined: and, but that it was a special providence that I was out upon
the side of the island where the sayages never came. I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the
main, when they happened to he a little too far out at sea, to shoot over
to that side of the island for harbor: likewise, as they often met and
fought in their canoes, the victors. having taken any prisoners, would
bring them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful

customs, being all cannibaJs, they would kill and eat them; of which
hereafter. '
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the
south-west point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed;
nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the
shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies;
and, particularly,l observed a place where there had been a fire made,
and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage
wretches had sat down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of
their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no
notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while : all my appre-
hensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish
brutality. and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which,
though 1 had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of before:
in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach
grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged
the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not hear to stay in the place a
moment; so I got me up the hill again with all the speed I could, and
walked on toward my own habitation.

When [came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still awhile,
as amazed, and then recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost afl'ec-
tion of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks,
that had cast my that lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished
from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I had esteemed
my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts
in it, that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of: and
this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been com-
forted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of His blessing;
which was a felicity more than sufliciently equivalent to all the misery
which I had sutfered, or could sutler.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and began to
be much easier now,as to the safety of my circumstances, than everl
was before: for I observed that these wretchee never came to this island
in search of what they could get: perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or
not expecting, any thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up in
the covered woody part of it, without finding any thing to their purpose.
I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the
least footsteps of human creature there before; and I might be eighteen
years more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover
myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my
only business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I
found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make myself known
to. Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I
have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their
devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad,
and kept close within my own circle, for almost two years alter this;
when I say my own circle,I mean by it my three plantations, viz: my
castle, my country seat, which I called my bower, and my inclosure in
the woods: nor did I look alter this for any other use than as an inclosure
for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these hellish
wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the
Devil himself. I did not so much as go to look after my boat all this
time, but began rather to think of making me another; forIcould not
think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat round
the island, to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea;
in which, if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what
would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of
being discovered by these people, began to wear olt' my uneafiness about
them: and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before;
only with this ditference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes
more about me, than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any
of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest
any of them being on the island should happen to hear it. It was there-
fore a very good providence to me thatl had furnished myself with a
tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the
woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was
by traps and snares, as I had done before: so that for two years alter this,
I believe I never fired my gun once ofi', though I never went out without
it; and which was more. as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I
always carried them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them
in my goat's--skin belt. I also l'urbished up one of the great cutlasses
that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on also; so that
I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad. if you
add to the former description of myself, the particular of two pistols, and
a great broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said for some time, I seemed, except-
ing these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way ofliving.
All these things tended to show me, more and more, how far my condi-
tion was from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many
other particulars of life. which it might have pleased God to have made
my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining there ,would be
among mankind at any condition of life. if people would rather compare
their condition with those that were worse. in order to be thankml, than
be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their
murmurings and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many things which I
wanted. so, indeed, I thought that the frightsI had been in about these
savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation,
had taken ofl' the edge of my invention for my own conveniences: and I
had dropped a good design. which I had once bent my thoughts too much
upon, and that was, to try ifl could not make some of my barley into
malt, and then try to brew myself some beer. This was really a whim-
sical thought. and l reproved myself onen for the simplicity of it; for I
presently saw there would be the want of several things necessary to the
making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply; as. first.
casks to preserve it in, which wasa thing that, as I have observed already,
I could never compass; no, though I spent, not only many days, but
weeks, nay, months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. ln the next
place, I had no hops to make it keep. no yeast to make it work, no copper
or kettle to make it boil ; and yet, with all these things wanting, l verily
believe, had not the {rights and terrors! was in about the savages inter-
vened,l had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too: for I
seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing it, when once I had it
in my head to begin it. But my invention now ran quite another way; for,
night and day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these monsters in their cruel, bloody entertainment, and. if possible, save
the victim they should bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger
volume than this whole work is intended to be, to set down all the con-
trivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the
destroying these creatures. or at least frightening them so as to prevent
their coming hither any more: but all this was abortive; nothing could
be possible to take eti'ect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and
what could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty
or thirty of them together, with their darts. or their bows and arrows,
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as 1 could with my gun!
Sometimes l thought of digging a hole under the place where they
made their fire. and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which,
when they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up
all that was near it: but as, in the first place, 1 should be unwilling to
waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the
quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going oll' at any
certain time, when it might surprise them: and. at best, that it would do
little more than just blow the tire about their ears, and frighten them,
but not suflicient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it aside: and
then proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient
place, with my three guns all doudle--ioaded, and, in the middle of their
bloody ceremony. let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound
perhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with
my three pistols, and my sword. I made no doubt but that if there were
twenty I should kill them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts for some
weeks; and l was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it, and sometimessonmson (23030:. 137

that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep. I went so far with
it in my imagination, that I employed myself several days to find out
proper places to put myself in ainhuscsde, as I said, to watch for them;
and I went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more
familiar to me: but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of
revenge, and a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as
I may call it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the bar-
barous wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice. Well, at
lengtb,I found a place in the side of the hill, where I was satisfied I
might securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming: and might then.
even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself, un-
seen, into some thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow
large enough to conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe
all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they
were so close together as that it would be next to impossible that lshould
miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the
first shot. In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design: and, accord-
ingly, I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two
musket: I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets; and the fowling--piece I loaded
with near a handful of swan-shot. of the largest size: I also loaded my
pistols with about four bullets each; and in this posture, well provided with
ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my
expedition.

Anerl had thus laid'the scheme of my design, in my imagination, put
it in practice. I continually made my tour every morning, up to the top
of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it,about three miles, or
more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea. coming near the
island or standing over toward it: but I began to tire of this hard duty,
after I had, for two or three months, constantly kept my watch. but
came always back without any discovery; there having not, in all that
time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on the
whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses'could reach every way.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also I
kept up the vigor of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while
in a suitable form for so outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or
thirty naked savages, for an ofl'ense which I had. not at all entered into a
discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my passions were at first
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of
that country; who, it seems, had been sutTered by Providence. in his wise
disposition of the world, to have no other guide than that of their own
abominable and vitiated passions; and, consequently, were left, and per-
haps had been so for some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive
such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by

12
Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy, could have run them
into. But now, when, as l have said. I began to be weary of the fruitless
excursions which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain,
so my opinion of the action itself began to alter; and I began, with cooler
and calmer thoughts, to consider what Iwas going to engage in; what
authority or call] had to be judge and executioner upon these men as
criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to sutfcr,
unpunished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of hisjudg--
ments one upon another. How far these people were ofl'enders agaipst
me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which
they shed promiscuously upon one another, I debated this very often
with myself. thus; How do 1 know what God himself judges in this par-
ticular case? It is certain these people do not commit this as a crime; it
is not against their own consciences reproving, or their light reproaching
them: they do not know it to be an offense. and then commit it in def>>
ance of Divine justice. as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They
think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill
an ox; nor to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was
certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were not murderers in
the sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more
than those Christians were murderers who often put to death the pris-
oners taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put
whole troops of men to the sword. without giving quarter, though they
threw down their arms and submitted. In the next place. it occurred to
me. that although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and
inhuman. yet it was really nothing to me; these people had done me no
injury: that ifthey attempted me, or I saw it necessary, for my immedi-
ate preservation, to fall upon them, something might be said for it; but
thatl was yet out of their power, and they really had no knowledge of
me, and consequently no design upon me: and'therefore it could not be
just for me to fall upon them: that this would justify the conduct oftho
Spaniards in all their barbariiies practiced in America. where they
destroyed millions of these people: who. however they were idolaters
and barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their
customs. such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet,ss
to the Spaniards. very innocent people; and that the' rooting them
out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrencs and detesta-
tiun by even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other
Christian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatural
piece of cruelty. unjustifiable either to God or man; and for which the
very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all
people of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a race of men who
were without principles of tenderness, or the common bowels of pity to
the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark of generous temper in the
mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a. kind of a full
stop; and I began, by little and little. to be 017' my design. and to con-
cludeI had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the savages;
and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they first
attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent; but
that if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty. 0n
the other hand, I argued with myself, that this really was the way not to
deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at that time, but
that should ever come on shore afterward, if but one of them escaped to
tell their country people what had happened, they would come over
again by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should
only bring upon myselfa certain destruction, which, at present, I had no
manner of occasion for. Upon the whole,I concluded, that neither in
principle nor in policy,l ought, One way or other, to concern myself in
this afl'air: that my business was. by all possible means, to conceal my-
self from them, and not to leave the least signal to them to guess by that
there were any living creatures upon the island, I mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential resolution: and I was convinced
now, many ways. that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying
all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean
innocent as to me. As to the crimes they were guilty of toward one
another,I had nothing todo with them; they were national, and I ought
to leave them to the justice of God, who is the governor of nations, and
knows how. by national punishments, to make a just retribution for
national otfenses, and to bring public judgments upon thoae who ofl'end
ina public manner. by such ways as best please him. This appeared
so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than
that I had not been sufl'ered to do a thing which I now sawso much
reason to believe would have been no less a sin than that of willful murder,
if I had committed it; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to
God, that had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching him
to grant me the protection of his providence, that! might not fall into
the hands of the barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them,

unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defense of my
own life.
SECTION XIX.

ROBIIIBON DISCOVEBS A CAVE, WHICH SERVES XII AS A RETREAT AGAINST
THE BAVAGIIS-

IN this disposition I continued for near a year after this;and so far
was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in
all that time! never once went up the hill to see whether there were
any of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on shore
there or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my contri-
vances against them. or be provoked, by any advantage which might
present itself, to fall upon them : only this I did, I went and removed my
boat, which I had on the other side of the island. and carried it down to
the eastcnd of the whole island. where I ran it into a little cove, which
I found under some high rocks, and where I knew. by reason of the cur-
rents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats,
upon any account whatever. With' my boat I carried away every thing
that I had left there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare
going thither. viz: a mastand sail which I had made for her. and a thing
like an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called either anchor or
grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its kind: all these I
removed, that there might not be the least shadow of any discovery, or
any appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation, upon the
island. Beside this. I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, and
seldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant employment, .
viz: to milk my she goats, and manage my little flock in the wood. which,
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was quite out of danger;
for certain it is. that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this
island, never came with any thoughts of finding any thing here, and con-
sequently never wandered ofl' from the coast; and I doubt not but they
might have been several times on shore alter my apprehensions of them
had made me cautious, as well as before. Indeed,I looked back with
some horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been
if I had popped upon them and been discovered before that,when, naked
and unarmed, except with one gun. and that loaded often only with
small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and peering about the island
to see what I could get; what a surprise should I have been in, if. when
I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead of that, seen fineen
or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of
their running, no possibility of my escaping them! The thoughts of
this sometimes sank my very soul within me, and distressed my mind
so much, that I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have
done, and bowl should not only have been unable to resist them, but
even should not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might
have done; much less now, afler so much consideration and preparation,
I might be able to do. Indeed, alter serious thinking of these things. I
would be very melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while;

. hutI resolved it all, at last, into thankfulness to that Provtdsnce which
had delivered me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept from me
those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in delivering
myself from, because I had not the least notion of any such thing
depending, or the least supposition of its being possible. This renewed
a contemplation which onen had come to my thoughts in former times,
~whan first I began to see the merciful disposition of Heaven, in the
dangers we run through in this life; how wonderfully we are delivered
when we know nothing of it; how, when we are in (a quandary. as 'we
call it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way, or that way, a
secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that way:
nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business, has called
to go the other way, yeta strange impression upon the mind, from we
know not what springs, and by we know not what power, shall overrule
us to go this way; and it shall afterward appear, that had we gone that
way which we should have gone, and even to our imagination ought
to have gone, we should have been ruined and lost. Upon these,
and many like reflections, I atterward- made it a certain rule with
me, that whenever I found these secret hints or pressings of mind. to
doing or not doing any thing that presented, or going this way or that
way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew no other
reason for it than that such a pressure, or such a hint, hung upon my
mind. I could give many examples of the success of this conduct in
the course of my life, but more especially in the latter part of my inhabit-
ing this unhappy island; beside many occasions which it is very likely I
might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I
see with now. But it is never too late to be wise; and I can not but
advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with such extra-
ordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to
slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them come from what
invisible intelligence they will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps
can not account for; but certainly they are a proof of the converse of
spirits, and a secret communication between those embodied and those
unembodied. and such.a proofas can never be withstood: of which I
shall have occasion to give some very remarkable instances in the remain-
der of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader or this will not think it strange if I confess that
these anxieties. these constant dangers] lived in, and the concern that
was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances
that I had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences. I had
the core of my safety more now upon my hands than that ofniy food. I
cared not to drive a nail. or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise
I might make should be heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the
same reason: and,above all,l was intolerably uneasy at making any lire,
lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should.
betray me. For this reason I removed that part of my business which
required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, etc., into my new apart-
ment- in the woods; where. alterl had been some time,I found, to my
unspeakable consolation.a mere natural cave in the earth. which went in
a vast way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth
of it, would be so hardy as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man
else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where by
mere accident (I would say, if! did not see abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to providence) l was cutting down some thick branches
of trees to make charcoal; and, before I.go on, I must observe the reason
of my making this charcoal, which was thus: I was afraid of making a
smoke about my habitation." I said before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my bread, cooking my meat. etc.; so I contrived to
burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it
became chark, or dry coal: and then putting the fire out, I preserved the
coal to carry home, and perform the other services for which fire was
wanting, without danger of smoke. But this is by-the-byr--While I was
cutting down some wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick
branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow
place: Iwas curious to look in it, and getting with difliculty into the
mouth of it, I found it was pretty large: that is to say, sufficient for me
to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me: but I must confess
to you that I made more haste out than I did in, when, looking farther
into the place, and which was perfectly dark,l saw two broad shining
eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled
like two stars; the dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in,
and making the reflection. However, alter some pause, l recovered
myself, and began to call myself a thousand fools, and to think, that he
that was afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an
island all alone; and thatl might well think there was nothing in this
cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon this, plucking up my
courage. I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed again. with the stick
flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as
much frightened as I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like that
of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, asof words
half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was
indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat; and
if I had had a hat on my head,l will not answer for it, that my hair
might not have lined it 011'. But still plucking up my spirits as well as I
could, and encouraging myself a little with considering that the power
and presence of God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, upon
this I stepped forward again, and by thelight of the firebrand, holding it
up a little over my head, l saw lying on the ground a most monstrous,
frightful. old he-'goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping for
life; and dying, indeed', of mere old age. '1 stirred him a little to see if I
could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and I thought with myself he might even lie there; for if he
had frightened me, so he would certainly frighten any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any life
in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise. and began to look around me,
when I found the cave was but very small, that is to say, it might be
about twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor
square, no hands having ever been employed in making it but those of
mere nature. Iobserved also that there was place at the farther side
of it that went in further, but was so low that it required me to creep
upon my hands and knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not:
so having no candle,l gave it over for that time; but resolved to come
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had
made of the lock of one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day [came provided with six large candles of
my own making (for I made very good candles new of goat's tallow, but
was hard set for candlewiclr, using sometimes rags or ropeyarn, and
sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles); and going into this low
place, I was obliged to creep upon all-fours," I have said, almost ten
yards; which, by the way,l thought was a venture bold enough, con-
sidering that I knew not how far it might go. nor what was beyond it.
When I had got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up,I
believe near twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the
island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the side and roof of this vault -
or cave: the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me ll'om my
two candles. What it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other
precious stones, or gold, which I rather supposed it to be, I lmew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its kind, as
could be expected, though perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level,
and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nausa<<
one or venomous creature to be seen, neither was there any damp or wet
on the sides or roof: the only difficulty in it was the entrance, which,
however, as it was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I
thought that was a convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the dis-
covery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things
which I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, I resolved to
bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms, viz: two
fowling-pieces, for I had three in all. and three muskets, for of them I '
had eight in all: so I kept at my castle only five, which stood ready
mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence; and were ready
also to take out upon any expedition. Upon this occasion of removing
my ammunition,l happened to open the barrel of powder which I took
up out of the sea, and which had been wet: andl found that the water
had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every side,
caking and growing hard, had preserved the i'nside like a kernel in the
shell; so thatI had near sixty pounds of very good powder in the center
of the cask: this was a very agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I
carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three pounds of
powder with me in my castle. for fear ofa surprise of any kind: I also
carried thither all the lead I had lett for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants. which were said
to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them;
for l persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages
were to hunt me, they could never find me out; or, if they did, they
would not venture to attack me here. The old goat, whom I found expir-
ing, died in the mouth of the cave the nextday aflerl made this discovery:
and I found it much easier to digs great hole there, and throw him in
and cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him
there to prevent ofi'ense to my nose.

I was now in the thirty-third year of my residence in this island; and
wusso naturalized to the place, and the manner of living, that could I
have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place
to disturb me,I could have been content to have capitulated for spending
the rest of my time there. even to the last moment, till I had laid me
down and died, like the old goat in the cave. I had _also arrived to some
little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal
more pleasantly with me than it did before: as first, I had taught my
Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked
so articulately and plain, that it. was very pleasant to rne: for I believe no
bird ever spoke plainer; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty
years: how long he might have lived afterward I know not, though I know
they have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog
was a very pleasant and lovely companion to me for no less than sixteen
years of my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they
multiplied, as I have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot
several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had;
but, at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were gone, and
after some time continually driving them from me, and letting them have
no provision with mo, they all ran wild into the woods. except two or
three favorites, which I kept tame, and whose young, when they had
any, I always drowned: and these were part of my family. Beside
these, I always kept two or three household kids about me, whom I
taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more parrots, which
talked pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe, but none like my
first; nor, indeed, did I talre the pains with any of them that I had done
with him. I had also several tame seafowls, whose names I knew not,
that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings: and the little stakes
which I had planted before my castle wall being now grown up to a good
thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there,
which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I began to be
very well contented with the life I led. if I could have been secured from
the dread of the savages. But it was otherwise directed; and it may not
be amiss for all people who shall meet with my story, to malls this just
observation from it, viz: How frequently, in the course of our lives, the
evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen
into, is the most dreadful to us, is ottentilnes the very means or door of
our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised again from the amiction
we are fallen into. I could give many examples of this in the coume of
my unaccountable life; but in nothing was it more particularly remark-
able than in the circumstances of my last years of solitary residence in
this island. '

ANGIE" VISIT 0" m SAVAGE--ROBINSON 8m rams DANOlldr--an
Tfll waxes 0' A YES".

11' was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-
third year: and this. being the southern solstice (for winter I can not call
it), was the-particular time of my harvest, and required my being pretty
much abroad in the fields: when going out pretty early in the morning,
even before it was thorough daylighbl was surprised with seeing a light
of some fire upon the shore. at a distance from me of about two miles,
toward the end of the island where I had observed some savages had been,
as before; and not on the other side, but, to my great sflliction, it was on
my side or the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within
my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet! had
no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these
savages. in rambling over the island, should tlnd my corn standing or cut,
or any of my works and improvements, they would immediately con-
clude that there were people in the place, and would then never give

13
over till they had found me out. In this extremity, I went back directly
to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all things without
look as wild and natural as I <<would.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defense:
I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to say, my muskets,
which were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and
resolved to defend myself to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to
commend myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians. I continued in this pos-
ture about two hours: and began to be mighty impatient for intelligence
abroad, for I had no spies to send out. Aftersitting a while longer, and
musing what I should do in this, I was not able to bear sitting in ignor-
anee any longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where
there was a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder
up alter me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and
pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose,l laid
the down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.
I presently found there were no less than nine naked savages, sitting
round a small fire they had made, not to warm them, for they had
no need of that, the weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed,
to dress some of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which they had
brought with them, whether alive or dead I could not tell.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the
shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the
return of the flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine what can-
tusion this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my side of
the island, and so near me too; but when I considered their coming must
be always with the current of the ebb, I began, afterward. to be more
sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all
the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore before; and hav-
ing made this observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with
the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the west-
ward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle as we call it) away.
I should have observed, that for an hour or more before they went ofl',
they went a-daneing; and I could easily discern their postures and ges-
tures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my nicest observation. but
that they v~ere stark naked and had not the least covering upon them;
but whether they were men or women, I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone,l took two guns upon my
shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle. and my great sword by my side,
without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make, went away
to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance ofall; and as soon
as I got thither, which was not less than two hours,l perceived there had
been three canoes more ofaavages at that place; and looking out farther,
I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main. This was
a dreadful sight to me, especially as, goinedown to the shore, I could see
the marks of horror, which the dismal work they had been about had left
behind it, viz : the blood. the bones, and part of the flesh, of human
bodies, eaten, and devoured by those wretches with merrimentand sport.
I wasso filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began to pre-
meditats the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them he whom
or how many socver. It seemed evident to me that the visits which they
made thus to this island were not very frequent, for it was above litteen
months before any more of them came on shore there again; that is to
say. I neither saw them, nor any footsteps or signals of them, in all that
time; for. as to the rainy seasons. then they are sure not to come abroad,
at least not so far: yet'all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of
the constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by surprise: from
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the
suflering, especially if there is no room to shake ofl' that expectation, or
those apprehensions.

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and took up most
of my hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very next time I should see
them; especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time,
into two parties: nor did I consider at all. that if I lrilled one party,
suppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even at infinflum, till I should be at length no
less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters, and perhaps much
more so. I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind,
expecting that I should, one day or other, fall into the hands of these
merciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not
without looking round me with the greatest care and caution imaginable.
And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it was that I provided
for a tame dock or herd of goats; for I durst not, upon any account, tire
my gun, especially near that side of the island where they usually came,
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had lied hem me now, I was
sure to have them come again, with perhaps two or three hundred canoes
with them, in a few days, and then I knew what to expect. However, I
wore out a year and three months more before lever saw any more of
the savages, ind then I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is
true, they might have been there once or twice, but either they-halls no
stay, or at least I did not see them: but in the month of May,.as near as '
I could calculate. and in my four-and-twentieth year,I had every strange
encounter with them; of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fliteen or sixteen months'
interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always frightful
dreams. and often started out of my sleep in the night: in the day, great
troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night,l dreamed otten of
killing the savages, and of th'rcasons why I might justify the doing or
it. But, to waive all this for a while. It was in the middle of May. on
the sixteenth day.I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would
reckon, for l marked all upon the post still; I say. it was on the sixteenth
of May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after it. I
knew not what was the particular occasion of it, but as I was reading in
the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present can-
dition,I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, tired at sea.
This was. to be sure,a surprise quite ofa ditferent nature from any I had
met with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite
of another kind. I started up in' the greatest haste imaginable, and, in a
trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it
after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill the
very moment that a flash of tire bid me listen forasccond gun, which
accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard; and, by the sound, knew
that it was from that part of the see. where I was driven down the
current in my~boat. I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in
the company, and tired these guns for signals of distress, and to obtain
help. I had the presence of mind, at that minute, to think, that though I
could not help them, it might be they might help me: so I brought
together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good.
handsome pile.I set it on the upon the hill. The wood was dry, and
blazed freely; and though the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt firly
out; so that I was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they
must needs see it; and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire
blazed up I heard another gun, and after that several others, all from the
same quarter. I plied my fire all night long, till daybreak; and when it
was broad day. and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great
distance at see, full east of the island, whether a nil or a hall I could not
distinguish, no, not with my glass; the distance was so great, and the
weather still something hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did not
move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being
eager. you may be sure, to be satisfied. I took my gun in 'my hand, and
ran toward the south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly
been carried away with the current; and getting up there, the weather
by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow,
the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks
which I found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks," they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter stream,
oreddy, were the occasion of my recovering hour the most desperate,
hopeless condition that ever! had been in, all my life. Thus, what is
one man's safety is another man's destruction: for it seems these men,
whoever they were, being out of their knowledge. and the rocks being
wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the night, the wind
blowing hard at E. N. E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily
suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavored to have
saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat; but their tiring o'l'
guns for help.eepecially when they saw, as I imagined, my tire, filled me
with many thoughts: First,I imagined that upon seeing my light, they
might have put themselves into their boat, and endeavon to make the
shore; but that the sea going veryhigh, they might have been cast away:
other times I imagined that they might have lost their boat before, as
might be the case many ways; as, particularly, by the breaking of the
sea upon their ship, which many times obliges men to stave, or take in
pieces. their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard with their own
hands: other times I imagined they had some other ship or ships in
company, who, upon the signals of distress they had made,had taken
them up and carried them uti': other times I mneied they were all gone
oil" to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the current that I had
been formerly in, were carried out into the great swan, where there was
nothing but misery and perishing; and that perhaps, they. might by this
time be starving, and in a condition to think of eating one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in,
I could do no more than look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them; which had still this good efleet on my side, that it gave me more and
more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably
provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two ships'gp-e
panics who were new cast away upon this part of the world, not one" lib
should be spared but mine. I learned here again to observe, that ltis
very rare that the providence of God casts us into any condition of litb
so low, or any misery so great, but we may see something or other tube
thankflIl for, and may see others in worse circumstances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much
asses roomto suppose any of them were saved; nothing could make it
rational so much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there,
except the possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in
company; and this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the
least sign or appearance of any such thing. I can not explain, by any
possible energy or words. what a strange longing or hankering ordesires
I fell in my soul upon this sight, breaking out sometimes thus: Oh that
there had been.but one or two, nay, or butone soul, saved out of this ship,
to have escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion, one
(ellowccresture, to have spoken to me, and to have convened with! In
all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire

alter the society of my fellow creatures, or so deep a regret at the want
of it.

0' QUITTIKG I'll ISLAND--HAS A manxasus DBEAI.

Tasks are some secret moving springs in the atl'ections, which, when
they are set a-going by some object in view, or. though not in view, yet
rendered present to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion
carries out the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embrac-
ings of the object, that the absence of it is insupportable. Such were
these earnest wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe I
repeated the words, Oh that it had been but one! a thousand times; and
my desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands
would clinch together. and my fingers would press the palms of my
hands,so that i" had had any set! thing in my hand, it would have
crushed it involuntarily: and the teeth in my head would strike together,
and set against one another so strong, that for some time I could not part
them again. Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and
manner of them: all 1 can say to them is, to describe the fact, which was
even surprising to me. when 1 found it. though I knew not from whence
it proceeded: it was doubtless the etl'ect of ardent wishes, and of strong
ideas formed in my mind. realizing the comfort which the conversation
of one of my fellow Christians would have been to me. But it was not
to be; either their fate or mine, or both, forbade it: for, till the last year
of my being on this island. l never knew whether any were saved out of
that ship or no; and had only the sflliction, some days after. tosee the
corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which
was next the shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman's waist-
coat, a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of: he had
nothing in his pockets but two pieces 01' eight and a tobaccocpipe;--the
last was to me of ten times more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to
this wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might
be useml to me: but that did not altogether press me so much as the
possibility that there might be yet some living creature on board,
whose life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort
my own to the last degree; and this thought so clung to my heart, that I
could not be quiet night or day, but! must venture out in my boat on
board this wreck; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be resisted,
that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I should be
wanting to myself if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression. I hastened back to my castle, pre-
pared every thing for my voyage, tool: a quantity of bread, a great pot of
flesh water. a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great
deal of that left). and a basket of raisins: and thus, loading myself with
every thing necessary, I went down to my boat. got the water out of her.
put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for
more. My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the umbrella to set up
over my head for a shade, another large pot of fresh water. and about two
dozen of my small loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before, with a
bottle of goat's milk and a cheese ; all which, with great labor and sweet,
I carried to my boat; and praying to God to directlmy voyage, I put out;
and rowing, or paddling, the canoe along the shore. came at last to the
utmost point of the island on the north-east side. And now I was to
launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I
looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the
island at a distance, and which were very terrible to me, from' the re-
membrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to
an me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I
should he carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach
or light of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if
any little gale of wind should rise. I should he inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my
enterprise: and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore. I
stepped out, and sat me down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive
and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was
musing, I could perceive that the tidewas turned, and the flood came on;
upon which my going was impracticable for so many hours. Upon this,
presently it occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece of
ground I could find. and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide, or
currents lay, when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, it I
was driven one way out,l might not expect to be driven another way
home, with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought was no
sooner in my head than I cast my eye upon a little hill, which suflicienly
overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my
return. Here I found, that as the current of the ebb set out close by the
south point of the island,so the current of the flood set in close by the
shore of the north side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the
north side of the island in my return, and I should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next moral!!!>> to set
out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my
canoe, under the great watcheoat l mentioned,I launched out. I first
made a little out to see, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the
current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and
yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done before,
so as to take from me all government of the boat; but having a strong
steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and
in less than two hoursl came up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at:
the ship, which. by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her were beaten to pieces
with the sea; and as her forecastle,which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her mainmast and foremost were brought by the board,
that is to say, broken short ofi'; but her bowsprit was sound. and the head
and bow appeared firm. When I came close to her,a dog appeared upon
her, who, seeing me coming. yelped and cried; and as soon as I called
him,jumped into the sea to come to me; I took him into the host, but
found him almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake ofmy
bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a
fortnight in the snow: I then gave the poor creature some fresh water,
with which, if 1 would have let him, he would have burst himself. After
this, I went on board; but the first sight I met with was two men
drowned in the cook-room. or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast
about one another. Iconcluded.as is indeed probable, that when the
ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high. and so continually
over her, that the men were not able to bear it. and were strangled with the
constant rushing in of the water. as much as if they had been under water.
Beside the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life; nor any
goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the water. There were
some easks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay
lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out,l could see: but
they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believed
belonged to some of the seamen; and Igot two of them into the boat,
without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been
fixed. and the forepart broken ofi', I am persuaded I might have made a
good voyage; lbr. by what I found in these two chests.I had room to
suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board: and, ifl may guess
fiom the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos
Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata. in the south part of America, beyond the
limits, to the Havanna, in the Gulf of Mexico. and so perhaps to Spain.
She had, no doubt. a great treasure in her. but of no use, at that time, to
anybody; and what became of her crew, I then knew not.

I found, beside these chests. a little eask full of liquor, or about twenty
gallons, which I got into my boat with much difi'iculty. There were
several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-hom, with about four
pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets. i had no occasion lbr them,
so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which I wanwd extremely; as also two little brass kettles. a copper pot
to make chocolate, and a gridiron: and with this cargo, and the dog,l
came away, the tide beginning to make home again; and the same even-
ing, about an hour within night,I reached the island again, weary and
fatigued to the last degree. I reposed that night in the boat; and in the
morning I resolved to harbor what I had got in my new cave. and not
carry it home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo
on shore, and began to examine the particulars. The cask of liquorI
found to be a kind ofrurn, but not such as we had at the Brazils, and, in
a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the cheets,I found
several things of great use to me; for example, I found in one a fine case
of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine
and very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped
with silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or swealmeats, so
fastened also on the top, that the salt water had not hurt them; and two
more of the same, which the water had spoiled. I found some very good
shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a dozen and a half
of white linen handkerchiefs and colored neckcloths; ,the former were
also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my face in a hot
day. Beside this, when I came to the till in the chest,I found there three
great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in
all: and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold,
and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh
near a pound. In the other chest were some clothes, but of little value;
but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate;
though there was no powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed
powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowling-
pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage that
was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner of occasion
for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given it
all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were
things I greatly wanted, but had none on my feet for many years. I had
indeed got two pair of shoes now, which I took of the feet of the two
drowned men whom I saw in the wreck. and I found two pair more in
one of the chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were not
like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we
call pumps than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces
of eight in rials, but no gold; [suppose this belonged toa poorer man
than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer. Well, however,
I logged this money home to my cave, and laid it up. as I had done that
before which I brought from our own ship: but it was a great pity, as I
said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my share; for I am
satisfled I might have loaded my canoe several times over with money;
and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, it might lie here safe enough
till I may come again and fetch it.

Having now brought all my things on shore. and secured them, I went
back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old
harbor. where I laid her up. and made the best of my way to my old
habitation.where I found every thing safe and quiet. I began now to
repose myself, live alter my old fishion, and take care of my family
strain; and, for awhile. I lived easy enough, only that I was more
vigilant than I used to be, looked out ottener and did not go abroad so
much; and if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to
the east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages
never came, and where I could go without so many precautions, and such
a load of arms and ammunition as I always carried with me if I went
the other way. I lived in this condition near two years more; but my
unlucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to make my
body miserable, was all these two years filled with projects and designs,
how. it'it were possible, I might get away from this island: forsometimes
I was for making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me
that there was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; some-
times for a ramble one way. sometimes another; and I believe verily. it' I
had had the boat thatI went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to
sea, bound anywhere,1 knew not whither. I have been. in all my circum-
stances, s memento to those who are touched with the general plague of
mankind. whence. for aught I know, one half of their miseries flow;
I mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and
nature hath placed them: for, not to look back upon my primitive con-
dition,and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to which
was, as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistake of the
same kind had been the means of my coming- into this miserable con-
dition; for bad that Providence. which so happily seated me at the Brazil-
as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, and I could have been con-
tented to have gone on gradually,l might have been. by this time. I mean
in the time of my being in this island, one of the most considerable plant-
ers in the Brazils; nay, I am persuaded, that by the improvements I had
made in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably
have made if I had remained, I might have been worth a hundred thou-
sand moidmcs: and what business had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-
stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to turn supercargo to
Guinea to fetch Negroes, when patience and time would have soincreased
our stock at home, that we could have bought them at our own door
from those whose business it was to fetch them: and though it had cost
us something more,.yet the difl'erence of that price was by no means
worth saving at so great a hazard! But as this is usually the fate or
0
young heads, so reflection upon the folly of it is as commonly the exer-
cise of more years, or of the dear-bought experience of time: so it was
with me now; and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not satisfy myself in my station. but was continually poring
upon the means and possibility of my escape from this place: and that I
may, with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part
of my story, it may not be improper to give some account of my first
conceptions on the subject of this foolish scheme for my escape, and how,
and upon what ibundation, I acwd.

I am now to be soppowd retired into my castle, alter my late voyage to
the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before; I had more wealth, indeed,
than I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for
it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four-and-
twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude,I was
lying in my bed, or hammock, awake: very well in health, had no pain,
no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of mind, more
than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is,so as to
sleep; no not a wink all night long. otherwise than as follows :-It is im-
poMble to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled
through that great thoroughfare of the brain. the memory. in this night's
time : I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridg-
ment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of that part
of my life since I came to this island. In my reflections upon the state
of my case since I came on shore on this island,l was comparing the
happy posture of my sfi'airs in the first years of my habitation here,
compared to the life of anxiety, rear, and care, which I had lived in ever
since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand: not that I did not believe
the savages had frequented the island even all the while. and might have
been several hundreds cl them at times on shore there; but I had never
known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about it; my satis-
fiastion was perfect, though my danger was the same, and I wasas happy
in not knowing my danger as if I had never really been exposed to it.
This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable reflections. and
particularly this one: How infinitely good that Providence is, which has
provided in its government of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight
and knowledge of things; and though he walks in the midst of so many
thousand dangers, the sight of which, ifdiscovered to him, would distract
his mind and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the
events of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him. '

Alter these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to
reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in
this island.and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and
with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of
a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been between
me and the worst kind of destruction. viz: that of falling into the hands
of esnnibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same
view as I would on a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a
crime to kill and devour me, than I did a pigeon or curlew. I would
unjustly slander myself, if I should say I was not sincerely thankful to
my great Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with
great humility, all these unknown deliverances were due, and without
which I must inevitably have fallen into their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up
in considering the nature of these wretched creatures, I mean the savages.
and how it came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of all
things should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to
something so much below even brutality itself, as to devourits own kind;
but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred
to me to inquire what part of the world these wretchee lived in! how far
06' the coast was from whence they came! what they ventured over so
far from home for! what kind of boats they had! and why I might not
order myself and my business so, that I might be able to go over thither
as they were to come to me. '

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with
myself when I went thither; what 'would become of me, if I fell into the
hands of the savages; or how I should escape from thorn, if they attacked
me; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the coast,
and not be attacked by some or other of them, without any.possibility of
delivering myself ; and if I should not fall into their hands, what I should
do for provision. or whither I should bend my course: none of these
thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way: but my mind was wholly
bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the main land. I
looked upon my present condition as the most miserable that could
possibly be; that I was not able to'throw myself into any thing, but
death, that could be called worse; and if I reached the shore of the main,
I might perhaps meet with relief, or I might coast along. as I did on the
African shore, till I came to some inhabited country. and where I might
find some' relief ; and after all, perhaps, I might fall in with some Chris
tian ship that might take me in; and if the worst came to the worst, I
could but due, which would put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray
note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind. an impatient temper,
made desperate, as it were, by the long continuance of my troubles, and
the disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been on board of, and
where I had been 'so near obtaining what I so earnestly longed for, viz:
somebody to speak to, and to learn some knowledge from them of the
place where I was, and of the probable means of my deliverance. I was
agitated wholly by these thoughts; all my calm of mind, in my resig-
nation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven,
seemed to be suspended; and Ihad, as it were, no power to turn my '
thoughts to any thing but to the project of a voyage to the main; which
came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that
it was not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such
violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as
if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervor of my mind
about it. nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very
thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought I
should have dreamed of it. but I did not, nor of any thing relating to it:
but I dreamed that as I was going out in the morning, as usual. ll'orn my
castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages coming to
land, and that they brought with them another savage, whom they were
going to kill, in order to eat him; when. on a sudden, the savage that
they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life; and I thought,
in my sleep, that he came running into my little thick grove before my
fortification, to hide himself; and that I, seeing him alone, and not per-
ceiving that the others sought him that way, showed myself to him, and
smiling upon him, encouraged him: that he lmeeled down to me,
seeming to pray me to assist him: upon which I showed him my ladder,
made him go up, and carried" him into my cave, and he became my
servant: and that as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, Now I
may certainly venture to the main land; for this follow will serve me as
a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and
whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what places to venture
into, and what to shun. I waked with this thought: and was under such
inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my
dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon coming to myself,
and finding that it was no more than a dream, were equally extravagant
the other way, and threw me into a very great dejeetion of spirits.

Upon this, however,l made this conclusion; that my only way to go
about to attempt an es'cape was, if possible, to get a savage into my pos-
session; and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners whom they
had condemned to be eaten, and should bring.hither to kill. But these
thoughts still were attended with this difliculty, that it was impossible to
etl'ect this without attacking a whole caravan of them,and killing them
all; and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might misearry,
but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to
myself: and my heart trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much
blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need not repeat the argu-
ment! which occurred to me against this, they being the same mentioned
before: but though I had other reasons to oll'er now viz: that those men
were enemies to my life, and would devour me if they could; that it was
self-preservation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself Item this death
of a life, and was acting in my own defense as much as if they were
actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though these things argued
for it,,yet the thoughts of shedding human blood for my deliverance
were very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means reconcile
myself to for a great while. However, at last. sller many secret disputes
with myself, and altera great many perplexities about it (for all these
arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head along time), the
eager prevailing desire ofdeliveranee at length mastered all the rest; and
I resolved. if possible. to get one of those savages into my hands, cost what
it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed
was very difl'icult to resolve on: but as I could pitch upon no probable
means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them
when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event; taking such
measures as the opportunity should present, let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as
often as possible, and indeed so often, that I was heartily tired of it: lbr
it was above a year and a half that I waited: and for a great part of that
time went out to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the
island.slmost every day to look for canoes, but none appeared. This
was very discouraging, and began to trouble the much; though I can not
say that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) wear off the
edge of my desire.to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,
the more eager I was for it: in sword, I was not at first so careful to
shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as l was
now eager to be upon them. I pleased myself with this all'aira great
while: but all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages'
came near me for a great while.

 

SECTION XXII.

ROBINSON MUE ON! OF THEIR OAPHVE no: 11!: SAVAGE, WHO! n
NAME FRIDAY, AND HARE BIS SERVANT.

Anon-r a year and a half after I entertained these notions (and by long
musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, for want of an
occasion to put them into execution). I was surprised one morning early
with seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my side of
the island, and the people who belonged to them all landed, and out of
my sight. The number of them broke all my measures; for seeing so
many, and knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more,
in a boat, I could not tell what to think ofit, or how to take my measures,
to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so lay still in my castle,
perplexed and discomforted: however, I put myself into all the same
postures for an attack that I had formerly provided. and was just ready
{or action, it any thing had presented. Having waited a good while,
listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being very impatient,
I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of
the hill, by my two stages, as usual; standing so, however, that my head
did not appear .above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any
means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective glass, that they
were no less than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and that
they had meat dressed. How they had cooked it I knew not, or what it
was; but they were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous
gestures and figures. their own way, round the fire.

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two
miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were
laid by, and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of
them immediately fall, being knocked down, I suppose, with a club or
wooden sword, for that was their way, and two or three others were at
work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while the other
victim was let! standilx by himself, till they should be ready for him. In
that very moment, this poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, and
unbound, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away
from them, and ran with incredible awittneas along the sands directly
toward me, I mean toward that part of the coast where my habitation
was. I was dreadthlly frightened,I must acknowledge, when I perceived
him run my way, and especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued
by the whole body: and now I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove:
but I could not depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it,
viz : that the other savages would not pursue him thither, and find him
there. However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover,
when I found that there was not above three men that followed him; and
still more was I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them
exceedingly in running, and gained ground of them; so that i! he could
but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would hirly get away from
them all. I

There was between them and my castle the creek, which I mentioned
otten in the first part of my story. where I landed my cargoes out of the
ship; and this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor
wretch would be taken there: but when the sat-age mpingcame thither,
he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up; but plunging in,
swam through in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on
with exceeding strength and swifiness. When the three persons came to
the creek. I found that two of them could swim, but the third could not,
and that, standing on the other side, he looked at the others, but went no
farther, and soon after went softly back again; which, as it happened, was
very well for him in the end. 1 obsenved that the two who swam were
yet more than twrce as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was
that fied tl'om them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and
indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, and per-
haps a companion or assistant, and that I was called plainly by Provi-
dence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the
ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were
both at the foot of the ladders, as 1 observed above, and getting up again,
with the same haste, to the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, and
having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in the way
between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing alould to him that fied,
who looking back, was at first, perhaps, as much frightened at me as at
them: but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and in the
meantime, I slowly advanced toward the two that followed: then rushing
at once upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of my
piece. I was loth to fire, because I would not have the rest hear; though.
at that distance, it would not have been easily heard. and being out of
sight of the smoke too, they would not have easily known what to make
of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued him
stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced a pace toward him :
but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a how and arrow, and
was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him'
first, which I did. and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who
fled but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen'nd killed,
as he thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece,
' that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward nor went backward,
though he seemed rather inclined still to fly, than to come on. I hallooed
again to him, and made'signs to come forward. which he easily under-
stood, and came a little way; then stopped again.and then a little far-
ther, and stopped again; and I could then perceive that he stood tremb-
ling,as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as
his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come to me, and gave
him all the sins of encouragement thatI could think of: and he came
nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him, and looked pleaa~
antly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer: at length he came close
to me; and then he kneeled down again. kissed the ground, and laid his
head upon the grou'nd. taking me by the foot. set my foot upon his head;
this,it seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave forever. Itook
him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But
there was more work to do yet. I perceived the savage whom I knocked
down was not killed. but stunned with the blow, and began to come to
himself: so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he was
not dead; upon this he spoke some words to me, and though I could not
understand them. yet I thought they were pleasant to hear; for they
were the first sound ofa man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted,
for above twenty-five years. But there was no time for such reflections
now; the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so or as to
sit upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be "laid;
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as in would
shoot him : upon this my savage. for so I celled him now, made a motion-
to me to lend him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side.
which I did. He no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one
blow, cut 06' his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have
done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one who. I had
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except their own
wooden swords: however, it seems, as I learned anerward, they make
their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy. and the wood is so herd, that
they will cut oi! heads even with them, ay and arms, and that at one blow
too. When he had done this, he came laughing to me, in sign of triumph.
end bnught me the sword again, and with abundance of gestures, which
I did not understand, laid it down, with the head of the savage that he
had killed, just before nae. But that which astonished him most. was to
know how I killed the other Indian so far elf: so pointing to him;he
made signs to me to let him go to him; so I bade him go,as wellasI
could. When he came to him. he stood like one amend, looking at him,
turning him first one side, then on the other, looked at the wound the
bullet had made. which, it seems, was just in his breast, where it had
made a hole, and no great quantity of blood had followed; but he had
bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows,
and came back: so I turned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow
me, making signs to him that more might come afler them. Upon this,
he made signs to me that he should bury them with sand, that they might
not be seen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs to him
again to do so. He fell to work; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole
in the sand with his hands, big enough to bury the tint in, and then
dragged him into it, and then covered him ; and did so by the other also;
I believe he tad buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling
him away. I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave,
on the farther part of the island: so I did not let my dream come to pass
in that part, viz: that he came into my grove {or shelter. Here I gave
him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I
found he was indeed in great distress for, by his running; and having
refreshed him, I made signs for him to go'and lie down to sleep, showing

14
him a place where I had laid some rice straw and a blanket upon it
which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the poor creature lay
down, and went to sleep.

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight
strong limbs, not too large, tall and well shaped; and, as I reckon, about
twenty-six years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a fierce
and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly in his face;
and yet he had all the sweetness and soltness of a European in his
countenance too, especially when he smiled. His hair'ss long and
black, not curled like wool; his forehead very high and large; and a
great vivscity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The color of his skin
was not quite black, but very tawny; and yet not an ugly, yellow, nause-
ous tawny,as the Brazilians and Virginisns,and other natives of America
are, but of a bright kind of s dun olive color, that had in it something
very Whle, though not very easy to describe. His face was round
and plum p; his nose small, not fist like the Negroes: a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory.

After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he
awoke again, and came out of the cave to ms, for I had been milking my
goats, which I had in the inclosure just by: when be copied me, he came
running to me, laying himself down again upon the ground, withfil the
possible signs of an humble, thankful disposition, making a great many
antic gestures to show it. At last, he lays his heed flat upon the ground,
close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his head, as he had done
before; and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude,
and submission, imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me so
longas he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him know
I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to speak
to him,and teach him to speak to me; and first,l let him know his name
should be Paton, which was the day I saved his life: I called him so for
the memory of the time. I likewise taught him to ssy,Msster; uni then
let him know that was to be my name: I likewise taught him to say Yes
and No, and to know the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him,and sop my bread in
it; and gave him a cake of breadto do the like, which he quickly complied
with, and made signs that it was very good for him. I kept there with
him all that night; butsssoonssitwss day,I beckoned him to come
with me, and let him know I would give him somp clothes; at which he
seemed very glad. for he was stark naked. As we went by the place
where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and
showed me the marks that he had made to find them again, making signs
to me that we should dig them up again. and eat , them. At this i
appeared very angry. expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to' hiin to come
away; which he did immediately, with great submission. I then led him
up to the top of the hill,to see if his enemies were gone; and pulling out
my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been. but
no appearance of them or their canoes: so that it was plain they were
gone, and had 'lett their two comrades behind them, without any search
alter them.

But I was not content with this discovery: but having now more
courage and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with
me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrowset his
back. which I found he could use very dextrouely, making him carry one
gun for me, and I two for myself; and away we marched to the place
where these creatures had been; lbr I had a mind now to get some fuller
intelligence of them. When l came to the place, my very blood ran chill
in my veins, and my heart sank within me, at the horror of the spectacle;
indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday
made nothing of it. The place was covered with human bones, the
ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces of flesh left here and
there, half-eaten, mangled, sud scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of
the triumphant feast they had been making there, alters victory over
their enemies. lsaw three skulls, five hends, end the bones of three or
four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and
Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they brought over bur
prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he,
pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had been a great battle
between them and their next king, whose subjects, it seems, he had been
one of, and that they had taken a greet number of prisoners; all of which
were carried to several places by those who had taken them in the light,
in order to fast upon them,as was done here by thus wretches upon
those they brought hither.

I caused Friday to gathers]! the skulls, bones, flesh,end whatever
remained, and lay them togetherin s heap, and makes great are upon
it, and burn them all to ashes. I find Friday had still a hankering
stomach after some of the flesh, and was still acaunibal in his nature;
but I discovered so much shhorreuee at the"very thoughts of it, and at _
the least appearance of it. that he-durst not discover it; for I had, by
some means, let him know that I would kill him if he offered it.

When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to
work for my man Friday: and, first of all,l gave him a peirofliueu
drawers, which I had, out of the poor gunner's chest I mentioned, which
I found in the wreck; and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very
well: and then 1 made him a jerkin of goat's skin.es well as my skill
would allow (for l was now grown a tolerably good tailor); and I gave
him a cap, which I made of here's skin, very convenient and fashionable
enough : and thus he was clothed (hr the present, tolerahly well, and was
mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master.
his true, he went awkwardly in these clothes at first; wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him. and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled
his shoulders, and the inside of his arms; but after a little easing them
where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them. he took
to them at length very well.

The next day after I came home to my hutch with him,l began to con-
sider where I should lodgehim; and that I might do well for him.and
yet be perfectly easy myself,l made alittle tent for him in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last and in the
outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there into my cave,
I made a formal framed decrease, and a door to it. of boards, and set it up
in the passage, a little within the entrance; and causing the door to open
in the inside,I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so
that Friday could no way come to me in the inside of my innermost
wall without makingso much noise in getting over that it must needs
waken me; for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the side of the hill; which
was again laid across with smaller sticks, instead of lathe, and then
thatched overs great thickness with the rice straw, which was strong,
like reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the
ladder, I had placed a kind of trap door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have fallen down,
and made a great noise: as to weapons, I took them all into my side
every night. But I needed none of all this precaution: for never man
had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me;
without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged;
his very afl'ections were tied to me, like those of a child to a Ather; and
I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon any
occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out
of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precautions, as
to my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder,
that howeverithad pleased God, in his providence, and in the govern-
ment of the works of his hands, to take from so great a part of the world
of his creatures the best uses to which their faculties and the power of
their souls are adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon them the same
powers, the same reason, the same afl'ections, the same sentiments of
kindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,
the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of
doing good, and receiving good, that he has given to us; and that when he
pleases to ofl'er them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready. nay,
more ready. to apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed,
than we are. This made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting,' 24%..

as the seven! occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these,
even though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of
instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his Word added
to our understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving
knowledge fiom so many millions ofsouls, who,ifl mightjudge by this poor
savage, would make a much better use of it than we did. From hence, I
sometimes was led too far. to invade the sovereignty of Providence, and
as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that
should hide that light lion: some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect
a like duty hum both, but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with
this conclusion: first, That we did not know by what light and law these
should be condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and, by the
nature of his being, infinitely holy and just,so it could not be,'but if
these creatures were all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on
account of sinning against that light, which, as the Scripture says. was a
law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would acknowl-
edge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us; and.
secondly, That still, as we all are the clay in the hand of the potter, no
vessel could say to him, Why hast thou formed me thus'!

 

SECTION XXIII.

nonmsox mar-sum All) emuzaa ma IAN FRIDAY.

Ann I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought
that, in order to bring Friday ofl' from his horrid way of feeding, and
Dora the relish or a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other
flesh: so I took him out with me one morning to the woods. I went,
indeed intending to kill a kid out of my own flock. and bring it home and
dress it; but asl was going, I saw a she goat lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. l catched hold of Friday z--Hold,
said I; stand still; and made signs to him not to stir: immediately I pre-
sented my piece, shot and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who
had, at a distance, indeed,seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not
know. nor could imagine, how it was done. was sensibly surprised,
trembled andshook, and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have
sunk down. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceived I had killed it,
but ripped up his waistcoat, to feel whether he was not wounded; and,
as I found presently, thought I was molved to kill him : {or he came and
kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees said a great many things
I did not understand; but I could easily see the meaning was, to pray me
not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm; and
taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid
which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did:
and while he was wondering. and looking to see how the creature was
killed, I loaded my gun again. By and hy,l saw a great fowl, like a hawk,
sitting upon a tree, within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what
I would do, I called him to me again. pointed at the fowl, which was
indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say, pointing to
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him

see I would make it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and ~

kill that bird; accordingly,I tired, and bade him look, and immediawa
he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again, notwithstand-
ing all I had said to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because
he did not see me put any thing into the gun, but thought that there
must be some wonderful thud of death and destruction in that thing,able
to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near or far 06'; and the astonish-
ment this created in him was such, as could not wear off for a long time;
and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have worshiped me
and my gun. As for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for
several days aller;'but he would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had
answered him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterward learned
of him, was to desire it not to kill him. Well, alter his astonishment
was a little over at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird] had
shot, which he did, but stayed some time; for the parrot. not being quite
dead, had fluttered away a good distance from the place where she fell:
however he found her, took her up. and brought her to me; and as I had
perceived his ignorance about the gun before,I took this advantage to
charge the gun again, and not to let him see me do it, thatI might be
ready for any other mark that might present; but nothing more ofl'ered
at that time; so I brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the
skin oll'. and cut it out as well as I could; and having a pot fit for that
purpose, I boiled or stewed _some of the flesh, and made some very good
broth. After I had begun to eat some. I gave some to my man, who
seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well: but that which was
strangest to him, was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that
the salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own month, he
seemed to nauseate it. and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth
with fresh \Vuu'r alter it: on the other hand. I took some meat into my
mouth without salt. and l pretended to spit and sputter for want ofsalt,
as fast as he did at the salt; but it would not do: he would never ears for
salt with his meat or in his broth; at least, not for a great while, and then
but a very little. _

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I wasresolved to feast
him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid: this I did, by hanging

1')
it before the tire on a string. as I had seen many people do in England,
setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across on the
top, and tying the string to the cross stick. letting the meat turn con-
tinually. This Friday admired very much; but when he came to taste
the flesh, he tookso many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that!
could not but understand him: and at last he told me, as well as he
could, he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was very glad
to hear.

The next day, I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting
it in the same manner! used to do,asI observed before; and he soon
understood how to do it as well as I, especially alter he had wen what
the meaning of it was. and that it was to make bread of it: for after that
I let him see me make my bread. and bake it too; and in a little time
Friday was able to do all the work tbr me, as well as [could do it myselfl

I began now to consider, that having two months to feed,inetead of
one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger
quantity of corn than I used to do; no I marked out a larger piece of
land, and began the fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday
worked not only very willingly and very hard. but did it very cheerfully:
and I told him what it wasfor; that it was for corn to make more bread.
because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him and
myself too. He appeamd very sensible of that part, and let me know
that he thought I had much more labor upon me on his amount, than I
had for myself; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would
tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place; Friday
began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost every
thing I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send him to,
and talked a great deal to me; so that, in short, I began now to have some
use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little occasion for
before, that is to say, about speech. Beside the pleasure of talking to
him, I had a singular satisfiction in the fellow himself: his simple, un-
feigned honesty appeared to me more and more every day, and I began
really to love the creature; and, on his side, I believe he loved me more
than it was possible for him ever to love any thing before.

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to his own
country again; and having taught him English so well that he could
answer me almost any question, I asked him whether the nation that he
belonged to never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said,
Yes, yea, we always fight the better: that is. he meant, always get the
better in fight; and so we began the following discourse:--

Masraa. You always tight the better! how came you to be taken
prisoner then, Friday '!

FRIDAY. My nation beat much, tbr all that.

Ill-H
Manna. How beat? If your nation beat them, how come you to be
taken !

I-'amar. They more many than my nation in the place where me
was; they take oneI two, three, and me; my nation overheat them in the
yonder place, where me no was; there my nation take one, two, great
thousand. .

Manna. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of
your enemies then '!

Fawn. They run one, two, three, and mo,aud make go in the canoe;
my nation have no canoe that time.

Manna. Well. Friday, and what does your nation do with the men
they take? Do they carry them away andeat them, as these did!

FRIDAY. Yes. my nation eat mans too; eat all>> up.

Maana. Wheredo they carry them!

Fawn. Goth other place, where they think.

Mama. Do they come hither!

FRIDAY. Yes, yes, they come hither; some other else place.

Mauls. Have you been here with them"!

l-'arnar. Yes. I have been here (points ,to the N. W, side of the
island, which, it seems, was their side).

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among
the savages who used to come on shore on the Earther part of the island,
on the same man-eating occasions he was now brought for; and, some
time alter, when! toolr the courage to carry him to that side, being the
same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he
was these oncelwhen .they eat u'p twenty. men, two women. and one
child; he could, not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them, by
laying so many stone's in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.

COUNTRY--THEIR BOURKE mum BY THE ARRIVAL 0" A PARTY 0'
SAVAGE.-

Arrsn Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he
could understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently,
though'in'broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own history
or at least so much of it as related to my coming to this place; how I had
lived here, and how long: I let him into the mystery. for such it was to
himI of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him
a lmife,which he was wonderfully delighted with: and I made him a"u could uvl lu'I lwuuy, iu lilmliah but In; nun-1mm] |lll:|u by laying 5>>

bolt, with "a g hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in:
and in the Mg. instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not
only as good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useml upon other
occasions.

I described to him the country ofEurope, particularly England, which
I came from; how we lived, how we worshiped God, how we behaved
to one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I
gave him an account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and
showed him, as near as 1 could, the place where she lay; but she was all
beaten in pieces before, and gone. I showed him the ruins of our boat,
which we lost when we escaped. and which I could not stir with my
whole strength then; but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon
seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing. I
asked him what it was he studied upon! At last, says he, Me see such
boat like come to place at my nation. I did not understand him a good
while; but, at last, when I had examined farther into it, I understood by
him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore upon the country
where he lived; that is,as he explained it, was driven thither by stress
of weather. l presently imagined that some European ship must have
been'cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive
ashore; but was so dull, that I never once thought of men making their
escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might come: so I
only inquired alter a description of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better
to understand him when he added with some warmth, We eaved the
white mans from drown. Then I presently asked him, if there were any
white mans, as he called them, in the boat'.I Yes, he said; the boat ml!
of white mans. I asked- him how many? He told upon his fingers
seventeen. I asked him then what became of them! He told Inc, They
live, they dwell at my nation.

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imaginEd that
these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the
sight or my island; as I now called it; and who, alter the ship was struck
on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in
their bost,snd were landed upon that wild shore among the savages.
Upon this, I inquired of him more critically what was become of them;
he assured me they lived still there; that they had been there about fohr
years; that the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to live on.
I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill them,and eat them?
He said, No, they make brother with them; that is, as I understood him,
a truce; and then he added, They no eat mans but when make the war
fight: that is to say, they never eat any men but such ascome to light
with them, and are taken in battle. -

It was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of the

15
.- kt '
In", at the east side of the island, from whence, as I havmid. I had, in
a clear day. discovered the main or continent ot'AmerI'ca, Friday,the
weather being very serene, looks very earnestly toward the main land,
and. in a kind of surprise, falls a-jumping and dancing. and calls out to
me,forlwas at some, distance from him. I asked him what was the
matter! 0h joy! says he; on glad! there see my country. there my
nation! l observed an extraordinary sense ofpleasure. appeared in his face,
and his eyes sparkled. and his countenance discovered a. strange eagerness,
as if he had a mind to be in his own country again. This observation of
mine put a great many thoughts into me. which made me at first not so
easy about my new man. Friday, as I was before; and I made no doubt
but that it' Friday could get back to his own nation again. he would not.
only forget all his religion. but all his obligation to me, and would be for-
ward enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and come back
perhaps with a hundred or two of them,and makca feast upon meat
which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies,
when they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest creature
very much. for which I was very sorry atterward. However, as my
jealousy increased, and held me some weeks. I was a little more circum-
spect. and not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which Iwas
certainly In the wrong too; the honest, grateful creature. having no
thought about it. but what consisted with the best prinCIpIt-s, both as a
religious Christian. and as a grateful friend; as appeared afterward, to
my full satisfaction.

While my jealousy of him lasted. you may he sure [was everyday
pumping him, to see iflie would discover any ofthe new thoughts which
I suspected were in him: but I found every thing he said was so honest
and so innocent, that I cuuld find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and.
in spite of all my uneasiness, he made. me at last entirely his own again;
nor did he, in the least. perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore 1 could
not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill. but the weather being hazy at sea,
so that we could not see the continent, I called to him. and said, Friday,
do not you wish yourself in your own country. your own nationi--Yes,
he said, lite much on glad to he at my owrrnation.--What would you do
there! said I: would you turn wild again. eat men's tlesh again. and be
a savage. as you were before? He looked full of concern. and shaking
his head. said. No. no: Friday tell them to live good. tell them to pray
God. tell them to eat corn-bread. cattle-flesh, milk; no cat man again.--
Why then. said l to him. they will kill you. He looked grave at that.and
then said. No,no: they no kill me, they willing love learn. lle meant
by this. they would be willing to learn. He added. they learned much of
the bearded mans that came in the boat. Then l asked him if he would
go, back to them. lie smiled at that, and told me that he could not swim
so. far. I told him, I would make a canoe for him. He told me he would
go, ifI would go with him. I go! says I; why. they will eat me,if1
come there.----No. no, says he; me make they no eat you; me make
they much love you. He meant, he would tell them how I had killed his
enemies. and saved his life, and so he would make them love me. Then
he told me, as well as he could, how ltind they were to seventeen whitb
men, or bearded men,as he called them, who came on shore there iiti'
distress.

For this time. I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if I could
possibly Join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt were
Spaniards and Portuguese: not doubting but it' I could, we might find
some method to escape from thence, being upon the continent, and I
good company together, better than I could from an island forty miles 01?
the shore, and alone, without help. So, alter some days, I took Friday to
work again. by way of discourse; and told him I would give him a boat

to go back to his own nation; and accordingly Icarried him to my frigate,
which lay on the other side ol the island. and having cleared it of water

(for I always kept it sunk in water) I brought it out, showed it him, and
we both went into it. I found he was a most dcxtrous fellow at manag-
ing it. and would make it go almost as swin again as I could. So when
he was in. I said to him, Well, now, Friday. shall we go to your nation!
He looked very dull at my saying so; which, it seems, was because he
thought the boat too small to go so far: I then told him I had a bigger;
so the nextday I went to the place where the first boat lay which I had
made, but which I could not get into the water. He said that was big
enough: but then.asI had taken no care of it. and it had lain two or
three-and-twenty years there, the sun had so split and dried it, that it was
in a manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well. and
would carry 'much enough vittle, drink, bread:' that was his way of
talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going
over with him to the continent, thatI told him we would go and make
oneas big as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one;
word. but looked very grave and sad. I'asked him what was the mutt;t
with him! He asked me again, Why you angry mad with Friday!
What me done? I asked him what he meant: I told him I was not angry
with him at all. No angry! sayshe. repeating the words several times:
Why send Friday home away to my nation l--Why. says I. Friday, did
not you say, you wished you were there i--Yes, yes, says he, wish be both
there: no wish l-'riday there. no master there. In a word, he would not
think of going there without me. I go there, l-'riday! says I; what shall
I do there! He returned very quick upon me at this: You do great deal
much good, says he: you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame mans;

you tell them know God, pray God, and live new life--Alas! Friday,
0
says 1, thou knowest not what thou saycst; [am but an ignorant man
myseltl--Yes, yea, says he, you teachee me good, you teaches them
good--No, no, Friday, says I, you shall go without me; leave me here to
live by myself, as I did before. He looked confused again at that word;
and running to one of the hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up
hastily, and gives it to me. What must I do with this! says I to him.
You take kill Friday, says he. What must I kill you for! said I again.
He returns very quick, What you send Friday away for? Take kill
Friday, no send Friday away. This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw
tear-s stand in his eyes: in a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost
afl'ection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him then,
and onen alter, that Iwould never send him away from me, if he was
willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found, by all his discourse, 8'9"!" afi'ection to
me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the foun-
dation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affec-
tion to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good; a thing which,
as I had no notion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or intention,
or desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong inclination to my
attempting an escape, as above, founded on the supposition gathered
from the discourse, viz: that there were seventeen bearded men there:
and, therefore, without any more delay, I went to work with Friday, to
find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe,
to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the island to I've
built a little fleet, not ofperiaguas or canoes, but even of good large vessels:
but the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we
might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake] committed at
first: At last, Friday pitched upon a tree; for! found he knew much
better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor can I tell, to this
day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was very like
the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicaragua wood, for it
was much of the same color and smell. Friday was for burning the
hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it for a heat, but I showed him
how to cut it with tools; which. after I had showed him how to use, he
did very handily: and in about a month's hard labor we finished it, and
made it very handsome; especially when, with our axes, which I showed
him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of ,
a boat. Afler this, however. it cost as near a furnight's time to get her ~
along. as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the water; butwhen
she was in. she would have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water. and though she was so big, it amazed me
to see with what dexterity, and how swift my man Friday would manage
her, turn her and paddle her along. So ,1 asked him ifhe would, and it'we
might vepturc over in her. Yes, he said; we venture over in her very well.
though great blow wind. However, I had a farther design, that he know
nothing of, and that was to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with an
anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so! pitched
upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found near the place, and
which there were great plenty of in the island: and I set Friday to work
to cut it down, and gut: him directions how to shape and order it. But
as to the sail, that was my particular care. I knew I had old sails or
rather pieces of old sails enough; but as I had had them now six-and-
twenty years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not
imagining that I should ever have this kind of use for them,l did not
doubt but they were all rofien,and, indeed, must of them were so. How-
ever, I found two pieces which appeaged pretty good, and with these I
went to work; and with a great deal of pains, and awkward stitching,
you may he sure, for want of needles, 1 at length made a three cornered
ugly thing, like flat we call in England a shoulder-otlmutton-sail, to go
with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually
our ship's long-boats sail with, and Inch as l best knew how to manage,
as it was such a one I had to the boat in which I made my escape from
Barbary, as related in the first part of my story.

I was near two months performing this last work, viz: rigging and
fitting my mast and sails; forl finished them very complete, making a
small stay, and a sail, or fomail, to it. to assist, if we should turn to wind-
ward; and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stem of her
to steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I knew the use-
t'glness, and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so
much pains to do it, thatat last I brought it to pass: though, considering
the many dull contrivancesl had for it that failed,I think it cost me
almost as much labor as making the boat.

After all this was done,l had my man Friday to teach as to what
belonged to the navigation of my boat; for, though he knew very well
how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a
rudder; and was the most amazed when he saw me work the host to and
again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed, and tilled this
way, or that way. as the course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw
this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. However, with a little
use,l made all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except thatas to the compass, I could make him understand very
little of that. On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy weather,
and seldom or never any tags in those parts, there was the less occasion
for a compass, seeing the-stars were always to be seen by night, and the
shore by day, except in the rainy seasons, and then nobody cared to stir
abroad, either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in
this place; though the three last years that! had this creature with me
ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite of
another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the annivemry of
landing here with the same thankfulneu to God for his mercies as at first:
and if I had such cause of acknowledgment at flrst.l had much more
so now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Providence
over me, and the great hopes 1 had of being eflectuslly and speedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts that my
deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be another year in this
place. I went on, however, with my husbandry; digging. planting, and
fencing as usual. I gathered and cured my grapes, and did every noose
sary thing as before.

The rainy season was, in the meantime. upon me, when I kept more
within doors than at other times. We had slowed our new vessel as
secure as we could, bringing her up into the creek. when, as I said in the
beginning,l landed my rails from the ship; and hauling her upto the
shore.at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just
big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her water enough to
float in; and then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam
across the end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to the
tide, from the sea: and to keep the rain 08', we laid a great many boughs
of trees, so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house; and thus we
waited for the months of November and December, in which 1 designed
to make my adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design
returned with the fair weather, 1 was preparing daily for the voyage: and
the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of provmons, being
the stores for our voyage: and intended. in a week or a fortnight's time,
to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning
upon something of this kind, when i called to Friday, and bid him go to
the sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle, or tortoise, a thing which
we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh.
Friday had not been long gone, when he came running back, and flew
over my outer wall, or fence, like one that felt not the ground or the
steps he set his feet on; and befurej had time to speak to him, he cries
out to me, Oh master! 0h master! on sorrow! 0h heal--What's the
matter, Friday! says I. Ch yonder, there, says he, one, two, three canoe;
one, two, three! By this way of speaking,l concluded there were six:
but, on innuiry, I found it was but three. Well, Friday, says I, do not be
frightened! Sol heartened him upas well as I could : however, Isaw the
poor fellow was most terribly seared; for nothing ran in his head but
that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces and eat
him; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with
him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him: but, says I,
Friday, we mnstresolveto fight them. Can you tight I-'riday l--Me shoot,
aays he; but there come many. great number.--No matter for that, said
I, again: our guns will fright them that we do not kill. So I asked him
whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as Mid him. He said, Me die, when you bid die, master.
So I went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave him; for I had been
so good a huehand of my rum, that I had a great deal left. When he
drank it, I made him take the two lbwling-piaees, which we always carried,
and loaded them with large swan-ehot,as big assrnall pistol-bullets: then
I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs, and five small
bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each: I
hung my great sword.as usual, naked by my side; and gave Friday his
hatchet. When I had thus prepared myself; I took my perspective-glass,
and went up to the side-of the hill, to see what I count discover; and I
found quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages, three
prisoners, and three canoes; and that their whole husineas aeemed to be
the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarous
feast, indeed! but nothing more than,as I observed, was usual with them.
I observed, also, that they were landed, not where they had done when
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek': where the shore was
low, and where a thick wood came almost close down to the sea. This,
with the abhorrenee of the inhuman errand these wretches came about,
tilled me with such indignation, that I came down again to Friday. and told
him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all; and asked him
if he would atand by me. He had now got over his flight, and his apirits
being a little raised with the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful,
and told me, as before. he would die when I bid die.

In this fit of fury, I took and divided the arms which I had charged, as

before, between us: I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle. and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol, and the other three
guns myself; and in this poeture we marched out. I took a small bottle
of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and
bullets; and, as to orders. I charged him to keep close behind me, and not
to stir, or shoot, or do any thing, till I bid him: and in the meantime, not
to speaks word. In this poeture, l fetched a compete to my right hand
of near a mile: as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, an
that I might come within shot of them before I should be discovered,
which I had seen. by my glass, it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began
to abate my resolution : I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their
number; for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was
superior to em; nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my
thoiighta, at call, what occasion, much less what necessity I was in,

to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done 'v;

or intended me any wrong! Who, as to me, were innocent, and whose
barbarous customs were their own disaster; being in them a'token indeed
of God's having let! them. with the other nations of that part of the
world, to such stupidity. and to such inhuman courses; but did not call
me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less an execu-
tioner of his justice; that, whenever he thought fit, he would take the
cause into his own hands, and, by national vengeance, punish them, as a
people. for national crimes; but that in the meantime, it was none of my
business; that, it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a
declared enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular people.
and it was lawful for him to attack them: but 1 could not say the same
with respect to myself. These things were so warmly pressed upon my
thoughts all the way esl went, that I resolved I would only go and place
myself near them. that 1 might observe their barbarous feast, and that
l would act then as God should direct; but that unless something ofl'ered
that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with
them.

With this resolution I entered the wood: and, with all possible wari-
aces and silence, Friday following close at my heels, I marched till I
came to the skirt of the wood. on the side which was next to them, only
that one corncnof the wood lay between me and them. Herel called
sottly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which was just at the
corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring ms word if he
could see there plainly what they were doing. He did so; and came
immediately back to me. and told me they might be plainly viewed
there; that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the sand. a little from them.
which, he said, they would kill next, and which tired all the very soul
within the. lie told me it was not one of their nation, but one of the
bearded men he had told me of, that came to their country in the boat.
I was filled with horror at the very naming the white bearded man; and.
going to the tree. I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon
the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or thing!
like rushes, and that he was a European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yards
nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going a little way
about,l sawl might come at undiscovered, and that then I should be
within half a shot of them: so I withheld my passion, though I was
indeed enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty paces.
I got behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other
tree; and then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view
of them at the distance of about eighty yards.So I u: down one uf the musk". Ind um fouling-puke upon the ground'

him at the surprise of our first fire, and tied in a terrible fright to the sea-
side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the
same way. I turned to Friday, and bade him step forward, and fire at
them; he understood the immediately, and running about forty yards, to
be nearer them, he shot at them, and i thought he had killed them all.
for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though 1 saw two of them
up again quickly: however, he killed two of them and wounded the third,
so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as it' he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife and cut the
flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet, 1 litted
him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He
answered in Latin, Christianus; but was so weak and faint that he could
scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it
him, making signs that he should drink, which he did: and l gave him a
piece of bread, which he eat. Then I asked him what countryman he
was: and he said, Espagniole; and being a little recovered, let me know,
by all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my debt for
his deliverance. Seignior. said I, with as much Spanish as i could make
up, we will talk atterward, but we must light now; it' you have any
strength tell, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you. He took
them very thankfully; and no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but,
as if they had put new vigor into him,he flew upon his murderers like a
fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant: for the truth is,
as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so much
frightened with the noise of our pieces, that they fell down from mere
amazement and rear, and had no more power to attempt their own escape,
than their flesh had to resist our shot: and that was the case of those five
that Friday ahot'at in the boat: for as three or them fell with the hurt
they received, so the other two fell with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still without tiring. being willing to keep
my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword;
so I called Friday and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first
fired, and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, which
he did with great swittness; and then giving him my musket. I sat down
myself to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these pieces. there happened a fierce
engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at
_ him with one of their great wooden swords. the same-like weapon that
was to have killed him before, it' I had not prevented it. The Spaniard,
who was as bold and brave as could be imagined, though weak, had
fought this Indian a good while, and had cut him two great wounds on
his head; but the savage being a stout. lusty fellow. closing-in with him,
had thrown him ann, being faint1 and was wringing my sword out of

sword. drew the pistol ll'om bis girdle, shot the savage through the body,
and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help him,
could come near him. _

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, with
no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he dispatched those
three, who. as I said before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the
rest he could come up with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I
gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the
savages. and wounded them both; but, as he was not able to run, they
both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed
one of them, but the other was too ninible for him; and though he w'aa
wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea, and swam, with all his
might, 06' to those two who were let! in the canoe, which three in the
canoe. with one wounded, that we knew not whether he died or no, were
all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty; the account of'the whole
is as follows: three killed at our tlrst shot from the tree; two killed at
the next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat; two killed by Friday of
those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood; three killed by
the Spaniard; four killed. being found dropped here and there, of their
wounds. or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four escaped in the
boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.---Twenty-one in all.

Those that were. in the canoe worked hard to get out of gunshot, and
though Friday made two or three shots at them,l did not find that he hit
any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes,
and pursue them ; and indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest
carrying the news home to their people. they should come back perhaps
With two or three hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere multi-
tude; so 1 consented to pursue them by sea. and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and beds Friday follow me; but when I was in the
canoe, l was surprised to find another poor creature lie there, bound hand
and l'not,as the Spaniard was. for the slaughter, and almost dead with
fear, not knowing what was the matter; for he had not been able to look
up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard neck and heels, and had
been tied so long, that he had really but little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had bound
him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or
speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still. that he was
only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him, i bade
him speak to him, and tell him of his deliverance: and, pulling out my
bottle. made him give the poor wretch a dram; which, with the news 0.
his being delivered. revived him. and he sat up in the beat. But when
l-'riday came to hear him speak, and look in his face. it would have moved

any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, ~

hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed. jumped about. danced, lung; then' .
180 .wven runes os-

cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own files and bead; and then
sung and jumped about again. like a distracted creature. lt was a
good while beforel could make him speak to me. or tell me what was
the matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told me that it was
his father. '

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy
and filial sflection had worked in this poor savage at the sight 'of'hia
llither. and of his being delivered from death; nor, indeed. can I describe
half the cxtravaganeies of his afl'ection after this; for he went into the
boat. and out of the boat a. great many times: when he went in to him,
he would sit down by him, open his breast.and hold his father's head
close to his bosom for many minutes together, to nourish it; then he took
his arms and ankles. which were numbed and slid with the binding. and
chatted and rubbed them with his hands; and l perceiving what the case
was, gave him some rum outot" my bottle to rub them with, which did them
a great deal of good.

This atliiir put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other sav-
ages. who were now got almost out of sight;and it was happy for us that
we did not, for it blew so hard within two hours alter, and before they
could be got a quarter of their way, and continued blowing so hard all
night, and that from the north-wast, which was against them. that I
could never suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their
own coast. -

'But. to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father. that [could
not find in my heart to take him oil' for some time: but after! thought
he could leave him a little. I called' him to me, and he came jumping,
and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme; then I asked if he had
given his father any bread. He shook his head. and said, None; ugly dog
eat all up self. I then gave him a cake of bread. out of a little pouch I
carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself. but he would not
taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my pocket two or three
bunches of raisins, so Igave hiiu a handful of them for his hither. He
had no sooner given his lather these raisins, but I saw him come out of
the boat, and run away. as if he had been bewitchcd. he ran at such a
rate; for he was the swiftest follow on his feet that I ever saw: I say, he
nut at such a rate, that lie was out of sight. as it were. in an instant; and
though I called, and hallooed out too. after him. it was all one, away he
went; and in a quarter of an hour [saw him come back again, though
not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, l found his pace slacker.
because he had something in his hand. When he came up tome. I found
he had been quite home for an earthen jug. or pot. to bring his father
some fresh water, and that he had two more cakes or loaves of bread;
the bread he gave me. but the water he carried to his father; however, as
l was very thirsty too, 1 took a little sup of it. The water revived his
fllther more than all the rum or spirits I had given him, for he was just '
fainting with thirst.

When his father had drank. I called to him to knowif there was any
water left: he said, Yes; and l bade him give it to the mar Spaniard, who
was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the cakes that
Friday brought to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and was re-
posinghimself upona green place under the shade ofa tree; and whose limbs
were also very stifl'. and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had
been tied with. When I saw that, upon Friday's coming to him with the
water. he sat up and drank, and took the bread, and began to eat, I went
to him and gave him a handhil of raisins: he looked up in my face with
all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any
countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted him-
self in the fight. that he could not stand upon his feet: he tried- to do it
two or three times. but was really not able, his ankles were so swelled
and so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub
his ankles. and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's.

Iobserved the poor alfeetionate creature, every two minutes, or per-

haps less.sll the while he was here, turn his head about,to see if his
' father wasin the same place and posture as he let! him sitting; and at
last he found he was not to be seen: at which he started up, and, without
speaking a word, flew with that swiltness to him, that one could scarce
perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he came, he
only found that he had laid himself down to ease his Iimbs,so Friday
came back to me presently: and then I spoke to the Spaniard to let
l-'riday help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he
should carry him to our dwelling. where I would take care of him: but
Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite upon his back, and
carried him away to the boat, and set him down soltly upon the side or
gunnel of the canoe. with his feet in the inside of it; and then lilting him
quite in. he set him close to his father ; and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could
walk, though the wind blew pretty hard too: so he brought them both
safe into our creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch
the other canoe. As he passed me. I spoke to him, and asked him,
whither he went. He told me, Go fetch more boat: so away he went like
the wind. for sure never man nor horse ran like him ; and he had the other
canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land; so he waited me
over. and then went to help ournew guests out of the boat. which he did:
but they were neither of them able to walk,so that poor Friday knew
not what to do. '

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday. to
bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me. I soon made a kind
of handbarrow to lay them on. and Friday and I carried them both up182 aovaa I'URES or

together upon it. between us. 'But when we got them to the outside of
our wall. or fortification. we were at a worse loss than before. for it was
impossible to get them over. and l was resolved not to break it down: so
I set to work again; and Friday and I. in about two hours' time, made
a very handsome tent. covered with old sails. and above that with bougbs
of trees, being in the space without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted: and here we made
them two beds or such things as I had. viz: of good rice straw, with
blankets laid upon it. to lie on, and another to cover them. on each bad.

My island was now peopled, and I drought. myself very rich in sub.
jccts: and it was a merry reflection, which I fiequently made. how like
a king I looked. First of all. the whole country was my own mere prop-
erty. so that I had an undoubted right of dominion. Secondly. my
people were perfectly subjected; I was absolutely lord and lawgiver;
they all owed their lives to me. and were ready to lay down their lives.
it there had been occasion for it, for me. It was remarkable, too. I had
but three subjects. and they were of three different religions: my man
Friday was a Protestant. his father was a Pagan and a cannibal. and the
Spaniard was a Papist: however. I allowed liberty ot'consceince through-
out my dominionsz--But this is by the way.

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given
them shelter. and a place to rest them upon,l began to think or making
some provision for them: and the first thing I did.I ordered Friday to
take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out. of my particular flock,
to be killed ; when I cut oil the hinder quarter.and chopping it into small
pieces.I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing. and made them a
very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth. having put some barley
and rice also into the broth: and as I cooked it without doors, for I made
no fire within my inner wall. so I carried it all Into the new tent. and
having set a table there for them. I sat down. and eat my dinner also with
them. and as well as I could. cheered them, and encouraged them. Friday
was my interpreter. especially to his father. and indeed. to the Spaniard
too: for the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.

After we had dined. or rather suppad, I ordered Friday to take one of
the canoes. and go and t'ctch our muskels and other tire arms. which. for
want ot' time, we had lett upon the place of battle: and, the next day. I
ordered him to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay
open to the sun. and would presently be otfensive. I also ordered him to
bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast. which I knew were
pretty much. and which I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could
not bear to see them, if I went that way; all which he punctuslly per-
formed. and etlnced the very appearance of the savages being there; so
that when l Weill again.I could scarce know where it was,otharwiu
than by the corner or the wood pointing'to the place.
1 then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new sub-
Jects: and. first, I set Friday to inquire at his father what he thought of
the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a
return of them. with a power too great for us to resist, His first opinion
was, that the savages in the boat never could live out the storm which
blew that night they went olf. but must of necessity. be drowned, or
driven south to those other shores. where they were as sure to be
devoured as they were to be drowned, if they were cast away: but, as to
what they would do, if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not;
but it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully hightened with the
manner of their being attacked, the noise. and the fire, that he believed
they would tell the people they were all killed by thunder and lightning,
not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared, viz: Friday
and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them,
and not men with weapons. This, he said, he knew; because he heard
them all cry out so. in their language, one to another; for it was imposibls
for them to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder. and
kill at a distance, without lilting up the hmd, as was done now: and this
old savage was in the right; foras I understood since, by other hands, the
savages never attempted to go over to the island alterward, they were so
terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for, it seems, they
did ewape the sea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted
island would be destroyed with fire from the gods. This, however.l
knew not; and therefore was under continual apprehensions fora good
while, and kept always upon my guard, with all my army: for, as there
were now four of us,I would have ventured upon a hundred of them,
fairly in the open field, at any time.

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of heir
coming wore ofi'; and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to
the main into consideration; being likewise assured. by Friday's father,
that I might depend upon good usage from their nation. on his account,
if I would go. But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a
serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that them
were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese, who, having been
cast away, and made theirescape to that side, lived there at peace, indeed,
with the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed
for life. I asked him all the particulars of their voyage, and found they
were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la Flats to Havanna, being
directed to leave their loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver,
and to bring back what European goods they could meet with there; that
they had five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of an-
other wreck; that five of their own men were drowned, when first their
ship was lost, and that these escaped. through infinite dangers and
hazards, and arrived, almost starved,on the cannibal coast, where they
expected to have been devoured every moment. He told me they had
some arms with them. but they were perfectly useless. for that they had
neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their
powder. but a little, which they used, at their first landing, to provide
themselves some food.

I asked him what he thought would become of them here. and if they

had formed no design of making any escape. He said they had many
consultations about it; but that having neither resaelmor tools to build
one. nor provisions of any kind. their councils always ended in tears and
despair. I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from
me. which might tend toward an escape: and whether, if they were all
here, it might not be done. I told him with freedom! feared mostly
their treachery and in usage of me, if I put my life in their hands; tor
that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the nature of man, nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they had received.so
much as they did by the advantages they expected. I told him it would
be very hard that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and
that they should afterward make me their prisoner in New Spain where
an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity or
.what accident soever brought him thither: and that I had rather be
delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the
merciless claws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I
added, that otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might,
with so many hands, build a bark large enough to carry us alltaway.either
to the Brazils, southward. or to the islands, or Spanish coast, northward;
but that if, in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their
hands, carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill used for
my kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before.

He answered, with a great deal ofcandor and ingenuousness. that their
condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of'it, that. he
believed, they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that
should contribute to their deliverance; and that if I pleased. he would
go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it and
return again, and bring me their answer; that he would make conditions
with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under
my leading as their commander and captain :' and that they should swear
upon the holy sacraments and Gospel, to be true to me, and go to such
Christian country as that I should agree to. and no other. and to be
directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were landed safely
in such country as I intended; and that he would bring a contract from
them, under their hands, for that purpose. Then he told me he would
first swear to me himself. that he Would- never stir from me as long as he
lived, till I gave him orders: and that he would take my side to the last
drop ofhis blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among
his countrymen. He told me they were all or them very civil, honest
men, end they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having
neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and dis-
cretion of the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own
country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief they
would live end die by me. _

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible,
and to send the old savage end this Spaniard over to them to treat.
But when we had got ell things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself
started an objection, which had so much prudence in it, on one hand.
and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well
satisfied in it; and, by this advice, put 011' the deliverance of his com-
rades fin at least helf a year. The case was thus: He had been with us
now about a month, during which time I had let him see in what manner
I had provided. with the assistance of Providence, for my support; and
he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up; which,
though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not auficient,
without good husbandy, for my family, now it was increased to four; but
much less would it be suflicient if his countrymen, who were, as he said,
sixteen, still alive, should come over: and, least of all, would it he suf-
ficient to victusl our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to any
one of the Christian colonies of America: so he told me he thought it
would be more advisable to let him end the other two dig and cultivate
some more lend,as much as I could spare seed to sow. and that we should
wait mother harvest, that we might have a supply ofcorn for his country-
men, when they should come; for want might be a temptation to them
to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, or otherwise than out
of one difficulty into another. You know, says he, the children of Israel,
though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of Egypt, yet
rebelled even against God himself, that delivered them, when they came to
want bread in the wilderness.

His caution.was so eessonsble end his advice so good, that I could not
hutnhe very well pleased with his proposal, as well as l was satisfied with
his fidelit ': so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden
tools We were furnished with permitted; and in abouts month's time, by
the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and
trimmed up as we sowed mound-twenty bushels of barley on, and six-
teen jars of rice; which was, in short. all 'the seed we had to spare: nor,
indeed, did we leave ourselves barely sufficient for our own food, for the
six months that we had to expect our crop: that is to say, reckoning
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for.it is not to be sup-
posed it is six months in the ground in that country.

Having now society enough, and our number being suflicient to put us
out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their_number had

l6
been very grant, we went freely all over the island,-whenever we found
occasion ; and as here we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts,
it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mind.
For this purpose. I marked out several trees which I thought fit for our
work, and I set Friday end his father to cutting them down; and then I-
cauaed the Spaniard. to whom I imparted my thought on that affair. to
oversee and direct their work. I showed them with what indefatigable
pains I had hewed a large tree into single planks,and I caused them to do
the like, till they had made about a dozen large planks or good oak, near
two feet broad. thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches
thick: what prodigious labor it took up. any one may imagine.

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats
as much as I could; and, for this purpose, I made Friday and the
Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we
took our turns). and by this means we got about twenty young kids to
breed up with the rest; tor whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids,
and added them to our flock. But, above all, the season for curing the
grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in
the sun, that, I believe had we been at Alicsnt, where the raisins of the
sun are cured, we could have tilled sixty or eighty barrels; and these.
with our bread, was a great part of our food, and was very good living
too, I assure you, for it is exceeding nourishing

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most
plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to
answer our end; for iron twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in
and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in
proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or
if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have vic-
tualed our ship to have carried us to any part or the world, that is to say,
any part of America. When we had thus housed and secured our msg-
azins of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz: great
baskets. in which we kept it; .and the Spaniard was very handy and
dextroul at this part, and often blamed me that] did not make some-
thing for defense of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.

And now having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I
gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do
with thwe he had let! behind him there. I gave him a strict charge not
to bring any man with him who would not first swear, in the presence of
himself and the old savsge, that he would no way injure. tight with, or
attack the person he should find in the island.'who was so kind as to send
for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand by him,
and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went,
would be entirely under and subjected to his command; and that this
should be put in writing, and signed with their hands. How they were
to have done this, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a
question which we never asked. Under these instructions, the Spaniard
and the old savage, the lather of Friday, went away in one of the canoes
which they might be said to come in. or rather were brought in. when
they came as prisoners to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of
them a musket, with a tirelock on it. and about eight charges of powder
and ball, charging them to be very good husbands of both, and not to
use either of them but upon urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in view
of my deliverance. for now twenty-seven years and some days. I gave
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufllcient for themselves
for many days, and sumcient for all the Spaniards for about eight days'
time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go; agreeing with
them about a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I
should know them again,when they came back, at a distance, before they
came on shore. They went away with a {air gale. on the day that the
moon was at full, by my account in the month of October; but as for an
exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I_could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the number-1f years so punctually as to be
sureI was right; though, as it proved, when l afterward examined my
account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange
and unforeseen accident intervened. of which the like has not perhaps
been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my butch one morning.
when my man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, Master,
master, they are come, they are come ! I jumped up, and, regardless of
danger, I went out as soon as I could get myclothes on. through my little
grove, which, by the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick
wood; I say, regardless ofdanger, I went without my arms, which it was
not my custom to do: but I was surprised. when turning my eyes to the
sea, I presently saw a boat at abouta league and a halfdistance, standing
in for the shore, with a shoulder-oilinutton sail." they call it, and the
wind blowing pretty Iiir to bring them in: also I observed presently. that
they did not come item that side which the shore lay on. but from the
southernmost end of the island. Upon this, I called Friday in, and bade
him lie close. lbr'tbese were not the people we looked'for, and that we
might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the next
place, I went in to fetch my perswctive-glass, to see what I could make
of them; and having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing, and to take
my view the plainer, without being discovered. I had scarce set my foot
upon the bill, when my eyes plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor,
at about two leagues sud a half distance hem me, 8. S. E, but not above
a league and a belt from the shore. By my observation. it appeared
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an English
long-boat.

I can not express the confusion I was in : though the joy of seeing a
ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own
countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as] can not describe;
but yet I had some secret douhts hang shout msh-I can not tell from
whence they come, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place,
it occurred to me to consider what husineu an English ship could have
in that part of the world. since it was not the way to or item any part of
the world where the English had any traflic; and I lmew there had been
no storms to drive them in' there,as in distress; end that it' they were
rially English, it was most probable that they were here upon no good
design; end that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the hands
of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger, which some-
times are given him when he may think there is no possibility ofits
being real. That such hints and notices are given us, I believe few that
have made any observations of things can deny; that they are certain
discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we can not
doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger,
why should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether
supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they
are given for our good!

The present question abundantly confirms the in the justice of this
reasoning: for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,
come it from 'whence it will,l had been undone inevitably, and in a far
worse condition than before." you will see presently. lhad not kept
myself long in this posture, but I saw the host draw near the shore. as if
they looked fora creek to thrust in at. for the convenience of landing:
however, as they did not comequite far enough, they did not see the little
inlet whereI formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon
the beach, at about half a mile from me. which was very happy for me;
for otherwise they would have landed just at my door. as I may say, and
would soon have beaten the out of my castle, and perhaps have plundered
me of all I had. When they were on shore.I was mlly satisfied they
were Englishmen. at least'most of them; one or two I thought were
Dutch, but it did not prove so: there were in all eleven men, whereof
three of them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound; and
when the first four or tive of them were jumped on shore, they took those
three out of the boat, as prisoners: one of the three I could perceive
using the most passionate gestures of entreaty,amiction. and despair,
even to a kind of extravagance; the other two, I could perceive. titled up
their hands sometimes, and appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such
a degree as the first. I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew
not what the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English,
as well as he could, on master! you see English mans eat prisoner as
well as savage mans.--Why. Friday, says I, do you think they are going
to eat theml--Yea, says Friday, they will eat then--No, no, says I,
Friday; I am altaid they will murder them, indeed, but you may be sure
they will not eat them.

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood
trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when
the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains
lift up his arm with a great cutlass as the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike one of the poor men; and I expecwd to we him fall every moment;
at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I
wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with
him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that] might have rescued the three men, for I saw no fire-arms
they had among them; but it fell out to my mind another way. Alter I
had observed the outrageous usage of the three men by the insolent ses-
men,I observed the fellows run scattering about the island," if they
wanted to see the country. I observed that the three other men had
liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat down all three upon
the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair. This put me
in mind of the first time when I came on share, and began to look about
me; how I gave myself over for lost; how wildly I looked around me;
what dreadful apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the tree all
night, for {car of being devoured by wild beasts. As I knew nothing, that
night, of the supply I was to receive by the providential driving of the
ship nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been _
so long nourished and supported; so these three poor desolate men knew
nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it was
to them, and how elfectually and really they were in a condition of safety,
at the same time that they thought themselves lost, and their case despe-
rate. So little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason have
we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that he does
not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute. but that, in the worst
circumstances, they have always something to be thankful for, and some-
times are nearer their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even
brought to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be
brought to their destruction

and partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a place they
were in, they had caroleuly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water
waaehbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground. They had left
two men in the boat. who, as i found afterward, having drank a little too
much brandy. fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner
than the other. and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it.

all soon came to the boat: but it was past all their strength to launch
her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a suit

who are perhaps the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave
it over, and away they strolled about the country again; and i heard one
of them my aloud to another, calling them otf from the boat, Why. let
her alone, Jaek,ean't you! she'll fioat next tide: by which [was fully
confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were. All this
while I kept myself very close. not once daring to stir out of my castle,
any farther than to my place of observation, near the top of the hill; and
very glad I was to think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less
than ten hours belbre the boat could fioat again. and by that time it would
be dark, and I might be at more liberty tosee their motions, and to hear
their discourse, if they had any. in the meantime. I fitted myself up
for a battle. as before, though with more caution, knowing I had to do
with another kind of enemy than I had at first. lordered Friday also.

muskets. My figure, indeed.was very fierce; I had my formidable goata'

side. two pistols in my belt. and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above. not to have made any attempt till it
was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that,
in short, they were all gone straggling into the woods. and. as I thought,
laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep. were, however, sat down under the shelter of
a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me. and. as I thought. out
of sight of any of the rest. Upon this.l resolved to discover myself to

murder us all. Have they any tire-arms? said I. He answered they had
only two pieces, one of which they left in the boat. Well then, said I,
leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing to kill
them all: but shall we rather take them prisoners! He told me there
were two desperate villains among them, that it was scarce safe to show
any mercy to; but it' they were secured, he believed all the rest would
return to their duty. I asked him which they were! He told me he
could not at that distance distinguish them, but he would obey myordere
in any thing I would direct. Well, says Llet us retreat out oftheir view
or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further. So they willingly
went back with me, till the woods covered as from them.

Look you sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliverance, are you will-
ing to make two conditions with me"! He anticipated my proposals, by
telling me, that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly
directed and commanded by me in every thing; and, if the ship was not
recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world soever
I would send him; and the two other men said the same. Well, says I,
my conditions are but two: first, that while you stay in this island with
me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if i put arms in
your hands, you will, upon all occasions. give them up to me, and do no
prejudice to me or mine upon this island; and, in the meantime, be gov-
erned by my orders: secondly, That if the ship is, or may be recovered,
you will carry me and my man to England passage tree.

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could
devise, that he would comply with these most reasonable demands; and,
beside, would owe his life to mc, and acknowledge it upon all occasions,
as long as he lived. Well then, said I, here are three muskets for you,
with powder and ball: tell me next what you think is proper to be done.
He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able. but
uttered to be wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard
venturing any thing: but the best method I could think of was to tire
upon them at once, as they lay. and if any were not killed at the first
volley. and offered to submit, we might save them. and so put it wholly
upon God's providence to direct the shot. He said very modestly, that
he was loth to kill them,if he could help it: but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the
ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still; for they would go
on board and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. Well
then. says i, necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to
save our lives. However, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I

told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found con-
veniont.

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and
soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either of
them were the heads of the mutiny! He said no. Well then, said I,
you may let them escape t and Providence seems to have awakened them
' on purpose to save themselves. Now, says i, if the rest escape you, it is
your fault. Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in
his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, with
.each a piece in his hand; tin two men who were with him going first,
made some noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned
about. and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too late
then, for the moment he cried out they fired: 1 mean the two men, the
captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their
shot at the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and
the other very much wounded; but not being dead. he started up on his
'bet, and called eagerly for help to the other; but the captain stepping to
him, told him it was too late to cry 1hr help. he should call upon God to
forgive his villainy ; and with that word knocked him down with the stock
ofhis musket,so that he never spoke more: there were three more in the
company, and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this time I
was come; and when they new their danger nd that it was in vain to
resist, they begged for mercy. The captain [(1 them he would spare
their lives, it' they would give him any assurance of their abhorrence of
the treachery they had been guilty of. and would swear to he faithml to
him in recovering the ship. and afterward in carrying her back to
Jamaica. from whence they came. They gave him all the protestations
of their sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing to believe
them. and spare their lives, which I was not against, only that I obliged
him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the boat,
with orders to secure her. and bring away the oars and sails, which they
did: and by and by three straggling men, that were (happily for them)
parted item the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired, and seeing
the captain, who before was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they
submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.

lt now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another's
circumstances; Ibegan first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement; and particularly et the
wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammuni-
tion; and, indeed. as mystery is a whole collection of wonders, it
affected him deeply. But when he reflected {tom thence upon himself,
and howl seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his
life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not speaks word more.
After this communication was at an end. I carried him and his two men
into my apartment, leading them in just where I came out. viz: at the
top of the house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had,
and showed them all the contrivsnces I had made, during my long. long
inhabiting that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but,
above all, the captain admired my fortification. and how perfectly I had
concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been new
planted near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in.
England. was become a little wood, and so thick, that it was impassable
in any part of it, but. at that one side where I had reserved my little
winding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and my residence,
but that I had a seat in the country," most princes have, whither I could
retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that too another time: but
at present. our business was to consider how to recover the ship. He
agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a loss what

measures to take, for that there were still six-and-twenty hands on board,
who having entered into a cursed conspiracy. by which they had all
forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by despera-
tion, and would carry it on, knowing that, if they were subdued, they
would be brought to tho gallows, as soon as they came to England. or to
any of the English colonies; and that, therefore, there would be no
attacking them with so small a number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a very
rational conclusion. and therefore, something was to be resolved on

specdily,as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their
surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. Upon
this. it presently occurred to me. that in a little while the ship's crew,
wondering what was become of their comrades, and of the boat. would
certainly come on shore in their other boat, to look for them; and that
then, perhaps, they might come armed. and he too strong for us: this he
allowed to be rational. Upon this,l told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat. which lay upon the beach, so that they might not
carry her oil': and taking every thing out of her. leave her so far useless
as not to be lit to swim: accordingly we went on board. took the arms
which were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found there,
which was a bottle or brandy. and another of rum. a few biscuit-cakes,
a horn of powder and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas (the
sugar was five or six pounds); all of which was very welcome to me.
especially the brandy and sugar. of which I had none lett for many
years.

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast. sail,
and rudder ot' the boat were carried away before. as above), we knocked
a great hole in her bottom; that if they had come strong enough to
master us, yet they could not carry all" the boat. Indeed it was not much
in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view
was. that if they went away without the boat. I did not much question
to make her lit again tocarry us to the Leeward islands. and call upon
our friends the Spaniards in my way; for I had them still in my
thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first. by main
strength. heaved the boat upon the beach,so high that the tide would not
tlost her 011' at high water-mark. and, beside. had broke a hole in her
$ottom too big to be quickly stopped. and were set down musing what
we should do. we heard the ship tire a gun, and saw her make a waft
with her ensign asa signal {or the boat to come on board: but no heat
stirred; and they tired several times. making other signals for the boat.
At last. when all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found
the boat did not stir. we saw them, by the help of my glasses. hoist
another boat out, and row toward the shore; and we found, as they
approached, that there were no less than ten men in her, and that they
had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore. we had a full view
of them as they came. and a plain sight even of their faces; because the
tide having set them a little to the east of the other best, they rowed up
under shore. to come to the same place where the other had landed. and
where the boat lay; by this meana.l say. we had a full view of them.
and the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the
boat, of whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he
was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpowered
and frightened; but that as for the hostswain, who, it seems, was the
chief officer among them. and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any
of the ship's crew. and were no doubt made desperate in their new enter-
prise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too powerful
for us. I smiled at him, and told him that men' in our circumstances
were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost every condition that
could be was better than that which we were supposed to be in. we ought
to expect that the consequence, whether death or life. would be sure to
be a deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circumstances of
my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for! And
where. sir, said I, is your belief of my being preserved here on purpose
to save your life, which elevated you a little while ago! for my part, said
I, there seems to me but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it. What
is that! says he. Why,said I, it is, that as you say there are three or
four honest fellows among them, which should be spared: had they been
all of the wicked part of the crew,l should have thoughtGod's providence
had singled them out to deliver them into your hands; for depend upon
it. every man that comes ashore are our own, and shall die or live as they
behave to us. As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful counte-
nance. I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our
business.

We had. upon the first appearance of the host's coming horn the ship,
considered of separating our prisoners; and we had. indeed. secured
them effectually. Two of them,of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary. I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivemd men, to
my cave, where they were remote enough. and out of danger of being
heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they'
could have delivered themselves: here they left them bound, but gave
them provisions: and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to
give them their liberty in a day or two: but that if they attempted their
escape, they should be put to death without mercy. They promised
faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very thankful
that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light left them;
for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their
comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at
the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,
indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them; but the other two
were taken into my service upon the captain's recommendation. and upon
their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and tho
three honest men we were seven well armed; and I made no doubt we
soould be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming. con-
sidering that the captain had said there were three or four honest men
among them also. As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore. haul-
ing the boat up after them. which I was glad to see; for l was afraid they
would rather have let! the boat at an anchor, some distance from the
shore, with some hands in her, to guard her, and so we should not be able
to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to
their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great surprise
to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
her bottom. After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two or
three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try it' they could
make their companions hear: but all was to no purpose: then they came
all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their smollarms, which, indeed, we
heard, and the echoes made the woods ring: but it was all one; those in
the cave we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though
they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them. They
were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they told us atterward,
they resolved to go all on board again, to their ship. and let them know
that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat slaved; accordingly,
they immediately launced their boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at this, believ-
ing they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their com-
rades over for lost. and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in
hopes we should have recovered, but he was quickly as much frightened
the other way. '

They had not been long put all' with the boat, but we perceived them
all coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct,
which it seems they consulted together upon, viz: to leave three men in
the boat. and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look
for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, for now we
were at a loss what to do ; as our seizing those seven men on shore would be
no advantage to us. if we let the boat escape; because they would then
row away to the ship, and then the rest of them would he sure to weigh
and set sail. and so our recovering the ship would be lost. However, we
had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of things might present.
The seven men came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat
:

put her of to a good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to
wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the
boat. Those that came on shore, kept close together, marching toward
the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay;and we could
see them plainly, though they could not perceive us. We could have
been very glad they would have come nearer to us,so that we might have
fired at them.or that they would have gone farther of, that we might
have come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay
toward the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted
and hallooed till they were weary; and not caring,it seems, to venture
far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat down together
under a tree, to consider of it. Had they thought lit to have gone to
sleep there, as the other part of them had done, they had done the job
for us: but they were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture to
go to sleep, though they could not tell what the danger was they had to
fear neither.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation
of theirs, viz: that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to endeavor
to make their fellows hear. and that we should all sally upon them, just
at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they would
certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked
this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to come
up to them before they could load their pieces again. But this event did
not happen; and we lay still a long time. very irresolute what course to
take. At length I told them there would be nothing done.in my opinion,
till night: and then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might
find away to get between them and the shore, and so might use some
stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore. We waited a
great while, though very impatient for their removing; and were very
uneasy, when, alter long consultations, we saw them all start up, and
marched down toward the sea; it seems they had such dreadful appre-
hensions upon them of the danger of the place, that they resolved to go
on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on
with their intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as l perceived them to go toward the shore, I imagined it to be,
as it really was, that they had given over their search, and were for going
back again; and the captain," soon as [told him my thoughts, was
ready to sink at the apprehensions or it: but I presently thought ofa
stratagem to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a
tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little creek
westward, toward the place where the savages came on shore when
Friday was rescued, and as soon as they came to a little rising ground,at
about half a mile distance. I bade them halloo out, as loud as they could,
and wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever
they heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again; and
than keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the
others hallooed, to draw them as farinto the island, and among the woods,
as possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such ways as l directed
them. i '

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed :
and they presently heard them, and answering. ran along the shore west-
ward, toward the voice they heard, when they were presently stopped by
the creek, where the water being up, they could not get over, and called
for the boat to come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected. When
they had set themselves over, l observed that the boat being gone a good
way into the creek, and, as it were, in a harbor, within the land, they
took one of the three men out of her, to go along with them, and let! only
two in the boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the
shore. This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday
and the captain's' mate to their business, I took the rest with me. and
crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men before
they were aware; one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in
the boat. The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and
going to start up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and
knocked him down; and then calling out to him in the boat to yield, or
he was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw live men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down; bcsidc. this was, it seems, one of the three who were not
so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily
persuaded not only to yield, but afterward to join very sincerely with
us. In the meantime. Friday and the captain's mate so well managed
their business with the rest. that they drew them, by hallooing and
answering. from one hill to another, and from one wood to another, till
they not only heartily tired them. but. lelt them where they were very
sure they could not reach back to the boat before it was dark; and
indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the time they came
back to us. .

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to
fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours
after Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and
we could hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up call-
ing to those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and
complain how lame and tired they were, and notable to come any faster;
which was very welcome news to us. At length they came up to the
boat: but it is impossible to expresstheir confusion when they found the
hunt fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men
gulls. We could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were got into an enchanted island; that
either there were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or
else there were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away
and devoured. They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by
their names a great many times; but no answer. Alter some time. we
could see them, by the little light there was. run about, wringing their
hands like men in despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit
down in the boat, to rest themselves: then come ashore again, and walk
about again. and so the same thing over again. My men would ruin have
had me give them leave to fall upon them at ones in the dark: but I
was willing to take them at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as
few of them as I could; and especiallyI was unwilling to hazard the
killing of any (if our men, knowing the others were very well armed.
I resolved to wait, to see ifthey did not separate ; and, therefore. to make
sure of them, I drew my ambuaeade nearer, and ordered Friday and the
captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close to the ground as they
could. that they might not he discovered, and get as near them asthey
could pouibly, before they oti'ered to fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatawain, who was
the principal ringleader of the mutiny. and had now shown himself the
moat dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking toward them,
with two more or the crew: the captain was so eager at having this
principal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience
to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his
tongue before: but when they eame nearer, the captain and Friday, start-
ing up on their feet, let fly at them. The boatswain was killed upon the
spot; the next man was shot in the body. and fell just by him, though
he did not die till an hour or two after: and the third ran for it. At the
noise of the tire l immediately advanced with my whole army, which
was now eight men, viz: myself, generalissimo: Friday, my lieutenantp
general; the captain and his two men, and the three prisoners of war,
whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon.them. indeed, in the
dark, so that they could not see our number; and I made the man they
had lelt in the host, who was now one of us', to call them by name, to try
if I could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to
terms; which fell out just as we desired: for, indeed it was easy to think,
as their condition then was, they would be very willing to eapitulate. So
he calls out, as loud as he'could, to one of them, Tom Smith! Tom
Smith! Tom Smith answered immediately, Is that Robinson? For it
seems, he knew the voice. The other answered. Ay. ay; for God's sake,
Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men
this moment. Who must we yield to! Where are they! says Smith
again. Here they are, says he; here's our captain and fifty men with him,
have been hunting you these two hours: the boatswain is killed, Will200 anemones or

Fry is wounded. and! am a prisoner; and if you do not yield, you are
all lost.--Will they give us quarter then'! says Tom Smith, and we will
yield.--I will go ask. if )'Ou promise to yield, says Robinson: so he
asked the captain: and the captain himself then calls out. You, Smith,
you know my voice; if you lay down your arms immediately, and sub-
mit. you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins.

UPON this Will Atkins cried out. For God's sake, captain, give me
quarter; what have I done? They have all been as had as l: which, by
the way, was not true neither: for, it seems. this Will Atkins was the
first man that laid hold ot'thc captain,when they first mutinied. and used
him harbarously, in tying his hands. and giving him injurious language.
However, the captain told him he must. lay down his arms at discretion,
and trust to the governor's mercy: by which he meant me, for they all
called me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms.and begged
their lives: and I sent the man that had parleyed with them,and two
more, who bound them all; and then my great army of titty men, which,
particularly with those three, were in all but eight. came up and seized
upon them, and upon their boat; only that l kept myself and one more
out of sight for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat. and think of seizing the ship:
and as for the captain. now he had leisure to parley with them, he
expostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him.and
at length upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly
it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the
gallows. They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their
lives. As for that. he told them they were none of his prisoners, but the
commander's of the island: that they thought they had set him on shore
in a barren, uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct them.
that it was inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman ; that he
might hang them all there, if he pleased: but as he had given them all
quarter. he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with
there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by
the governor to advise to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged
in the morning.

Though all this was but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired
effect: Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercedc with
the governor for his life; and all the rest begged or him, for God's sake,
that they might not be sent to England.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was come, and
that it would he a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty
in getting possession or the ship; so I retired in the dark from them, that
they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the
captain to me: when 1 called, as at a good distance. one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, Captain. the commander
calls for you; and presently the captain replied, Tell his excellency I am
just a-coming. This more perfectly amused them, and they all believed
that the commander was just by with his titty men. Upon the captain's
coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked
wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next morning.
But. in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I
told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take
Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioncd to
the cave where the others lay. This was committed to Friday, and the
two men who came on shore with the captain. They conveyed them to
the cave, as to a prison: and it was. indeed. a dismal place, especially to
men in their condition. The others I ordered to my bower.as I called it.
of which I have given a full description; and as it was fenced in, and
they pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were upon
their behavior.

To these in the morning! sent the captain, who was to enter into a
parley with them: in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he
thought they might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise the ship.
He talked to them of the injury done him. of the condition they were
brought to, and that though the governor had given them quarter for their
lives as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to England, they
would all be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they would join in
so just an attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the governor's
engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by
men in their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and
promised, with the deepest impremtions, that they would be faithful to
him to the last drop, and that they should own theirlives to him. and
would go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a
father-as long as they lived. Well, says the captain.l must go and tell
the governor what you say,and see what I can do to bring him to consent
to it. So he brought me an account of the temper he found them in, and
that he verily believed they would be faithful. However, that we might
be very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out those
five, and tell them, that they might see he did not want men, that he
would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the governor
would keep the other two and the three that were sent prisoners to the
castle (my cave) as hostages tbr the tidelity of those the; and that if they
proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in
chains alive on the share. This looked severe, and convinced them that
the governor was in earnest: however, they had no way let! them but to
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of
the captain. to persuade <<the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first. the
captain, his mate and passenger: second, the two prisoners of the first
gang. to whom, having their character from the captain, I had given their
liberty,and trusted them with arms: third, the other two that I had kept
till now in my bower pinioned, but. on the captain's motion, had now
released: fourth, these five released at last; so that they were twelve in
all, beside the we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on
board the ship: but as for me and my man-Friday,l did not think it
was proper for us to stir, having seven men lett behind; and it was
employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with
victuals. As to the five in the eave,l resolved to keep them fast, but
Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries:
and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where
Friday was to take it.

When I showed myself to the two hostages. it was with the captain.
who told them 1 was the person the governor had ordered to look after
them; and that it was the governor's pleasure they should not stir any-
where but by my direction; that if they did. they would be fetched into
the castle, and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see
me as a governanl now appeared as another person,and spoke of the
governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like. upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difliculty before him. but to furnish his two
boats,atop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger
captain of one. with four of the men; and himseltlhis mate, and five
more, went in the other: and they contrived their business very well. for
they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they came within
call of the ship. he made Robinson hail them. and tell them they had
brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they
had found them,and the like, holding them in a chat till they came to
the ship's side; when the captain and the mate entering first, with their
arms,immediate|y knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the
butt end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men;
they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks,
and began to fasten the hatches. to keep them down that were below;
when the other host and their men entering at the fore-chains, secured
the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the
cock-room, making three men they found there prisoners. When this
was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with
three men, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain
lay, who having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a
boy had got fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate, with a crow,
split open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among
them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm,
and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The mate
calling tor help, rushed, however, into the round-house, wounded as he
was, and with his pistol shot the new captain through the head, the
bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of his ears,
so that he never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded, and
the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns
to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice
of his success. which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having sat
watching upon the shore for it till near two o'clock in the morning. Hav-
ing thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been a
day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur-
prised with the noise of a gun ; and presently starting up. I heard a man
call me by the name of Governor, Governor, and presently I knew the
captain's voice: when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood,
and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. My dear Mend
and deliverer, says he, there's your ship, for she is ail yours, and so are
we, and all that belong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within little more than half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed
her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and the weather being
iair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the little
creek: and the tide being up. the captain had brought the pinnace in near
the place where I at first landed my ralts. and so landed just at my door.
I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise: for I saw my deliver-
ance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship
just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for some
time, I was not able to answer him one word : butaa he had taken me in his
arms, l held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the ground. He per-
ceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of his pocket,
and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me.
Alter I had drank it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought
me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to
him. All this time the poor man was in asgreat ecstasy as Lonly not
under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand kind and tender
things to me, to compose and bring me to myself: but such was the
flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion; at last
it broke out into tears; and in a little while alterI recovered my speech.
O

I then took my turn. and embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced
together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of won-
ders; that such things as these were the testimonies we had of a secret
hand of Providence governing the world, and an evidence that the eye of
an infinite power could search into the remotest corner of the world, and
sand help to the miserable whenever he pleased.

When we had talked awhile, the captain told me he had brought me
some little refreshment, such as the ship afl'orded, and such as the
wretches that had been so long his masters had not plundered him of.
Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things
ashore that were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I
had been one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had
been to dwell upon the island still. First, he had brought me a case of
bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine
(the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good tobacco,
twelve good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag
of peas. and about a hundred weight of biscuit: he also brought me a
box of sugar. a box of dour,a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-
juice,.and various other things. Beside these he brought me six new
clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of
shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit of clothes
of his own, which had been worn but very little; in a word he clothed
me from head to foot. After these ceremonies were past, and alter all
his good things were brought into my little apartment. we began to consult
what was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con-
sidering whether we might venture to take them away with us or no,
especially two of them, whom he knew to be incorrigible and refractory
to the last degree: and the captain said he knew they were such rogues,
that there was no obliging them; and if he did carry them away, it must
be in irons,as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice at the first
English colony he could come at; and I found that the captain himself
was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, that if he desired it. I
would undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own
request that he should leave them upon the island. I should be very
glad of that, says the captain, with all my beam--Well, says 1,1 will
send for them up, and talk with them for you. So I caused Friday and
the two hostages. for they were now discharged, their comrades having
performed their promise: I say,! caused them to [:0 lo the cave, and
bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep
them there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in my
new habit; and now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the
captain with me,l caused the men to be brought before me, and I told
them 1 had got a full account of their villainous behavior to the captain,
and how they had run away with the ship,and were preparing to commit
farther robberies, but that Providence had enenared them in their own
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had dug tor
others. 1 let them know that by my direction the ship had been seized;
that she lay now in the road; and they might see, by and by, that their
new captain had received the reward of his villainy, and that they would
see him hanging at the yard-arm: that as to them, I wanted to know
what they had to say why! should not execute them as pirates, taken
in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt but I had
authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing
to say but this, that when they were taken, the captain promised them
their lives,and they humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I
knew not what mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to
quit the island with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain
to go for England; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to
England other than as prisoners, in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and
running away with the ship; the consequence of which. they must needs
know, would be the gallows; so that! could not tell what was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in the island; if they
desired that, as I had liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to
give them their lives, if they thought they could shift on shore. They
seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture
to stay there than be carried to England to be hanged: so 1 let! it on that
Issue.

However, the captain seemed tomeke some difliculty of it, as if he durst
not leave them there. Upon this [seemed a little angry with the captain
and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that seeing I had
otfered them so much favor. I would be as good as my word; and that it'
he did not think fit to consent to it I would set them at liberty, as I found
them; and if he did not like it, he might take them again if he could
catch them. Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly
set them at liberty. and bade them retire into the woods to the place
whence they came, and I would leave them some fire-arms, some ammu-
nition, and some directions how they should live very well, if they
thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the
captain l would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to
go on board, in the meantime. and keep all right in the ship, and send the
heat on shore next day for me; ordering him, at all events, to cause the
new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
men might see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my apart-
ment. and entered seriously into discourse with them on their circum-
stances. I told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the
captain had carried them away. they would certainly be hanged. I
showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and
told them they had nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them
I would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the
way of making it easy to them: accordingly, I gave them the whole
history of the place, and of my coming to it: showed them my fortifica-
tions, the way I made my bread, planted my oom,cured my grapes; and,
in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them the
story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to he expected, for whom
Ilelt a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common with
themselves. Here it may be noted, that the captain had ink on board,
who was greatly surprised that 1 never hit upon a way of making ink of
charcoal and water, or something else, as I had done things much more
difficult.

I lelt them my flmms, viz: five muskets, three fowling--pieces, and
three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for alter
the first year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a
description of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese: in a word, I gave them
every part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more. and some garden
seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of: alsoI gave them
the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them
be sure to sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I lelt them the next day, and went on board the
ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.
The next morning early, two of the live men came swimming to the
ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint of the other three.
begged to be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they should be mur-
dered. and begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged
them immediately. Upon this, the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but alter some dilliculty. and alter their solemn promises
of amendment. they were taken on board, and were some time alter
soundly whipped and pickled: alter which they proved very honest and
quiet fellowa.

Some time alter this, the boat was ordered on shore. the tide being up,
with the things promised to the men; to which the captain at my inter-
cession. caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they took,
and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them. by telling them
that it" it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I would not
forget them.

When I took leave of this island,I carried on board, for reliques, the
great goatvskin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots:
also I forgot not to take the money I form'erly mentioned, which had lain
by meso long useless, that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could
hardly pass for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and handled; as also
the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. And thus I left the
island, the 19th of December, as I found by the ship's account, in the year
1686, after I had been upon it eighband~twenty years, two months, and
nineteen days; being delivered from this second captivity the same day
of the month that I first made my escape in the long-boat, from among
the Moore of Ssllee. In this veuel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the nth of June, in the year 1667, having been thirty-live years
absent.

Wires] came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the world
as if I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithfulsteward,
whom lhad let! my money in trust with. was alive, but had had great
misfortunes in the world; was become a widow thesecond time, and very
low in the world. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring
hcrl would give her no trouble; but, on the contrary. in gratitude for her
former care and faithfulness to me,l relieved her as my little stock would
afford; which, at that time, would indeed allow me to do but little for
her; but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness to me;
nor did i forget her when 1 had suflicient to help her,as shall be observed
in its proper place. I went down alterward into Yorkshire; but my father
and mother were dead. and all the family extinct, except that] found two
sisters, and two of the children ofone of my brothers; and as I had been
long ago given over for dead, there had been no provision made for me:
an that. in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that the
little money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed. which I did not expect; and
thiu'was. that the master of the ship whom l had so happily delivered,
and by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very
handsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the
lives of the men, and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and some
other merchants concerned. and all together made me a very handsome
compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost two hundred
pounds sterling.
But after making several reaections upon the circumstances of my life,
and how little way this would go toward settling me in the world, I re-
solved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come by some information
of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and what was become of my
partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past given me over
for dead. With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in
April following; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly in all
these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon,I found out. by inquiry, and to my particular
satisfaction. my old friend the captain of the ship who first took me up
at sea otf the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had let! 06'
going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man, into his
ship. and who still used the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me ;
and, indeed. I hardly knew him: but I soon brought him to my remem-
brance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him
who I was. '

Aflersome passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I
inquired, you may be sure. alter my plantation and my partner. The
old man told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but
that he could assure me. that when he came away my partner was living;
but the trustees, whom I had joined with him to take cognizance of my
part. were both dead; that, however, he believed [would have a very
good account of the improvement of the plantation; for that upon the
general belief of my being cast away and drowned. my trustees had given
in the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the pro-
curator-fiscal, who had appropriated it. in case I never came to claim it,
one-third to the king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine,
to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the
Indians to the Catholic faith; but that if I appeared. or any one for me,
to claim the inheritance, it would be restored; only that the improve-
ment, or annual production. being distributed to charitable uses. could
not be restored: but he assured me that the steward of the king's revenue
from lands, and the proviedore, or steward of the monasteryI had taken
great care all along that the incumbent, that is to say. my partner. gave
every year a faithful account of the produce, of which they had duly
received my moiety. I asked him if he knew to what hight of improve-
ment he had brought the plantation, and whether he thought it might be
worth looking after; or, whether, on my going thither, I should meet
with any obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety. He
told me he could not' tell exactly to what degree the plantation was
improved, but this he knew. that my partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying his part of it; and that to the best of his remembrance,
he had heard that the king's third of my part, which was, it seems,
granted away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to
above two hundred moidore'sa year : that as to my being restored to a quiet
pomion of it. there was no question to he made of that. my partner
being alive to witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the
register of the country: also he told me, that the survivors of my two
trustees were very fair, honest people, and very wealthy; and he believed
I would not only have their assistance for putting me in possession. but
would find a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my
account, being the produce of the form while their fathers held the trust.
and before it was given up, as above; which as he remembered, was for
about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account. and
inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should
thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and
had made him, the Portuguese captain. my universal heir, etc.

He told me that was true; but'that as there was no proof of my being '
dead, he could not act as executor, until some certain account should
come of my death; and, beside, he was not willing to intermeddle with
a thing so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put in
his claim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or
alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the
ihgenio (so they called the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was
now at the Brazils,ordere to do it. But, says the old man,l have one
piece of news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you
as the rest; and that is, believing you were lost. and all the world believ-
ing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account with me. in
your name, for six or eight of the first year's profits, which I received.
There being at that time great disbursements for increasing the works,
building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much
as afterward it produced: however, says the old man,l shall give you a
true account of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed
of it.

After a few days' farther conference with this ancient friend. he brought
me an account of the first six years' income of my plantation, signed by
my partner and the merchant trustees. being always delivered in goods,
viz: tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests. beside rum, molasses. etc, which
is the consequence of a sugar-work: and I found by this account, that
every year the income considerably increased; but, as above. the disburse-
ments being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old man let
me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of
gold. beside sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco,
which were lostin his ship; he having been shipwrecked coming home
to Lisbon, about eleven years alter my leaving the place. The good man
their began to complain of his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged
to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a

18 , a
new ship. However, my old friend, says be, you shall not want a
supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall be
fully satisfied. Upon this, he pulls out an old pouch. and gives me one
hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and giving the writings of
his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which
he was a quarter part owner, and his son another, he puts them both into
my hands, for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man
to be able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all
occasions, and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me. I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that time.
and if it would not straiten him! He told me he could not say but it
might straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might
want it more than he.

Every thing the good man said was full of afl'ection, and I could hardly
refrain from tears while he spoke; in short.I took one hundred of the
moidores, and called fora pen and ink to give him areceipt for them:
then I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the
plantation,l would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterward
did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would
not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the money.l found he
was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive
what he gave me reason to expect,l would never have a penny more
from him.

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a
method to make my claim to my plantation? I told him I thought to
go over to it myself. He said I might do so, ifI pleased; but that if I
did not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to
appropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river
of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name
in a public register, with his affidavit, afiirming upon oath, that l was
alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the
planting the said plantation at first. This being regularly attested by a
notary, and a procuration aflixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter
of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and then
proposed my staying with him till an account came of the return.

Never was any thing more honorable than the proceedings upon this
procuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet from
the survivors of my trustees. the merchants, for whose account I went to
sea, in which were the following particular letters and papers inclosed:

l-'irst, There was the account current of the produce of my farm or
plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old
Portugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to he one
thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favor.

Secondly, There was the account of four years more, while they kept
the efi'ects in their hands. before the government claimed the administra-
tion, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which they called
civil death; and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increas-
ing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusa-
does, being about three thousand two hundred and forty moidoree.

Thirdly, There was the prior of Augustine's account, who had received
the profits for above fourteen years; but not being to account for what
was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he had. eight
hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed. which he acknowl--
edged to my account: as to the king's part, that refunded nothing. '

There was a letter of my partner's congratulating me very affection-
ately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was
improved, and what it produced a year; with a particular of the number
of squares or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there
were upon it, and making two-snd-twenty crosses for blessings, told me
he had said so many Ave Maria to thank the blessed Virgin.that1 was
alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of
my own; and, in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should
deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty
tender of his friendship, and that of his family; and sent me, as a
present, seven fine leopards' skins, which he had. it seems, received from
Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and who, it seems,
had made a better voyage than 1. He sent me also five chests of excel-
lent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so
large as moidorss. By the same fleet, my two merchant trustees shipped
me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of
tobacco, and the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end ofJob was better than
the beginning. It is impossible to' exprees the fluttering: of my very
heart, when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships
come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my
goods: and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my
hand. In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick: and had not the old man
run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise ofjoy had over-
set nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that. I continued very
ill, and wassome hours, till a physician being sent for,and something of
the real cause of my illness being known, he ordered me to he let blood;
after which I had relief, and grew well: but I v'erily believe. if I had not
been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of about five thousand pounds
sterlihgin money, and had an estate,as I might well call it, in the Braslla212 AD\'E.\"I'URt-:s or

of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of land,in
England: and, in a word,I was in a condition which I scarce knew how to
understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment ofit. The first
thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old captain,
who had been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in my
beginning, and honest to me at the end. I showed him all that was sent
to me; I told him, that next to the providence deeaven, which disposed
all things, it was owing to him ; and that it now lay on me to reward him,
which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first returned to him the hundred
mnidores I had received of him; then I sent for a notary, and caused
him to draw up a general release or discharge item the four hundred and
seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me. in the fullest
and flrmest manner possible. After which I caused a procuration to be
drawn. empowering him to be my receiver of the annual profits of my
plantation, and appointing my partner to account with him,and make
the returns by the usual fleets to him in my name; and a clause in the
end, being a grant of one hundred moidoresa year to him,during his
life. out of the efl'ects, and tiny moidores a year to his son after him, for
his life: and thus I requited my old man.

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to
do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands: and,
indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had in my silent state
of life in the island. where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had
nothing but what I wanted: whereas I had now a great charge upon me,
and my business was how to secure it. I had never a cave now to hide
my money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till it
grew mouldy and tarnished before anybody would meddle With it: on
the contrary,I knew not where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My
old patron,the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I
had. In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me
thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I had
settled my afl'airs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. At
first, I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and
would be just to me; but then she was in years, and but poor, and, for
aught I knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word,I had no way but to
go back to England myself, and take my elfects withme.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and there-
fore. as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction. who
had been my former benefactor. so I began to think of my poor widow,
whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her
power, my faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not only
to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in money a hundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty,
by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply: at the same
time I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they
being, though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one hav-
ing been married and left a widow: and the other having a husband not
so kind to her as he should be. But among all my relations or acquaint-
ances, I could not yet pitch upon one to whom l durst commit the gross
of my stock, that I might go awayto the Brazils, and leave things safe
behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled myself
there: for I was," it were, naturalized to the place; but I had some
little scruple in my mind about religion, which insemibly drew me back.
However, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the
present; and as! had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of
the country all the while 1 was among them, so neither did 1 yet: only
that, now and then, having of late thought more ofit than formerly, when
I began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret my
having professed myself a papist, and thought it might not be the best
religion to die with.

But.as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me Rom
going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave
my efl'ects behind me; so I resolved, at last, to go to England with it,
where, if! arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or find
some relations that would be faithml to me : and, accordingly, I prepared
to go to England with all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first, the Brazil fleet
being just going away, resolved to give answers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the prior of
St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for their just dealings, and
the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were
undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior
should direct; desiring the good padre's prayers for me, and the like. I
wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the acknowl-
edgment that so much justice and honesty called for; as for sending
them any present, they were thr above having any occasion for it. Lastly,
I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the improving
the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of the works;
giving him instructions for his future government of my part, according to
the powers I hid left with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send
whatever became due to me, till he should hear from me more particu-
larly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to come to
him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this!
added a very handsome preaent of some Italian silks for his wife and two
daughters, for such the captain's son informed me he had; with two
pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five
pieces of black baiee, and some Flanders lace of a good value.

Having thus settled my attains, sold my cargo, and turned all my eflecta
into good bills of exchange, my next ditficulty was, which way to go to
England: I had bun accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a
strange aversion to go to England by sea at that time; and though I could
give no reason {or it, yet the difliculty increased upon me so much, that
though I had once shipped my baggage, in order to go, yet I altered my
mind. and that not once, but two or three times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might besotne
of the reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own
thoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled
out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other, having
put my things on board one of them, and in the other to have agreed
with the captain; I say, two of these ships miscarried. viz: one was taken
by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the Start near Torbay,
and all the people drowned, except three; so that in either of those ves-
sels I had been made miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts. my old pilot, to whom I
communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to go to sea, but
either to go by land to the Groyne (Corunna), and cross over the Bay of
Biscay to Rochelle, (tom whence it was but an easy and safe journey by
land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid. and so
all the way by land through France. In a word, 1 was so prepossessed
against my going by sea at all. except horn Calais to Dover, that I resolved
to travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did not
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to make it more
so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant
in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked up
two more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen,
the last going to Paris only; so that in all there were six of us, and five
servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting them-
selves with one servant between two, to save the charge: and as for me,
I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant. beside my man
Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place
of a servant on the road.

In this manner! set out from Lisbon: and our company being very
well mounted and armed, we made a little troop. whereof they did me
the honor to call me captain,as well because I was the oldest man. as
because I had two servants, and, indeed, was the original of the whole
Journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so 1 shall trouble
you now with none of my land journal; butsome adventures that hap-
pened to us in this tedious and diflicult journey I must not omit.
a

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to Spain, were?
willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and to see what was
worth observing; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened
away, and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when
we came to the edge of--Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on
the way, with an account that so much snow was fallen on the French
aide of the mountains. that several travelers were obliged to come back
to Pampeluna, aner having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on.

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we fbund it so, indeed; and to me,
that had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I
could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insuflerable: nor, indeed,
was it more painful than surprising to come but ten days before out of
Old Castle, where the weather was not only warm. but very hot, and
immediately to feel a wind horn the Pyrennean mountains so very keen,
so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumbing and
perishing of our fingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all
covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or
felt before in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence, and so long, that the people
said winter was come before its time: and the roads, which were ditficult
before, were now quite impassable; for, in a word. the snow lay in some
places too thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case
in the northern countries, there was no going without being in danger of
being buried alive. every step. We stayed no less than twenty days at
Parnpeluna; when seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its
being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had been
known in the memory of man, I proposed that we should all go away to
l-'ontarabia, and there take shipping for Bourdeaux, which was a very
little voyage. But while I was considering this, there came in four
French gentlemen, who having been stopped on the French side of the
passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing
the country near the head of Languedoc. had brought them over the
mountains by such ways, that they were not much incommoded with the
snow; for where they met with snow in any quantity. they said it was
frozen hard enough to hear them and their horses. We sent for this
guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the same way with rio
hazard from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently to protect
ourselves from wild beasts; for, he said, upon these great snows it was
frequent for some wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains,
being made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with
snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as
they were, it' he would insure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which,
we were told, we were in most danger from especially on the French
side of the mountains. He satisfied us that there was no danger of that
kind in the way that we were to go: so we readily agreed to follow him,
as did also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French,
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with our guide. on the 15th
of November; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of going for-
ward. he came directly back with us on the same road that we came
from Madrid, about twenty miles; when having passed two rivers, and
come into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden,
turning to his left, he approached the mountains another way: and
though it is true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made
so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we
insensibly passed the hight of the mountains without being much en-
cumbered with the snow; and. all on a sudden, he showed us the
pleasant. fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gascony, all green and
flourishing. though, indeed, at a great distance, and we had some rough
way to pass still.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole
day and a night so fast, that we could not travel; but. he bid us be easy;
we should soon be past it all : we found, indeed, that we began to descend
every day, and to come more north than before; and so depending upon
our guide, we went on.

 

SECTION XXIX.

FRIDAY'S ENCOUNTER WITH A BEAR--ROBINSON AND HIS FELLOW TRAVELERS
A'l'I'ACXED BY A FLOL'K OP WOLVES--E18 ARRANGEMENT 0" ms AFFAIRS,
AND IABBIAGI AFTER BIS RETURN TO ENGLAND.

11' was about two hours before night, when our guide being something
before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and
alter them a bear, out of a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two
of the wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he would
have been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them
fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with that vio-
lence, that he had not time. or presence of mind enough, to draw his
pistol. but hallooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Friday
being next me.l bade him ride up, and see what was the matter. As
Icon as Friday came in sight of the man. he hallooed out as loud as the
other, Oh master! 0h master! but, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to
the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him, in the
head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for be
having been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon
him. but went close up to him and shot him, as above; whereas, any
other of us would have fired at a farther distance. and have perhaps either
missed the wolf, or endangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed,
it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we
heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,
rednubled by the echo of the mountains. appeared to us as if there had
been a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a
few as that we had no cause of apprehensions; however," Friday had
killed this wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him
immediately, and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily
fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his
teeth. But the man was most hurt; for the raging creature had hit him
twice, once in the arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and
though he had made some defense, he was just as it were tumbling down
by the disorder of his horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all mended
our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very difficult, would
give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as we came clear of
the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the
case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.

But never was a tight managed so hardly, and in such a surprising
manner, as that which followed, between Friday and the bear, which
gave us all, though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the
greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature,
and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has
two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions: first,
as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt
them, except they first attack him, unless he be excessive hungry, which
it is probable might now be the case, the ground being covered with
show). if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but
then you must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road.
for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of his way for
a prince; nay. if you are really atraid, your best way is to look another
way, and keep going on; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and
look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an atl'ront; but if you throw or
tow any thing at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick
as big as your finger, he thinks himselfabused, and sets all other business

19
asideto pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honor ;---
this is his first quality: the next is, if he be once afl'ronted. he will never
leave you, night nor day, till he has his revenge, but follows, at a good
round rate. till he ove kes you.

My man Friday he delivered our guide, and when we came up to him,
he was helping him ofl' from his horse, for the man was both hurt and
frightened, when, on a sudden we espied the bear some out of the wood,
and a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We
were all a little surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw him,
it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's countenance: Oh, Oh,
Oh! says Friday, three times, pointing to him; 0h master! you give me
te leave, me shakee to hand with him; me makes you good laugh.

.1 was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased: You fool, says I. he
will eat you up.--Eateo me up! eatee me up! says Friday, twice over
again; me eaten him up; me makee you good laugh: you all stay here,
me show you good laugh. So down he sits, and gets of his boots in a
moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear,
and which he had in his pocket), gives my other servant his horse, and
with his gun away he flew, swift like the wind.

The hear was walking softly on. and odered to meddle with nobody,
till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could under-
stand him, Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me speakee with you. We fol-
lowed at a distance; for now being come down on the Gaecony side of the
mountains, we were entereda vast great forest, where the country was plain

land pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with him
quickly, and takes up a great stone and throws it at him, and hits him
just on the head, but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it
against a wall; but it answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of
fear that he did it purely to make the bear follow him, and show us some
laugh. as he called it. As soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he
turns about, and comes alter him, taking devilish long strides. and shuf~
tling on at a strange rate. so as would have put a horse to a middling gallop;
away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he ran toward us for help;
so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear. and deliver my man;
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing the hear back upon us,
when he was going about his own business another way; and especially

I was angry that he had turned the bear upon us. and then run away;
and I called out, You dog. is this your making us laugh! Come away,
and take your horse. that we may shoot the creature. He heard me, and
cried out; No shoot, no shoot; stand still. and you get much laugh: and
as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear'a one, he turned ona
sudden. on one side of us. and seeing a great oak tree fit for his purpose,
he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up
the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground at about five or six yards
from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon eame to the tree, and we fol-
lowed at a distance: the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to
it, but let it lie. and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing likea eat,
though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I thought it,
of my man. and could not for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till
seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him.

When we eame to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end
of a large branch, and the bear got about half way to him. As soon as
the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker--Ha!
says he to us, now you see me teaches the bear dance: so he hills a-jump-
ing and shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood
still, and began to look behind him, to see how he should get back; then,
indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a
great deal; when seeing him stand still, he calls out to him again, as if
he had supposed the bear could speak English, What, you come no
farther! pray you come farther: so he left jumping and shaking the tree;
and the bear, just as it' he understood what he said, did come a little far-
ther; then he fell a-jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We
thought now was a good time to knock him on the head, and called to
Friday to stand still. and we would shoot the bear: but he cried out
earnestly. Oh prey! 0h pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then; he would
have said by and by. However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much, and the bear stood so ticklish. that We had laughing enough, but
still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for first we thought he
depended upon shaking the bear ofi'; and we found the hear was too cun-
ning for that too; for he would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
but clings fast with his great broad claws and feet, so that we could not
imagine what would be the end of it, and what the jest would be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the bear cling fast to
the bough. and that he would not be persuaded to come any farther,
Well, well, says Friday, you no come farther, me go ; you no come to me,
me come to you: and upon this. he goes out to the smaller end of the
bough, where it would bond with his weight, and gently lets himself down
by it. sliding down the bough, till he eame near enough to jump down
on his feet, and away he runs to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.
Well, said I to him, Friday, what will you do now! Why don't you
shoot him l--No shoot, says Friday. no yet; me no shoot now, me no
kill; me Stay, give you one more laugh: and indeed, so he did, as you
will see presently; for when the bear saw his enemy was gone, he comes
back from the bough where he stood. but did it mighty cautiously. look-
ing behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into the body
of the tree; then with the same hinder-end foremost, he came down the
tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very
leisurely. At this juncture, and just before he could set his hlnd-l'oot on
theground, Friday stepped up close to him, clapped the muzzle of his
piece into his ear, and shot him dead. Then the rogue turned about, to see
if we did not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he
falls a-laughing himself very loud. So we kill hear in my country, says
Friday. So you kill them! says 1 : why, you have no guns.--No, says he,

' no gun, but shoot great much long arrow. This was a good diversion to

us; but we were still in a wild place. and our guide very much hurt. and
what to do we hardly knew: the howling of wolves ran much in my
head; and. indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa,
of which I have said something already, I never heard any thing that
filled me with so much horror.

These things and the approach of night, called us 06', or else, as Friday
would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this
monstrous creature ofl', which was worth saving; but we had near three
leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we let! him, and went for-
ward on our journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and
dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures, as we heard
afterward, were come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by
hunger to seek for food, and had done a great deal of mischiefin the villages,
where they surprised the country people, killed a great many oftheir sheep
and horses. and some people too. We had one dangerous place to pass,
of which our guide told us, if there were more wolves in the country we
should find them there; and this was a small plain, surrounded with woods
on every side, and a long narrow defile. or lane, which we were to pass to get
through the wood, and then we should come to the village where we were
to lodge. It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first
wood, and a little after sunset when we came into the plain: so we met
with nothing in the first wood, except that, in a little plain within the
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great wolves
cross the road, full speed, one alter another. as if they had been in chase
of some prey. and had it in view; they took no notice of us, and were
gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon this our guide, who, by the
way, was but a faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for
he believed there were more wolves a-coming. We kept our arms ready.
and our eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood. which was near halt'a league. and entered the plain. As soon
as we came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us:
the first object we met with was a dead horse, that is to say, a poor
horse which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work,
we could not say eating of him, but picking ofhis bones rather: for they
had eaten up all the flesh before. We did not think lit to disturb them at
their feast; neither did they take much notice 01 us. Friday would have
let fly at them. but I would not sufl'er him by any means; for 1 found we
were like to have more business upon our hands than we were aware of.
We were not gone half over the plain, when we began to hear the wolves
howl in the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after
we saw about a hundred coming on directly toward us. all in a body, and
most of them in a line,as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced
officers. I scarce lmew in what manner to receive them, but found to
draw ourselves in a close line was the only way: so we formed in a mo-
meat: but that we might not have too much interval, I ordered that only
every other man should fire, and that the others who had not fired should
stand ready to give them a second volley immediately, if they continued
to advance upon us: and then that those who had fired at first should not
pretend to load their fusees again, but stand ready every one with a
pistol, for we were all armed with a fuses and a pair of pistols each man;
so we were. by this method. able to tire six volleys, half of us at a time:
however, at present we had no necessity; for upon firing the first volley,
the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well with the noise as with
the tire; four of them, being shot in the head. dropped; several others
were wounded, and Went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow. I
found they stopped. but did not immediately retreat; whereupon,
remembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures were terri-
fied at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as loud as
we could; and I found the notion not altogether mistaken; for upon our
shout, they began to retire, and turn about. I then ordered a second vol-
ley to be fired in their rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they
went to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again; and
that we might lose no time, we kept going: but we had but little more
than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a
terrible noise in the same wood, on our lelt, only that it was farther on-
ward, the same way we were to go.

The night was coming on.and the light began to be dusky,which made
it worse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of those hellish creatures; and on a
sudden. we perceived two or three troops of wolves. one on our left, one
behind us,and one in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with
them: however, as they did not fall upon us. we ltept our way forward,
as fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being very rough,
was only a good hard trot. In this manner we came in view of the
entrance of a wood, through which we were to pass, at the farther side
of the plain: but we were greatly surprised, when coming near the lane
or pass, we saw a confused number of wolves standing just at the
entrance. On a sudden. at another opening of the wood, we heard the
noise of a gun. and looking that way, out rushed a horse with a saddle
and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves
after him, full speed; indeed, the horse had the heels of them, but as we
supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted not but they
would get up with him at last; no question but they did.

But here we had a most horrible sight; for riding up to the entrance
where the horse came out. we found the carcasses of another horse and
of two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures; and one of the men
was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gun. for there lay a gun
just by him fired off; but as to the man. his head and the upper part of
his body were eaten up. This tilled us with horror, and we knew not
what course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon. for they gathered
about us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were
three hundred of them. It happened very much to our advantage, that
at the entrance into the wood, but a little way from it, there lsy some
large timber trees. which had been cut down the summer before, and I
suppose lay there for carriage. I drew my little troop in among those
trees. and placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree,I advised them
all to alight, and keeping that tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in
a triangle or three fronts, inclosing our horses in the center. We did so.
and it was well we did; for never was a more furious charge than the
creatures made upon us in this place. They came on with a growling
kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber. which, as I said. was our
breastwork. as if they were only rushing upon their prey: and this fury
of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our horses
behind us. [ordered our men to fire as before, every other man; and
they took their aim so sure. that they killed several of the wolves at the
first volley; but there was a noccfiity to keep a-continual firing. for they
came on like devils, those behind pushing on those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our fusees. we thought they
stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off; but it was but a
moment, for others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our
pistols: and I believe in these four tirings we had killed seventeen or
eighteen of them, and tamed twice as many, yet they came on again. I
was loth to spend our shot too hastily; so [called my servant. not my
man Friday, for he was better em played, for, with the greatest dexterity
imaginable, he had charged my fusee and his own while we were
engaged; but, as l said,l called my other man, and giving him a horn
of powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it
be a large train. He did so: and had but just time to get away, when
the wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I. snapping an
uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire: those that were upon
the timber were scorched with it ; and six or seven of them fell, or rather
jumped in among us, with the force and fright of the fire; we dispatched
these in on instant. and the rest were so frightened with the light. which

draw back a little; upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in
one volley, and after that we gave a shout: upon this the wolves turned
tail, and we ssllicd immediately upon near twenty lame ones, that we
found struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with our swords,
which answered our expectation; for the crying and howling they made
was better understood by their fellows; so that they all fled and left us.

We- had, first and last, killed about threescore of them; and had it
been daylight, we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus
cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go.
We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the woods as we went,
several times. and sometimes we fancied we saw some of them, but the
snow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain: in about an hour more we
came to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible
fright, and all in arms: for, it seems, the night before, the wolves and
some beers had broke into the village, and put them in such terror, that
they were obliged to keep guard night and day, but especially in the
night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed, their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much
with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we
were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to Thoulouse, where we
found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no
wolves, nor any thing like them : but when we told our story at
Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great forest at the foot of the mountains,especially when the snow lay
on the ground; but they inquired much what kind of a guide we had
got, who would venture to bring us that way in such a severe season;
and told us it was surprising we were not all devoured. When we told
them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle, they
blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was any to one but we had been
all destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves
so furious, seeing their prey; and that, at other times, they are really
afraid of a gun; but being excessive hungry, and raging on that account,
the eagerness to come to the horses had made them senseless of danger;
and that if we had not, by the continued fire,and at last by the stratagem
of the train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that
we had been torn to pieces: whereas, had we been content to have sat
still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the
horses so much for their own, when men were on their backs. as other-
wise; and withsl they told us, that at last, if we had stood all together,
and left our horses. they would have been so eager to have devoured
them, that we might have come otf safe, especially having our fire-arms
in our hands, and being so many in number. For my part, I was never
sosensible of danger in my life; for seeing above three hundred devils
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having nothing to
shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and. as it was, I
believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again; I think I would
much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet
with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through
France, nothing but what other travelers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than I can. I traveled from Thonlouse to Paris.
and without any considerable slay came to Calais, and landed safe at
Dover, the 14th of January, after having a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the center of my travels. and had in a little time all
my new discovered estate safe about me: the bills of exchange which I
brought with me having been very currently paid.

My principal guide and privy counselor was my good ancient widow;
who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her. thought no pains too
much,nor care too great. to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely
with every thing. that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my
ell'ects: and. indeed,l was very happy front the beginning, and now to
the end. in the unspotted integrity of this good gentlcwoman.

I new resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils. if I could

'find means. For this purpose, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon: who
having oll'ered it to the two merchants. the survivors of my trustees. who
lived in the Brazils. they accepted the ofl'er. and remitted thirty-three
thousand pieces of eight to a correspondent of theirs at Lisbon. to pay
for it. Having signed the instrument ofsale. and sent it to my old friend,
he remitted me hills of exchange for thirty-two thousand eight hundred
pieces of eight for the estate. reserving the payment of a hundred moi-
dorcsa year to himself. during his life, and titty moidores afterward to
his son for life. which I had promised them.

Though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep the
country out of my head; nor could I resist the strong inclination I had
to see my island. My true friend, the widow. earnestly dissuaded me
from h, and so far prevailed with me. that. for almost seven years, she
prevented my running abroad; during which time I took my two
nephews. the children of one of my brothers, into my care: the eldest
having something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman. and gave him a
settlement of some addition to his estate, after my decease. The other
I put out to a captain of a ship: and after five years. finding him a sensi-
ble. hold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship. and sent
him to sea. and this young fellow alterward drew me in, as old as I was,
to farther adventures mysell.

In the meantime. I in part settled myself here; for. first of all,l
married. and that not either to my disadvantage or dlMlleflcllon, and
had three children. two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying. and
my nephew coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain. myinclination to go abroad, and his importunity prevailed, and engaged me
to go in_ his ship asa private trader to the East Indies: this was in the
year 1694.

But these things. with some very surprising incidents in some new
adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a further
account of.

That homely proverb used on so many occasions in England, viz:
" That what is bred in the bone, will not go out of the flesh," was never
more verified than in the story of my life. Any one would think, that
alter thirty-five years affliction, and a variety of unhappy circumstances,
which few men, if any, ever went through before, and alter near seven
years ofpeace and enjoyment in the fullness of all things. grown old. and
when. if ever, it might be allowed me to have had experience of every
state of middle life, and to know which was most adapted to makea
man complewa happy; I say, after all this, any one would have thought
that the native propensity to rambling, which I gave an account of in
my first setting out in the world to have been so predominant in my
thoughts. should be worn out, the volatile part be fully evacuated, or at
least condensed, and I might, at sixty-one years of age, have been a little
inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing life and fortune any

more.
Nay, farther. the common motive of foreign adventures was taken

away in me: for I had no fortune to make: Ihad nothing toseek: it'l
had gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had already
sumcient for me, and for those I had to leave it to: and that Ihad was
visibly increasing: for havim no great family,l could not spend the in-
come of what I had, unless I would set up for an expensive way ofliving,
such as a great family. servants, equipage. gayety, and the like, which
were things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing
indeed to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it
increase daily upon my hands. Yet all these things had no effect upon
me, or at least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical distemper. In
particular, the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the
colony I let! there, ran in my head continually. I dreamed of it all
night, and my imagination ran upon it all day: it was uppermost in all
my thoughts; and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it that
I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing could remove it out of my
mind: it even broke so violently into all my discourses, that it made my
conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else: all my discourses
ran into it even to impertinence, and I saw it in myself.228 ennui-ones or

I Have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all the stir
people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions, is owing to the
strength of imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in their
minds; that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost. walk-
ing, and the like: that people's poring affectionately upon the past
conversation of their deceased tiiends,so realises it to them, that they
are capable of fancying, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that
they see them. tallr to them, and are answered by them, in truth, there
is nothing but shadow and vapor in the thing, and they really know
nothing of the matter.

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any such things
as real apparitions, spectres. or walking people after they are dead; or
whether there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that kind, more
than the product of vapors, sick minds, and wandering fancies: but this
I know, that my imagination worked up to such a night, and brought me
into such excess of vapors. or what else I may call it. that i actually
supposed myself often upon the spot, at my old castle, behind the trees;
saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father. and the reprobate sailors I left
upon the island; nay,l fancied i talked with them, and looked at them
steadily, though [was broad awake. as at persons just before me; and
this] did till I often frightened myself with the images my fancy repre-
sented to me. One time, in my sleep.l had the villainy of the three
pirate sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and l-'riday's
father. that it was surprising; they told me how they barbarously
attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set tire to the
provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them:
things that I had never heard of, and that indeed were never all of them
true in fact; but it was so warm in my imagination, and so realized to"
me, that, to the hourl saw them, l could not he persuaded but that it
was. or would be true: also how I resented it, when the Spaniard com-
plained to me; and how I brought them tojustice. tried them before me,
and ordered them all three to be hanged. What there was really in this,
shall be seen in its place: for however I came to form such things in my
dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was.I
say, much of it true. I own, that this dream had nothing in it literally
and specifically true; but the general part was so true. the base villainous
behavior ofthesa three hardened rogues was such, and had been so much
worse titan all I can describe, that the dream had too much similitude o!
the fact; and as I would alterward have punished them severely. so, if I
had hanged them all,I had been much in the right, and even should have
been justified both by the laws of God a'nd man. But to return to'my
story: In this kind or temper I lived some years: I'hsd no enjoyment of
my life. no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversions. but what had some-
thing or other of this in it; so that my wife. who saw my mind wholly
bent upon it. told me very seriously one night. that she believed there
was some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had
determined me to go thither again; and that she found nothing hindered
my going, but my being engaged to a wife and children. She told me,
that it was true she could not think or parting with me; but as she was
assured. that if she was deed it would be the first thing] would do: so,
as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above, she would not
be the only obstruction; for, if I thought fit. and resolved to go--l-Iere
she found me very intent upon her words. end that I looked very earnestly
st her.so that it a little disordered her. and she stopped. I asked her
why she did not go on, and say out what she was going to say'! But I
perceived that her heart was too full, and some tears stood in her eyes
Speak out, my dear. said I; are you willing I should go! No, says she
very affectionately. I am or iron: willing; but if you are resolved to go
says she, and rather than I would be the only hinderance, I will go with
you: for though 1 think it a most preposterous thing for one of your
years. and in your condition. yet, if it must be. said she. again weeping, I
would not leave you; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there is no
resisting it: and if Heaven make it your duty to go. it will also make
it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not
obstruct it.

This affectionate behavior of my wil'e's brought me a little out of tho
vapors. and I began to consider what I was doing; lcorrected my wander<
ing fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately, what business I had
alter threescore years, and alter such a life of tedious sufi'erings and
disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner; I say. what businefl
had I to rush into new hazards. and put myself upon adventures fit only
for youth and poverty to run into!

With these thoughts I considered my new engagement; that I had a
wife, one child born. and my wife then great with child of another; thst
I had all the world could give me, and had no need to seek hazard for
gain; that I was declimng in years, and ought to think rather of leaving
what I had gained, than of seeking to increaseit: that as to what my
wife had said of its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be
my duty to go,I had no notion of that: so, alter many of these eogi-
tatIone, I struggled with the power of my imagination. reasoned myself
out of it, as I believe people may always do in like eases ifthey will: and,
in a word, I conquered it; composed myself with such arguments, as
occurred to my thoughts, and which my present condition furnished me
plentifully with; and particularly," the most effectual method, I re-
solved to divert myself with other things, and to engage in some business
that might effectually tie me up flom any more excursions of this kind;
for I found that thing return upon me chiefly when l was idle, and had
nothing1o do, nor any thing of moment immediately before me. To this
purpose I bought a little farm in the county of Bedford. and resolved to
remove myself thither. I had a little convenient house upon it; and the
lend about it, I found, was capable of great improvement; and it was many
ways suited to my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing,
planting, end improving of land ; and particularly, being an inland country
I was removed from convening among sailors. end things relating to the
remote parts or the world.

In a word, I went down to my term, settled my family. bought me
plows, barrows, a cart, wagon, horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting
seriously to work, became, in one half-year, a mere country-gentlemen:
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants. cultivating
the ground. inclosing, planting, etc.; end I lived, eel thought, the most
agreeable life that nature was capable of directing, or that a man always
bred to misfortunes was capable of retreating to.

I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was limited by no
articles; [could pull up or cut down asl pleased: whatl planted was
for myself, and whet 1 improved was for my family ; end having thus left
08 the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least discomfort in any part
of life as to this world. Now I thought indeed that I enjoyed the middle
state of life which my father so earnestly recommended to me, and lived
a kind of heavenly life, something like what is described by the poet,
upon the subject of a country life--

as

 

Free from vices. free from care.
Age has no pain. and youth no snare."

But, in the middle of all this felicity,one blow from unseen Providence
unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach upon me inevitable and
incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a deep relapse of the
wandering disposition, which,as I may say, being born in my very blood,
soon recovered its'hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent dis-
temper, eame on with an irresistible force upon me, so that nothing
could make any more impression upon me. This blow was the loss of
my wife. it is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife,
give a character of her particular virtues. and make my court to the sex
by the flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay
of all my atfairs, the center of all my enterprises. the engine, that, by her
prudence, reduced me to that happy compass l was in, item the most
extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in my head, as above, and
did more to guide my rambling genius than a mother's tears, e hther's
instrueuonea friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could
do. I was happy in listening to her entreeties; and in being moved by
her tears, and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world by
the loss of her.

When she was gone. the world looked awkwardly round me. I was as
much a stranger in it, in my thoughts,as l was in the Brezils, when I
first went on shore there; and as much alone. except as to the assistance
of servants,as [was in my island. I knew neither what to think nor
what to do. 1 saw the world busy around me; one part laboring for
bread, another pert squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures,
equally miserable, because the end they proposed still fled from them;
for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped up
work for sorrow and repentance: and the men of labor spent their
strength in daily struggling for breed to maintain the vital strength they
labored with: so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to
work, and working but to live," if daily bread were the only end of
wearisome life, end a wearisome life the only occasion of daily breed.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the island;
where I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not went it: end
bred no more goats, because I had no more use for them; where the
money lay in the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had scarce the favor to
be looked upon in twenty years.

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have done, and as
reason and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to search
further than human enjoyments fora full felicity: and that there was
something which certainly was the reason and end of life, superior to all
these things, and which was either to he possessed, or at least hoped for,
on this side the grave.

But my sage counselor was gone; I was like a ship without a pilot,
that could only run afore the wind: my thoughts ran all away again into
the old etliair, my head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign
adventures; and all the pleasant, innocent amusements of my term, my
garden. my cattle. and my family, which before entirely posse-ed me,
were nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music to one thet has
no ear. or food to one that has no taste: in a word. I resolved to leave ofl
housekeeping, let my firm, and return to London: and in a few months
after. I did so.

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; I had
no relish for the place, no enjoyment in it, nothing to do but to saunter
about like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless
in God's creation, and 'it is not one hrthing's matter to the rest of his
kind whether he be dead or alive. This also was the thing which,,of all
the circumstances of life. was the most my aversion. who hed been all
my days used to an active life; and I would often say to myself, A state
of idleness is the very dregs of life; and indeed I thought I was much
more suitably employed when I was twenty-six days making me a deal
board.

, It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom.
as I have observed before,l had brought up to the sea, and had made
him pomlnander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to
Bilboa, being the first he had made. He came to me, and told me that
some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a
voyage for them to the East Indies and to China.aa private traders.--
And now. uncle, says he, if you will go to sea with me. I will engage to
land you upon your old habitation in the island; for we are to touch at
the Brazils.

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of the
existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second causes with
the ideas of things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved, and
not communicated to any in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thought to
say, when that very morning. before he came to me, I had, in a great deal
of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circumstances
in my mind, come to this resolution, viz: that I would go to Lisbon. and
consult with my old sea-captain; and so. if it was rational and practi-
cable. I would go and see the island again, and see what was become of
my people there. Ihad pleased myself with the thoughts of pcopling
the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence. getting a patent for the
possession, and I knew not what; when. in the middle of all this, in
comes my nephew. as l have said, with his project of carrying me thither
- in his way to the East Indies.

l paused awhile at his words, and, looking steadily at him, What devil,
laid I, sent you on this unlucky errand! My nephew stared," if he
had been frightened. at first; but perceiving that 1 was not much dis-
pleased with the proposal. he recovered himself. I hope it may not be
an unlucky proposal, sir, says he: I dare say you would be pleased to see
your new colony there. where you once reigned with more felicity than
most of your brother-monarchs in the world.

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that is to say, the
prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so much, that I told
him, in a few words. if he agreed with the merchants I would go with
him: but] told him I would not promise to go any farther than my own
island. Why, sir, says be, you don't want to be left there again, I hope!
Why, said Lean you not take me up on your return? He told me it would
not be possible to do so; that the merchants would never allow him to come
that way with a laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of
his way, and might be three or four. Beside, air, if l should miscarry,
said he, and not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the con-
dition you Were in before.

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for it; which
was, tocarrya framed sloop on board the ship, which being taken in
pieces, and shipped on board the ship, might, by the help or some car-
penters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the island,
and finished, lit to go to sea, in a few days.

I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunities of my nephew
joined so ell'ectuslly with my inclination, that nothing could oppose me;
on the other hand, my wife being dead, I had nobody concerning them--
selves so much for me as to persuade me to one way or the other, except
my ancient good friend. the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to
consider my. years, my easy circumstances. and the needless hazards of a
long voyage; and, above all, my young children. But it was all to no
purpose ;--I had an irresistible desire to the voyage; and I told her I
thought there was something so uncommon in the impressions I had
upon my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting Provi-
dence if I should attempt to stay at home: after which she ceased her
expostulations, and joined with me, not only in making provision for my
voyage, but also in settling my femily-afl'airs for my absence, and provid-
ing for the education of my children.

In order to this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had in such a
manner for my children, and placed it in such hands, that I was perfectly
easy and satisfied they would have justice done them. whatever might
befall me: and for their education, I left it wholly to the widow, with a
eufllcient maintenance to herself for her care: all of which she richly
deserved, for no mother could have taken more care in their education,
or understood it better: and as she lived till I came home, I alao lived to
thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January, 1894-55
and l, with my man I-'riday,went on board in the Downs the am: having,
beside that sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of
all kinds of necessary things for my colony; which, if I did not find in
good condition, I resolved to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants. whom I purposed to place
there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there. upon my account,
while I staid, and either to leave them there, or carry them forward, so
they would appear willing; particularly I carried two carpenters, a smith
and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade. and was
also a general mechanic; for he was dextrous at making wheels, and hand-
rnills to grind corn, was a good tanner, and a good pot maker; he also
made any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of wood; in a word,
we called him our Jul: of all trades. With these I carried a tailor, who
had ottered himself to go a paflenger to the East Indies with my ne-
phew, but alterward consented to stay on our new plantation; and
proved a most necessary, handy fellow," could be desired, in many other
businesses beside that of his trade: tor, as I observed formerly, necessity
arms us for all employments.

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I had not kept account of the
particulars, consisted of a suflicient quantity of linen, and some English
thin stuffs. for clothing the Spaniards that! expected to and there; and
enough of them, as, by my calculation, might comfortably supply them
for seven years: if I remember right, the materials I carried for clothing
them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could
want for wearing, amounted to above two hundred pounds, including
some beds, bedding, and household stufl'. particularly kitchen utensils,
with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, etc, and near a hundred pounds more
in iron works, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every
necessary thing I could think of.

! carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and nieces; beside some
pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of
lead, and two pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not what time
and what extremities I was providing for, 1 carried a hundred barrels of
powder, beside swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and
halberds: so that, in short, we had'a large magazine of all sorts ofstores:
and I made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more than he
wanted for his ship. to leave behind it there was occasion; that. when we
came there, we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies:
and,indeed,l at first thought there would be need enough for all,snd
much more," we hoped to maintain our possession of the island; as
shall be seen in the course of that story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet
with; and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the reader,
who perhaps may be impatient to hear how matters went with my
colony: yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad weather, happened
on the first setting out, which made the voyage longer than I expected at
first: and I, who had never made but one voyage, viz: my first voyage to
Guinea, in which I might be said to come back again as the voyage was
at first designed. began to think the same ill fate attended me; and that I
was born to be never contented with being on shore, and yet to be always
unfortunate at sea.

Contrary winds first put us tothe northward, and we were obliged to
put in at Galway in lreland, where we lay wind-bound two-and-twenty
days; but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that provisions were
here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that while we lay
here, 'we never touched the ship's stores, but rather added to them.
Here,also, I took in several live hogs, and two cows. with their calves;
which I resolved, it' I had a good passage, to put on shore in my island;
out we found occasion to dispose otherwise or" them.

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very fair
gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be about the 20th
of February, in the evening late, when the mate, having the watch, came
into the round-house, and told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun
fired: and while he was telling us of it,a boy came in, and told us the
boatswain heard another. This made us all run out upon thequerter-declr,
where, for awhile, we heard nothing; but in a few minutes we sawa
very greet light, and found that there was some very terrible fire at a dis-
tance: immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all
agreed, that there could be no land that way in which the fire showed
itself, no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W.
Upon this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; end as, by
our hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded that it could not
be far off, we stood directly toward it, and were presently satisfied we
should discover it, because, the Earther we sailed, the greater the light
appeared; though, the weather being hazy, we could not perceive any
thing but the light for a while. In about half an hour's sailing, the wind
being fair {or us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a
little, we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the
middle of the sea.

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all
acquainted with the persons engaged in it: 1 presently recollected my
former circumstances, and in what condition I was in, when taken by the
Portuguese captain; and how much more deplorable the circumstances
of the poor creatures belonging to that ship must be, if they had no other
ship in company with them. Upon this, I immediately ordered that five
guns should be fired, one soon after another; that if possible, we might
give notice to them that there was help for them at hand, and that they
might endeavor to save themselves in their boat; for though we could see
the flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship drove,
waiting for daylight; when on. a sudden. to our great tenor, though we
had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air; and immediately,
that is to say, in a few minutes, all the fire was out, that is to say, the rest

of the ship sank. This was a terrible and indeed an afflicting sight. for
the salte of the poor men: who, 1 concluded, must be either all destroyed
in the ship. or be in the utmost distress in their boat, in the middle of the
ocean; which. at present, by reason it was dark, I could not see. How-
ever, to direct them as well as I could. I caused lights to be hung out in
all parts of the ship where we could. and which we had lanterns fur, and
kept firing guns all the night long; letting them know, by this, that there
was I ship not far off.

About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered the ship's hosts by
the help of our perspective glasses; found there were two of them, both
throngsd with people, and deep in the water. We perceived they rowed,
the wind being against them ; that theynw our ship, and did their utmost
to make us see them.

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them,
and hung a wait out, as a signal for them to come on board; and then
made more sail.standing directly to them. In little more than half an
hour we came up with them ; and, in a word. took them all in, being no
less than sixty-four men, women, and children; for there were a great
many passengers.

Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant-ship of three
hundred tons, home-bound for Quebec, in the river of Canada. The
master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship; how the tire
began in the steerage, by the negligence of the swersman; but on his
crying out for help. was, as everybody thought, entirely put out; but
they soon found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten into some
part of the ship so dfliicult to come at, that they could not elfectually
quench it; and afterward getting in between the timbers, and within
the ceiling of the ship. it proceeded into the. hold, and mastered all the
skill and all the application they were able to exert.

They had no more to do then, but get into their boats, which, to their
great comfort, were pretty large; being their long-boat, and a great
ahallop, beside a small skill'. which was of no great service to them, other
than to get some fresh water and provisions into her, after they had
secured their lives from the tire. They had, indeed, small hope of their
lives by getting into these boats, at that distince from any land; only. as
they said well, that they were escaped from the tire, and a possibility
that some ship might happen to be at sea. and might take them in. They
had sails, ours. and a compass; and were preparing to make the best of
their way back to Newfoundland. the wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew
an easy gale at s. E. by E. They had as much provision and water. as
with sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might support them
about twelve days; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no con-
trary winds, the captain said he hoped he might get to the Banks of New-
foundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they
might go on shore. But there were so many chances against them in all
these cases, such as storms, to overset and founder them; rains and cold,
to henumb and perish their limbs; contrary winds. to keep them out
and starve them; that it must have been next to miraculous if they had
escaped. _ '

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and ready
to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they were on a
sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and alter that {our
more; these were the five guns which I caused to be fired at first seeing
the light. This revived their hearts, and gave them the notice, which, as
above,ldesired it should,viz: that there was a ship at hand for their
help. It was upon the hearing of these guns, that they took down their
masts and sails: the sound coming fiom the windward, they resolved to
lie by till morning. Some time after this, hearing no more guns. they
find three muskets, one a considerable while alter another; but these,
the wind being contrary, we never heard.

Some time alter that again, they were still more agreeably surprised
with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns which,as I have said. I
caused to be tired all the rest of the night: this set them to worlr with
their oars, to keep their boats ahead, at least, that we might the sooner
come up with them; and. at last, to their inexpressihle joy, they found
we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange
ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor delivered people ran
into, to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance
Grief and fear are easily described: sighs, tears, groans, and a very few
motions of the head and hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagancies in it: there
were some in tears; some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had
been in the greatest agonies of sorrow ; some stark raving, and downright
lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others wring-
ing their hands; some were dancing, some singing, some laughing, more
crying; many quite dumb, not able to speak a word; others sick and
vomiting; several swooning, and ready to faint; and a few were crossing
themselves, and giving God thanks.

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that were
thankml anerward, but the passion was too strong (Br them at first. and
they were not able to master it: they were thrown into ecstasies, and a
kind of fienzy; and it was but a very few that were composed and serious
in their joy.

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the particu-
lar circumstance of that nation they belonged to; I mean the French,
whose temper, is allowed to be more volatile. more passionate, and more
sprightly, and their spirits more fluid. than inother nations. I am not
philosopher enough to determine the cause: but nothing I had ever seen
before came up to it. The ecstasics poor Friday. my trusty savage. was
in, when he found his father in the boat, came the nearer to it; and the
surprise of the master and his two companions, whom I delivered from
the villains that set them on shore in the island. came a little way toward
it: but nothing was to compare to this, either that 1 saw in Friday, or
anywhere else in my life.

It is flirther observable, that these extravagancies did not show them-
selves. in that difl'erent manner I have mentioned, in dlll'eront persons
only; but all the variety would appear, in a short succession of moments,
in one and the same person. A man that we saw this minute dumb. and
as it were stupid and confounded, would the next minute be dancing and
hallooing like an antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or
pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet, Iilrea
madman; in a few moments alter that, we would have him all in tears,
then sick, swooning, and. had not immediate help been had, he would in
a few moments have been dead; and thus it was, not with one or two, or
ten or twenty, but with the greatest part of them: and, if I remember
right, our surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty of them.

There were two priests among them, one an old man. and the other a
young man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was the
worst. As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself
safe, he dropped down stone-dead. to all appearance; not the least sign
of life could be perceived in him: our surgeon immediately applied
proper remedies to recover him.and was the only man in the ship that
believed he was not dead. At length he opened a vein in his arm,having
first chafed and rubbed the part. so as to warm it as much as possible:
upon this, the blood, which only dropped at first, flowing freely, in three
minutes after the man opened his eyes; and a quarter of an hour after
that he spoke, grew better, and in a little time, quite well. Alter the
blood was stopped. he walked about; told us he was perfectly well; took
a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him,and was what we call
come to himself. About a quarter of an hour after this, they came
running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding is French
woman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad. It
seems he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his
mind, and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy; his spirits whirled
about faster than the vessels could convey them. the blood grew hot and
feverish.and the man was as lit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was
in it: the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave
him something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after some time,
operated upon him, and he awoke next morning perfectly composed
and well.

The young priest behaved with great command of his passions, and
was really an example of a serious, well-govemed mind: at his that
coming on board the ship, he threw himsell' flat on his face, prostrating
himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I unhappily and
unseasonahly disturbed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon; but
he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for his
deliverance; begged me to leave him afew moments, and that, next to
his Maker, he would give me thanks also.

I was heartily sorry that l disturbed him, and not only let! him, but
kept others from interrupting him also. He continued in that posture
about three minutes, or little more, alter I left him; then came to me. as
he had said he would, and, with a greatdeal ol' seriousness and sli'ection,
but with tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him,
and so many miserable creatures, their lives. I told him I had no room
to move him to thank God for it, rather than his, for I had seen that he
had done that already; but, I added, that it was nothing but what
reason and humanity dictated to all men, and that we had as much
reason as he to give thanks to God, who had blamed us so far, as to make'
us the instruments of his mercy to so many of his creatures.

Alter this, the young priest applied himself to his country-folks;
labored to compose them; persuaded, entreated. argued, reasoned with
them. and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their
reason: and with some he had success, though others were for a time out
of all government of themselves.

I can not help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be uselhl
to those in whose hands it may fall. for the guiding themselves in all the
extravaganciea of their passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men
out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what will not the
extravagancies of anger, rage, and a provoked mind carry us to! And,
indeed, here I saw reason for keepingan exceeding watch over our passions
of every kind," well those of joy and aatisfaction,as those of sorrow
and anger.

We were something disordered, by these extravagancies among our
new guests. for the first day; but when they had been retired, lodgings
provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and they had slept
heartily--as most of them did, being litigued and lrightened--they were
quite another sort of people the next day. '

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the kindness
shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally apt
enough to exceed that way. The captain and'one of the priests came to
me the next day, and desired to speak with me and my nephew: the
commander began to consult with us what should be done with them;
and. first, they told us that we had saved their lives, so all they had was
little enough for a return to as for that kindness received. The captain
said they hadsaved some money, and some things of value, in their boats.
catehed hastily out of the flames, and if he would accept it, they were
ordered to make an altar of it all to us: they only desired to be set on
shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might get a passage
to France. My nephew was for accepting their money at first word, and
to consider what to do with them afterward: but I overruled him in that
part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange country: and
if the Portuguese captain that took me up at sea had served Ins so, and
took all I had for my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been as
much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary, the mere being sold
to a Mahometan excepted: and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a 'I'urk, if not, in some cases, much worse.

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in their
distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow-
creaturee: and we would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like
or any other extremity; that we had done nothing for them but what we
believed they would have done for us, if we had been in their case, and
theyin ours; but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder
them; and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from
them which they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore
and leave them; that this would be first to save them from death, and
then kill them ourselves; save them fiom drowning, and abandon them
tostarving; and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from
them. As to setting them on shore, I told them, indeed, that was an
exceeding difliculty to us, for that the ship was bound to the East Indies;
and though we were driven out of our course to the westward a very
great way. and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose for their
deliverance, yet it was impossible for us willfully to change our voyage on
their particular account: nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to
the freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to pursue his voy-
age by the way of Brazil: and all I knew we could do for them, was to
put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships homeward bound
from the West Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to England or
France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they could not
but be very thankful for it; but they were in a very great consternation,
especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the East
Indies: they then entreated me, that seeing I was driven an far to
the westward before I met them, I would at least keep on the same
course to the Banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might
meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to
Canada, from whence they came.

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and therefore
I inclined to agree to it; for indeed, I considered, that to carry this whole
company to the East Indies, would not only be an intolerable severity
upon the poor maple, but would be ruining our whole voyage by devour-
ing all our provisions; so I thought it no breech of charter-party. but
what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in
which no one could say we were to blame; for the laws ofGod and nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of
people in such s distressed condition: and the nature of the thing,"
well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them on
shore somewhere or other for their deliverance: so I consented that we
would carry them to Newfoundland. if wind and weather would permit;
and if not, that! would carry them to Martinico in the West Indies.

H18 ISLAND.

Tan wind continued flesh easterly, but the weather pretty good, and
as the winds had continued in the points between N. E. and 8. E- a long
time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to France; for we
met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French horn St.
Christopher's; but they had been so long beating up against the wind.
that they durst take in no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions
for the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take in: so
we were obliged to 'go on. it was about a week after this that we made
the Banks of Newfoundland; where, to shorten my story, we put all
our French people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put
them on shore, and afterward to carry them to France, if they could get
provisions to victual themselves with. When I say, all the French went
on shore, I should remember. that the young priest I spoke of, hearing
we were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and
to be set on shore on the coast ofCoromandel; which l readily agreed to,
forI wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason,as will appear
afterward; also four of the seamen entered themselves in our ship, and
proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away
8. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes little or no
wind at all; when we met with another subject for our humanity to work
upon, almost as deplorable as that before.

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees five minutes north, on
the 19th day of March, 1894--5, when we copied a sail, our course 8. E.
and by s.: we soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she hots up
to us, but could not at that know what to make of her, till, afler coming
a little nearer, we found she had lost her main topmsst. fore-mast, and
bowaprit; and presently she fired a gun, as a signal of distress: the
weather was pretty good, wind at N. N. w.. fresh gale, and we soon
came to speak with her.

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had
been blown out of the road at Barbadoes,a few days before she was ready
tosail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chiefmate were both
gone on shore; so that. beside the tenor of the storm, they were in an
indifl'erent case for good artists to bring the ship home. They had been
already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm, alter
the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their knowl-
edge to the westward, and in which they lost their masts, as above.
They told us they expected to haveseen the Bahama islands, butwere then
driven away again to the south-east, by a strong gale of wind at N. N. W.,
the same that blew now: and having no sails to work the ship with but
a main-course. and a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which
they had set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavoring
to stand away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost starved for
want of provisions, beside the fatigues they had undergone: their bread
and flesh were quite gone; they had not one ounce lefi in the ship, and
had none for eleven days. The only relief they had was. their water was
not all spent, and they had about halfa barrel of flour left; they had
sugar enough; some succadee, or sweetmests, they had at first, but they
were devoured; and they had seven caelrs of rum.

There were a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant, on board,who
were going passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily
came on board the evening before the hurricane began; and having no
provisions of their own left. they were in a more deplorable condition
than the rest: for the seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity
themselves, had no compassion. we may be sure, for the poor passengers;
and they were, indeed, in a condition, that their misery is very hard to
describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led me (the
weather being fair and the wind abated) to go on board the ship. The
second mate, who. upon this occasion. commanded the ship, had been on
board our ship, and he told me. indeed. they had three passengers in the
great cabin, that were in a deplorable condition: Nay. says he,I believe
they are dead, for l have heard nothing of them for above two days: and
l was afraid to inquire after them,said be, for 1 had nothing to relieve
them with. .

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could
spare; and. indeed, I had so far overruled things with my nephew, that I
would have victualed them, though we had gone away toVirginia, or
any other part of the coast of America, to have supplied ourselves; but
there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for they were sflgld of eating too
much, even of that little we gave them. The mate or commander
brought six men with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked
like skeletons, and were so weak. that they could hardly sit to their oars.
The mate himself was very ill, and half-starved; for he declared he had
reserved nothing from the men, and went share and share elike with
them in every hit they eat. '

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, b,ut set meet before him immediately;
and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick. and out
oforder; so he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something
with some broth, which he said would be to him both food and physio:
and after he had taken it he grew better. In the meantime. I forgot not
the men; I ordered victuals to be given them; end the poor creatures
rather devoured than ate it: they were so exceeding hungry. that they
were in a kind ravenous, and had no command of themselves; and two
of them ate with so much greediness, that they were in danger of their
lives the next morning.

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me,and brought
to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my that coming on shore in
my island, where I had never the least mouthful of food. or any prospect
of procuring any; beside the hourly apprehensions I had of being made
the food of other creatures. But all the while the mate was thus relying
to me the miserable condition of the ship's company, 1 could not put out
of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in the
great cabin, viz: the mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he
had heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he seemed to con-
fess, they had wholly neglected, their own extremities being so great: by
which I understood, that they had really given them no food at all. and
that therefore they must be perished, and be all lying deed, perhaps, on
the floor or deck of the cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board
with his men to refresh them, so [also forgot not the starving crew that
were left on board; but ordered my own boat to- go on boerd the ship,
and. with my mate and_ twelve men, to carry them a sack of breed, and
four or tlve pieces of beef to boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause
the meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-
room, to prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot
before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at
a time: and by this caution he preserved the men, who would otherwise
have killed themselves with that very food that was given them on pur-
pose to save lheir lives.

At the same time,l ordered the mate to go into the great cabin, and see

2|
what condition the poor passengers were in; and if they were alive, to
comfort them. and give them what refreshment was proper: and the
surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some of the prepared broth which
he had given the mate that was on board, and which he did not question
would restore them gradually.

I was not satisfied with this; but. as I said above, having a great mind
to see the scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would present ms
with, in a more lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the
captain of the ship. as we now called him, with me, and went myself. a
little alter, in their boat.

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult, to get the victuals
out of the boiler before it was ready: but my mate observed his orders.
and kepta good guard at the cook-room door: and the men he placed
there, after using all possible persuasion--to have patience. kept them off
by force: however, he caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot,
and soflened with the liquor of the meat, which they called brewie, and
gave them every one some, to stay their stomachs. and told them it was
for their own safety that he was obliged to give them but little at a time.
But it was all in vain; and had I not come on board, and their own com-
mander and ofiicere with me, and with good words. and some threats also
of giving them no more, I believe they would have broken into the cook-
room by_ force, and tom the meat out of the furnace; for words are
indeed of very small force to a hungry belly: however, we pacified them,
and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first. and the next time
gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men did well
enough.

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another
nature, and far beyond the rest; for as the ship's company had so little
for themselves. it was but too true that they had at first kept them very
low. and at last totally neglected them; so that for six or seven days it
might be said they had really no food at all. and for several days before
very little. The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman
of sense and breeding, had spared all she could so afi'eetionately for her
son, that at last she entirely sank under it; and when the mate of our
ship went in, she set upon the floor or deck. with her back up against the
sides. between two chairs, which were lashed fast. and her head sunk
between her shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate
said all that he could do to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon
put some broth into her mouth. She opened her lips, and lined up one
hand, but could not speak: yet she understood what he said, and made
signs to him, intimating that it was too late for her, but pointed to her
child, as if she would have said they should take care of him. However,
the mate. who was exceedingly moved with the sight, endeavored to get
acute broth into her mouth,and, as he said. got two or three spoonfuls
down; though I question whether he could be sure of it or not: but it
was too late. and she died the same nighfi

The youth. who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate
mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a cabin bed, as one
stretched out, with hardly any life lelt in him. He had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it: however, being young.
and having more strength than his mother. the mate got something down
his throat, and he began sensibly to revive; though by giving him, some
time alter, but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick.
end brought it up again.

But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all along upon the deck,
hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down with an
apoplexy,and struggled for life. Her limbs were distorted; one of her
hands was clasped around the frame of a chair, and she griped it'eo hard,
that we could not easily make her let go: her other arm lay over her
head, and her feet lay both together. set fast against the frame of the cabin
table: in short, she lay just like one in the agonies of death, and yet she
was alive too. .

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and terrified with
the thoughts of death, but as the men told us alterward, was broken-
hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three days
before. and whom she loved most tenderly.

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our surgeon,
who was a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, with great
application, recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hands as to her
senses; for she was little less than distracted for a considerable time alter,
as shall appear presently.

Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to consider.
that visits at see are not like a journey into the country, where sometimes
people stay a week or a fortnight at a place: our business was. to relieve
this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them; and though they
were willing to steer the same course with us for some days, yet we could
carry no sail, to keep pace with a ship that had no masts: however, as
their captain begged of us to help him to set up a main-topmost, and a
kind of a topmast to his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him
for three or four days; and than having given him five barrels of beec
a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas. flour,
and what other things we could spare; and taking three casks of sugar,
some rum, and some pieces of eight from them for satisfaction, we lelt

and the maid, and all their goods.

modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of his mother,

ship; for he said the cruel fellow" had murdered his mother: and, indeed,
so they had, that is to say. passively ; for they might have spared a small

lifeI though it had been but just enough to keep her alive: but hunger
knows no friend. no relation. no justice, no right; and therefore is
remorselcss. and capable of no compassion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going. and that it would carry
him away from all his friends,and put him perhaps in as bad circum-
stances almost as those we found him in, that is to say. starving in the
world. He said it mattered not whither he went. if he was but delivered
from the terrible crew that he was among: that the captain (by which he
meant me. for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life,
and he was sure would not hurt him; and as for the maid. he was sure,
it'she came to herself. she would be very thankful for it, let us carry them
where we would. The surgeon represented the case so afl'cetionately to
me, that 1 yielded. and we took them both on board. with all their goods,
except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed or come
at; and as the youth had a hill ot'ladiug for them] made his commander
sign a writing ohliging himself to go.as soon as he came to Bristol, to one
Mr. Rogers.a merchant there. to whom the youth stud he was related,
and to delivers letter which lwrole to him. and all the goods he had
belonging to the deceased widow; which i suppose was not done, liirI
could never learn that the ship came to Bristol. but was, as is most proba-
ble. lost at sea; being in so disabled a condition, and so far from any land,
that I am of opinion the first storm she met with afterward she might
founder in the sea: for site was leaky and had damage in her hold, when
we met with her.

I was new in the latitude of nineteen degrees thirty-two minutes. and
had hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather. though. at first. the winds
had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents of
wind, weather, currents. etc., on the rest of our voyage; but, to shorten
my story, for the sake of what is to follow, shall observe, that i came to
my old habitation, the. island. on the toth or April. 11:95. It was with no
small dilliculty that 1 found the place; for as I come to it. and went from
it. before, on the south and east side of the island. as coming from the
Brazils, so now, courting in hetweeu the main and the island, and having
no chart for the coast. nor any landmark, I did not know it when 1 saw
it, or know whether i saw it or not.

We beat about a great while.aud went on shore on several islands in the
mouth of the great river Oronoco, but none for my purpose; only this]
learned by my coasting the shore. that l was under one great mistake
before, viz: that the continent which i thought i saw from the island i
lived in, was really no continent. but a long island, or rather a ridge of
islands, reaching from one to the other side ofthe extended mouth of that
great river: and that the savages who came to my island were not properly
those which we call Caribbees, but islanders, and other barbarians of the
same kind. who inhabited something nearer to our side than the rest.

In short.l visited several of these islands to no purpose; some I found
were inhabited, and some were not: on one of them [ found some
Spaniards, and thought they had lived there; but speaking with them,
found they had a sloop in a small creek hard by, and came thither to
make salt and to catch some pearl muscles, if they could; but that they
belonged to Trinidad, which 'lay farther north, in the latitude of ten and
eleven degrees.

Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship,
sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop. which we had found a con-
venient boat, and therefore kept her with their very good will, at length I
came on the south side of my island. and presently knew the very coun-
tenance ot' the place: so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside
with the little creek where my old habitation was.

 

SECTION XXXIII.

ROBINSON AND FRIDAY GO ON SHORE--Tn! LAHEB MEETS WITH Ell
I'A'flll-lfl--AOCOL'NT OF WHAT PASSED ON THE ISLAND AFTER BOBLVBONW
QUINING IT.

As soon as I saw the place. I called for Friday, and asked him it' he
knew where he was; he looked about a little, and presently clapping hil
hands, cried, Oh yes, on there, Oh yes, on there, pointing to our old
habitation, and fell dancing and capering likca mad fellow; and I had
much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the
place.

Well, Friday. says i, do you think we shall find anybody here or no'!
and do you think we shall see your father! The t'ellow stood mule as a
stock a good while. but when I named his father, the poor afl'ectionato
creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears run down his face
very plentifully. What is the matter, Friday? says I; are you troubled
because you may see your father'.' No, no, says he, shaking his head, no
see him more; no, never more see him again. Why so, said I, Friday!
how do you know that! Oh no, Oh no, says Friday; he long ago die,
long ago; he much old man. Well, well,says l, Friday, you don't know;
but shall we see any one else then'! The fellow, it seems, had better
eyes than Laud he points to the hill just above my old house; and
though we lay halt'a league on", he cries out, We see, we see, yes, yes,
we see much man there, and there, and there. I looked, but I saw
nobody, no not with a perspective-glass, which was, I suppose because I
could not hit the place: for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry
the next day: and there were live or six men all together, who stood to
look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us.

As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English ancient
to be spread. and fired three guns, to give them notice we were friends:
and in about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a smoke arise
from the side of the creek: so I immediately ordered the boat out. taking
Friday with me; and hanging out a white flag, or a flag of truce,I went
directly on shore, taking with me the young friar I mentioned. to whom
I had told the story of my living there, and the manner of it, and every
particular both of myself and those l left there: and who was, on that
sccount,extremely desirous to go with me. We had beside about sixteen
men well armed, if we had found any new guests there which we did not
know of; but we had no need of weapons.

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, we rowed
directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my eye upon was the
Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face perfectly
well: as to his habit.l shall describe it afterward. I ordered nobody to
go on shore at first but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the
boat. for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance, a
good way off the Spaniards. where indeed [saw nothing of him: and if
they had not let him go ashore, he would have jumped into the sea. He
was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to his father, like an arrow out
ofa bow. It would have made any man shed teamin spite ofthe lirmest
resolution. to have seen the first transports of this poor felluw's joy when
he came to his father: how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his face,
took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree. and lay down by
him; then stood and looked at him. as any one would look at a strange
picture, for a quarter of an hour together; then lay down on the ground,
and stroked his legs. and kissed them. and then got up again. and stored
at him: one would have thought the fellow bewitchcd. But it would
have made a dog laugh the next day to see how his passion ran out
another way; in the morning he walked along the shore to and again,
with his father, several hours. always leading him by the hantl,es if he
had been a lady; and every now and then he would come to the boat to
fetch something or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a
biscuit-cake, or something or other that was good. In the afternoon his
i'rolics ran another way; for then he would set the old man down upon
the ground and dance about him, and make a thousand antic postures
and gestures: and all the while he did this, he would be talking to him,
and telling him one story or other of his travels, and of what had hap-
pclth to him,sbrosd, to divert him. In short, if the same filial affectlon
was to be found in Christians, to their parents in our part of the world,
one would be tempted to say there would hardly have been any need of
the filth commandment.

But this is a'digression: I return to my landing. It would be needless
to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that the Spaniards re-
ceived me with. The first Spaniard, who, as l eaid, I knew very well,
was he whose life I had saved; he came toward the boat, attended by one
more, carrying a flag of truce also; and he not only did not know me at
first, but he had no thoughts, no notion of its being me that was come,
till I spoke to him. Senhor, eaid l, in Portuguese, do you not know me!
At which he spoke not a word, but giving his musket to the man that was
with him, threw his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish that I did
not perfectly hear,came forward and embraced me; telling me he was
inexcusable in not knowing that thee again. that he had once seen as if
an angel from heaven sent tonve his life: he said abundance of very hand-
some things, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how; and then
beckoning to the person that attended him, bade him go and cell hie com-
rades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation, where
he would give me possession of my own house again, and where 1 should
see they had made but mean improvements: so I walked along with him;
but, alas! I could no more find the place again than if I had never been
there; for they had planted so many trees, and placed them in such a
posture, so thick and close to one another, and in about ten years' time
they were grown so big, that, in abort, the place was inaccessible. except
by such windings and blind ways as they themeelvee only, who made
them, could find.

I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications: he told me I
would eay there was need enough of it. when they had given me an
account how they had passed their time since theirarriving in the island,
especially after they had the misfortune to find that I wee gone. He told
me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he
heard that l was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction: and that
he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that. one time or other, he should
see me again; but nothing that ever befall him in his life, he said, was so
surprising and amicting to him at first, as the disappointment he was
under when he came back to the island and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he calledrthem) that were left behind, and
of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spaniards all
thought themselves much better among the savages, only that their num-
bar was so small : and, says he, had they been strong enough, we had been
all long ago in purgatory ; and with that he creased himselt'on the breast.
But, sir, aays he, I hope you will not be displeawd when I shall tell you,
how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation, to
diam them, and make them our subjects, who would not be content
with being moderately our masters, but would be our murderers. I
answered. I was heartily afraid of it when I lelt them there, and nothing
troubled me at my parting from the island but that they were not come
back, that I might have put them in possession olevery thing at first, and
lelt the others in a state of subjection, as they deserved; but it they had
reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should be very far from finding
any fault with it: for I lrnew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned
villains. and were lit for any manner of mischief.

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had sent back.
and with him eleven men more. In the dress they were in, it was
impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he made all clear,
both to them and to me. First he turned to me, and pointing to them,
said, These. sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you;
and then turning to them. and pointing to me, he let them know who I
was; upon which they all came up, one by one. not as it' they had been
sailors and ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if they had been
ambassadors ol' noblemcn. and l a monarch or great conqueror: their
behavior was to the last degree obliging and courteous. and yet mixed
with a manly. majestic gravity, which very well became them; and, in
short. they had so much more manners than I. that I scarce knew how to
receive their civilities, much less how to return them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island. alter my
going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents, which the
former part of my relation will help to understand, and which will, in
most of the particulars, refer to the account I have already given that I
can not but commit them. with great delight, to the reading of those that
come alter me. -

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first person,
which will put me to the expense of ten thousand said Pa, and said he's,
and lie lolil me's,and I laid Iiim'e, and the like; but I shall collect the
facts historically. as near as I can gather them out of my memory, from
what they related to me, and from what I met with in my conversing
with them and with the place.

In order to do this succinctly.and as intelligibly aeI ean,l mustgo
back to the circumstances in which I lelt the island, and in which the
persons were of whom I am to speak. And first, it is necessary to repeat,
that I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard (the two whose
lives I had rescued from the savages) in a large canoe, to the main. as I
then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions that he _lelt
behind him. in order to save them from the like calamity that he had
been in, and in order to succor them for the present; and that, if possi-
ble. we might together find some way for our deliverance alterward.

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or the least
room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more than I had twenty years
before. much less had I any foreknowledge of what anerward happened.
I mean, of an English ship coming on shore there to fetch me on"; and it
could not but he s very great surprise to them, when they came back. not
only to find that! was gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot,
possessed of all that 1 had left behind me, which would otherwise have
been their own.

The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might begin
where I left off, was of their own part; and I desired he would give me a
particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat,
when I sent him to fetch them over. He told me there was little variety
in that part. for nothing remarkable happened to them on the way, having
had very calm weather and a smooth sea. As for his countrymen, it
could not be doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him
(it seems he was the principal man among them, the captain of the vessel
they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time); they were,
he said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew that he was
fallen into the hands of the savages, who. they were satisfied. would
devour him, as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that when he told
them the story of his deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished
for carrying them away. it was like a dream to them. and their astonish-
ment, he said, was somewhat like that of Joseph's brethren. when he told
them who he was, and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's
court; but when he showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and
provisions. that he had brought them for their journey or voyage, they
were restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of their deliver-
ance, and immediately prepared to come away with them.

Their first business was to get canoes: and in this they were obliged not
to stick so much upon the honest part of it, but to trespass upon their
friendly savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or periaguas, on pre-
tense of going out a fishing, or for pleasure. In these they came away
the next morning. It seems they wanted no time to get themselves
ready , for they had no baggage. neither clothes nor provisions, nor any
thing In the world but what they had on them, and a new roots to eat. of
which they used to make their bread.

They were in all three weeks absent; and in that time, unluckily for
them,[ had the occasion ott'ered for my escape," I mentioned in my
other part, and to get otl'l'rom the island, leaving three of the most impu-
dent, hardened. ungovemed, disagreeable villains behind me. that any
man could desire to meet with; to the poor Spaniards' great grief and
disappointment. you may be sure.

The only just-thing the rogues did was. that when the Spaniards came
ashore. they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions, and other
relief. as I had ordered them to do; also) they gave them the long paper
of directions which I had left with them, containing the particular
methods which I took for managing every part of my life there; the way
how I baked my bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn: how I
cured my grapes, made my pots. and, in a word, every thing I did; all
this being written down. they gave to the Spaniards (two of them under-
stood English well enough): nor did they refuse to accommodate the
Spaniards with any thing else, for they agreed very well for some time.
They gave them an equal admission into the house. or cave. and they
began to live very sociably: and the head Spaniard. who had seen pretty
much of my methods. and Friday's father together, managed all their
affairs; but as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about '
the island. shoot parrots. and catch tortoises; and when they came homo
at night. the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the others but
let them alone; which. however, they could not find in their hearts to do
long. but. like the dog in the manger. they would not eat themselves,
neither would they let the others cat. The differences. nevertheless. were
at first but trivial. and such as are not worth relating. but at last it broke
out into open war: and it began with all the rudeness and insolcnce that
can be imagined. without reason. without provocation. contrary to nature,
and. indeed. to common sense; and though. it is true, the first relation of
it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the aecusera,
yet when lcame to examine the fellows. they could not deny a Word ofit.

But before I come to the particulars ol'this part. I must supply a defect
in my former relation; and this was.l forgot to set down. among the rest.
that just us we were weighing the anchor to set sail, there happened a
little quarrel on board of our ship. which I was once afraid would have
turned to a second mutiny; nor was it appeascd till the captain. rousing
up his courage. and taking us all to his assistance. parted them by force,
and making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners. he laid them in
irons: and as they had been active in the fiirmcr disorders. and let fall
some ugly. dangerous words. the second time he threatened to carry them
III irons to England,and have them hanged there for Inutinymnd running
away with the ship. This. it scents. though the captain did not intend to
do it. frightened some other men in the ship; and some of them had put
it into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them good words
for the present. till they should come to some English port. and that then
they should be all put into jail. and tried for their lives. The male got
intelligence of this. and acquainted us with it: upon which it was desired
that I. who still passed fora greatman among theni.should gndown with
the mate. and satisfy the men. and tell them that they might he assured.
il'they behaved well the rest ofthe voyage. all they had done for the time
past should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing my honor's word
to them they appeared easy, and the more so when 1 caused the two men
that were in irons to be released and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night; the wind
also falling calm next morning, we found that our two men who had been
laid in irons had stole each of them a musket, and some other weapons
(what powder or shot they had we knew not), and had taken the ship's
pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and ran away with her to their
companions in roguery on shore. As soon as we found this, i ordered the
long-boat on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away they went
to seek the rogues; but they could neither tlnd them or any of the rest,
for they all tied into the woods when they saw the, boat coming on shore
The male was once resolved. in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed
their plantations, burned all their household-slut? and furniture, and lelt
them to shilt without it; but having no orders, he let it all alone. lelt
every thing as he found it, and bringing the pinnaee away, came on board
without thei'n. These two men made their number five; but the other
three villains were so much more wicked than they, that alter they had
been two or three days together, they turned the two new comers out of
doors to shilt for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them;
nor could they, for a good while. be persuaded to give them any food: as
for the Spaniards, they were not yet come.

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to go tor-
ward: the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English brutes to
have taken in their two countrymen again, that as they said, they might
be all one family; but they would not hear ofit: so the two poor fellows
lived by themselves; and finding nothing but industry and application
would make them live comfortably. they pitched their tents on the north
shore of the island, but a little more to the west, to be out of danger or
the savages, who always landed on the east part of the island.

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay up
their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniards having given them
some corn for seed, and especially some of the peas which 1 had let!
them, they dug, planted. and inclosed, after the pattern I had set for
them all, and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on
the ground; and though it was but a little bit of land which they had
dug up at first, having had but a little time. yet it was enough to relieve
them, and find them with bread and other catables; and one of the
fellows, being the cook's-mate ol' the ship. was very ready at making soup,
puddings, and such other preparations as the rice and the milk, and such
little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.

Tan were going on in this little thriving posture, when the three
unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in more humor, and to
insult them, came and bullied them, and told them the island was theirl:
that the governor, meaning me, had given them the possession of it, and
nobody else had any right to it; end that they should build no houses
upon their ground, unless they would pay rent for them.

The two men thinking they were jeeting at first, aalred them to come
in and sit down, and see what tine houses they were that they had built,
and to tell them what rent they demanded; and one of them merrily
said, ifthey were the ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built tenements
upon their land, and made improvements, they would. according to the
custom of landlords. grant a long lease: and desired they would get a
scrivener to draw the writings. One of the three, cursing end raging, told
them they should see they were not in jest; end going to a little place at
a distance, where the honest men had made a fire, to dress their victuals,
he takes a firebrand,end claps it to the outside of their hut, and very
fairly set it on fire; end it would have been ell burned down in a few
minutes, if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust him away.
end trod the fire out with his feet, end that not without some dificulty
too. '

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest men's thrusting him away,
that he tnmed upon him, with a pole he had in his hand, and had not the
man avoided the blow very nimhly, and run into the hut, he had ended
his days at once. His eomrede, seeing the danger they were both in, ran
in alter him,and immediately they came both out with their muskets,
and the man that was first struck at with the pole, knocked the fellow
down that had begun the quarrel with the stock of his musket, end that
before the other two could come to help him; and then seeing the rest
come at them; they stood together, and presenting the other ends of their
pieces to them, bade them stand off.

The others had fire-arms with them too: but one of the two honest
men, bolder than his comrade, and mode desperate by his danger, told
them, if they offered to move hand or foot they were dead men, and
boldly commended them to lay down their arms. They did not, indeed,
lay down their arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought them toe
parley, and they consented to telre their wounded men with them and be
gone; end, indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded suflleiently with the
blow. However, they were much in the wrong, since they had the advan-
tage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as they might have done,
and have gone immediately to the Spaniards. and given them an account
how the rogues had treated them; for the three villains studied nothing
but revenge, and every day gave them some intimation that they did so.

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of the
rogueries, such as treading down their corn; shooting three young kids
and a she goat, which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their
store; and, in a word, plaguing them night and day in this manner; it
foroed the two men to such a desperation. that they resolved to fight them
all three, the first time they had a fairopportunity. In order to this:they
resolved to go to the castle, as they called it (that was my old dwelling),
where the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at that time.
intending to have a [air battle, and the Spaniards should stand by. to see
thir play: so they got up in the morning before day, and came to the
place. and called the Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that
answered that they wanted to speak with them.

lt happened that' the day before. two or the Spaniards having been in
the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for distinction I
called the honest men, and he had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards
of the barbarous usage they had met with from their three countrymen,
and how they had ruined their plantation, and destroyed their oorn that '
they had labored so hard to bring forward, and lrilled the milch goat and
their three kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance;
and that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist them
again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards came home at night,
and they were all at supper, one of them took the freedon to reprove the
three Englishmen, though in very gentle and mannerly terms, and asked
them how they could be so cruel, they being harmless, inofi'ensive fellows;
that they were putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labor, .
and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such
perfection as they were then in.

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What had they to do
there! that they came on shorehvithout leave: and that they should not
plant or build upon the island; it was none of their ground. Why, says
the Spaniard, very ealmy, Sanhor Inglese, they must not starve. The
Englishman replied, like a rough-hewn tarpanlin, They might starve
and be d--d: they should not plant or huild in that place. But what
must they do then, senhor! said the Spaniard. Another of the brutes
returned, 00'! d--n them, they should be servants, and work for them.
But how can you expect that of them! says the Spaniard; they are not
bought with your money; you have no right to make them servants. The
Englishman answered, the island was theirs; the governor had given it
to them, and no man had any thing to do there but themselves; and with
that swore by his Maker that they would go and burn all their new huts;
they should build none upon their land. Why, senhor, says the Spaniard,
by the same rule, we must be your servants too.---Ay, says the bold dog,
and so you shall too. before we have done with you (mixing two or three
G--d d--n me's in the proper intervals of his speech). The Spaniard only
smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this little discourse
had heated them; and, starting up, one says to the other.l think it was
he they ealled Will Atkins, Come, Jack, let's go.end have t'other brush
with 'em; we'll demolish their castle, I'll warrant you; they shall plant
no colony in our dominions.

Upn this they went all trooping awey.with every men a gun, a pistol.
and a sword. and muttered some insolent things among themselves, of
what they would do to the Spaniards too. when opportunity offered; but
the Spaniards, it seems. did not so perfectly understand them as to know
all the particulars, only that. in general, they threatened them hard for
taking the two Englishmen's pert.

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that evening, the
Spaniards said they did not know; but it seems they wandered about the
country part of the night, and then lying down in the piece which I used
to call my bower, they were weary. and overslept themselves. The case
was this: they had resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the two
poor men when they were asleep, and, as they acknowledged alterward,
intended to set fire to their huts while they were in them, and either burn
them there, or murder them as they came out; as malice seldom sleeps
very sound, it was very strange they should not have been kept awake.

However. as the two men had also a design upon them, as l have said,
though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, it hap-
pened. and very luckily for them all, that they were up, and gone abroad,
before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts.

When they came there, and found the men gone,Atkins, who. it seems,
was the forwardest man, called out to his comrades. Ha, Jack. here's the
nest, but d--n them. the birds are down. They mused awhile, to think
what should he the occasion of their being gone abroad so soon, and sug-
gested presently that the Spaniards had given them notice of it: and with
that they shook hands. and swore to one another that they would be
revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bargain,
they fell to work with the poor man's habitation: they did not set lire,
indeed, to any thing. but they pulled down both their houses. and pulled
them so limb liom limb, that they lelt not the least stick standing, or
scarce any sign on the ground where they stood : they tore all their little
collected household-stull' in pieces, and threw every thing about in such\
a manner, that the poor men elterward found some of their things a mile
on' their habitation. When they had done this, they pulled up all the
young trees which the poor men had planted; pulled up an incloeure
they had mode to secure their cattle and their corn; and, in a word,
sacked and plundered every thing as completely as a horde of Tartar-s
would have done.

The two men were 'at this juncture. gone to find them out. and had re-
solved to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but two to
three; so that, had they met, there certainly would have been blood-
shed among them; for they were all very stout, resolute fellows, to give
them their due. _

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they them-
selves could do to meet; for, as if they had dogged one mother, when the
three had gone thither, the two were here; and alterward, when the two
went back to find them, the three were come to the old habitation again :
we shall see their diflerent conduct presently. When the three came
back like furious creatures flushed with rage which the work they had .
been about had put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told
them what they had done, by way ofscofl' and bravado; and one of them
stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of boys
at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon his head,and giving it a twirl
about, fleering in his thee, says to him, And you, Senhor Jack Sfiniard.
shall have the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners. The
Spaniard, who, though a quiet civil man, was as brave a man as could be,
and withal a strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good while, and
then, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and with
one blow of his list knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-ax;
at which one or the rogues, as insolent as the first, tired his pistol at the
Spaniard immediately: be missed his body, indeed, for the bullets went
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he
bled pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more
hurt than he really was. and that put him into some heat, for before he
acted all in a perfect calm; but now resolving to go through with his
work, he stooped, and took the fellow's musket whom he had knocked
down, and was just going to shoot the man who had fired at him, when
the rest of the Spaniards, being in the cove, came out, and calling to him
not to shoot, they stepped in, secured the other two, and took their arms
from them.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the
Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they began to
cool, and, giving the Spaniards better words, would have their arms

again; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was betwaen them
and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best method they
could take to keep them from killing one another, told them they would 1
do them no harm, and if they would live peaceably. they would be very
willing to assist and associste with them as they did before; but that they
could not think of giving them their arms again. while they appeared so
resolved to do mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had
even threatened them all to make them theirservanta.

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to act with
reason; but being refused their arms, they went raving away, and raging
like madman. threatening what they would do. though they had no tire-
artns. But the Spaniards, despising their threatening. told them they
should take care how they oh'ered any injury to their plantation or cattle,
{or if they did, they would shoot them as they would reavenous beasts,
wherever they found them; and if they fell into their hands alive, they
should certainly be hanged. However. this was far from cooling them,
but away they wentfnging and swearing like furies of hell. As soon as
they were gone. the two men came back, in passion and ragc'enough also,
though of another kind; for having been at their plantation, and finding it
all demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they
had provocation enough. Theypould scarce have room to tell their tale,
the Spaniards were so eager to tell theirs; and it was strange enough to
find that three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punish-
ment at all.

The Spaniards. indeed, despised them, and especially, having thus dis-
armed them. made light of their threatenings; but the two Englishmen
resolved to have their remedy against them, what pains soever it cost to
find them out. But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them.
that as they had disarmed them. they could not consent that they (the
two) should pursue them with fire-arms. and perhaps kill them. But,
said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, we will endeavor to make
them do you justice, if you will leave it to us: for there is no doubt but
they will come to us again, when their passion is over, being not able to
subsist without'our assistance: we promise you to make no peace with
them. without havinga full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition
we hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than in
your own defense. The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly,
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested, that they did It .
only to keep them from bloodshed,and to make all easy at last. For, said
they, we are not so many of us; here is room enough for us all, and it is
a great pity we should not be all good triends. At length they did
consent, and waited for the issue of the thing. living for some days with
the Spaniards: for their own habitation was destroyed.

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with wandering, and
almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that
while, came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard. who. as I have
said. was the governor, and. two more with him walking by the side of
the creek, they came up in a very submissive, humble manner, and begged
to be received again into the family. The Spaniards used them civilly,
but told them they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and
so very grossly by them (the Spaniards). that they could not come to any
conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen and the rest; but,
however, they would go to them. and discourse about it, and they should
know in half an hour. It may be guessed that they were very hard put
to it: for. it seems, as they were to wait this half an hour for an answer.
they begged they would send them out some bread in the meantime,
which they did; sending. at the same time.a large piece of goat's flesh.
and a broiled parrot, which they ate very heartily, for they were hungry
enough.

After half an hour's consultation, they were called in, and a long debate
ensued: their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their
labor, and adesign to murder them: all which they owned before. and
therefore could not deny now. Upon the whole. the Spaniards acted the
moderator between them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen
not to hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed, so they now
obliged the three to go and rebuild their fellows' two huts, one to be of
the same and the other of larger dimensions, than they were before; to
fence their ground again where they had pulled up their fences, plant trees
in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land again for planting corn
where they had spoiled it, and. in a word, to restore every thing in the
same state as they found it, as near as they could; for entirely it could
not be, the season for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges,
not being possibIQto be recovered.

Well. they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of provisions .
given them all the while. they grew very orderly, and the whole society
began to live pleasantly and agreeably together again; only, that these
three fellows could never be persuaded to work, I mean for themselves,
except now and then a little just as they pleased: however, the Spaniards
told them plainly, that if they would but live sociably and friendly
together, and study the good of the whole plantation. they would be
content to work for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they
pleased: and thus having lived pretty well together for a month or two,
the Spaniards gave them arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad
with them as before.

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went abroad,
but the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublwome as
before: but, however, an accident happened presently upon this. which
endangered the safety of them all: and they were obliged to lay by all
private resentments, and look to the preservation of their lives.

It happened one night, that the Spanish governor, as l call him, that is
to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who was now the captain, or
leader, or governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the night.
and could by no means get any sleep: he was perfectly well in body, as

he told me the story, only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran
22
upon men fighting and killing of one another, but he was broad awake,-
and could not by any means get any sleep; in short, he lay a great while;
but growing more and more uneasy. he resolved to rise. As they lay, being
so many of them, upon goats' skins laid thick upon such couches and pads
as they made for themselves, and not in hammocks and ship beds, as I
did, who was but one, so they had little to do, when they were willing to
rise, but to get up upon their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it
was. and their pumps, and they were ready for going any way that their
thoughts guided them. Being thus got up, he looked out; but, being
dark, he could see little or nothing; and, beside, the trees which I had
planted, as in my former account is described, and which were now
grown tall. intercepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see
that it was a clear starlight night, and hearing no noise, he returned and
laid him down again: but it was all one; he could not sleep, nor could
he compose himself to any thing like rest; but his thoughts were to the
last degree uneasy, and he knew not for what.

Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going out and
coming in, another of them waked, and calling, asked who it was that
was up. The governor told him how it had been with him. Say you so?
says the other Spaniard; such things are not to be slighted, I assure you;
there is certainly some mischief working near us: and presently he asked
him, Where are the Englishmen l--They are all in their huts. says he,
safe enough. it seems, the Spaniards had kept possession of the main
apartment. and had made a'place for the three Englishmen. who,sincs
their last mutiny, were always quartered by themselves. and could not
come at the rest. Wall, says the Spaniard, there is something in it. I am
persuaded, from my own experience. l am satisfied our spirits embodied
have s converse with, and receive intelligence from, the spirits unem-
bodied. and inhabiting the invisible world; and this friendly notice is
given for our advantage, if we knew how to make use of it. Come, says
he. let us go and look abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to
justify the trouble. 1'" tell you a story to the purpose, that shall convince
you of the justice of my proposing it.

In a word, they went out, to go up to the top of the hill, where I used
to go; but they being strong, and a good company, not alone, as l was,
used none of my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and pulling it up alter
them, to go up a second stage to the top, but were going round through
the grove. unconcerned and unwary, when they were surprised with
seeing alight as of fire, a very little way ofl' from them, and hearing the
voices of men. not of one or two, but of a great number.

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on the island,
it was my constant care to prevent them making the least discovery of
there being any inhabitant upon the place; and when by any occasion
they came to know it, they felt it so elfectually, that they that got away
were scarce able to give any account of it; for we disappeared as soon as
possible; nordid ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else,
except it was the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the
boat; of whom,l mentioned. I was afraid they should go home and bring
more help. Whether it was the coquuence of the escape of those men
that so great a number came now together, or whether they came igno-
rantly, and by accident, on their usual bloody errand. the Spaniards
could not, it seems, understand; but, whatever it was, it had been their
business either to have concealed themselves, or not to have seen them at
all, much less to have let the savages have seen that there were any
inhabitants in the place; or to have fallen upon them so elfectually, as
that not a man of them should have escaped, which could only have
been by getting in between them and their boats: but this presence of
mind was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for
a great while.'

We need not doubt. but that the governor and the man with him,
surprised with this sight, ran back immediately, and raised their fellows,
giving them an account of the imminent danger they were all in, and
they again as readily took the alarm; but it was impossible to persuade
them to stay close within, where they were, but they mustall run out to
see how things stood.

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they had oppor-
tunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the light of three fir.
they had made ata distance from one another; what they were doing
they knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not. For, first, the
enemy were too many; and, secondly, they did not keep together, but
were divided into several parties, and were on shore in seven! places.

The Spaniards were in no small consternation -at this eight; and as '
they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the shore, they made
no doubt but, tint or last, some of them would chop in upon their
habitation, or upon some other place where they would see the token of
inhabitants; and they were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock
of goats, which would have been little less than starving them, if they
should have been destroyed; so the tint thing they resolved upon was,
to dispatch three men away before it was light. two Spaniards and one
Englishman, to drive all the gets away to the great valley where the
cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the very cave itself.
Could they have seen the savages all together in one body, and at a
distance from their canoes, they resolved, it there had been a hundred of
them, to have attacked them; but that could not be obtained; for they
were some of them two miles of from the other; and, as it appeared
anerward, were of two difi'erent nations.

After having Inuud a great while on the course they should take, and
beating their brains in considering their present circumstances, they
resolved, at latrwhile it was still dark, to send the old savage, Friday'a
fither, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning them : as
what they came for, what they intended to do, and the like. The old ma'n
readily undertook it; and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the
savages were, away he went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he
brings word that he had been among them undiscovered; that he found
they were two partiea, and of two several nations, who had war with one
another, and had agreat battle in their own country: and both aides havo
ing had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance,
landed all on the same island, for the devouring their prisoners and malt-
ing merry, but their coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled
all their mirth; that they were in a great rage at one mother. and were
so near, that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began
to appear; but he did not perceive that they had any notion of anybody
being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made an'end of telling
his story. when they could perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that
the two little armies were engaged in a bloody tight.

Friday's t'ather used all the arguments he could to persuade our people
to lie close, and not to be seen; he told them their safety consisted in it,
and that they had nothing to do but lie still. and the savages would kill
one another to their hands, and then the rest would go away; and it was
so to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the
Inglishmen; their curiosity was so importunate upon their prudentials,
that they must run out and see the battle: however, they used aome
caution too, viz: they did not go openly, just by their own dwelling, but
went farther into the woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where
they might securely see them manage the fight. and, as they thought,
not to be seen by them; but it seems the savages did see them,as we
shall find hereafter.

The battle was very fierce; and, if] might believe the Englishmen, one
of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of great
bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the fight.
The battle, they said, held two hours before they could guesa which party
would be beaten; but then, that party which was nearest our people'a
habitation began to appear weakest, and, alter some time more, some of
them began to fly; and this put our men "sin into a great consternation,
lest any one of those that tied should run into the grove before their
dwelling for shelter. and thereby involuntarily discover the place; and
that, by consequence, the pureuers would do the like in search of them.
Upon this they resolved that they would stand armed within the wall,
and whoever came into the grove, they resolved to sally out over the wall
and ltill them : so that, if possible, not one should return to give an
account of it: they ordered also that it should be done with their swords,
or by knockifi them down with _the stocks of their mnskets, but not by
shooting them, for fear of raising an alarm by the noise.

As they expected, it fell out: three of the routed army tied for life. and
crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the least knowing
whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter. The
scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this within. with this
addition, to our men's great satisfaction, viz: that the conquerors had not
pursued them. or seen which way they were gone; upon this, the
Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill the
three fugitives, but sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered
them to go round, come in behind them, and surprise and take them
prisoners, which was done. The residue of the conquered people fled to
their canoes, and got off to sea; the victors retired, made no pursuit, or
very little, but drawing themselves into a body together, gave two great
screaming shouts, which they supposed was by way of triumph, and so
the fight ended: and the same day, about three o'clock in the alternoon,
they also marched to their canoes. And thus the Spaniards had their
island again free to themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no
savages in several years alter.

Alter they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and
viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty men dead on
the spot: some were killed with great long arrows. some of which were
found sticking in their bodies; but most of them were killed with great
wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the field of
battle, and as many bows, with a great many arrows. fl'hese swords
were strange, great, unwieldy things, and they must be very strong men
that used them: most of those men that were killeflvith them had their
heads mashed to pieces, as we may say. or, as we call it in English, their
brains knocked out, and several their arms and legs broken; so that it is
evident they fight with inexpressible rage and fury. We found not one
man that was not atone-dead, for either they stay by their enemy till they
have quite killed him, or they carry all the wounded men that are not
quite dead away with them.

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while; the sight
had filled them with horror, and the consequences appeared terrible to
the last degree, especially upon supposing that some time or other they
should {all into the hands of those creatures, who would not only kill
them as enemies, but kill them for food," we kill our cattle; and they
professed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef and mut-
ton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very stomachs, made
them sick when they thought of it, and filled their minds with such
unusual tenor, thpt they were not themselves 'for some weeks alter.
This, as I said, tamed even the three English brutes I have'een speaking
of, and, for a great while otter, they were tractable, and went about the
common business of the whole society well enough; planted, sowed,
reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country. But some time
alter this, they fell into such simple measures again, as brought them into
a great deal of trouble.

They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these three being
lusty. stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught them to
work for them: and. as slaves, they did well enough; but they did not
take their measures with them as I did by my man Friday, viz: to begin
with them upon the principle of having saved their lives, and then
instruct them in the rational principles of life; much less of religion,
civilizing, and reducing them by ltind usage and afl'ectionate arguings;
but as they gave them their food every day, so they gave them their work
too, and kept them lully employed in drudgery enough; but they tailed
in this by it, that they never had them to assist them, and fight for them,
as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very flesh upon
my bones.

But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends. for com-
mon danger, as I said above. had effectually reconciled them, they began
toconsider their general circumstances; and the first thing that came
under their consideration was, whether, seeing the savages particularly
haunted that side of the island. and that there were more remote and
retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living. and manifestly
to their advantage, they should not rather move their habitation, and
plant in some more proper place for their safety. and especially for the
security of their catfle and corn.

Upon this, alter lung debate, it was concluded that they would not
remove their habitation; because that, some time or other, they thought
they might hear from their governor again. meaning me; and if I should
send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct them to that side;
where, if they should find the place demolished, they would conclude the
savages had killed us all, and we were gone; and so our supply would
go too. But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove them into
the valley where my cave was. where the land was as proper for both, and
where, indeed. there was land enough: however, upon second thoughts,
they altered one part of their resolution too, and resolved only to remove
part of their cattle thither. and plant part of their corn there; and so it
one part was destroyed. the other might be saved. And one part of
prudence they used.which it was very well they did, viz: that they never
trusted those three savages, which they had prisoners, with knowing any
thing of the plantation they had made in that valley, or ofany cattle they
had there. much less of the cave there, which they kept, in case of neces
sily, as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also the two barrels ofpowde.
which I haflsent them at my coming away. But, however. they resolved
not to change their habitation : yet they agreed. as I had carefully covered
it first with awall or fortification, and then with a grove of trees, so seeing
their safety consisted entirely in their being concealed, of which they
were now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and conceal the place
yet more effectually than before. For this purpose, as I planted trees,
or rather thrust in stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for
some good distance before the entrance into my apartments, they went
on in the same manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of
ground, from the trees I had set. quite down to the side of the creek,
where, as I said, I landed my floats, and even into the veryooso where
the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any sign
that there had been any landing thereabout: these stakes also being of a
wood very forward to grow," I have noted formerly, they took care to
have them generally much larger and taller than those which I had
planted; and as they grew space, so they planted them so very thick and
close together, that when they had been three or four years grown, there
was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into the plantation :
and, as for that part which I had planted,_the trees were grown as thick
as a man's thigh, and among them they placed so many other short ones,
and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a pallisado a quarter of a mile
thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it, but with a little army
to cut it all down; for a little dog could hardly get between the trees,
they stood so close.

But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground to the
right hand and to the lett, and round even to the top of the hill. leaving
no way, not so much as for themselves to come out. but by the ladder
placed up to the side of the hill. and then lined up, and placed again
from the first stage up to the top; and when the ladder was taken down,
nothing but what had wings. or witchcraft to assist it, could corneat them.
This was excellently well contrived; nor was it less than what they after-
ward round occasion for; which served to convince me, that as human
prudence has the authority of Providence to justify it,so it has doubt-
less the direction of Providence to set it to work; and it'we listened care-
fully to the voice of it,I am persuaded we might prevent many of the
disasters which our lives are now, by our own negligence, subjected to:
but this by the way.

I return to the story.--They lived two years alter this in perfect retire--
ment, and had no more y'sita from the savages. They had indeed an
alarm given them one morning, which put them into a great consterv
nation; for some of the Spaniards being out early one morning on the
'west side, or rather end. of the island (which was that end where I never
went, for fear of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing above
twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. They made the best of
i

their way home, in hurry enough; and giving the alarm 6 their com-
rades, they kept close all that day and the next, going out only at night
to make their observation: but they had the good luck to be mistaken:
for wherever the savages went, they did not land that time on the island,
but pursued some other design.

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; one of
whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of the three elevee,
which I mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had not done some-
thing right which he bid him do, and seemed a little untractable in his
showing him. drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he wore it by
his side. and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him.
One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the fellow a barbarous
cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his head, but struck into his
shoulders, so that he thought he had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran
to him. and entresting him not to murder the poor man, placed himself
between him and the savage, to prevent the mischief. The fellow being
enraged the more at this, struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and
swore he would serve him as he intended to serve the savage: which the
Spaniard perceiving. avoided the blow. and with a shovel which he had
in his hand (for they were all working in the held about their corn--land),
knocked the brute down. Another of the Englishmen running at the
same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; and then
two Spaniards more came in to help their man, and a third Englishman
fell in upon them. They had none of them any tire-arms. or any other
weapons but hatchets and other tools, except this third Englishman;
he had one of my rusty cutlessee. with which he made at the two last
Spaniards. and wounded them both. This fray set the wole family in an
hprosr, and more help coming in, they took the three Englishmen
prisoners. The next question was, what should be done with them!
They had been so otten mutinoue, and were so very furious, so desperate,
and so idle withal, they knew not what course to take with them, for they
were mischievousto the highest degree, and valued not what hurt they
did to any man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was the governor told them, in so many words. that

'if they had been of his own country, he would have hanged them; for
all laws and all governors were to preserve society, and those who were
dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it; but as they were
Englishmen. and that it was to the generous kindness of an Englishman
that they all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would use them
with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of the
other two Englishmen, who were their own countrymen.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up. and said they desired it
might not be left to them; For, says he, I am sure we ought to sentence
them to the gallows: and with that he gives an account how Will Atkins,
one of the three, had proposed to have all the five Englishmen join to-
gether, and murder all the Spaniards, when they were in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins, How,
Senhor Atkins, would you murder us all! What have you to say to that!
The hardened villain was so far from denying it, that he said it was true:
and, G--d o--n him, they would do it still, before they had done with
him. Well, but Senhor Atkins, says the Spaniard, what have we done to
you, that you would kill us'! And what would you get by killing us?
And what must we do to prevent your killing us'! Must we kill
you, or you kill us? Why will you put us to the necessity of this,
Senhor likins'. says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. Senhor
Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making a jest of it,
that, had he not been held by three men. and withal had no weapon near
him, it was thought he would have attempted tohave killed the Spaniard
in the middle of all the company. This hairbrain carriage obliged them
to consider seriously what was to be done: the two Englishmen, and the
Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of the opinion that they should
hang one of three, for an example to the rest: and that particularly it
should be he who had twice attempted'to commit murder with his hatchet;
and, indeed, there was some reason to believe he had done it, for the poor
savage was in such i miserable condition with the wound he had received,
that it was thought he could not live. But the governor Spaniard still
said no; it was an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he
would never consent to put an Englishman to death, though he had
murdered half of them: nay, he said,if he had been killed himself by an
Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that they should
pardon him.

The was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, that there
was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are moat apt to prevail,
when they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it: but then .it
was to be considered what should be done to keep them Mm doing the
mischief they designed; for all agreed, governor and all, that means were
to be used for preserving the society from danger. Alter a long debate,
it was agreed, first, that they should be disarmed, and not permitted to
have either gun, powder,.shot. sword, or any weapon: and should be
turned out of the society, and len to live where they would, and how
they would, by themselves: but that none of the rest, either Spaniards
or English, should convene with them, speak with them,or have any
thing to do with them: that they should be forbid to come within a
certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and if they altered to
commit any disorders, so as to spoil, bum, kill, or destroy any of the
corn, plantings, buildings. fences, or cattle belonging to the society, they
should die without mercy, and they would shoot them wherever they
cauld find them.

23 o
The govemor,a man of great humanity, musing upon the sentence,
considereda little. upon it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen.
said, Hold; you must reflect that it will be long are they can raise corn
and cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must therefore
allow them provisions: so he caused to be added, that they should have
a proportion of corn given them to last them eight months, and for seed
to sow, by which time they might be supposed to raise some of their own; .
that they should have six milch goats, {our he goats, and six kids given
them, as well for present subsistence as for a store; and that they should
have tools given them for their work in the fields, such as six hatchets, an
adze,a saw, and the like; but they should have none of these tools or
provisions, unless they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt
or injure any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society,and turned them out to shilt t'ot'
themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as neither content
to go away nor to stay; but, as there was no remedy, they went, pretend-
ing to go and choose a place where they would settle themselves; and
some provisions were given them, but no weapons.

About four or five days after, they came again for some victuals, and
gave the governor an account where they had pitched their tents, and
marked themselves out a habitation and plantation; and it was a very
convenient place, indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N. E., much
about the place where I providentially landed in my first voyage. when
l was driven out to sea, the Lord alone knows whither,in my foolish
attempt to sail round the island. .

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived them in
a manner like my first habitation, being close under the side of a hill
having some trees growing already on three sides of it, so that by
planting others, it would be very easily covered from the sight. unless
narrowly searched for. They desired some dried goats' skins, for beds
and covering, which were given them; and upon giving their words that
they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they
gave them hatchets, and what other tools they could spare: some peas,
barley, and rice for sowing; and, in a word, any thing they wanted,
except arms and ammunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six months. and had got in
their first harvest, though the quantity was but stnall,the parcel of land
they had planted being but little; for, indeed. having all their plantation)
to form, they had a great deal of work upon their hands; and when they
came to make boards and pots, and such things. they were quite out of
their element, and could make nothing of it; and when the rainy season
came on, for want of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain
dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling: and this humbled them
much: so they came and begged the Spaniards to help them, which they
very readily did ; and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the
bill for them, big enough to secure their corn and other things from the
rain; but it was but a poor place. at best. compared to mine, and especi-
ally as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and
made several new apartments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic took -
.these rogues, which together with the former villainy they had committed,
brought mischief enough upon them, and had very near been the ruin of
the whole colony. The three new associates began, it seems, to be weary '
of the laborious life they led. and that without hope of bettering their
circumstances; and a whim toolr them, that they would make a voyage
to the continent, from whence the savages came. and would try if the
could seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, and bring them
home, so to make them do the laborious part of their work for them.
The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no farther: but
they did nothing. and proposed nothing. but had either mischief in the
design. or mischiefiri the event: and, if I may give my opinion, they
seemed to be under a blast fl'om Heaven; for if we will not allow a visible
curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we reconcile the events of
things with the divine justice! It was certainly an apparent vengeance
on their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state they
were in; anti they showed not the least remorse for the crime. but added
new villanies to it, snch as the piece of monstrous cruelty of woundinga
poor slave, because he did not, or perhaps could not. understand to do
what he directed, and to wound him in such a manner as made him a
cripple all his life, and in 'a place where no surgeon or medicine could be
had for his cure; and what was still worse, the murderous intent, or, to
do justice to the crime, that the intentional murder, for such to be sure
it was. as was afterward the formed design they all laid, to murder the
Spaniards in cold blood, and in their sleep.

ARRIVAL 0F SAVAGE- '

Bur 1 leave observing. and return to the story :--The three fellows came
down to the Spaniards one morning, and in very humble terms desired to
be admitted to speak with them: the Spaniard very readily heard what
they had to say, which was thin--That they were tired of living in the
manner they did; and that they were not handy enough to make the
necessaries they wanted, and that having no help, they found they should
be starved; but i! the Spaniards would give them leave to take one of the
canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and ammunition
proportioned to their defense, they would go over to the main and seek
~their fortunes, and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them
with any other provisions.

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very honestly
represented to them the certain destruction they were running into; told!
them they had sufl'ered such hardships upon that very spot, that they
could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell them they would be starved
or murdered. and bade them consider of it.

The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they stayed
here, for they could not work, and would not work, and they could but be
ltarved abroad; and if they were murdered, there was an and of them;
they had no wives or children to cry alter them: and, in short, insisted
importunately upon theirdemand ; declaring they would go, whether they
would give them any arms or no.

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were resolved
to go, they should not go like naked men, and be in no condition to defend
themselves: and that though they could ill spare their flmrms, having
not enough for themselves, yet they would let them have two musliets, a
pistol and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet. which they thought was
suflicient for them. In a word, they accepted the otfer; and having baked
them bread enough to serve them a month, and given them as much goats'
flesh as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket of dried
grapes, a pot of fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in
the canoe fora voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles
broad. '

The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have carried
fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for them to
manage; but as they had a fair breeze, and flood tide with them, they did
well enough. They had made a mast of a long pole, and asail of four
large goat's skins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and
away they went merrily enough: the Spaniards called after them, Buen
triage; and no man ever thought of seeing them any more.

The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two honest
Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and comfortably they
lived, now these three turbulent fellows were gone; as for their coming
again, that was the remotest thing front their thoughts that could be
imagined: when, behold, alter two-and-twenty days' absence, one of the
Englishmen, being abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange men
coming toward him at a distance, with guns upon their shoulders.

Away runs the Englishman. as if he was bewitched,comes frightened
and amazed to the governorSpaniard, and tells him they were all undone,
for there were strangers landed upon the island, but could not tell who
The Spaniard pausing a while. says to him, How do you mean, you can
not tell who? They are the savages, to he sure--No, no, says the English-
man; they are men inclothea, with srmn--Nay. then, says the Spaniard,
why are you concerned! if they are not savages, they must be friends;
fiir there is no Christian nation upon earth but wiu do us good rather
than harm.

While they were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and stand-
ing without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed to them: they
presently knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceased.
But now the admiration was turned upon another question, via: What
could be the matter. and what made them come back again!

It was not long before they brought the men in. and inquiring where
they had been. and what they had been doing. they gave them a nu]
account of their voyage in a few words. viz: That they reached the land
in two days. or something less; but finding the people alarmed at their
coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, they durst
not go on shore, but sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till
they came to a great opening, by which they perceived that the land they
saw from our island was not the main, but and island; upon entering
that opening of the see, they saw another island on the right hand, north,
and several more west: and being resolved to land somewhere, they put
over to one ofthe islands which lay west, and went boldly on shore: that
they found the people very courteous and friendly to them ; and that they
gave them several roots and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable;
and the women as well as the men were very forward to supply them with
any thing they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a great _
way upon their heads.

They continued here four days; and inquired, as well as they could of
them, by signs, what nations were this way, and that way; and were told
of several tlerce and terrible people that lived almost every way. who, as -
they made known by signs to them, used to eat men; but as for them-
selves, they said, they never ate men or women. except only such as they
took in the wars: and then, they owned, they made a great feast. and ate
their prisoners. '

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of that kind: and '
they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon, and to two
fingers: and that their great king had two hundred prisoners now. which
he had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to make them fat
for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous of seeing
those prisoners; but the others mistaking them, thought they were
desirous to have some of them to carry away for their own eating; so
they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the
rising: which was to signify, that the next morningatsunrising they would
bring some for them; and, accordingly, the next morning, they brought
down five women and eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to
carry with them on their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows
and oxen down to a seaport town to victual a ship.

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their stomachs
turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do. To refuse the
prisoners would/have been the highest ad'ront to the savage gentry that
could be altered them, and what to do with them they knew not. How--
ever alter some debate, they resolved to accept or them; and, in return,
they gave the savages that brought them one of their hatchets. an old
key,a knife. and six or seven of their bullets; which. though they did not
understand their use, they seemed particularly pleased with; and then
tying the poor creatures' hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners
into the boat for our men.

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had them,
or else they that gave them this noble present would certainly have
expected that they should have gone to work withhcm, have killed two
or three of them the next morning. and perhaps hate invited the donors
to dinner. But having taken their leave, with all the respect and thanks
that could well pass between people, where, on either side. they under-
stood not one word they could say, they put ofl' with their boat. and
came back toward the first island; where, when they arrived, they set
eight or their prisoners at liberty, there being too many of them for their
occasion. ,

In their voyage. they endeavored to have some communication with
their prisoners; but it was impossible to make them understand any
thing; nothing they could say to them, or give them. or do for them. but
was looked upon as going to murder them. They first of all unbound
them ; but the poor creatures screamed at that. especially the women. as
if they had just felt the knife at their throats: for they immediately con-
cluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed. If they gave them
any thing to eat. it was the some thing; they then concluded. it was for
fear they should sink in tlesh,and so not be fat enough to kill. if they
looked at one of them more particularly, the party presently concluded,
it was to see-whether he or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first: nay,
after they had brought them quits over, and began to use them kindly,
and treat them well, still they expected every day to make a dinner or
supper for their new masters.

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or
journal or their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where heir new family
was; and being told that they had brought them on shore, and put them
into one of their huts. and were come up to beg some victuals for them,
they (the Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen, that is to say. the
whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place and see them; and did
so, and Friday's father with them.
When they came into the but. there they sat all bound; for when they
had brought them on shore. they bound their hands, that they might not

take the boat and make their escape; there, I say, they sat,all of them
stark naked. Fret, there were three men, lusty, comdy fellows, well

shaped. straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five years of age;
and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to forty; two more
not above four or five-and-twenty; and the filth, a tall, comely maiden,
about sixteen or seventeen. The women were well favored, agreeable
persons, both in shape and features, only tawny; and two of them. had
they been perfect white, would have passed for very handsome women,
even in London itself, having pleasant, agreeable countenancecs, and of a
very modest behavior: especially when they came afterward to heclothed
and dressed," they celled it, though that dress was very indifferent, it
must he confessed; of which hereafter.

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our Spaniards,
who were, to give them a just character, men of the best behavior, of the
most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good humor, that ever I met
with; and, in particular, of the most modesty, as will presently appear:
I say, the sight was very uncouth, to see three naked men and five naked
women, all together bound, and in the most miserable circumstances that
human nature could be supposed to be, viz: to be expecting every
moment to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked out, and then
to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's father, to
go in, and see, first, if he knew any of them, and then if he understood
any of their speech. As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously
at them, but knew none of them; neither could any of them understand
a word he said, or a sign he could make, except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end. which was to satisfy them
that the men into whose bands they were fallen were Christians; that
they abhorred eating men or women; and that they might be sure they
would not be killed. As soon as they were assured of this, they dis-
covered such a joy, and by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is
hard to describe; for, it seems, they were of several nations.

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place, to
ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to work for the men
who had brought them away, to save their lives; at which they all fell a
dancing; and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that, any
thing that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that they
were willing to work.

The governor, who found that the having women among them would
presently be attended with some inconvenience. and might occasion
some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intended
to do with these women, and how they intended to use them, whether as
servants or as women! One of the Englithmen answered very boldly
and readily, that they would use them as both; to which the governor
said. i am not going to restrain you from it; you are your own masters
as to that; but this I think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels
among you. and l desire it of you for that reason only, viz: that you will
all engage, that if any of you take any of these women. as a woman or
wife, that he shall take but one: and that having taken one, none else
shall touch her; for though we cannot marry any one of you. yet it is
but reasonable that while you stay here, the woman any of you takes
should be maintained by the man that takes her. and should be his wife;
I mean, says he, while he continues here, and that none else shall have
any thing to do with her. All this a ppeared so just, that every one
agreed to it without any difiiculty.

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if they designed to take any
of them! But every one of them answered no: some of them said they
had wives in Spain.and the others did not like women that were not Chris-
ttans: and all together declared that they would not touch one of them:
which was an instance of such virtue as l have not met with in all my
travels. 0n the other hand. to be short, the five Englishmen took them
every one a wife. that is to say, a temporary wife; so they set ups new
form ot'living; for the Spaniards and Friday's father lived in my old habi-
tation, which they had enlarged exceedingly within. The three servants
which were taken in the late battle of the savages lived with them; and
these carried on the main part of the colony, supplied all the rest with
food. and assisted them in any thing as they could, or as they found
necessity required.

But the wonder of this story was. how five such refractory ill matched
fellows, should agree about these women, and that two of them should
not pitch upon the same woman. especially seeing two or three of them
'were, without comparison. more agreeable than the others: but they took
a good way enough to prevent quarrelling among themselves; for they
set the five women by themselves in one of their huts, and they went all
into the other hut, and drew lots among them who should choose first.

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where
the poor naked creatures were. and fetched out her!" chose; and it was
worth observing. that he that chose first took her that was reckoned the
homeliest and oldest of the five. which made mirth enough among the
rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it: but the fellow considered
better than any of them. that it was application and Insiness they were
to expect assistance in. as much as in any thing else; and she proved the
best wife of all the parcel.

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and fetched
out one by one, the tenors of their condition returned upon them again.
and they firmly believed they were now going to be devoured. Accord-
ingly, when the English sailor came in and fetched out one of them, the
rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her. and took their
leave of her with such agonies and allcctiou. as would have grieved the
hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible for the Englishmen to
satisfy them that they were not to be immediately murdered, till they
fetched the old man,l-'riday's father. who immediately let them know
that the five men, who had fetched them out one by one, had chosen them
for their wives.

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a little
over. the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped them;
and in a few hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent for
their lodging apart; for those they had already were crowded with their
tools. household stutf. and provisions. The three wicked ones had
pitched farthest oh, and the two honest ones nearer, but both on the north
shore of the island, so that they continued separate as before; and thus.
my island was peopled in three places; and. as 1 might say, three towns
were begun to he built.

And here it is very well worth observing, that, as it often happens in
the world (what the wise ends of God's providence are in such adispo-
sition of things, I can not say). the two honest fellows had the two worst
wives; and the three reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging. that
were fit for nothing, and" neither seemed born to do themselves good, nor
any one else, had three clever, diligent, careful, and ingenious wivefi; not
that the first two were bad wives. as to their temper or humor. for all the
five were most willing.quiet, pmive, and subjected creatures. rather like
slaves than wives; but my meaning is, they were not alike capable, in-
genious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.

Another observation I must make, to the honor of a diligent applica-
tion, on one hand, and to the disgrace ofa slothful, negligent, idle temperg
on the other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the several im-
provements, plantings, and management of the several little colonies, the
two men had so far outgone the three, that there was no comparison.
They had, indeed, both of them as much ground laid out for corn as they
wanted, and the reason was, because, awarding to my rule, nature dic-
_tated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn than they wanted; but
the difl'erence of the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, and, in-
deed. of every thing else, was easy to be seen at first view.

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts,
so that when you came to the place. nothing was to be seen but a wood:
and though they had twice had their plantation demolished. once by their
own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shown in its place,
yet they had restored'all again.and every thing was thriving and flourish-
ing about them: they had grapes planted in order. and managed like a
vineyard, though they had themselves never seen any thing of that kind;
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good again
as any of the others. They had also found themselves out a retreat in
the thickest part of the woods; where. though there was not a natural
cave. as I had found, yet they made one with incessant labor of their
hands. and where. when the mischief which followed happened. they
secured their wives and children. so as they could never be found; they
having, by sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood which. as I
said, grew so readily, made the grove unpassable. except in some places
where they climbed up to get over the outside part, and then went on by
ways of their own leaving.

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them. though they were much
civilized by their settlement compared to what they were before, and
were not so quarrelsorne, having not the same opportunity; yet one of
the certain companions ot'a profiigate mind never left them. and that
.was theiridleness. it is true, they planted corn, and made fences; but
Solomon's words were never better verified than in them, "I went by the
vineyard of the slothful, and it was all overgrown with thorns ;" for when
the Spaniards came to view their crop, they could not see it in some
places for weed's; the hedge had several gaps in it, where the wild goals
had got in and eaten up the corn: perhaps here and there a dead bush
was crammed in to stop them out for the present, but it was only shutting
the stable--door after the steed was stolen: whereas, when they looked on
the colony of the other two. there was the very face of industry and suc-
cess upon all they did; there was not a weed to be seen in all their corn,
ora gap in any of their hedges; and they, on the other hand, verified
Solomon's words in another place, "that the diligent hand maketh rich ;"
for every thing grew and thrived. and they had plenty within and with-
out; they had more tame cattle than the others. more utensils and neces-
saries within doors. and yet more plseaure and diversion too.

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly within
doors. and having learned the English ways of dressing and cooking from
one of the other Englishmen. who, as I said, was a cook's mute on board
the ship, they dressed their husbands' victuals very nicely and well;
whereas the others could not be brought to understand it; but then the
husband. who, as I say, had been cook's mate. did it himself. But as for _
the husbands ot' the three wives, they ioitered about, fetched turtles'
eggs. and caught fish and birds; in a word, any thing but labor, and they
fared accordingly. The diligent lived well and comfortably; and the
slothful lived hard and beggarly; and so. I believe, generally speaking, it
is all over the world.

But I now come to a scene difl'erent from all that had happened before,
either to them or to me; and the original of the story was this: Early
one morning. there came on shore five or six canoes of Indiana or sava-
ges, call them which you please, and there is_ no room to doubt they
came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves; but that part was
now so familiarto the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not
concern themselves about it," I did: but having been made sensible,
by their experience, that their only business was to lie concealed, and
that, if they were not seen by any of the savages, they would go ofl' again
quietly, when their business wasdone, having, as yet, not the least notion
of there being any inhabitants in the island; I say, having been made
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but give notice to all the three
plantations to keep within doors, and not to show themselves, only plac-
ing a scout in a proper place, to give notice when the boats went to sea
again.

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled all these meas-
ures, and made it known among the savages that there were inhabitants
there; which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole colony.
Alter the canoes with the savages were gone 06', the Spaniards peeped
abroad again; and some of them had the curiosity to go to the place
where they had been,to see what they had been doing. Here, to their
great surprise, they found three savages lelt behind, and lying fast asleep
upon the ground. It was supposed they had either been so goiged' with
their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they were 'l'allen asleep, and would
not stir when the others went, or they had wandered into the woods, and
did not come back in time to be taken in.

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight. and perfectly ata
loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as it happened, was with them,
and his advice was asked, but he professed he knew not what to do. As
for slaves, they had enough already; and as to killing them, they were
none of them inclined to that: the Spanish governor told me, they could
not think of shedding innocent blood: for as to them, the poor creatures
had done them no wrong, invaded none of their property, and they
thought they had no just quarrel against them, to take away their lives.
And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe, that let the
accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I
never met with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in any foreign
country,who were so universally modest, tern perale.vi rluous, so very good
humored. and so courteous, as these Spaniards; and as to cruelty. they
had nothing of it in their very nature: no inhumanity, no barbarity, no
outrageous passions; and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their hearinthe insuflerable
usage of the three Englishmen; and their justice and humanity appeared
now in the case of the savages, as above. After some consultation,
they resolved upon this; that they would lie still a while longer, till, if
possible. these three m'en might be gone. But then the governor Spaniard
recollected,that the savages had no boat; and if they were lelt to rove
about the island, they would certainly discover that there were inhabi-
276 aovss'ruass or

tents in it: and so they should be undone that way. Upon this they
went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep still. and so they
rewlved to awaken them, and take them prisoners; and they did so. The
poor fellows were strangely frightened when they were seized upon and
bound; and afraid, like the women, that they should be murdered and
eaten; for it seems those people think all the world does as they do, eat-
ing men's flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that, and away they
carried them.

It was very happy for them that they did not carry them home to their
castle. I mean to my pdaca under the hill; but they carried them first to
the bower, where was the chief of their country work, such as the keep-
ing the goats, the planting the corn, ates. and afterward they carried
them to the habitations of the two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for them
to do: and whether it was by negligence in guarding them, or that they
thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I know. not, but one of
them ran away, and taking to the woods, they could never hear of him
any more. . .

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon alter, in some
other boats or canoes of savages who came on shore three or four weeks
afterward; and who. carrying on their revels as usual, went off in two
days" time. This thought terrified them exceedingly; for they concluded,
and that not without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came 'home
safe among hiscomrades, he would certainly give them an account that
there were people in the island, and also how few and week they were;
for this savage, as I observed before, had never been told, and it was very
happy he had not, how many there were. or where they lived: nor had he
ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns, much less had they shown
him any of their other retired places; such as the cave in the valley, or
the new retreat which the two Englishmen had made, and the like.

The first testimony they had that this fellow had given intelligence of
them was, that about two months alter this, six canoes of savages, with
about seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the north
side of the island, where they never used to come before, and landed
about an hour alter sunrise, at a convenient place, about a mile from the
habitation of the two Englishmen, where thisescaped man had been kept.
As the Spaniard governor said, had they been all there, the damage would
not have been so much, for not a man of them would have escaped: but
the case difl'ered now very much, for two men to filly was too much odds.
The two men had'the happiness to discover them abouts league otl', so
that it was above an hour before they landed; and as they landed a mile
from their huts, it was some time before they could come at them. Now,
having great reason to believe that they were betrayed,the first thing
they did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause two of the
three men whom they brought with the women (who it seems, proved
very thithful to them) to lead them with their two wives, and whatever
they could carry away with them, to their retired places in the woods
which! have spoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows hand
and foot, till they heard farther.

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore. and that
they had bent their courserlirectly that way, they opened the fences where
the milch goats were kept. and drove them all out; leaving their goats to
straggle in the woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might think
they were all bred wild; but the rogue who came with them was too cun-
ning for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they went directly
to the place.

When the two poor frightend men had secured their wives and goods,
they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with the women,
and who was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards with all
speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy help; and, in the mean-
time, they took their arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated
toward the place in the wood where their wives were sent; keeping at a
distance. yet so that they might see, it' possible, which way the savages took.

They had not gone fir, but that from a rising ground they could see
the little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, and,
in a moment more. could seeall their huts and household stufl' flaming
up together, to their great grief and mortiflcation: for they had a very
. great loss. to them immovable, at least for some time. They kept their

station for a while, till they found the savages, like wild beasts. spread
themselves all over the place, rummaging every way and every place
they could think of, in search of prey; and in particular for the people,
of whom, now, it plainly appeared they had intelligence.

The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure where
they stood, because it was likely some of the wild people might come
that way, and they might come too many together, thought it proper to
make another retreat about half a mile farther: believing, as it afierward
happened, that the farther they strolled the fewer would be together.

OF THE! AFTEEWABD ARRIVE--A GENERAL BATH-HEB SAVAGE All
OVEBCOIE, AND TEAKQUILIJTY 2310le-

Tssm next halt was at the entrance into a very thick grown part of the
woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and
vastly large; and in this tree they both took their standing, resolving to
see there what might oll'er. They had not stood there long, before two or
the savages appeared running directly that way, as if they already had
notice where they stood. and were coming up to attack them; and a little
way farther they espied three more coming after; them, and five more
beyond them, all coming the same way: beside which, they saw seven or
eight more at a distance, running another way; tor, in a word, they ran
every way, like sportsmen heating for their game.

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should stand
and keep their posture, or fly: but. after a very short debate with them-
selves, they considered, that if the savages ranged the country thus before
help came, they might perhaps find out their retreat in the woods. and
then all would be lost: so they resolved to stand them there; and if they
were too many to deal with, then they would get up to the top of the
tree, fiom whence they doubted not to defend themselves, fire excepted,
as long as their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were
landed, which was near fifty, were to attack them.

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should
fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party,
by which the two and the five that followed would be separated: at
length they resolved to let the first two pass by, unless they should spy
them in the tree, and come to attack them. The first two savages con-
firmed them also in this regulation, by turning a little item them toward
another part of the wood; but the three. and the five after them. came
forward directly to the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were
there. Seeing'them come so straight toward them, they resolved to take
them in a line as they came; and as they resolved to fire but one ata
time, perhaps the first shot might hit them all three: for which purpose,
the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into his piece;
and having a fair loophole, as it were, from a broken hole in the tree, he
took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till they were within about
thirty yards of the tree, so that he could not miss.

While they were thus waiting. and the savages came on. they plainly
saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped from
them; and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible,
he should not escape. though they should both fire: so the other stood
ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at the first shot, he should
be sure to have a second. But the first was too good a marksman to miss
his aim: for as the savages kept near one another, a little behind. in a
line. he fired. and hit two of them directly: the foremost was killed out-
right. being shot in the head; the second, which was the runaway Indian,
was shot through the body,and fell, but was not quite deed; and the
third had a little scratch on the shoulder. perhaps by the same ball that
went through the body of the second; and being dreadfully fiightened,
though not so much hurt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and
yelling in a hideous manner.
The live that were behind. more frightened with the noise than sensible
of the danger, stood still at first; tor the woods made the sound a thou-
sand times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattling from one side to
another, and the_fowls rising from all parts, screaming. and every sort
making a different noise, according to their kind; just as it was when I
fired the first gun that perhaps was ever shot off in the island.

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the matter
was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the place where their com-
panions lay,in scondition miserable enough; and here the poor ignorant
creatures, not sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief,
stood all of a huddle over the wounded man, talking. and as may be
supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be hurt; and who, it is very
rational to believe. told them, thata flash of tire first. and immediately
alter that thunder (tom their gods, had killed those two and wounded
him; this, I say. is rational; for that nothing is more certain than that,
as they saw no man near them," they had never heard a gun in all their
lives, nor so much as heard of a gun; neither knew they any thing of
killing and wounding at a distance with fire and bullets? if they had,
one might reasonably believe they would not have stood so unconcerned
in viewing the fate of their fellows, without some apprehension of their
own.

Our two men, though," they confessed to me, it grieved them to be
obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who at the same time, had no
notion of their danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and the
first having loaded his piece again, resolved to let fiy both together
among them: and singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they shot
together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them; the filth.
frightened even to death, though not hurt. fell with the rest; so that our
men seeing them all fall together, thought they killed them all._

The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men came
boldly out from the tree betbrs they had charged their guns, which was a
wrong step; and they were under some surprise when they came to the
place, and found no less than four of them alive, and of them two very
little hurt, and one not at all: this obliged them to fall upon them with the
stocks of their muskets; and first they made sure of the runaway savage,
that had been the cause of all the mischief, and of another that was hurt
in the knee, and put them out of their pain: then the man that was hurt
not at all came and kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up,
and made piteous moans to them. by gestures and signs, for his life, but
could not say one word to them that they could understand. However,
they made signs to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by; and one
of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope twined. which he had by great
chance in his pocket, tied, his two hands behind him, and there they left
him: and with what speed they could made alter the other two, which
were gone before. fearing they, or any more of them, should find the way
to their covered place in the Woods, where their wives, and the few good:
they had left, lay. They came once in sight of the two men, but it was
at a great distance; however, they had the satisfaction to see them cross
over a valley toward the sea, quite the contrary way from that which led
to their retreat. which they were afraid of; and being satisfied with that,
they went back to the tree where they let! their prisoner, who,as they
supposed, was delivered by his comrades, for he was gone, and the two
pieces or rope-yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just at the foot
of the tree._

They were now in as great concern as belbre, not knowing what course
to talte, or how near the enemy might be, or in what numbers; so they
resolved to go away to the place where their wives were, to see if all was
well there,and to make them easy, who were in fright enough to be sure;
for though the savages were their own countryfolk, yet they were most
terribly afraid of them,and perhaps the more for the knowledge they
had of them.

When they came there. they found the savages had been in the wood,
and very near that place, but had not found it: for it was indeed inac-
cessible, by the trees standing so thick, as betbre, unless the persons seek-
ing it had been directed by those that knew it, which these did not: they
found, therefore, every thing very safe, only the women in a terrible
fright. While they were here, they had the comfort to have seven of the
Spaniards come to their assistance; the other ten, with their servants,
and old Friday.l mean Friday's father. were gone in a body to defend
their bower, and the corn and cattle that was kept there. in case the env-
ages should have rowed over to that side of the country; but they did not.
spread so far. With the seven Spaniards came one of the three savages,
who.asl said, were their prisoners formerly : and with them also came the
savage whom the Englishmen had len. bound hand and foot at the tree;
for it seems they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven men. and
unbound the eighth. and brought him along with them; where, however,
they were obliged to bind him again," they had the two others who
were left when the third ran away.

The prisoners now began to bea burden to them ; and they were so afraid
of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill them all, believing
they were under an absolute necessity to do so, for their own preser
vation. However, the Spaniard governor would not consent to it; but
ordered, for the present, that they should be sent out of the way, to my
old cave in the valleyiand be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard
them; and give them food for their subsistence. which was done; and
they were bound there hand and foot for that night.

When the Spaniards came. the two Englishmen were so encouraged,
that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there; but
taking five of the Spaniards and themselves. with four muskets and a pistol
among them.and two stoutquarter--staves. away they went in questof the
savages. And first they came to the tree where the men lay that had
been killed: but it was easy to see that some more of the savages had been
there, for they had attempted to carry their dead men away. and had
dragged two of theme good way. but had given it over. From thence
they' advanced to the first rising ground, where they had stood and
seen their camp destroyed. and where they had the mortiflcation still
to see some of the smoke: but neither could they here see any of the'
savages.

They then resolved. though with all possible caution. to go forward.
toward their ruined plantation; but a little before they came thither,
coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all em barked
again in their canoes. in order to be gone. They seemed sorry. at first,
that there was no way to come at them, to give them a parting blow;
but, upon the whole, they were very well satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their improve-
ments destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them to rebuild,
and to assist them with needful supplies. Their three countrymen, who

. were not yet noted for having the least inclination to do any good, yet as
soon as they heard of it (for they living remote eastward, knew nothing
of the matter till all was over). came and altered their help and assistance,
and did, very friendly. work for several days, to restore their habitation,
and make necessaries for them. And thus, in a little time, they were set
upon their legs again.

About two days after this. they had the farther satisfaction of seeing
three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore. and at some distance
from them. two drowned men: by which they had reason to believe that
they had met with astorm at sea. which had overset some of them: for it
had blown very hard the night alter they went all.

However,aa some might miscarry,so. on the other hand, enough of
them escaped to inform the rest. as well of what they had done as of
what had happened to them. and to whet them on to another enterprise
of the same nature; which they, it seems. resolved to attempt with suf-
ficient force to carry all before them: for'exeept what the first man had
told them -of inhabitants, they could say little of it of their own knowl-
edge, for they never saw one man: and the fellow being killed that had
affirmed it, they had no other witness to confirm it to them.

It Was five or six months afler this before they heard any more of the
savages, in which time our men were in hopes they had either forgot
their former bad luck, or given over hopes of better; when, on a sudden,
they were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less than eight-
and-twenty canoes. full of savages. armed with bows and arrows, great
clubs. wooden swords, and such-like engines of war, and they brought such

24
numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost
consternation.

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side of
the island. our men had that night to consult and consider what to do;
and, in the first place. knowing that their being entirely concealed was
their only safety before, and would be much more so now. while the
number of their enemies was so great, they therefore resolved. first ot'all,
to take down the huts which were built for the two Englishmen. and
drive away their goats to the old cave; because they supposed the savages
would go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to play the old game over
again, though they did not new land within two leagues of it. in the
next place, they drove away all the flocks of goats they had at the old
bower. as I called it. which belonged to the Spaniards; and. in short, left
as little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was possible: and the
next morning early they posted themselves, with all their force, at the
plantation of the two inen, to wait for their coming. As they guessed,
so it happened: these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east end
of the island, came ranging along the shore. directly toward the place. to
the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could judge.
Our army was but small. indeed; but that which was worse, they had
not arms for all their number neither. The whole account, it seems,
stood thus: first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old
Friday. or'l-'riday's father. the three slaves taken with the women, who
proved very faithful, and three other slaves, who lived with the Spaniards.
To arm these they had eleven muskets, five pistols, three fowling-pieces,
five mhskets or fowling-pieces which were taken by me from the mutin-
ous seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and three old halberds.

To their slaves they did not give either musket, or fuses, but they had
every one a halberd. or a long stsfl', like a quarter-stem with a great spike
of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also. every
one of our men had a hatchet. Two of the women could not he prevailed
upon but they would come into the fight; and they had bows and arrows,
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when the first action
happened, which I have spoken of. where the Indians fought with one
another; and the women had hatchets too.

The Spaniard governor whom ] described so often commanded the
whole; and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness,
was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. The savages
came forward like lions; and our men, which was the worst of their fate,
had no advantage in their situation: only that Will Atkins. who now
proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was planted just behind a
small thicket of bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let the first
of them pass by. and then fire into the middle of them,and as soon as he
had tired, to make his retreat as nimhly as he could round a part of theaoamsox 930503. 283

wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards, where they stood, having a
thicket of trees before them.

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in
heaps. out of all manner of order. and Will Atkins let about filty of them
pass by; then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, he orders three
of his men to lire, having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets
a-piece, about aa.big as large pistol bullets. How many they killed or
wounded they knew not, but the consternation and surprise was inex-
pressible among the savages; they were frightened to the last degree to
hear such a dreadful noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt. but
see nobody that did it; when, in the middle of their fright, Will Atkins
and his other three let fly again among the thickest of them; and in less
than a minute, the first three, being loaded again, gave them a third
volley.

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately as soon as they had
third," they were ordered todo, or had the rest of the body been at hand
to have poured in their shot continually, the savages had been ell'eetually
routed; for the terror that was among them came principally from this,
viz: that they were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning, and
could see nobody that hurt them; but Will Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat; some of the savages, who were at a distance spying
them, came upon them behind; and though Atkins and his men tired at
them also two or three times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as
they could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow
Englishmen with their arrows, as they did alterward one Spaniard and
one of the Indian slaves who came with the women. This slave was a
most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, killing live of them
with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed slaves and a
hatchet.

Our men being thus hard laid at. Atkins wounded. and two other men
killed. retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and the Spaniards, alter
firing three volleys upon them. retreated also; for their number was so
great, and they were so desperate, that though above filly of them were
killed, and more than as many wounded, yet they came on in the teeth
of our men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it
was observed that their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were
made outrageous by their wounds, and fought like madmen.

When our men retreated, they lelt the Spaniard and the Englishman
that were killed'behind them; and the savages, when they came up to
them, killed them over again in a wretched manner, breaking their arms.
legs, and heads with their clubs and wooden swords, like true savages;
but finding our men were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but
drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems, their custom, and
shouted twice in token of their victoryLaher which they had the
mortiheation to see several of their wounded men fall, dying with the
mere loss of blood. '

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon
a rising ground. Atkins, though he was <<funded, would have had them
march and charge again all together at once; but the Spaniard replied,
Senhor Atkins, you see how their wounded men tight: let them alone till
morning; all the wounded men will be stifl' and sore with their wounds,
and faint with the loss of blood, and so we shall have the fewer to engage.
This advice was good; but_Will Atkins replied merrily, That is true.
senhor, and so shall 1 too: and that is the reason I would go on while]
am warm. Well. Senhor Atkins, says the Spaniard, you have behaved
gsllantly. and done your part; we will light for you if you eon not come
on; but I think it best to stay till morning: so they waited.

But as it was aclear moonlight night, and they found the savagesin
great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a great noise and
hurry among them where they lay, they afterward resolved to fell upon
them in the night. especially if they could come to give them but one
volley before they were discovered, which they had a fair opportunity to
do; for one of the Englishmen, in whose quarter It was where the fight
began, led them around between the woods and the seaside westward,
and then turning short south, they came so near where the thickest of
them lay, that before they were seen or heard, eight of them fired in
among them, and did dreadful execution upon them; in half a minute
more eight others fired alter them, pouring in their small shot in such a
quantity that abundance were killed and wounded; and all this while
they were not able to see who hurt them or which way to fly,

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then
divided themselves in three bodies. and resolved to fall in among them all
together. They had in each body eight persons: that is to say, twenty-
two. and the two women, who. by the way, fought desperately. They
divided the tire-arms equally in each party, and so the haldherds and
slaves. They would have had the women kept back, but they said they
were resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus formed their
little army, they marched out from among the trees, and came up to the
teeth of the enemy. shouting and hallooing as loud as they could; the
savages stood all together, but were in the utmost confusion. hearing the
noise of our men shouting from three quarters together: they would have
fought if they had seen us: for as soon as we came near enough to be
seen some arrows were shot. and poor old Friday was wounded, though
not dangerously; but our then gave them no time, but. running up to
them, fired among them three ways. and then fell in with the hutt~ends
of their muskets, their swords, armed-slaves, and hatchets, and laid about
them so well, that, in a word, they set' up a dismal screaming and howl-
ing. flying to save their lives which way soever they could.
Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally wounded
in the two fights about one hundred and eighty of them; the rest, being
frightened out of their wits, scoured through the woods and over the hills
with all the speed fear and nimble feet could help them to; and as we
did not trouble ourselves much to pursue 'them, they got all together to
the seaside where they landed, and when their canoes lay. But their
disaster was not at an end yet: for it blew a terrible storm of wind that
evening from the sea,so that it was impossible for them to go 08'; nay,
the storm continuing all night, when the tide came up, their canoes were
most of them driven by the surge of the see so high upon the shore, that
it required infinite toil to get them ofl'; and some of them were even
dashed to pieces against the beach or against one another.

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that night;
but, having refreshed themselves as well as they could, they resolved to
march to that part of the island where the savages were fled, and see
what posture they were in. This necessarily led them over-the place
where the fight had been, and where they found several of the poor crea-
tures not quite deed, and yet past recovering life; a sight disagreeable
enough to generous minds; for a truly great man, though obliged by the
law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his misery. How-
ever, there was no need to give any orders in this case; for their own sav-
ages, who were their servants, dispatched these poor creatures with their
hatcheta.

At length they came in view of the place where the more miserable
remains of the savages' army lay, where there appeared about a hundred
still: their posture was generally sitting upon the ground, with their
knees up toward their mouth, and the head put between the two hands,
leanlng down upon the knees.

When our men came within two musket-shots of them. the Spaniard
governor ordered two muskets to be tired without ball to alarm them:
this he did, that by their countenance he might know what to expect,
viz: whether they were still in heart to light, or were so heartily beaten
as to be dispirited and discouragcdmnll so he might manage accordingly.
This stratsgem took; for as soon as the savages heard the first gun and
saw the flash of the second, they started up upon their feet in the great-
est consternation imaginable: and as our men advanced swinly toward
them, they all ran screaming and yelling away. with a kind of howling
noise, which our men did not understand, and had never heard before:
and thus they ran up the hills into the country.

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and they
had all gone away to see: but they did not then consider that this might
probabty have heal the occasion of their coming again in such multi-
tudes as not to be resisted, or at least to come so many and so otten as
would quite desolate the island and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore,
who. notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them, proved the
best counselor in this case: his advice was to talte the advantage that
ofi'ered, and clap in between them and their boats, and so deprive them of
the capacity of ever returning any more to plague the island.

They consulted long about this; and some were against it, for fear of
making the.wretches fly to the woods and live there desperate, and so
they should have them to hunt like wild beasts.be afraid tostirout about
their business, and have their plantation continually rified, all their lame
goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of continual distress.

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred men
than with a hundred nations:-that as they must destroy their boats. so
they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. In
a word, he showed them the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came
into it: so they went to work immediately with the boats, and, getting
some dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them
on fire; but they were so wet that they would not burn; however, the
fire so burnt the upper part that it soon made them unfit for swimming
in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw what they were about. some
of them came running out oaths woods. and, coming as near as they
could to our men, kneeled down and cried, "0a, 0a, Waramokoa." and
some other words of theirlanguage which none ot' the others understood
any thing of; but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was
easy to understand they begged to have their boats spared, and that they
would be gone, and never come there again. But our men were now
satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves, or to save their
colony, but efi'ectually to prevent any of these people from ever going
home again: depending upon this, that if even so much as one of them
got back into their country to tell the story, the colony was undone; so
that, letting them know that they should not have any mercy, they fell to
work with their canoes, and destroyed them every one that the storm had
not destroyed before; at the sight of which the savages raised a hideous
cry in the woods, which our people heard plain enough. alter which they
ran about the island like distracted men; so that, in a word. our men did
not really know at first what to do with them. Nor did the Spaniards,
with all their prudence, consider. that while they made those people thus
desperate, they ought to have kept a good guard at the same time upon
their plantations; for though. it is true, they had driven away their cattle,
and the Indians did not find out their main retreat. I mean my old castle
at the hill, nor the cave in the valley. yet they found out my plantation
at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting
about it; trod all the corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes,
being just then almost ripe, and did our men an inestimabls damage,
though to themselves not one t'srthing's worth of service.

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet they
m in no condition'to pursue them. or hunt them up and down; for as
they were too nimble of foot for our men when they found them single,
to our men durst not go abroad single, for fear of being surrounded with
their numbers. The best was, they had no weapons; for though they
had how's, they had no arrows left. nor any materials to make any; nor
had they any edge-tool or weapon among them. .

The extremity and distreu they were reduced to was great, and indeed
deplorable; but, at the same time, our men were also brought to very bad
circumstances by them; for, though their retreats were preserved, yet
their provision was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled; and what to do,
or which way to turn themselves. they knew not. The only refuge they
had now was the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and
some little corn which grew there, and the plantation of the three Eng-
lishmen, Will Atkins and his comrades, who were now reduced to two.
one of them being killed by an arrow, which struck him on the side of
the head. just under the temples,so that he never spoke more: and it
was very remarkable that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the
poor savage slave with his hatchet, and who afterward intended to
have murdered the Spaniards.

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine was
at any time after I first discovered the grains of barley and rice, and got
into the manner of planting and raising my corn and my tame cattle;
for now they had, as I may say, a hundred wolves upon the island, which
would devour every thing they could come at, yet could be hardly come
at themselves. .

When they saw what their circumstanws were, the first thing they
concluded was that they would, if possible. drive them up to the firther
part of the island, southward, that if any more savages came on shore
they might not and one another: then that they would daily hunt and
harass them,and kill as many as they could come at, till they had re-
duced their number i and if they could at last tame them and 'bring them
toany thing. they would give them corn. and teach them how to plant,
and live upon their daily labor.

In order to this, they so fojlowed them. and so terrified them with their
guns. that in a few days. ifany ofthem tireda gun at an Indian, if he did
not hit him, yet he would fall down for fearzand so dreadfully frightened
they were, that they kept out of sight farther and farther, till at last our
men following them and almost every day killing or wounding some of
them. they kept up in the woods or hollow places so much, that it re~
dueed them to the utmost misery for want of food: and many were after-
ward found dead in the woods, without any hurt, absolutely starved to
death. '

When our men found this. it made their hearts relent, and pity moved
them. especially the Spaniard governor, who was the most gentleman-288 measures or '

like, generousominded man that I ever met with in my life: and he pro-
posed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and bring him to understand
what they meant, so bar as to be able to act as interpreter, and go among
them, and see if they might be brought to some conditions that might be
depended upon to save their lives and do us no harm.

It was some while before any of them could be taken; but, being weal:
and half starved, one of them was at last surprised and made prisoner.
He was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; but finding him-
self kindly used, and victuale given him, and no violence ofl'ered him, he
at last grew tractable, and came to himself. They brought old Friday to
him, who talkedoiten with him, and told him how kind the others would
be to them all: that they would not only save their lives, but would give
them part of the island to live in, provided they would give satisfaction
that they would keep in their own bounds. and not come beyond it to
injure or prejudice others; and that they should have corn given them to
plant, and make it grow for their bread, and some bread given them for
their present subsistence: and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk
with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they said to it; assuring
them that if they did not agree immediately they should be all destroyed.

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to
about thirtyvseven, closed with the proposal at the first ofi'er, and begged
to have some food given them; upon which twelve Spaniards and two
Englishmen. well armed, with three Indian slaves and old Friday,
marched to the place where they were. The three Indian slaves carried
them a large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in
the sun, and three live goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of a
hill, where they sat down. ate their provisions very thankfully, and were
the most faithful fellows to their words that could be thought of; for,
except when they came to beg victuals and directions, they never came
out of their bounds: and there they lived when I came to the island, and
1 went to see them.

They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed tame
goats, and milk them: they wanted nothing but wives, and they soon
would have been a nation. They were confined to a neck of land sur-
rounded with high rocks behind them,and lying plain toward the sea
before them, on the southeast corner of the island. They had land
enough, and it was very good and fruitful; about a mile and a half broad,
and three or four miles in length.

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made for
myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and three or four knives;
and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent creatures that ever
were heard of.

. After this, the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect to the
savages, till I came to revisit them, which was about four years after;
not but that, now and then. some canoes of savages came on shore for
their. triumpbal, unnatural feasts; but as they were of several nations,
and perhaps had never heard of those that came before. or the reason of
it. they did not make any search or inquiry after their countrymen; and
if they had, it would have been very hard to have found them out.

Thus. I think! have given a full account of all that happened to them
till my return, at least, that was worth notice. The Indians or savages
were wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently went among
them; but forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians coming to
them, because they would not have their settlement betrayed again. One
thing was very remarkable, viz: that they taught the savages to make
wicker-work, or baskets. but they soon outdid their masters; for they
made abundance of most ingenious things in wicker-work, particularly all
sorts of baskets. sieves, birdcages, cupboards, etc.; as also chairs to sit on,
stools, beds, couches, and abundance of other things; being very in-
genious at such work when they were once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we furnished
them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pickaxes, and' all things of that
kind which they could want. With the help of those tools they were so
very handy, that they came at last to build up their huts or houses very
handsomely, raddling or working it up like basket-work all the way
round; which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked
very odd, but was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat as against
all sorts of vermin; and our nzen were so taken with it, that they got the
wild savages to come and do the like for them; so that when Ieame to
see the two Englishmen's colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if they
all lived like bees in a hive. As for Will Atkins, who was now become a
very industrious, useful, and sober fellow, he had made himself such a
tent of basket-work, as I believe. was never seen; it was one hundred and'
twenty paces round on the outside," I measured by my steps; the walls
were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty-two in
number, and very strong, standing about seven feet high; in the middlS
was another not above twenty-two paces round. but built stronger, being
octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood eight very strong
posts: round the top of which he laid strong pieces, pinned together with
wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for a roof of eight rollers, -
very handsome,I assure you, and joined together very well, though he
had no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made himself too, out
of the old iron that I had left there; and. indeed, this fellow showed
abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had no knowledge of:
he made him a forge. with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire; he
made himself charcoal for his work; and he formed out of the iron crown
is middling good anvil to hammer upon: in this manner he made many
things, but especially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges. But

25
to return to the house: Alter he had pitched tho roof of his innermost
tent, he worked it up between the ralters with basket~worlt, so firm. and
thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice straw, and over that a
large leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry as
it it had been tiled or slated. Indeed, he owned that the savages had
made the basket-work for him. The outer circuit was covered as a leanv
to all round this inner apartment. and long rafters lay from the thirty-
two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty feet
distant; so that there was a space like a walk within the outer wicker
wall and without the inner, near twenty feet wide.

The inner place he partitioned 06' with the same wicker-work. but
much hirer; and divided into six apartmenta,so that he had six rooms
on a floor, and out of every one of these there was a door; that into the
entry, or coming into the main tent, another door into the main tent, and
another door into the space or walk that was round it; so that walk was
also divided into six equal parts,.which served not only for a retreat, but
tostore up any necessaries which the fimily had occasion for. These
six spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what other apartments
the outer circle had were thus ordered :---As soon as you were in at the
door of the outer circle, you had a short passage straight before you to the
door of the inner house; but on either side was a wicker partition and a
door in it, by which you went tlrst into a-large room or storehouse twenty
feet wide, and about thirty feet long. and through that into another not
quite so long; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six
of which were only to be come at- through the apartments of the inner
tent, and served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective chambers
of the inner circle; and four large warehouses, or barns. or what you
please to call them, which went through one another, two on either hand
of the passage that led through the outer door to the inner tent.

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the world, nor
a house or tent so neatly contrived, much teas eo built. In this great

$eehive lived the three families, that is to say, Will Atkins and his com-
panion; the third was killed, but his wife remained, with three children,
{or she was, it seems, big with child when he died; and the other two
were not at all backward to give the widow her full share of every thing,
I mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, etc., and when they killed a kid, or
found a turtle on the shore; so that they all lived well enough; though,
it was true, they were not so industrious as the other two.as has been
observed already.

One thing. however, can not be omitted. via: that as {or religion, I do
not know that there was any thing of that kind among them; they otten,
indeed. put one another in mind that there was a God, by the very
common method of seamen, viz: swearing by his name: nor were their
poor ignorant savage wives much, better for having been married to
Chrietiene. no we muet call them; for, ee they knew very little of God
themselves, no they were utterly ineepable ofentering into my discourse
with their wivee'ebout e God, or to tellt eny thing to them concerning
religion.

which were generally impossible to be recalled or to be remedied, but had
no views of things to come, and had no share in any thing that looked
like deliverance, but ratherndded to the afliction than proposed a remedy ;
and upon this he repealed a Spanish proverb, which, though 1 can not
repeat in just the same words that he spoke it in, yet I remember 1 made
it into an English proverb of my own, thus:--

In trouble. to be troubled.
Is to have your trouble doubled.

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvements I had
made in my solitude; my unwearied application, as he called it; and
how I had made a condition which in its circumstances was at first much
worse than theirs,a thousand times more hflppy than theirs was, even
now when they were all together. He told me it was remarkable that Eng-
lishmen had a greater presence of mind in their distress than any people
that ever he met with: that their unhappy nation and the Portuguese
were the worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes: for that
their first step in dangers, alter the common etl'orts were over, was to
despair, lie down under it, and die, without rousing their thoughts up to
proper remedies for escape.

Itold him their case and mine difl'ered exceedingly; that they were
cast upon the shore wilhoutv necessaries, without supply of food, or
present sustenance till they could provide; that, it was true. I had this
disadvantage and discomfort. that! was alone; but then the supplies!
had providentially thrown into my hands by the unexpected driving of
the ship on shore, was such a help as would have encouraged any creature
in the world to have applied himself as I had done. Senhor, says the
Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should never have
got half those things out of the ship as you did: nay, says he, we should
never have found means to have got a rat! to carry them, or to have got
the raft on shore without boat or sail: and how much less should we
hve done it' any of us had been alone! Well, I desired him to abate his
compliment. and go on with the history of their coming on shore, where
they landed. He told me they unhappily landed at a place where there
were people without provisions; whereas, had they had the common
sense to have put oil" to sea again. and gone to another island a little far-

ther. they had found proiisinns, though without people; there being an
island that way. as they had been told, where there were provisions,

though no people; that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad had
frequently been there, and had filled the island with goats and hugs at
several times, where they had bred in such multitudes, and where turtle
and sea~fowla were in such plenty. that they couldlhave been in no want
of flesh, though they had found no bread; whereas here they were only
sustained with a few roots and herbs, which they understood not, and
which had no substance in them, and which the inhabitants gave them
sparineg enough; and who could treat them no better, unless they
would turn eannibals, and eat men's flesh, which was the great dainty of
their country.

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilizs the
save-gee they were with, and to teach them rational customs in the ordi-
nary way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon them as
unjust, that they, who came there for assistance and support, should
attempt to set up for instructors of those that gave them food ; intimating,
it seems, that none should set up for the instructors of others but thou
who could live without them.

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven to;
how sometimes they were many days without any food at all, the island
they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more
indolent, and for that reason were less supplied with the necessaries of
life than they had reason to believe others were in the same part of the
world: and yet they found that these savages were less ravenous and
voracious than those who had beth supplies of food. Also, they added.
they could not but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and good~
ness the governing providence of God directs the event of things in the
world; which, they said, appeared in their circumstances; for if, pressed
by the hardships they were under,and the barreness of the country where
they were. they had searched after a better to live in. they had been out
of the way of the relief that happened to them by my means.

They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived
among expected them to go out with them into their wars: and, it was
true, that as they had fire-arms with them. had they not had the disaster
to lose their ammunition, they should have been serviceable not only to
their friends, but have made themselves terrible both to friends and
enemies; but being without powder and shot. and yet in a condition that
they could not in reason deny to go out with their landlords to the wars,
so when they came into the field of battle, they were in a worse condition
than the savages themselves; for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor
could they use those the savages gave them; so they,_oould do nothing
but stand still and be wounded with arrows, till they came up to the
teeth of their enemy; and then, indeed, the three halberds they had were
of use to them; and they would otten drive a whole little army before
them with those halberds, and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of
their muskets: but that, for all this. they were sometimes surrounded
with multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows, till at last they
found the way to make themselves large targets of wood, which they
covered with skins of wild beasts, whose name they knew not. and these
covered them from the arrows of the savages, yet. notwithstanding these,
they were sometimes in great danger, and live of them were once knocked
down together with the clubs of the savages, which was the time when
one of them was taken prisoner; that is to say, the Spaniard whom I had
relieved: that at first they thought he had been killed; but when they
afterward heard he had been taken prisoner, they were under the greatest
grief imaginable. and would willingly have all ventured their lives to
have rescued him.

They told me that when they were so knocked down the rest of the
company rescued them. and stood over them fighting till they were come
to themselves, all but him whom they thought had been dead; and then
they made their way with their halberds and pieces, standing close
together in a line, through a body of above a thousand savages, beating
down all that came in their way, got the victory over their enemies,
but to their great sorrow, because it was with the loss of their friend,
whom the other party, finding him alive, carried on" with some others, as .-
I gave an account before.

They described most atTectionately how they were surprised with joy
at the return of their friend and companion in misery, who they thought
had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind. viz: by wild men;
and yet how more and more they were surprised with the account he
gave them of his esrand. and that there was a Christian in any place near,
much more one that was able and had humanity enough to contribute to
their deliverance.

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief I
sent them. and at the appearance of loaves of bread, things they had not
seen since their coming to that miserable place; how ollen they crossed
and blessed it as bread sent from Heaven; and what a reviving cordial it
was to their spirits to taste it,as also the other things I had sent for their
supply; and. atter all, they would have told me something of the joy
they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to the
person and place from whence all these new comforts came; but it was
impossible to express it by words. for their excessive joy naturally driv-
ing them to unbecoming extravagancies, they had no way to describe them,
but by telling me they bordered upon lunacy.having no way to give ventr
to their passions suitable to the sense that was upon them; that in some
. it worked one way,and in some another; and that some of them, through
a surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark mad, and others
immediately faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and called to
my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his father, and the poor people's
ecstasy when i took them up at sea alter their ship was on fire; the joy
of the mate of the ship when he tbund himself delivered in the place
where he expected to perish; and my own joy. when, after twenty-eight
years' captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry me to my own coun-
try. All these things made me more sensible of the relation of these
poor men, and more afl'eeted with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found them, I must
relate the heads of what i did for these people. and the condition in which
I left them. It was their opinion, and mine too. that they would be
troubled no more with the savages. or, if they were, they would be able
to cut them off, if they were twice as many as before; so they had no
concern about that. Then lentered into a serious discourse with the
Spaniard, whom I call governor, about. their stay in the island: for as!
was not come to carry any of them oil", so it would not be just to carry
ofl' some and leave others, who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if
their strength was diminished. On the other hand, I told them leame
to establish them there, not to remove them: and then I let them know
that I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I had
been at a great charge to supply them with all things necessary as well
for their convenience as their Ofenso: and that I had such and such par-
tictxr persons with me, as well . increase and recruit their number, as
by e particular necessary employments which they were bred to, being
artificers, to mist them in those things in which at present they were in
went.

They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I
delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one by one, if
they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had been
among them, and would shake hands with one mother, and engage in a
strict friendship and union of interest, that so there might be no more
misunderstandings and jealousies.

Will Atkins, with abundance of fianlmess and good-humor, said, they
had met with sfliction enough to make them all sober. and enemies
enough to make them all friends ; that, for his part, he would live and die
with them; and was so far tl'om designing any thing against the Span-
iards, that he owned they had done nothing to him hutwhat his own mad
humor made necessary, and what he would have done, and perhaps
worse, in their case; and that he would ask them pardon if I desired it
for the foolish and brutish things he had done to them, and was very will-
ing and desirous of living in terms of entire friendship and union with
them, and would do any thing that lay in his power to convince them of
it; and as for going to England, he cared not it'he did not go thither these
twenty years.

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at tint, disarmed and excluded
Will Atkins and his two countrymen for all their ill conduct, as they had
let me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity they were under
to do so; but that Will Atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great
fight they had with the savages, and on seven] occasions since, and had
showed himself so faithful to and concerned for the general interest of
them all. that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited
as much to be trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any
of them: and they had testified their satisfiction in him, by committing
the command to him, next to the governor himself; and as they had
entire confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged
they had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest men
could merit to bevalued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced
the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would never have any
interest separate from one another.

Upon these frank and open declarations of Mendship. we appointed the
next dey to dine all together; and indeed we made a splendid least. I
caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our din-
ner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on
shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork out of the ship's
provision, with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it; and. in particular.
I gave them ten bottles of French claret and ten bottles of English hear;-
things that neither the Spaniards not yEninsh had lasted for many
years, and which, it may be supposed. they were very glad of. fi'he
Spaniards added to our least five whole kids. which the cooks round;
and three of them were sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the
seamen, that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore," we did
with their shit meat from on board.

am: this feast. at which we were very innocently merry, I brought out
my cargo of goods, wherein, that there might be no dispute about divid-
ing, 1 showed them that there was a sufliciency for them all, desiring that
they all might take an equal quantity of the goods that were for wearing:
that is to say.equal when made up. As, first. i distributed linen auflicient
to make every one of them four shirts, and, at the Spaniards' request,
aflerwerdv made .them up six; these were exceedingly comfortable to
them, having been what, asl may-eay,.thsy.had long since forgot the use
of, or what it was to wear them. I allotwd the thin~Eaglish etufli which
I mentioned before, to make every one a light coat, like a frock, which I
judged fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose; and ordered, that
whenever they decayed, they should make more, as they thought fit; the
like for pumps. shoes. stockings, hats, etc.

I can not express what pleasure, what satistection, set upon the coun-
tcnancs of all these poor men. when they saw the care I had taken of
them and how well I had furnished them. They told me I was a fietherto
them; and that having such a correspondent as I was in so remote a part
of the world, it would make them forget that they were lslt in a desolate
place; and they all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place with-
out my consent.

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, particu-
larly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them most
necessary people; but, above all, my general artihoer. than whom they
could not name any thing that was more useful to them: and the tailor,
to show his concern for them, went to work immediately, and, with my
leave, made them every one a shirt. the first thing he did ; and. which was
still more. he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch. and use
the needle. but made them assist to make the shirts for their husbands,
and for all the rest.

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were; for
they took to pieces all my clumsy unhandy things. and made them clever,
convenient tables. stools, bedsteads, cupboards. lockers,shelvea. and every
thing they wanted of that kind. But. to let them see how nature made
artificers at first, I carried the carpenters to see Will Atkins's basket-
house, as I called it: and they both owned they never saw an instance of
such natural ingenuity before, nor any thing so regular and so handily
built, at least of its kind; and one of them, when he saw it, alter musing
a good while. turning about to me. I am sure, says he, that man has no
need of us; you need do nothing but give him tools.

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man a
digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no barrows or plows;
and to every separate place a pickax, a crow, a broadax,and a saw; always
appointing. that as often as any were broken or worn out, they should be
supplied, without grudging, out of the general stores that lleft behind.
Nails, staples. hinges, hammers, chisels, knives. scissors, and all sorts of
iron-work, they had without tale,as they required; for no man would
take more than he wanted. and he must be a fool that would waste or
spoil them on any account whatever; and, {or the use of the smith, I let!
two tons of unwrought iron for a supply.

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such,
even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for now they
could march, as I used to do, with a musket upon each shouldQ if there
was occasion; and were able to tight a thousand savages, if they had but
some little advantage of situation, which also they could not miss it" they
had occasion.

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved
to death. and the maid also; she was a sober, welloducated, religious
young woman, and behaved so inofl'ensively, that every one gave her a
good word; she had. indeed, an unhappy life with us, there being no
woman in the ship but herself, but she bore it with patience. Alters
while. seeing things so well ordered. and in so due a way of thriving upon
my island. and considering that they had neither business nor acquaint-
ance in the East Indies, or reason tor taking so long a voyage; I say,
considering all this. both of them came to mo, and desired 1 would give
them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among my tamily, as
they called it. I agreed to this readily. and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or houses set up,
surrounded with s basket-work, palisaded like Atkins's, adjoining to his
plantation. Their tents were contrived so that they had each of them a
room apart to lodge in, and a middle tent. like a great storehouse. to lay
their goods in. and to eat and drink in. And now the other two English-
men removed their habitations to the same place; and so the island was
divided into three colonies. and no more. viz: the Spaniards. with old
Friday and the first servants. at my old habitation under the hill, which
was, in a word. the capital city: and where they had so enlarged and
extended their works." well under as on the outside of the bill. that
they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never was there
such a little city in a wood.aud so hid. in any part of the world; for l
verily believe a thousand men might have ranged the island a month.
and, if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on
purpose for it, they would not have found it; for the trees stood so thick
and so close. and grew so fashwoven one into another. that nothing but
cutting them down tlrst could discover the place, except the only two
narrow entrances where they went in and out could be found. which was
not very easy; one of them was close down at the water's edge. on the
side of the creek. and it was afterward above two hundred yards to the
plaee; and the other was up a ladder at twice. as l have already formerly
degflbed it; and they had also a large wood thick-planted on'Ihe top of
, thrhill. containing above an acre, which grew apnea. and concealed the
grew all discovery there. with only one narrow place between two
tees. not easily to be discovered, to enter on that aide.

The other colony was that of Will Atkins. where there were four
families of Englishmen.l mean those 1 had left there, with their wives
and children; three savages that were slaves; the widow and the children
of the Englishman that was killed; the young man and the maid; and,
by the wty, we made a wife of her before we went away. There were
also the two carpenters and the tailor. whom I brought with me for
them: also the smith. who were very necessary man to them. especially
asagunemith. to take care of their arms: and my other man. whom I
called Jack of all trades, who was within himself as good almost as
twenty men: for he was not only a very ingenious fellow. but a very
merry fellow; and before I went away we married him to the honest
maid that came with the youth in the ship I mentioned before.

And now I speak of marrying. it brings me naturally to say something
of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out of the ship's
crew whom I took up at sea. It is true. this man was a Roman. and
perhaps it may give ofi'ense to some hereaner. if I leave any thing extra-
ordinary upon record of a man whom, before I begin. I must (to set him
out in just colors) represent in terms very much to his disadvantage. in
the account of Protestants: as. first. that he was a Papist; secondly.
a Popish priest; and. thirdly. a French Popish prmst. But justice
demands of me to give him a due character; and,l must say, he was ae

grave. sober, pious, and most religious person ; exact in his life, extensive
in his charity, and exemplary in almost every thing he did. What then
can any one say against being very sensible or the value or such a man,
notwithstanding his prolhssion'! though it may be my opinion, perhaps,
as well as the opinion ofothen who shall read this, that he was mistaken.

The that hour that I begsn to convene with him after he had agreed to
go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight exceedingly in
his conversation; and he first began with me about religion in the most
obliging manner imaginable. Sir, ssys he. you have not only, under God
(and at that he crossed his breast), ssved my life, but you here admitwd
me to go this voyage in your ship, and, by your ohliglng civility, have
taken me into your hmily. giving me an opportunity of {tee conversa-
tion. Now, sir, you see by my habit what my profession is. and I guess
by your nation what yours is; I may think it is my duty, and doubtless
it is so. to use my utmost endeavors, on all occasions, to bring all the
souls l can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic
doctrine; but as I am here under your permission, and in your family. I
am bound. in justice to your kindness. as well as ,in decency and good
manners, to be under your government: and therefore I shall not, with-
out your leave, enter into any debate on the points or religion in which
we may not agree, firther than you shall give me leave.

I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but acknowledge
it; that it was true we were such people as they called heretics, but that
he was not the tint Catholic! had convened with without filling into
inconveniences, or carrying the questions to any hight in debate; that he
should not find himself the worse used for being of a dlflerent opinion
fiom us: end if we did not convene without any dislike on either side,
it should be his ault, not-ours.

He replied, that he thought all our conversation might be easily sepa-
rated from disputes; that it was not his business to cap principles with
every man be convened with; and that be rather desired me to convene
with him as a gentleman than as a religionist; and that, if I would give
hlm leave at any time to discourse upon religious subjects, he would
readily comply with it. and that he did not doubt I would allow him
also to defend hie own opinions as well as he_ could; but that, with-
out my leave, he would not break in upon me with my such thing. He
told me firther, that he would not cease to do all that became him, in his
office as a priest as well as a private Christian, to procure the good of the
ship, and the safety ofsll that was in her; and though, perhaps, we would
not join with him, end he could not pray with us, he hoped he might
pray for us. which he would do upon all occasions. In this manner we
convened; and, as he was or the moat obliging. gentlemanlihe behavior,

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many
extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had befallen him
in the few years that he had been abroad in the world; and particularly
this was very remarkable. viz: that in the voyage he was now engaged
in, he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipped, and
never to go to the place whither any of the ships he was in were at first
designed. That his first intent was to have gone to Martinico, and that
he went on board a ship bound thither at St. Maio: but, being forced
into Lisbon by bad weather. the ship received some damage by running
aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was obliged to unload her
cargo there; but finding a Portuguese ship there bound to the Madeiras,
and ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet with a vessel
there bound to Martinioo, he went on board, in order to sail to the
Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship, being but an indifferent
mariner, had been out of his reckoning, and they dmve to Fayal: where,
however, he happened to find a very good market for his cargo, which
was com. and therefore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load
salt at the Isle of lylay, and to go away to Newfoundland. He had no
remedy in this exigency but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good
voyage as fares the Banks (so they call the place where they catch the
fish); where. meeting with a French ship bound from France to Quebec,
in the river of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, to carry provisions,
he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first design;
but when he came to Quebec the master of the ship died, and the vessel
proceeded no further: so the next voyage he shipped himself for France,
in the ship that was burnt when we took them up at sea: and then
shipped with us for the East Indiee,as I have already said. Thus he had
been disappointed in five voyages, all as I may call it, in one voyage,
beside what I shall have occasion to mention farther of the same person.

.But I shall not make digression into other men's stories which have no
relation to my own: I return to what concerns our affairs in the island.

HIS WIFB.

HE came to me one morning, for he lodged among us all the while we
were upon the island, and it happened to be just when I was going to
visit the Englishmen's colony. at the farthest part of the island ; I say, he
came to me, and told me, with a very grave countenance, that he had fornosnrsorz consort. ' 301

two or three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with me,
which he hoped would not be displeasing to me, because he thought it
might in some measure correspond with my general design, which was,
the prosperity of my new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more
than he yet thought it was, in the way of. God's bleuing.

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse, and turning
a little short, How, sir, said I, can it be said that we are not in the way
of God's bleesing,after such visible assistances and wonderful deliverance!
as we have seen here, and of which I have given you a large account 1--
If you had pleaaed, sir, said he, with a world of modesty, and yet with
great readiness, to have heard me, you would have found no room to he
displeased, much less to think so hard of me, that I should suggest that
you have not had wonderlhl assistancee and deliverances; and I hope, on
your behalf. that you are in the way of God's blessing, as your design is
exceeding good, and will prosper: but, sir. though it were more so than
is even possible to you, yet there may be some among you that are not
equally right in their actions: and you know, that in the story of the
children of Israel, one Achan in the camp removed God's blessing from
them, and turned his hand so against them, that six-and-thirty of them,
though not concerned in the crime, were the objects of divine vengeance,
and bore the weight of that punishment. V

I was sensibly touched with his discourse, and told him his inference
was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, and was really so
religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him,
and begged him to go on; and, in the meantime, because it seemed that
what we had both to say might take up some time,I told him I was going
to the Englishmen's plantations, and asked him to go with me, and we
might discourse of it by the way. He told me he would the more will-
ingly wait on me thither, because there partly the thing was acted which
he desired to speak to me about: so we walked on, and I pressed him to
he lies and plain with me in what he had to say.

Why then, sir, says he, be pleased to give me leave to lay down a few
propositions as the foundation of what I have to say, that we may not
ditfer in the general principles, though we may be of some diflbring
opinions in the practice of particulars. First, sir, though we difl'er in
iome of the doctrinal articles of religion, and it is very unhappy it is so,
especially in the case before ns,as I shall show afterward, yet there are
some general princifis in which we both agree, viz: that there is a. God;
and that this God having given us some stand general rules for our service
and obedience, we ought not willingly and'knowingly to ofl'end him, either
by neglecting to do what he has commanded,or by doing what he has
expressly forbidden; and let our different religions be what they will.
this general principle is readily owned by us all, that the blessing of God
does not ordinarily follow presumptuous sinning against his command;r t!
302 ADVENTURES or

and every good Christian will be atfectionately concerned to prevent any
that are under his care living in a total neglect of God and his commands.
It is not your men being Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of
such, that discharges me from being concerned for their souls. and from
endeavoring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as little distance
from enmity with their Makeras possible, especially if you give me leave
to meddle so far in your circuit.

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at. and told him I granted all he
had said. and thanked him that he would so liar concern himself for us;
and begged he would explain the particulars of what he had observed,
that, like Joshua, to take his own parable, I might put away the accursed
thing from us.

Why then. sinsays he,l will take the liberty you give me; and there
are three things. which. if I am right, must stand in the way of God's
blessing upon your endeavors here, and which I should rejoice for your
sake and their own to see removed; and, sir, I promise myself that you
will fully agree with me in them all as soon as! name them; especially
because I shall convince you that every one of them may, with great ease
and very much to your satisfaction. be remedied. First, sir, says he. you
have here {our Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the
savages, and have taken them as their wives, and have had many children
by them all. and yet are not married to them after any stated, legal man-
ner, as the laws of God and man require; and therefore are yet, in the
sense of both, no less than fornicators, if not living in adultery. To this,
air, I know you will object, that there was no clergyman or priest of any
kind or of any profession, to perform the ceremony; and no pen and ink
or paper to write down a contract of marriage. and have it signed be-
tween them: and Iknow also, sir. what the Spaniard governor has told
you. I mean, of the agreement that he obliged them to make when they
took these women, viz: that they should choose them out by consent, and
keep separately to them; which, by the way. is nothing of a marriage, no
agreement with the women. as wives. but only an agreement among
themselves to keep them from quarreling. But, air, the essence of the
sacrament of matrimony (so he called it. being a Roman) consists not
only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man and
wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that there isin the contract'
to compel the man and woman, at all times. to own and acknowledge
each other; obliging the man to abstain from all 0* women, to engage
in no other contract while these subsist, and, on all occasiona,'as ability
allows, to provide honestly for them and their children; and to oblige the
women to the same or like conditions, mutatia mutandis. on their side.
Now. sir, says be. these men may. when they please or when occasion pre-
sents, abandon these women. disown their children, leave them to perish,
and take other women, and marry them while these are living: and hero
he added, with some warmth, How, sir, is God honored in this unlawful
liberty! and how shall a blessing succeed your endeavors in this place.
however good in themselves, and however sincere in your design, while
these men who at present are your subjects, under your absolute govern-
ment and dominion, are allowed by you to live in open adultery!

I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more with the
convincing arguments he supported it with; for it was certainly true,
though 'they had no clergyman upon the spot, yeta formal contract on
both sides, made before witnesses, and confirmed by any token which
they had all agreed to be bound by, though it had been but breaking a
stick between them, engaging the men to own these women {or their
wives upon all occasions. and never to abandon them or their children,
and the women to the same with their husbands, had been an eflectual,
lawful marriage in the sight of God; and it was a great neglect that it
was not done. But I thought to have got olf my young'prieet by telling
him that all that part was done when I was not here; and they had lived
so many years with them now, that it'it was adultery, it was past remedy;
they could do nothing in it now.

Sir, says he, asking your pardon for such freedom, you are right in this,
that it being done in your absence. you could not be charged with that
part of the crime; Hm. I beseech you, flatter not yourself that you are
not therefore under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an end to
it. How can you think but that, let the time past lie on whom it will, all
the guilt for the Nature will lie entirely upon you 1 because it is certainly
in your power now to put an end to it, and in nobody's power but yours.

I was so dull still that I did not take him right; but I imagined that,
by putting an end to it, he meant that I should part them, and not sufl'er
them to live together any longer: and I said to him I could not do that V
by any means, for that it would put the whole island into contusion. He
seemed surprised thatl should so far mistake him. No, sir, says he, I
do not mean that you should now separate them. but legally and efl'ec-
tually marry them now; and as, sir, my way of marrying them may not
be easy to reconcile them to, though it will beefl'ectual even by your own
laws, so your way may be as well before God, and as valid among men ;
I mean by a written contract signed by both man and woman and by all
the witnesses present, which all the laws of Europe would decree to be
valid.

I was amazed to 3>> much true piety, and so much sincerity ofzeal,
beside the unusual impartiflity in his discourse as to his own party or
church, and such true warmth for preserving the peoplexthat he had no
knowledge of or relation to; 1 say, for preserving them from transgressing
the laws of God, the like of which I had indeed not met with anywhere:
but, recollectmg what he had said of marrying them by a written con-
tract; which I knew he would stand to, I returned it back upon him, and
told him [granted all that he had said to be just, and on his part very
kind; that I would discourse with the men upon this point'now, when I
came to them; and l knew no reason why they should scruple to let him
marry them all, which I knew well enough would be granted to be as
authentic and valid in England as if they were married by one of our
own clergyman. What was afterward done in this matter, I shall speak
of by itselt'. '

1 than pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which he
had to make. acknowledging that l was very much his debtor for the first,
and thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would use the same free-
dom and plainneee in the second. and hoped I would take it as well; and
this was, that notwithstanding these English subjects of mine. as he
called them, had lived with those women for almost seven years, had
taught them to speak English and even to read it, and that they were, as
he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, and capable of instruc-
tion, yet they had not, to this hour, taught them any thing of the Christ-
ian religion, no, not so much as to know that there was a God, or a
worship, or in what manner God was to he served; or that their own
idolatry, and worshiping they knew not whom, was false and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly
call them to account for, and perhaps. at last, take the work out of their
hands--he spoke this very atl'ectionately and warmly. I am persuaded,
says he. had those men lived in the savage country whencetheir wives
came, the savages would have taken more pains to have brought them to
be idolaters, and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so far as!
can see, have taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the true
God. Now, sir, said he, though I do not acknowledge your religion, or you
mine, yet we would be glad to see the devil's servants, and the subjects
of his kingdom, taught to know the general principles of the Christian
religion; that they might, at least, hear of God and a Redeemer, and of
the resurrection, and of a future state,---things which we all believe; they
had, at least, been so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true
church, than they are now, in the public profession of idolatry and devil-
worship.

I could hold no longer;l took him in my arms, and embraced him with
an excess of passion. How far, said 1 to him, have I been from under-
standing the most essential part of a Christian! viz: to love the interest
of the Christian church, and the good of other men's souls; l scarce have
known what belongs to the being a Christian--Oh, sir, do not say so,
replied be; this thing is not your fault--No, said I; but why did I never
lay it to heart as well as you I--It is not too late yet, said he; be not too
forward to condemn yourselfl--But what can be done now! said I; you
see I am going away.--Will you give me leave to talk to these poor men
about iti-Yes, with all my heart, said I; and will oblige them to give
aomxsox causos. 305

heed to what you say, tom--As to that, said he, we must leave them to the
mercy of Christ; but it is your business to assist them, encourage them,
and instruct them; and if you give me leave, and God his blessihg, I do
not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home to the great
I circle of Christianity, if not into the particular faith we all embrace. and
that even while you stay here. Upon this Isaid,l shall not only give
you leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it. What followed on this
account. I shall mention also again in its place. '

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame.
Why, really, says he, it is of the same nature: and I will proceed, asking
your leave, with the same plainness as before: it is about your poor say-
ages, who are, as I may say. your conquered subjects. It is a maxim.sir,
that is, or ought to be, received among all Christians. of'hat church or
pretended church soever, viz: The Christian knowledge ought to be pro-
pagated by all possible means, and on all possible occasions. It is on this
principle that our church sends missionaries into Persia, India, China;
and that our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the
moat hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence among mur-
derers and barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true God, and
to bring them over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have
such an opportunity here to have six or scven-and-thirty poor savages
brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and
Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an occasion of doing
good, which is really worth the expense of a man's whole life.

I was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one word to say. I had
here a spirit of true Christian seal for God and religion before me, let
his particular principles be of what kind soever: as for me. I had not so
much as entertained a thought of this in my heart before, and I believe I
should not have thought of it; for I looked upon these savages as slaves.
and people whom, had we had any work for them to do. we would have
uwd as such, or would have been glad to have transported them to any
other part of the world: for our business was to get rid of them; and we
would all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so
they had never seen their own. But to the case: I say, I was confounded
at his discourse, and knew not what answer to make him.

He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder. Sir, says he. I
shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you any olfense.--No, no.
said 1.] am ofl'ended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly con-
founded not only to think that I should never take any notice of this be-
fore, but with reflecting what notice lam able to take of it now. You
know, sir, said I. what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies
in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an insufferable
piece of injustise to detain their ship here. the men lying all this while at
victuals and wages on the owners' account. It is true,I agreed to be

allowed twelve days here, and ifl stay more,l must pay three pounds
sterling per diem demumge; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight
days mbrennd l have been here thirteen already; so that I am perfectly
unable to engage in this work, unless lwould sufl'er myself to be lelt
behind here again; in which case, if this single ship should misearry in
any part of her voyage, I should be just in the same condition that l was
left in'here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully delivered.
He o'wned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage; hut laid it
home upon my conscience. whether the blessing of saving thirty-seven
souls was not worth venturing all I had in the world for. I was not so
sensible of that as he was. I returned upon him thus: Why, air, it is a
valuable thing, indeed, to he an instrument in God's hand to convert
thirty-seven hothens to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are an
ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so that it seems so naturally
to fall into the way of your profession, how is it then, that you do not
rather otl'er yourself to undertake it, than press me to do it!

Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and
putting me to a full stop. made me a very low how. I most heartily
thank God and you, sir, said he. for giving me so evident a call to so
blessed a work; and if you think yourself discharged from it, and desire
me to undertake it, I will most readily do it, and think it a happy reward
for all the hazards and diflieulties of such a broken. disappointed voyage
as l have met with, that I am dropped at least into so glorious a work.

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to me;
his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his color came and went,
as if he had been falling into the; in a word, he was fired with the joy of
being embarked in such a work. I paused a considerable while before I
could tell what to say to him; for l was really surprised to find a man of
such sincerity and seal, and carried out in his real beyond the ordinary
rate of men, not of his profession only, but even of any profession
whatsoever. But alter I had considered it awhile, I asked him seriously
if he was in earnest. and that he would venture, on the single considera-
tion of an attempt on those poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted
island for perhaps his life, and at last might not know whether he should
be able to do them good or not!

Ills turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a venture!
Pnyesir, said be, what do you think I consented to go in your ship to
the East Indies for l--Nay,said I, that I know not, unless it was to preach
to the lndians--Doubtless it was, said he: and do you think, if 1 can
convert these thirty-seven men to the faith ofJesus Christ, it is not worth
my time, though I should never be fetched off the island again! hay. is it
not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls than my life is. or the
life of twenty more of the same profession! Yes, sir, says he, I would
giVe Christ and the blessed Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be
made the least happy instrument of saving the souls of those poor men,
though I were never to set my foot ott' the island, or see my native
country any more. But since you will honor me with putting'me into
this work, for which I will pray for you all the days or my tife,l have
one humble petition to you beside.--What is that! said 1. Why says
he. it is that you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my inter-
preter to them, and to assist me; for without some help I can not speak
to them, or they to me. '3

I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could not
think of parting withhim,and that for many reasons: he had been the
companion of my va'fiew-ma only._faithful to me, but sincerely
affectionate to the last degree; and I had resolved todosomething con-
siderable for him if he outlived me, as it was probable hgwould. Then I
knew that as I had bred Friday up to hea Protestant, it would quite con-
found him to bring him toembraoe another profession: and he would
never, while his eyes were open, believe that his old master was a hero-
tic, and would be damned; and this might, in the end, ruin the poor
fellow's principles, and so turn him back again to his first idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it was this: I
told him that I could not say that I was willing to part with Friday on
any account whatever, though a work that to him was of more value
than his life, ought to be to me of much more value than the keeping or
parting with a servant. But,on the other hand,I was persuaded that
Friday would by no means agree to part withsne; and I could not force
him to it, without his consent, without manilest injustice; because I had
promised I would never put him away,and he had promised and engaged
to me that he would never leave me unless I put him away.

He seemed very much concerned at- it, for he had no rational access to
these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of their lan-
guago, nor they one word of his. To remove this difliculty,l told him
Friday's rather had learned Spanish, which I fodhd he also understood,
and he should serve him as an interpreter. So he was much better satis-
fied, and nothing could persuade him but he would stay and endeavor to
convert them; but Providence gave another very happy turn to all this.

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we came to
the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and alter some account
given them of what I had done tbr them, via: what neceuary things I
had provided for them, and how they were distributed, which they were
very sensible of and very thankful for. I began to talk to them of the
scandalous life they led, and gave them a full account of the notice the
clergyman had taken of it; and arguing how unchrietian and ineligious
a life it was, I first send them if they were married men or bachelors!
They soon explained their conditions to me, and showed that two of
them were widowers. and the other three were single men, or bachelors.
I asked them with what conscience they could take those women and lie
with them as they had done, call them their wives, and have so many
children by them. and not he lawfully married to them!

They all gave me the answer I expected. viz: that there was nobody

to marry them; that they agreed before the governor to keep them as
their wives, and to maintain and own them as their wives; and they
thought, as things stood with them, they were as legally married as it'
they had been married by a person, and with all the formalities in the
world.
, I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God, and
were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives: but that the laws
of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor womenand children
hereafler; and that their wives being poor desolate women. friendlesa
and moneyless, would have no way to help themselves: I therefore told
them that, unless I was assured of their honest intent. I could do nothing
for them,but would take care that what I did should be for the women
and children without them; and that unless they would give me some
assurances that they would marry the woinen.l could not think it was
convenient they should continue together as man and wife; for that it
was both scandalous to men and ofi'ensive to God, who they could not
think would bless them if they went on thus.

All this went on as I expected: and they told me, especially Will
Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their
wives as well as if they had been born in their own native country. and
would not leave them upon any account whatever: and they did verily
believe their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and did, to the
utmost of their skill, as much for? them and for their children," any
women conld possibly do: and they would not part with them on any
account: and Will Atkins, for his own particular, added. that if any man
would take him away, and ofl'er to carry him home to England, and make
him captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, he would not go with
him it' he might not carry his wife and children with him; and if there
was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her now with all
his heart.

This was just as] would have it: the priest was not with me at that
moment, but was not far ofl'; so. to try him further. I told him I had a
clergyman with me. and if he was sincere,l would have him married
next mbrning, and bade him consider of it, and talk with the rest. He
said. as for himself. he need not consider of it at all, for he was very
ready to do it. and was glad I had a minister with me, and he believed
they would be all willing also. I then told him that my friend thy
minister was a Frenchman, and could not Speak English, but 1 would act
the clerk between them. He never so much as asked me whether he was
a Papist or Protestant, which was indeed what I was afraid of; so we
parted; I went back to my clergyman. and Will Alkina went in to talk
with his companions. I desired the French gentleman not to say any
thing to them till the business was thorough ripe; and I told him what
answer the men had given me.

Before I went from their quarter. they all came to me, and told me they
had been considering what I had said; that they were glad to hear I had
a clergyman in my company. and they were very willing to give me the
satisfaction I desiredI and to be formally married as soon as I pleased;
for they were far from desiring to part with their. wives, and that they
meant nothing but what was very honest when they chose them. So I
appointed them to meet me the next morning; and. in the meantime,
they should let their wives know the meaning of the marriage law; and
that it was not only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige them that
they should not forsake them. whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing,
and were very well satisfied with it, as indeed they had reason to be; so
they thiled not to attend all together at my apartment next morning,
where I brought out my clergyman; and though he .had not on a
minister's gown.alter the manner of England, or the habit ofa priest,
alter the manner of France, yet, having a black vest, something like a
cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very unlike a minister;
and as for his language. I was his interpreter. But the Ieriousnem of his
behavior to them, and the scruples he made of marrying the women
because they were not baptized and professed Christians, pve theman
exceeding reverence for his person; and there was no need, after that, to
inquire whether he was a clergyman or not. Indeed.I was afraid his
ecruples would have been carried so far, as that he woultot have
married them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to" him,
he resisted me, though modestly. yet very steadily: and at last refined
absolutely to marry them, unless he had first talked with the men, and
the women too; and though at first I was a little backward to it, yet at
last I agreed to it with a good-will, perceiving the sincerity of his design.

When he came to them, he let them know that I had acquainted him
with their circumstances, and with the present design; that he was very
willing to perform that part of his (traction. and marry them,as I had
desired; but that. before he could do it, he must take the liberty to talk
with them. He told them, that in the sight of all indifl'erent men, and in
the sense ol' the laws of society, they had lived all this while in open for-
nication; and that it wastrue, that nothing but the consenting to marry.
or effectually separating them from one another, could now put an end
to it; but there was a dialeulty in it too, with respect to the laws of
Christian matrimony. which he was not fully .tisfied about, viz: that of
marrying one who is a professed .Christian too new.>> idolater to a
heathen, one that is not baptized; and yet that he did not see that there
was time left to endeavor to persuade the women to be baptized, or to
profess the name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing
of. and without which they could not be baptized. He told them be
doubted they were but indifferent Christians themselves; that they had
but little knowledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he could not
expect that they had said much to their wives on that head yet; but that, '
unless they would promise him to use their endeavors with their wives to
persuade them to become Christians, and would,as well as they could,
instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made them, and
to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry them:
for he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages; nor was it
consistent with the principles of the Christian religion, and was indeed
expressly forbidden in God's law.

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very faithfully
to them from his mouth, as near his own words as] could; only some-
times adding something of my own, to convince them how just it was,
and howl was of his mind; and i always very faithfully distinguished
between what I said for myself, and what were the clergyman's words.
They told me it was very true what the gentleman said, that they were
very indifferent Christians themselves, and that they had never talked to
their wrves about religion. Lord, sir, says Will Atkins, how should we
teach them religion? why, we know nothing ourselves; and beside, sir,
said he, should we talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and
hell, it would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believed our-
selves! And if we should tell them that we believe all the things we
speak of to them, such as of good people going to heaven, and wicked
people_ I e devil, they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves,
that be ll this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are! Why,
sir, 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing; folks
must have some religion themselves before they pretend to teach other
people.---Will Atkins, said I to him, though lam afraid that what you say
hastoo much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife she is in the
wrong; and that there is a God and a religion better than her own; that
her gods are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak: that there is a
great Being that made all things. and that can destroy all that he has
made: that he rewards the good and punishes the bad; and that we are
to be judged by him at last for all we do here! You are not so ignorant,
but even nature itself will teach you that all this is true; and I am satiss
tied you linow it all to be true, and believe it yourself.--That is true. sir,
said Atkins; but with what face can I say any thing to my wife of all
this, when she will tell me immediately it can not be trueY--Not true!
said I; what do you mean by that 1--Why. sir, said he, she will tell me it
can not be true that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or can punish
or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, that have been
such a wicked creature as she knowsl have been even to her, and to
everybody else; and that I should we suffered to live, that have been
always acting so contrary to what I must tell her is good. and to what I
ought to have done.--Why, truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speak-
est too much truth; and with that l informed the clergyman of what
Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. 0h, said the priest, tell
him there iOone thing will make him the best minister in the world to
his wife, and that is, repentance; for none teach repentance like true
penitents. He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so much
the better qualified to instruct his wife: he will then be able to tell her
that there is not only a God. and that he is the just rewarder of good and
evil, but that he is a merciful Being, and with infinite goodness and long-
suffering forbears to punish those that offend; waiting to be gracious,
and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should return
and live: that oftentimes he suffers wicked men to go a long time, and
even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution: that it is a
clear evidence ofGod and of a future state, that righteous men receive not
their reward. or wicked men their punishment, till they come into
another world; and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of
the resurrection and of the last judgment. Let him but repent for him-
self, he will been excellent preacher of repentance to his wife.

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while, and
who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected by it:
when. being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an end--l know all
this, master. says he, and a great deal more; but I have not the impu-
dence to talk thus to my wife, when God and my conscience knew, and
my wife will be an undeniable evidence against me, that] have'll'ved as
if I had never heard ofa God or a future state, or any thing about it; and
to talk of my repeating, ales! (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and
I could see that the tears stood in his eye), 'tis past all that with me.--
Past it, Atkins! said 1; what dost thou mean by that 1--] know me"
enough what l mean, says he; I mean 'tis too late, and that is too true.

I told the clergyman. word for word, what he said: the poor zealous
priest,---l must call him so, for. be his opinion what it will, he had cer-
tainly a. most singular affection for the good of other men's souls. and it
would be hard to think he had not the like for his own,--I say this affec-
tionate man could not'refrain from tears: but, recovering himself". said to
me. Ask him but one question; Is he easy that it is too late; or is he
troubled, and wishes it were not so! I put the question fairly to Atkins;
and he answered. with a great deal of passion, How could any man be
easy in a condition that must certainly end in eternal destruction! that
he was far from being easy; but that, on the contrary, he believed it
would, one time or other, ruin him. What do you mean by that! said 1.
Why, he said, he believed he should one time or other cut his throat, to
put an end to the terror of it.

The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his face, when I
told him all this; but turning quick to me upon it, says, If that be his
case, we may assure him it is not too Into; Christ will give him repent-
ance. But, pray, says he, explain this to him; that as no man is saved
but by Christ, and the merit of his passion procuring dime mercy for
him. how can it be too late for any man toreceive mercy! Does he think
he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy! Pray tell '
him there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, and
when God may refuse to bear, but that it is never too late for men to ask
mercy: and we, that are Christ's servants, are commanded to preach
mercy at all times, in the name ofJesus Christ, to all those that sincerely
repent; so that it is never too late to repent.

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness: but it
seemed as if he turned 00' the discourse to the rest, for he said to me, he
would go and have some talk with his wife; so he went out awhile, and
we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to
matters of religion, as much as l was when I went rambling away from
my father: and yet there were none of them backward to hear what had
been add; and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with
their wives about it, and do their endeavors to persuade then to turn
Christians.

The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer they
gave, but said nothing a good while; but at last, shaking his head, We
that are Christ's servants, says he, can go no firther than to exhort and
instruct; and when men comply, submit to the reproof, and promise
what we ask, 'tie all we can do; we are bound to swept their good
words; but, believe me, sir, said he, whatever you may have known of
the life of that man you call Will Atkins, I believe he is thebonly sincere
convert among them: I take that man to be a true penitent: [will not
despair of the rest: but that man is apparently struck with the sense of
his past life, and,l doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to his
wife, he will talk himself effectually into it; for attempting to teach
others, is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves. I know a men
who, having nothing but a summary notion of religion himself, and being
wicked and pmfligate to the last degree in his life, made a thorough reforo
motion in himself by laboring to convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins
begins but once to talk seriously ofJesus Christ to his wife, my life for it,
he talks himself into a thorough convert, makes himself a pcnitent, and
who knows what may follow! .

Upon this discourse. however, and their promising, as above, to en-
deavor to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he married the

o.
other two couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in.
Atter this, my clergyman waiting awhile, was curious to know where
Atkins was gone; and turning to me, said, I entreat you, sir, let us walk
out of your labyrinth here, and look; I dare say we shall find this poor
man somewhere or other talking seriously to his wife, and teaching her
already something of religion. I began to be of the same mind; so we
went out together, and I carried him a way which none knew but my-
self, and where the, trees were so very think that it was not easy to see
through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see out;
when, coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny wife
sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in discourse: I stopped
short till my clergyman came up to me, and then, having showed him
where they were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a good
while. We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the sun.
and to every quarter of the heavens, and then down to the earth, then
out to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees,Now,
says the clergyman, you see my words are made good, the man preaches
to her; mark him now, he is telling her that our God has made him and
her, and the heavens, the earth. the sea, the woods, the trees, etc. I
believe he is. said I. Immediawa we perceived Will Atkins start upon
his feet, fall down on his knees, and lilt both his hands. We supposed
he said something, but we could not hear him; it was too far for that.
He did not continue kneeling halfa minute, but comes and sits down
again by his wife, and talks to her again; we perceived then the woman
very attentive, but whether she said any thing to him we could not tell.
While the poor fellow was upon his knees, I- could see the tears run plenti-
fully down my clergyman's cheeks, and I could hardly forbear-Inyself;
but it was a great afllictiou to us both that we were not near enough to
hear any thing that passed between them. Well, however, we could
come no nearer, for fear of disturbing them ; so we resolved to see an end
of this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud enough to us without
the help of voice. He sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and
talked again earnestly to her, and two or three times we could see him
embrace her most passionately; another time we saw him take out his
handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of
transport very unusual; and after several of then things, we saw him on
a sudden jump up again. and lend her his hand to help her up, when
immediately leading her by the hand a step or two, they both kneeled
down together, and continued so about. two minutes.

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, St. Paul! St.
Paul! behold, he prayeth. I was afraid Atkins would hear him, therefore
I entreated him to withhold himself awhile. that we might see an end
of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most afl'ecting that
ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove with himself for awhile, but was

27
in such raptures to think that the poor heathen woman was becomea
Christian, that he was not able to contain himself ; he wept several times,
then, throwing up his hands and crossing his breast, said over several
things ejaculatory, and by way of giving God thanks for so miraculous s
testimony of the success of our endeavors; some he spoke eoltly. and I
could not well hear others; some in Latin, some in French; then two or
three times the tears would interrupt him, that he could not speak at all;
but! begged that he would contain himself, and let us more narrowly
and fully observe what was before us, which he did tor a time, the scene
not being near ended yet; for, after the poor man and hie wife were risen
again from their knees, we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her,
and we observed her motion, that she was greatly etfected with what he
said, by her frequently lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast,
and such other postures as express the greatest seriousness and attention;
this continued about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked
away; so we could see no more of them in that situation. I took this
interval to talk with my clergyman; and first,l was glad to see the par-
ticulars we had both been witnesses to, that though I was hard enough of
belief in such cases, yet that I began to think it was all very sincere here,
both in the man and his wife, however ignorant they might both be, and
I hoped such a beginning would yet have a more happy end: And who
knows, said i, but these two may, in time, by instruction and example,
work upon some of the others 'l--Some of them? said be, turning quick
upon me: sy, upon all of them: depend upon it, if those two savages,
for he has been but little better, as you relate it. should embrace Jesus
Christ, they will never leave it till they work upon all the rest; for true
religion is naturally communicative, and he that is once made a Christian
will never leave a pagan behind him if he can help it. I owned it was a
most Christian principle to think so, and a testimony of true zeal, as well
as a generous heart in him. But, my friend, said I, will you give me leave
to start one difliculty here! I can not tell how to object the least thing
against that afi'ectionate concern which you show for the turning the poor
people from their paganism to the Christian religion: but how does this
comfort you, while these people are. in your account, out of the pale of
the Catholic church, without which you believe there is no salvation! so
that you esteem these but heretics, and for other reasons as efl'ectually
lost as the pagans themselves.

To this he answered with abundance of candor. thus: Sir. I am a
Catholic of the Roman church, and a priest of the order of St. Benedict,
and I embrace all the principles of the Roman faith; but yet, if you will
believe me, and that i do not speak in compliment to. you. or in respect
to my circumstances and your civilities; I say. neverthelese.l do not
look upon you, who call yourselves reformed. without some charity; I
dare not say (though I know it is our opinion in general) that you can not
be saved; I will by no means limit the mercy of Christ so far as to think
that he can not receive you into the bosom of his church, in a manner to
us unperceivable; and I hope you have the same charity for us: I pray
daily for your being all restored to Christ's church. by whatsoever method
he. who is all-wise, is pleased to direct. In the meantime, surely you
will allow it consists'wlth me, as a Roman. to distinguish far between a
Protestant and a pagan; between one that calls on Jesus Christ, though
in a way which I do not think is according to the true faith.and a savage
or a barbarian. that knows no God. no Christ. no Redeemer; and if you
are not within the pale of the Catholic church. we hope you are nearer
being restored to it than than that know nothing of God or of his church :
and l rejoice, therefore. when I see this poor man. who, you say, has been
a protligate, and almost a murderer, kneel down and pray to Jesus Christ,

as we suppose he did, though not hilly enlightened; believing that God.
' from whom every such work proceeds. will sensibly touch his heart, and
bring him to the arther knowledge of that truth in his own time: and if
God shall influence this poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant
savage. his wife. I can never believe that he shall be cast away himself.
And have 1 not reason than to rejoice the nearer any are brought to the
knowledge of Christ, though they may not be brought quite home into
the bosom of the Catholic church just at the time when I may desire it,
leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect his work in his own time
and in his own way! Certainly, I would rejoice if all the savages in-
America were brought. like this poor woman. to pray to God. though
they were all to be Protestants at first, rather than they should continue
pagans or heathens; firmly believing, that He that had bestowed the first
light to them would farther illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly
grace, and bring them into the pale of his church when he should see
good.

lwss astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pious papist. as
much as I was oppressed by the power of his reasoning; and it presently
occurred to my thoughts. that if such a temper was universal, we might
be all Catholic Christians. whatever church or particulsr profession we
joined in; that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right
principles; and as he thought that the like charity would make usall
Catholics, so I told him I believed, had all the members of his church the
like moderation, they would soon all be Protestants. And there we left
that part, for we never disputed at all.

However,l talked to him another way, and taking him by the hand, My
friend, says I, I wish all the clergy of the Romish church were blest with
such moderation, and had an equal share of your charity. I am entirely
of your opinion: but I must tell you. that if you should preach such
doctrines in Spain or ltaly. they Would put you into the lnquisition.---lt
may he so, said he; I know not what they would do in Spain or Italy;
but i will not any they would be the better Christians for that severity:
for I am sure there is no heresy in abounding with charity.

As Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there was over, so
we went back our own way; and when we came back. we found them
waiting to be called in : observing this,I asked my clergyman ifwe should
discover to him that we had seen him under the bush or not; and it was
his opinion we should not, but that we should talk to him first, and hear
what he would say to us; so we called him in alone, nobody being in the
place but ourselves, and I began with him thus :--

Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had you! What was your
father '!

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be: Sir, my father was a clergy!-
man.

R. C. What education did he give you '!

W. A. He would have taught me well. sir: but I dupised all educa-
tion, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was.

R. C. It is true, Solomon says, He that despises reproof is brutish.

W. A. Ay. sir, I was brutish indeed, for I murdered my fhther: for
God's sake, sir, talk no more about that; sir. I murdered my poor father!

Pit. Ha! a murderer!

Here the priest started (for! interpreted every word as he spoke) and
looked pale: it seems he believed that Will had really killed his father.

ILC. No. no, sir,1 do not understand him so: Will Atkins, explain
yourself; you did not kill your father. did you, with your own hands?

W. A. No, air, I did not out his throat; but I cut the thread of all his
comforts. and shortened his days: I broke his heart by the most ungrate-
ml and unnatural return for the most tender and affectionate treatment
that father ever gave, or child wuld receive.

R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father to extort this con-
fession: I pray God give you repentance for it, and forgive that and all
your other sins; but I asked you because I see that though you have not
much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are in things that are
good; that you have known more of religion, a great deal, than you have
practiced.

W. A. Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that I make
about my father, conscience does; and whenever we come to look back
upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly the
first that touch us; the wounds they make lie deepest, and the weight
they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins we can commit.

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins; I can not
bear it.

w. A. You hear it. master! I dare say you know nothing of it.

R. C. Yes. Atkins: every shore. every hill, nay,I may say every tree
in this island, Is witness to the anguish ofmy soul for my ingratitude and
bad usage of a good, tender father; s father much like yours, by your
description; and I murdered my father as well as you. Will Atkins: but
I think, for all that, my repentance is short of yours t'oo, by a great deal.

I would have said more, if I could have restrained my passions but I
thought this poor man's repentance was so much sincerer than mine, that
I was going to leave olf the discourse and retire ; for I was surprised with
what he had said, and thought that instead of my going about to teach
and instruct him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a
most surprising and unexpected manner.

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly afl'ected
with it, and said to me, Did I not any. air. that when this man was con-
verted. he would preach to us all! I tell you, sir, if this one man be
made a true penitenhthere will be no need of me; he will make Christ-
ians ofsll in the island. But. having flittle composed myself, I renewed
my discourse with Will Atkins. But Will, said 1, how comes the sense
or this matter to touch you just now!

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a dart
through my very soul; I have been talking about God and religion to
my wife, in order. as you directed me, to make a Christian of her; and
she has preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget while I live.

R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you: but when you
were moving religious arguments to her, conscience has flung them back
upon you.

W. A. Ay, sir. with such force as is not to be resisted.

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and your
wife; for I know something of it already.

W. A. Sir. it is impossible to give you a mu account ofit; Iam too
mu to hold it. and yet have no tongue to express it; but let her have'said
what she will, and though I can not give you an account of it, this I can
tell you, that I have resolved to amend and reform my life.

R. C. But tell us some of it; how did you begin, Will! for'this has
been an extraordinary case, that is certain. She has preached a sermon,
indeed. if she has wrought this open you.

W. A. Why,l first told her the nature of our laws about marriage,
and what the reasons were that men and women were obliged to enter
into such compacts as it was neither in the power of one nor other to
break; that otherwise order and justice could not be maintained, and
men would run from their wives. and abandon their children, mix con-
t'usedly with one another, and neither families be kept entire, nor inherit-
ance be settled by legal descent.

R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make her understand
what you meant by inheritance and families! They know no such
things among the savages, but marry any how, without regard to relation,
consanguinity, or family; brother and sister, nay,as I have been told,
even the tisther and the daughter. and the son and the mother.

W. A. I believe, sir, you are misinformed, and my wife assures me to
the contrary, and that they abhor it; perhaps for any farther relations
they may not be so exact as we are: but she tells me they never touch
one another in the near relationship you speak of.

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her!

W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much better than in
her country.

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was!

W. A. Ay, ay. there began our dialogue. I asked her if she would be
married to me our way. She asked me what way that was; I told her
marriage was appointed by God ; and here we had a strange talk together,
indeed. as ever man and wife had. I believe.

N. B.--This dialogue between Will Atkins and his wife I took down in
writing,just after he had told it me. which was as follows:

Win. Appointed by your God! Why, have you a God in your
country '!

W. A. Yes. my dear. God is in every country.

Win. No your God in my country; my country have a great old
Benamuckee God.

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to show you who God is; God is in
heaven, and made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that in
them is.

Win. No make the earth : no your God makee all earth: no makes
my country.

Will Atkins laughed a little at her expression of God not making her
country.

Win. No laugh; why laugh me? This nothing to laugh.

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was more serious than he
at first. '

W. A. That's true, indeed; I will not laugh any more, my dear.

erl. Why. you say you God makee all!

W. A. Yes. child. our God made the whole world, and you and me,
and all things: for he II the only true God, and there is no God but him:
he lives for ever in heaven. 'Q

noemsox cnusox. 319

Wn'l. Why you no tell me long ago!

W. A. Thet'e true, indeed; but I have been a wicked wreteh, and have
not only forgotten to acquaint thee with any thing before. but have lived
without God in the world myself.

Wm. What, hue you 1 great God in your country, you no know
him! No eey Oh to him! No do good thing for him! That no poeeible.

W. A. It ia true; though, for all that, we live aa if there was no God
in heaven, or that he had no power on earth.

Win. But why God let you do so! Why he no make you good live!

w. A. It in all our own halt.

Win. But you my rue he ia great. lunch greet, have much great
power. een makee kill when he will, why he no makee kill when you no
aerve him, no aay Oh to him. no be good mane!

W. A. That in true, he might etrike me dead; end I ought to expect
it, for I have been a wicked wreteh, that in true: but God ia merciful, and
doea not deal with ue an we duerve.

Win. But then do you not tell God thenkee for that too!

W. A. No, indeed. I have not thanked God for his mercy any more
than I have feared God for hie power.

Wm. Then you God no God; me no think believe he beluch one,
greet much power, etmng: no makee kill you, though you make him Io
much angry.

W. A. What wiu my wicked life hinder you from believingin God!
What a dreadful creature em I! and what a sad truth ie it, that the
horrid lives of Chriatiena hinder the conversion of heathene!

Win. How me think you have greet much God up there (ahe point.
up to heuen),end yet no do well, no do good thing! Can he tell! Sure
he no tell what you do!

W. A. Yee, yee, he know and eeea all things; he been In epeak, aeea

Wm. What! he no hear you cune, swear. Ipeak de great damn!

W. A. Yes, yea, he hears it all.

Win. Where be then the much great power strong! _

W. A. He is merciful, that in all we can any for it; and thin provea
him to be the true God ; he in God, and not man,a'nd therele we are not
wmumed.

Here Will Atkins told on he run struck with horror. to think how he
could tell his wife .0 clearly that God lees, and been. and knowa the

secret thoughte of the heart. and all that we do, and yet that he had dared
to do all the vile things he had done.

Wm. Merciful! Whit you call that!

W. A. He in our fither and melrer, end he pitiea and Iparea he.

Wrrl. So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do wicked;
then he no good him-ell; or no great able.
W. A. Yes, yes. my dear, he is intlnitely good and infinitely great, and
able to punish too; and sometimes, to show his justice and vengeance,
he lets fly hisanger to destroy sinners and make examples; many are cut
off in their sins.

Wins. But no makes kill you yet; then he tell you, maybe, that he no
makee you kill: so you makes de bargain with him, you do bad thing. he
no be angry at you when he be angry at other mans.

W. A. No, Indeed; my sins are all presumptions upon his goodness;
and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me, as he has done other
men.

Wire. Well. and yet no kill, no makes you dead ; what you say to him
for that! You no tell him thankee for all that too!

W. A. 1 am an unthankful, ungrateful dog. that is true.

Wm. Why he no makee you much good better! you say he makes
you.

W. A. He made me. as he made all the world; it is I have deformed
myself and abused his goodness, and made myself an abominable
wretch.

Wm. i wish you makes God know me; 1 no makes him angry, I no
do had wicked thing.

Here Will Atkins said his heart sank within him, to hears poor un-
taught creature desire to be taught to know'God. and he such a wicked
wretch that he could not say one word to her about God. but what the
reproach of his own carriage would make most irrational for her to be-
lieve; nay. that already she had told him that she could not believein
God, because he, that was so wicked, was not destroyed.

W. A. My dear. you mean, you wish I could teach you to know God,
not God to know you; for he knows you already, and every thoughtin
your heart.

er. Why then he know what I say to you now; he know me wish
to know him; how shall me know who makes me!

W. A. Poor creature. he must teach thee, I can not teach thee; I will
pray to him to teach mee tokuow him, and forgive me, that am unworthy
to teach thee. A

The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make her
know God. and her wishing to know him. that he said he fell down on his
knees before her. and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with the
saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. and to pardon his sins. and accept of
his being the unworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles
of religion: atter which he sat down by her again. and their dialogue
went on.--This was the time when we saw him kneel down and hold up
his hands. '

Wis-s. tht you put down the knee for! What you hold 'up the
hand for! What you say'! Who you speak to! What is all that!
W. A. My dear, 1 how my knees in token of my aubmieoion to Him
that made me; I aaid Oh to him, a you cell it; and as your old men do
to their idol Benamuckee; that is, I prayed to him.

Wm. What you aay Oh to him for!

W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes, and your underalanding,
that you may know him, and be accepted by him.

Win. Can he do that too!

W. A. Yes, he can ; he can do all thins-

WIrl. But now he hear what you say!

W. A. Yea; he has bid us pray to him, and promiaed to hear he.

WWI. Bid you pray'.' When he bid you! How he bid you! What,
you hear him spook!

W. A. No,we do not heer him speak; but he haarevealed him-elf
many ways to us.

Here he was ata great loaa to make her under-tend that God baa re-
vealed himself to on by his word, and what hia word was; but at last he
told it her thua .

W. A. God has apoken to aome good men in former dayl. even from
heaven. by plain words; and God has inspired good men by hia Spirit;
and they have written all hia lawa down' In a book.

Wu'a. Me no understand that; where' Is book!

W. A. Alea! my poor creature, 1 have not thia book; but I hope I ehall
one time or other get it for you, and help you to read it.

Here he embmd her with greet afl'ection; but with inexpreaaible grief
that he had not a Bible.

WIre. But how you makeo me know that God teachee them to write
that book!

W. A. By the name rule that we know him to be God.

Win. What rule! What way you know him!

W. A. Becauae he teachea and commands nothing but what is good,
righteous, and holy, and tenda to make us perfectly good, an well aa per-
fectly happy; and because he forbids and commando he to avoid all that
ia wicked, and in evil in italll', or evil in it! conaequence.

Wire. That me would understand, that me fain ace; ifhe teachee all
good thing, he makee all good thing, he give all thing, he hear me when I
lay Oh to him,aa you do just now; he makee me good if I wish to be
good; he spare me, no makee kill me when I no be good: all thia you lay
he do, yet he be great God : me take, think, believe him to be great God;
me any Oh to him with you, my deer.

Here the poor man could forbear no longer. but raiud her up. made
her kneel by him, and he prayed to God aloud to instruct her in the
knowledge of himaelf, by hie spirit; and that by some good providence,
l! poaeible, ahe might acme time or other come to have a Bible, that ahe
might read the word of God, and be taught by it to know himPThi' waa
the time that we saw him litt her up by the hand. and saw him kneel
down by her as above.

They had several other discourses, it seems.atter this, too long to be
set down here; and particularly she made him promise, that since he
confessed his own life had been a wicked, abominable course of provo-
cirtions against God. that he would reform it, and not make God angry
any ruorc, lest he should make him dead,as she called it, and then she
Would be let! alone, and never be taught to know this God better; and
lest he should be miserable,as he had told her wicked men would be,
alter death.

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both, but par-
ticularly to the young clergy; he was indeed wonderfully surprised with
it, but under the greatest aflliction imaginable that he could not talk to
her, that he could not speak English tn make her understand him; and
as she spoke but very broken English, he could not understand her; how-
ever, he turned himself to me, and told me that he believed that there
must be more to do with this woman than to marry her. I did not
understand him at first, but at length he explained himself, viz: that she
ought to be baptized. I agreed with him in that part readily, and was
for going about it presently. No. no; hold, sir, said he: though 1 would
have her be baptized by all means. yet 1 must observe that Will Atkins,
her husband, has. indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be will-
ing to embrace a religious life, and has given her just ideas of the being
of a God; of his power.justice, and mercy: yet [desire to know of him
if he has said any thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of the. salvation of
sinners; of the nature of faith in him,and redemption by him; of the
Holy Spirit. the resurrection, the last judgment, and a future state.

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him: but the poor follow fell
immediately into tears, and told us he had said something to her of all
those things, but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own
conscience so reproached him with his horrid. ungodly life, that he
trembled at the apprehensions that her knowledge of him should lessen
the attention she should give to those things: and make her rather con-
demn religion than receive it; but he was assured, he said. that her mind
was so disposed to receive due impressions of all those things, and that
if I would but discourse with her, she would make it appear to my satis-
faction that my labor would not be lost upon her.

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter between
my religious priest and the woman.l entreated him to begin with her;
but sure such a sermon was never preached by a popish priest in these
latter ages of the world; and. as I told him, I thought he had all the zeal,
all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, without the error of a
Roman Catholic; and that I took him to be such a clergyman as the
Roman bishops were before the Church of Rome assumed spiritual sove-
reignity over the consciences of men. In a word, he brought the poor
woman to embrace the knowledge of Christ. and of redemption by him,
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did the first notions of a
God. but with<<joy and faith; with an all'ection, and a surprising degree
of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much less to be expressed; and,
at her own request, she was baptized.

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that he would
perform that office with some caution, that the man might not perceive
he was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of other ill conse--
quences which might attend a ditl'erenee among us in that very religion
which we were instructing the others in. He told me that as he had no
consecrated chapel,nor proper things for the oflice,l should see he would
do it in a manner that I should not know by it that he was a Roman
Catholic myself, ifl had not known it before; and so he did; for. saying
only some words over to himself in Latin. which I could not understand,
he poured a whole dishful of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing
in French very loud, " Mary" (which was the name her husband desired
me to give her, for I was her godfather), "I baptize thee in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost ;" so that none could
know any thing by it what religion he was of. He gave the benediction
atlerward in Latin; but either Will Atkins did not know but it was
French. or else did not take notice of it at that time.

As soon as this was over. we married them; and alter the marriage was
over, he turned to Will Atkins. and in a very allectionate manner ex-
horted him not only to persevere in that good disposition he was in. but
to support the convictions that were upon him by a resolution to reform
his life; told him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake
his crimes: represented to him how God had honored him with being the
instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the Christian reli-
gion, and that he should be careful he did not dishonor the grace of God;
and that if he did, he would see the heathen a better Christian than him-
self; the savage converted, and the instrument cast away. He said a
great many good things to them both: and then. recommending them to
God's goodness. gave them the benediction again, I repeating every thing
to them in English; and thus ended the ceremony. 1 think it was the
most pleasant and agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my whole
life.

But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts hung continually
upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, and fain he would have
stayed upon the island to have undertaken it; but I convinced him. first,
that. his undertaking was impracticable in itself; and. secondly, that per-
haps 1 would put it into a way of being done in his absence to his satis--
faction; of which by'and-by.

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compass,l
was preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had tahn
out of the tarnished ship's company came to me, and told me he under-
stood I had a clergyman with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen
to be married to the savages; that he had a match too, which he desired
might be finished before I went, between two Christians, which he hoped
would not be disagreeable to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother's servant.
for there was no other Christian woman on the island: so I began to per-
suade him not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because he found
himself in this solitary circumstance. I represented to him that he had
some considerable substance in the world. and good friends, as I under-
stood by himself, and the maid also; that the maid was not only poor,
and a servant, but was unequal to him. she being six or seven-and-twenty
years old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen: that he might
very probably, with my assistance. make a remove from this wilder-
ness, and come into his own country again; and that then it would
be a thousand to one but he would repent his choice, and the die-
like of that circumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was going
to say more. but he interrupted me, smiling, and told me, with a great
deal of modesty, that l mistook in my guesses, that he had nothing of
that kind in his thoughts; and he was very glad to hear that Ihad an
intent of putting them in a way to see their own country again: and
nothing should have put him upon staying there. but that the voyage I
was going was so exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him
quite out of the reach of all his friends: that he had nothing to desire of
me, but that I would settle him in some little property'in the island
where he was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and
he would settle himself here like a planter. waiting the good time when,
if ever I returned to England, I would redeem them; and hoped I would
not be unmindml of him when Icame to England: that he would give
me some letters to his friends in London, to let them know how good I
had been to him, and in what part of the world and what circumstances .
I had left him in; and he promised me that whenever Iredeemed him,
the plantation, and all the improvements he had made upon it, let the
value be what it would, should be wholly mine.

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his youth. and
was the more agreeable to me, because he told me positively the match
was not for himself. I gave him all possible assurances, that if I lived to
come safe to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his business
effectually; and that he might depend lshould never firrget the circum-
stances I had let! him in: but still I was impatient to know who was the
person to be married; upon which he told me it was my Jack ofall
trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably surprised when he named
the match; for indeed Ithought it very suitable. The character of that
man I have given already; and as for the maid, she was a very honest.
modest, sober, and religious young 'woman: had a very good share of
sense, was agreeable enough in her person, spoke very handsomely, and
- to the purpose, always with decency and good manners, and neither too
backward to speak when requisite, nor impertinently forward when it was
not her business; very handy and housewifely, and an excellent manager;
lit, indeed, to have been governess to the whole island, and she knew very
well how to behave in every respect.

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them the same
day; and as I was father at the altar, as I may say, and gave her away.
so I gave her a portion; for I appointed her and her husband a handsome
large space of ground for their plantation; and, indeed, this match, and
the proposal the young gentleman made to give him a small property in
the island, put me upon parceling it out among them, that they might
not quarrel afterward about their situation.

This sharing out the land to them I let! to Will Atkins, who was now
grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, exceedingly
pious and religious, and, as far as I may be allowed to speak positively
in such a case, I verily believe he was a true penitent. He divided things
so justly, and so much to every one's satisfaction, that they only desired
one general writing under my hand for the whole, which I caused to be
drawn up, and signed and sealed to them,setting out the bounds and
situation of every man's plantation, and testifying that I gave them
thereby severally a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the
respective plantations or farms, with their improvements, to them and
their heirs, reserving all the rest of the island as my own property, and a -
certain rent for every particular plantation alter eleven years, if I, or any
one from me, or in my name, came to demand it, producing an attested
copy of the same writing.

As to the government and laws among them, I told them I was not
capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give them-
selves; only I made them promise me to live in love and good neighbor-
hood with one another; and so I prepared to leave them.

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being new settled in a kind
ofcommonwealth among themselves, and having much business in hand,
it was but odd to have seven-and-thirty Indians live in a nook of the
island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed: for, excepting the provid-
ing themselves food, which they had difliculty enough to do sometimes,
they had no manner of business or property to manage. I proposed,
therefore, to the governor Spaniard, that he should go to them, with
Friday's father, and propose to them to remove, and either plant for
themselves, or take them into their several ihmilies as servants, to be -
maintained for their labor, but without being absolute slaves; for I
would not admit them to make them slaves by force, by any means;
because they had lheir liberty given them. by capitulation, as it were
articles of surrender, which they ought not to break.

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very cheerml
along with him; so we allotted them land and plantations, which three
or four accepted of, but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in
the several families we had settled; and thus my colony was in a manner
settled. as follows:---The Spaniards possessed my original habitation,
which was the capital city. and extended their plantations all along the
side of the brook, which made the creek thatl have so olten described,
as far as my bower; and as they increased their culture, it went always
eastward. The English lived in the northeast part, where Will Atkins
and his comrades began, and came on southward and southwest. toward
the back part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a great addition
of land to take in. it' they found occasion," that they need not jostle
one another for want of room. All the east end of the island was lelt
uninhabited, that if any of the savages should come on shore there only
for their usual customary barbarities. they might come and go; if they
disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them: and no doubt but they
were ofien ashore, and went away again, for 1 never heard that the
planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more.

It now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the
clergyman that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be set
on foot in his absence tohis satisfaction,and told him that nowl thought
it was put in a fair way; for the savages being thus divided among the
Christians, if they would but every one of them do their part with those
which came under their hands, I hoped it might have a very good
eflect. '

He agreed presently in that, if they did their part. But how, says he,
shall we obtain that of them! i told him we would call them all
together. and leave it in charge with them, or go to them, one by one,
which he thought best: so we divided it. he to speak to the Spaniards.
who were all Papists. and l to the English, who were all Protestants; and
we recommended it earnestly to them,and made them promise that they
would never make any distinction of Papist or Protestant in their exhort-
ing the savages to turn Christians. but teach them the general knowledge
of the true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise
promiud us that they would never have any ditfsrences or disputes one
with another about religion.

When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may call it so. for such a house,
or such a piece of basket-work.l believe, was not standing in the world
again), there I found the young woman I have mentioned above. and
Will Atkins's wife. were become intimates: and this prudent, religious
young woman had perfected the work Will Atkins had begun; and
though it was not above four days alter what 1 have related, yet the new-
baptized savage woman was made such a Christian as I have seldom

heard of in all my observation or conversation in the world.

It came next into my mind, in the morning before I went to them, that
among all the needful things I had to leave with them, I had not left
them a Bible. in which [showed myself less considering for them than
my good friend the widow was for me, when she sent me the cargo of a
hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a
prayer-book. However. the good woman's charity had a greater extent
than ever she imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort and
Instruction of those that made much better use of them than I had done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to Will Atkins's
tent or house, and found the young woman and Atkins's baptized wife
- had been discoursing of religion together, for Will. Atkins told it me with
a great deal of joy, I asked if they were together now, and he said yes:
so I went into the house, and he with me, and we found them together
very earnest in discourse. Oh, sir, says Will Atkins, when God has sin-
ners to reconcile to himself, and aliens to bring home. he never wants a
messenger; my wife has got a new instructor; I knew I was as unworthy
as I was incapable of that work; that young woman has been sent hither
from heaven; she is enough to convert a whole island of savages. The
young woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desired her to sit
still: I told her she hada good work upon her hands, and I hoped God
would bless her in it.

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any book among
them, though I did not ask: but I put my hand into my pocket, and
pulled out my Bible: Here, says I to Atkins. I have brought you an assist-
ant that perhaps you had not before. The man was so confounded that
he was not able to speak for some time; but recovering himself, he takes
it with bath his hands, and turning to his wife, Here. my dear. says he,
did not I tell you our God, though he lives above, could hear what we said!
Here's the book I prayed for when you and! kneeled down under the
bush; now God has heard us, and sent it. When'he had said so, the man
fell into such transports of passionate joy, that, between the joy of hav-
ing it and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a child
that was crying.

The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake that
none of us Were aware of ; for she firmly believed God had sent the book
upon her husband's petition. It is true, that providentially it was so, and
might be taken so in a consequent sense; but i believeit would have been
no dillicult matter. at that time. to have persuaded the poor woman to
have believed that an express messenger came from heaven on purpose
to bring that individual book; but it was too serious a matter to suffer any
delusion to take place; so I turned to the young woman, and told her we
did not desire to impose upon the new convert in her first and more
ignorant understanding of things, and begged her to explain to her that
God may he very properly said to answer our petitions, when, in the
course of his providence, such things are in a particular manner brought
to pass as we petitioned for; but we did not expect returns from heaven
in a miraculous and particular manner, and it is our mercy that it is
not so. .

This the young woman did afterward efl'ectually. so that there was. I
assure you, no priestcraft used here; and lshould have thought it one
of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. But the
surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really not to he expressed; and there,
we may be sure, was no delusion. Sure no man was ever more thankful
in the world for any thing of this kind than he was for the Bible; nor, I
believe, never any man was glad of a Bible from a better principle; and
though he had been a most profligate creature, headstrong, furious, and '
desperately wicked, yet this man is a standing rule to us all for the well.
instructing children, viz: that parents should never give over to teach and
instruct. nor ever despair of their endeavors, let the children be ever so
refractory, or, to appearance. insensible of instruction; for, if ever God,
in his providence, touches the conscience of such. the force of their edu-
cation returns upon thsm, and the early instruction of parents is not lost,
though it may have been many years laid asleep, but, some time or other,
they may find the benefit of it. Thus it was with this poor man. how-
ever ignorant he was of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he
had some to do with more ignorant than himself, and that the least part
of the instruction of his good father that now came to his mind was of
use to him.

Among the rest it occurred to him, he saidhhow his father used to in-
sistso much on the inexpressible value of the Bible, the privilege and
blessing of it to nations, families, and persons; but he never entertained
the least notion of the worth of it till now, when, being to talk to hea-
thens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help of the written oracle
for his assistance.

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion, though
she had one, and so had the youth, on board our ship, among their goods,
which were not yet brought on shore. And now having said so many
things of this young woman, I can not omit telling one story more of her
and myself, which has something in it very informing and remarkable.

1 have related to what extremity the poor young woman was reduced,
how her mistress was starved to death, and died on board that unhappy
ship we met at sea, and how the whole. ship's company was reduced to
the last extremity. The gentlewonran and her son, and this maid, were
first hardly used as to provisions, and at last totally neglected and starved;
that is to say, brought to the last extremity of hunger.--0ne day being
discounting with her on the extremities they sulfered,l asked her if she
could describe. by what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it"
appeared! She told me she believed she could, and she told her tale very
distinctly, thus :--

First. sir, said she, we had for some days fared exceeding hard, and
suffered very great hunger: but at last we were wholly without food of
any kind, except sugar, and a little wine and water. The first day, after
I had received no food at all. I found myself, toward evening, first empty
and sick at the stomach, and nearer night much inclined to yawning and
sleep. I laid down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep, and slept about
three hours, and awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine
when! lay down: after being about three hours awake, it being about
five o'clock in the morning, I found myself empty, and my stomach'
siekish, and lay down again, but could not sleep at all, being very faint
and ill; and thus I continued all the second day, with a strange variety,
first hungry, then sick again, with reachings to vomit. The second night,
being obliged to go to bed again without any food, more than a draught
of fresh water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that
the market was mightily stocked with provisions; that I bought some for
my mistress, and went and dined very heartily. I thought my stomach
was as full alter this as it would have been after a good dinner; but when
l awaked, I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the ex-
tremity of famine. The last glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar
in it, because ot'its having some spirit to supply nourishment; but, there
being no substance in the stomach for the digesting office to work upon,
I found the only effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from
the stomach into the head; and I lay, as they told me, stupid and sense-
less, as one drunk, for some time. The third day. in the morning, after a
night of strange, confused, and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing
than sleeping. I awaked, ravenous and furious with hunger; and I ques-
tion, had not my understanding returned and conquered it, whether, if I
had been a mother, and had a little child with me. its life would have
been safe or not. This lasted about three hours; during which time I
was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young master
told me. and as he can now inform you.

In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down, and struck my
face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mistress lay, and,
with the blow, the blood gushed out of my nose; and the cabin-boy bring-
ing me a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great deal; and as the
blood came from me, I came to myself, and the violence of the flame or
fever I was in abated, and so did the ravenous part of the hunger. Then
I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing
in my stomach to bring up. Alter I had bled some time I swooned, and
they all believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon after, and then
had a most dreadml pain in my stomach, not to be described, not like the

28
colic, buta gnawing, eager pain for food: and toward the night it went
off, with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food, something like, as
Isuppose,thc longing of a woman with child. 1 took another draught
of water with sugar in it; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought
it all up again: then I took a draught of water without sugar, and that
stayed with me; and I laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily
that it would please God to tells me away; and composing my mind in
hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and then waking, thought myself dying,
being light with vapors fiom an empty stomach; I recommended my
soul then to God; and earnestly wished that somebody would throw me
into the sea.

All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, expiring, but
bore it with much more patience than I; gave the last bit of breed she
had left to her child, my young master, who would not have taken it, but
she obliged him to eat it; and I believe it saved his life.

Toward the morning I slept again; and when I awoke, I fell into a vio-
lent passion of crying, and after that had a second at of violent hunger:
Igot up ravenous, and in a most dreadful condition: had my mistress
been dead,as much as I loved her, I am certain I should have eaten a
piece of her flesh with as much relish, and as unconcerned, as ever I did
eat the flesh of any creature appointed for food; and once or twice I was
going to bite my own arm: at last I saw the basin in which was the blood
I had bled at my nose the day before: I ran to it, and swallowed it with
such haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had
taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from me now. After it was
down, though the thoughts of it filled me with horror, yet it checked the
fit of hunger, and I took another draught of water, and was composed
and refreshed for some hours after. This was the fourth day, and thus I
held it till toward night, when, within the compass of three hours. I had
all the several circumstances over again, one after another, viz: sick,
sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then
sick. then lunatic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter
of an hour; and my strength wasted exceedingly: at night I laid me
down. having no comfort but in the hope that I should die before>>:
morning. '

All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now turned intoa
disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping, by wind. instead of food.
having found its way into the bowels; and in this condition I lay till
morning, when I was surprised with the cries and lamentations of my
young master, who called out to me that his mother was dead; I lifted
myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but found she was not
dead. though she was able to give very little signs of life.

I had then such convulsions in my stomach, for want of some suste-
nance, that I can not describe; with such frequent throes and pangs of
appetite. that nothing but the tortures of death can imitate; and in this
condition I was when I heard the seamen above cry out, A sail! a sail!
and halloo and jump about as if they were distracted.

I was not able to get ofi' from the bed, and my mistress much less; and
my young master was so sick, that I thought he had been expiring; so
we could not open the cabin door. or get any account what it was that

'occasioned such confusion; nor had we any conversation with the ship's

company for two days, they having told us that they had not a mouthful
of any thing to eat in the ship; and this they told us afterward, they
thought we had been dead. It was this dreadful condition we were in
when you were sent to save our lives: and how you found us, sir, you
know as well as I, and better too.

This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of starving
to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding entertaining
to me. I am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account, because the
youth gave me an account of a good part of it: though, I must own, not
so distinct and so feeling as the maid; and the rather, because it seems
his mother fed him at the price of her own life; but the poor maid,
though her constitution being stronger than that of her mistress, who
was in years, and a weakly woman too, she might struggle harder with
it; I say, the poor maid might be supposed to feel the extremity some-
thing sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last bit
something longer than she parted with any to relieve the maid. No
question, as the case is here related, if our ship or some other had not so
providentially met them, a few days more would have ended all their
lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one another; and that even,
as their use stood. would have served them but a little while, they being
five hundred leagues from any land, or any possibility of relief, other
than in the miraculous manner it happened: but this is by the way; I
return to my disposition of things among my people.

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I did not
think fit to let them know any thing of the sloop I had framed, and
which I thought of setting up among them: for I found, at least at my
first coming, such seeds of divisions among them, that I saw plainly, had
I set up the sloop, and left it among them, they would, upon every light
disgust, have separated, and gone away from one another, or perhaps
have turned pirates, and so made the island a den of thieves. instead
of a plantation of sober and religious people. as I intended it: nor did I
leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the two
quarter-deck guns that my nephew took extraordinary, for the same
reason: I thought it was enough to qualify them for a defensive war.
against any that should invade them. but not to set them up for an
offensive W", or to go abroad to attack others; which, in the end,
would only bring ruin and destruction upon them: I reserved the sloop,
therefore, and the guns, for their service another way." 1 shall observe
in its place.

Having now done with the island, I let! them all in good circumstances
and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship again the 0th
of May, having been about twenty-five days among them: and as they
were all resolved to stay upon the island till [came to remove them, I
promised to send them farther relief from the Brazils, if i could possibly
find an opportunity; and, particularly,l promised to send them some
cattle. such as sheep, hogs, and cows; as to the two cows and calves
which I brought from England, we had been obliged, by the length of
our voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed them.

"COUNTER Wfl'fl SAVAGE A'l' BBA--FBIDAY'B DRAW--ROBINSON PMS Ell
PORK" PARTS" IN TH! BRAZIIHAILS FOB "I W INDII.

Ta: next day, giving them a salute of live guns at parting, we set sail,
and arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the Brazils, in about twenty-two
days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this: that about
three days alter we had sailed. being becalmed, and the current setting
strong to the E. N. 8.. running, as it were, into a bay or gulf of the land
side. we were driven something out of our course. and once or twice our
men cried out, Land to the 'eastward; but whether it was the continent
or islands we could not tell by any means. But the third day, toward
evening, the see. smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea,as it
were, covered toward the land with something very black: not being able
to discover what it was till after some time. our chief mate going up the
main shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a perspective, cried
out i'ms an army. 1 could not imagine what he meant by an army, and
thwarted him a little hastily. Nay, sir, says he, don't be angry, for 'tis
an army, and a fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand canoes, and
you may see them paddle along, for they are coming toward us space.

_ I was a little surprised then. indeed, and so was my nephew the cap-
tain; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island, and
having never been in those seas before, that he could not tell whatto
think of it, but said, two or three times, we should all be devoured. I
must confess, considering we were becalmed, and the current set strong
toward the shore, I liked it the worse; however,l bade them not be afiaid,
but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so as near to know
that we must engage them.

The weather continued calm, and they came on space toward us; so
gave order to come to an anchor, and furl all our sails; as for the sav-
ages, I told them they had nothing to fear but fire, and therefore they
should get their beats out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and
the other by the stern, and man them both well, and wait the issue in
that posture: this I did, that the men. in the boats might be ready with
sheets and buckets to put out any fire these savages would endeavor to
fix to the outside of the ship.

In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came up
with us; but never was such a horrid sight seen by Christians: though
my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number, yet
when they came up we reckoned about a hundred and twentyaix; some
of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, and some more, and the
least six or seven.

When they came nearer to us they seemed to be struck with wonder
and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they had never seen be-
fore; nor could they, at first, as we afterward understood, know what to
make of us; they came boldly up, however, very near to us, and seemed
to go about to row round us; but we called to our men in the boats not
to let them come too near them. This very order brought us to an en-
gagement with them. without our designing it; for five or six of the large
canoes came so near our long-boat that our men beckoned with their
hands to keep them back, which they understood very well, and went
back, but at their retreat about filly arrows came on board us from those
boats, and one of our men in the long-boat was very much wounded.
However, I called to them not to fire by any means; but we handed down
some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind
of fence, like-waisbboards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages,
if they should shoot again.

About half an hour atterward they all came up in a body astem of us,
and so near, as that we could easily discern what they were. though we
could not tell their design; and l easily found they were some (if my old
friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used to engage with;
and in a short time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight upon us,
till they came so near that they could hear us speak: upon this I ordered
all my men to keep close, lest they should shoot any more arrows, and
made all our guns ready; but being so near as to be within hearing. I
made Friday go out upon the deck, and call out aloud to them in his
language, to know what they meant; which accordingly he did. Whether
they understood him or not, that I knew not; but as soon as he had called
to them,six of them, who were in the foremost or nighest boat to us,
turned their canoes from us, and, stooping down. showed us their naked
backsides, just as if. in English, saving your presence, they had bid us
kiss --: whether this was a defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether334 summons 0:-

it was done in mere contempt, one a signal to the rest; but immediately '
Friday called out they were going to shoot. and, unhappily for him, poor
fellow, they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my inex-
pressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their sight. The
poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows. and about three
more fell very user him; such unlucky marksmen they were!

I was so enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant and companion.
that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with small allot, and
four with great, and gave them such a broadside as they had never heard
in their lives before, to be sure. They were not above half a cable length
011' when we tired; and our gunners took their aim so well that three or
four of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to believe, by one shot
only.

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to us gave us no
great offense; neither did I know for certain whether that which would
pass for the greatest contempt among us might be understood so by them
or not; therefore, in return, 1 had only resolved to have fired four or five
guns at them with powder only, which I knew would frighten them suf-
ficiently; but when they shot at us directly, with all the fury they were
capable of, and especially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I so
entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so well deserved it, I thought
myself not only justifiable before God and man. but would have been
very glad if I could have overset every canoe there, and drowned every
one of them.

I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we wounded at
this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never was seen among
such a multitude; there were thirteen or fourteen of their canoes split
and overset in all, and the men all set a-swimming: the rest, frightened
out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little
care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot; so I
suppose 'that many of them were lost: and our men took up one poor
fellow swimming for his life above an hour aner they were all gone.

The small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a great
many; but. in short. we never knew any thing how it went with them,
for they fled so fast, that in three hours or thereabouts we could not see
above three or four straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any
more; for, a breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed,
and set sail for the Brazils.

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that he would
neither eat nor drink, and we all fancied he would starve himself to death :
but i took a way to cure him; for! made them take him and turn him
into the long-boat, and make him believe they would toss him into the
sea again. and so leave him where they found him, if he would not speak :
nor would that do, but they really did throw him into the sea, and came
away from him ; and then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and
called to them in his tongue, though they knew not one word of what he
said: however, at last they took him in again, and then he began to be
more tractable; nor did 1 ever design they should drown him.

We were now under sail again; but I was the moat diaconsolate crea-
ture alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been very glad to
have gone back to the islend to have taken one of the rest from thence
for my occasion: but it could not be; so we went on. We had one pris-
oner, as l have said, and it was a long time before we could make him un-
derstand any thing; but, in time, our men taught him some English, and
he began to he a little tractable. Alterward, we inquired what country he
came from, but could make nothing of what he said; for his speech was
so odd,alt guttursls, and he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd
manner, thatowe could never form a word after him; and we were all of
opinion that they might speak that language as well if they were gagged
as otherwise; nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either
for teeth. tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just as a hunting-
horn forms a tune, with an open throat. He told us, however, some time
after. when we had taught him to speak a little English, that they were
going with their kings to fighta great battle. When he said kings, we
asked him how many kings! He said they were five nation (we could
not make him understand the plural a), and that they all joined to go
against two nation. We asked him what made them come up to us? He
said, " To makee to great wonderloolr." Here it is to be observed, that all
those natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn English,always add
two e's at the end of the words where we use one; and they place the
accent upon them, as malice, takee, and the like; and we could not break
them ofit; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it otl', though at last
he did.

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last leave
of him: Poor honest Friday! We buried him with all the decency and
solemnity possible. by putting him into a eoflln, and throwing him into
the sea: and I caused them to fire eleven guns for him:-and so ended the
life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most afi'ectionate servant
that ever man had.

We went now away, with a mir wind. for Brazil: and in about twelve
days' time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees south of the
line. being the northeastemmost land of all that part of America. We
kept on s. by E. in sight of the shore four days, when we made Cape St.
Augustine, and in three days came to an anchor off the bay of all Saints,
the old place of my deliverance, from whence came both my good and
evil fate. r

Never ship came to this port that had less business than I had, and yet
it was with great dithculty that we were admitwd to hold the least
correspondence on shore: not my partner himself, who was alive. and
made a great figure among them, not my two merchant trustees, not the
fame of my wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain me that
favor; but my partner remembering that I had given five hundred moi-
dores to the prior of the monastery of the Augustines, and two hundred
and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, and obliged the
prior that then was to go to the governor. and get leave for me personally,
with the captain and one more, beside eight seamen, to come on shore,
and no more; and this, upon condition absolutely capitulated for, that
we should not alter to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any
person away without license. They were so strict with us as to landing
any goods. that it was with extreme difliculty that i got on shore three
bales of English goods, such as fine broadcloths, stutfis, and some linen,
which I had brought for a present to my partner.

He was a very generous, open-hearted man. though, like me, he came
from little at first: and though he knew not that I had the least design of
giving him any thing, he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions,
wine. and sweetmeata, worth above thirty moidores, including some
tobacco, and three or four tine medals of gold: but I was even with him
in my present, which,as 1 have said, consisted of fine broadcloth, English
stufl's, lace, and fine Hollands; also I delivered him about the value ofono
hundred pounds sterling. in the same goods. for orther uses; and [obliged
him to set up the sloop, which I had brought with me from England, as I
have said, for the use of my colony, In order to send the refreshmentsl
intended to my plantation.

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very few days.
for she was already flamed; and I gave the master of her such instruc-
tions as that he could not miss the place; nor did he miss it. as I had an
account from my partner alterward. I got him soon loaded with the
small cargo I sent them; and one of our seamen that had been on shore
with me there altered to go with the sloop and settle there, upon my letter
to the governor Spaniard to allot him a sumcient quantity of land for a
plantation, and giving him some clothes and tools for his planting worlr,
which he said he understood, having been an old planter at Maryland,
and a bucceneer into the bargain. I encouraged the fellow, by granting
all he desired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we had
taken prisoner of war to be his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard
to give him his share of every thing he wanted with the rest.

When we came to tit this man out, my old partner told me there was a
certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, who had
fallen into the displeasure of the church. 1 know not what the matter is
with him,says he, but on my conscience I thinlr he is a heretic in his
heart. and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the Inquisi-
tion; that he would be very glad of such an opportunity to malts his
escape, with his wife and two daughters; and if I would let them go to
my island, and allot them a plantation, he would give thema small stock
to begin with; for the otIicers ot' the Inquisition had seized all his effects
and estate, and he had nothing lel't but a little household stuff and two
slaves: and, adds he, though I hate his principles, yet I would not have
nim fall into their hands, for he will be assuredly burnt alive if he does.

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them; and
we concealed the man, and his wife and daughters, on board our ship; till
the sloop put out to go to sea; and then. having put all their goods on
heard some time before, we put them on board the sloop after she got out
of the bay.

Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new partner; and their
stocks, indeed. were much alike rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm;
but nothing to begin with, except as above: however, they carried over
with them, which was worth all the rest, some materials for planting
sugar-canes, with some plants of canes, which he, I mean the Portugal
man, understood very well.

Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island, I sent
them by the sloop three milch cows and five calves, about twenty-two
hogs among them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a stonehorse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise. I engaged three Portugal
women to go, and recommended it to them to marry them. and use
them kindly. I could have procured more women, but I remembered
that the poor persecuted man had two daughters, and that there were
but five of the Spaniards that wanted; and the rest had wives of their
own, though in another country.

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, was very
welcome to my old inhabitants, who were now, with this addition be-
tween sixty and seventy people, beside little children, of which there
were a great many. I found letters at London from them all, by way of
Lisbon, when I came back to England, of which I shall also take some
notice immediately.

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse about it;
and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would do well to
turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the follies of an
old man. not warned by his own harms, much less by those of other men,
to beware of the like; not cooled by almost forty years' miseries and
disappointment; not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation, nor
made cautious by afflictions and distress beyond imitation.

I had no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at full
liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock him
up among the prisoners there, and starve him. Had I taken a small
vessel from England, and gone directly to the island; had I loaded her, as
I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for the plantation and tbr

my people; taken a patent from the government here to have secured my
property. in subjection only to that of England; had I carried over can-
non and ammunition. servants. and people to plant, and taken possession
of the place, fortified and strengthened it in the name of England, and.
increased it with people,asl might easily have done; had I then settled
myself there, and sent the ship back laden with good rice, asl might also
have done in six months' time. and ordered my friends to have fitted her
out again for our supply; had I done this, and stayed there myself, I had
at least acted like a man of common sense: but I was possessed with a.
wandering spirit, and scorned all advantages: 1 pleased myself with
being the patron of the people] placed there. and doing for them in a
kind of haughty, majestic way. like an old patriarchal monarch, provid-
ing for them as i" had been tisther of the whole family, as well as of the
plantation: but I never so much as pretended to plant in the name 0! any
governmentor nation. or to acknowledge any prince. or to call my people
subjects to any one nation more than another: nay, I never so much as
gave the place a name, but lelt it as I found it, belonging to nobody, and
the people under no discipline or government but my own; who, though
I had influence over them as a hither and benefitetor; had no authority or
power to act or command one way or other, farther than voluntary
consent moved them to comply: yet even this, had,I stayed there, would
have done well enough ; but as I rambled from them. and came there no
more, the last letters I had from any of them were by my partner's
means, who afterward sent another sloop to the place. and who sent me
word, though I had not the letter till I got to London, several years alter it
was written, that they went on but poorly. were mslcontent with their
long stay there; that Will Atkins was dead; that five of the Spaniards
were come away; and though they had not been much molested by the
savages. yet they had had some skirmishes with them; and that they
begged of him to write to me to think of the promise I had made to fetch
them away, that they might see their country again before they died.

But I was gone a wildgoose chase. indeed! and they that will have any
more of the must be content to follow me intoa new variety of follies.
hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice of Providence may
be duly observed: and we may see how easily Heaven can gorge us with
our own desires, make the strongest of our wishes be our affliction. and
punish us most severely with those very things which We think it would
be our utmost happiness to be allowad in. Whether! had business or no
business.away I went: it is no time now to enlarge upon the reason or
absurdity of my own conduct, but to come to the history; I was em-
barked for the voyage. and the voyage I went.

I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest popish clergyman :
fill' let their opinion of us, and all other heretics in general, as they call
us, be as unchsritable as it may, I verily believe this man was very
sincere, and wished the good of all men: yet I believe he was upon the
reserve in many of his expressions, to prevent giving me ofl'ense; for!
scarce heard him once call on the blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago
or his guardian angel, though so common with the rest of them: how-
ever, I say, I had not the least doubt of his sincerity and pious intentions
on his own part; and I am firmly of opinion. if the rest of the popish
missionaries were like him, they would strive to visit even the poor Tar-
tars. and Laplandcrs, where they have nothing to give them,as well as
covet to flock to India. Persia, China, etc., the most wealthy of the bes-
then countries; for if they expected to bring no gains to their church by it,
it may well be admired how they came to admit the Chinese Confucius
into the calendar of the Christian saints. But this by-the-by.

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked me leave
to go thither; being still. as he observed,bound never to finish any voyage
he began. How happy had it been for me if I had gone with him! But
it was too late now: all things heaven appoints for the best: had lgone
with him,l had never had so many things to be thankful for, and the
reader had never heard of the second part of the travels and adventures
of Robinson Crusoe; sol must here leave exclaiming at myself, and go
on with my voyage. From the Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic
Sea to the Cape of Good Hope. and had a tolerable good voyage, our
course generally southeast, now and then a storm. and some contrary
winds, but my disasters at see were at an end; my future rubs and cross
events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land was as
well prepared to be our scourge as the sea.

Our ship was on a trading voyage. and had a supereergo on board, who
was to direct all her motions alter she arrived at the Cape, only being
limited to a certain number of days for stay. by charter-party," the
several ports she was to go to. This was none of my business, neither
did 1 meddle with it; my nephew, the captain, and the supercargo,
adjusting all those things between them as they thought ht.

at the island of Madagascar. where, though the people are fierce and
treacherous. and very well armed with lances and bows, which they use
with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with them awhile:
they treated us very civilly; and, for some trifles which we gave them,
such as knives, scissors, etc.. they brought us eleven good fat bullocks of
a middling size, which we took in partly for fresh provisions for our
present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.

We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished our-
selves with provisions; and 1. who was always too curious to look into
every nook of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore as often
as I could. It was on the east side of the island that we went on shore
one evening: and the people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a distance; but, as we had
traded freely with them, and had been kindly used, we thought ourselves
in no danger; but when we saw the people, we out three boughs out of a
trce,and stuck them up ata distance from us; which, it seems, is a mark in
that country, not only of a trace and friendship, but when it is accepted,
the other side sets up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they
accept the trace too; but then this is a known condition of the truce, that
you are not to pass beyond their three poles toward them. nor they to
come past your three poles or boughs toward you; so that you are per-
l'cctly secure within the three poles, and all the space between your poles
and theirs is allowed like a market for free converse, traffic. and com-
merce. When you go there, you must not carry your weapons with you:
and if they come into that space, they stick up their javelins and lances
all at the first poles. and come on unarmed; but if any violence is offered
them. and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay
hold or their weapons, and the truce is at an end.

it happened one evening when we went on shore. that a greater number
ortheir people came down than usual, but all very friendly and civil; and
they brought several kinds of provisions, {or which we satisfied them
with such toys as we had: their women also brought us milk and roots
and several things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet; and we
made us a little tent or but of some boughs of trees, and lay on shore all
night.

I knew not what. was the occasion, butl was not so well satisfied to lie
on shore as the rest; and the boat riding at an anchor about a stone's cast
from the land, with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of
them come on shore; and getting some bought or trees to cover us also
in the boat. I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and lay under
the cover of the branches of the trees all night in the boat.

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men makes
terrible noise on the shore, ealling out. for God's sake to bring the boat
in. and come and help them, for they were all like to be murdered; at
the same time I heard the tire of five muskets, which was the number of,
the guns they had. and that three times over; for. it seems. the natives
here were not so easily frightened with guns as the savages were in
America, where I had to do with them. All this while I knew not what
was the matter, but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise,[
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with three fusees we had on
board. to land and assist our men.

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too much
haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the water to get to
the boat with all the expedition they could, being pursued by between
three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine in all, and only five
of them had fusees with them: the rest had pistols and swords, indeed,
but they were of small use to them.

We took up seven of our men. and with difliculty enough too, three
of them being very ill wounded; and that which was still worse was,
that while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as much
danger as they were in on shore; for they poured their arrows in upon us
so thick. that we were glad to barricade the side of the boat up with the'
benches, and two or three loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction,
we had by mere accident in the boat. And yet, had it been daylighl, they
are. it seems, such exact marksman. that if they could have seen but the
least part of any of us, they would have been sure of us. We had. by
the light of the moon a sight of them. as they stood pelting us from the
shore with darts and arrows; having got ready our tire-arms, we gave
them a volley. that we could hear by the cries of some of them,had
wounded several; however, they stood thus in battle array on the
shore till break of day, which we suppose was that they might see the
better to take their aim at us.

In this! conditon we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our anchor or
set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the boat, and they
were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot.
We made signals of distress to the ship. which though she rode a league
oll', yet my nephew, the captain. hearing our tiring. and by glasses per-
ceivmg the posture we lay in. and that we tired toward the shore. pretty
well understood us: and weighinganchor with all speed. he stood as near
the shore as he durat with the ship. and then sent another boat with ten
. hands in her to assist us: but we called to them not to come too near,
telling them what condition we were in; however. they stood in near to342 musician or
'

us, and one of the men taking the end ofa tow-line in his hand, and keep-
ing one boat between him and the enemy," that they could not per-
l'ectly see him. swam on board us. and made fast the line to the boat:
upon which we slipped out a little cable : and leaving our anchor behind,
they towed us out of the reach of the arrows; we all the while lying
close behind the barricade we had made.

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore, that we
could lay her side to the shore. she ran along just by them. and poured
in a broadside among them loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small
bullets. and such stuff. beside the great shot, which made a terrible havoc
among them.

When we were got on board and out of danger, we had timeto examine
into the occasion of this fray; and, indeed, our supereargo. who had been
often in these parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure the inhabit-
ants would not have touched us alter we had made a truce, if we had
not done something to provoke them to it. At length it came out that an
old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had brought it within our
poles, and a young woman with .her. who also brought some roots or
herbs: and while the old woman (whether she was mother to the young
woman or no they could not tell) was selling us the milk. one of our men
olfered some rudeness to the wench that was with her, at which the old
woman made a great noise: however the seamen would not quit his prize,
but carried her out of the old woman's sight among the trees. it being
almost dark: the old woman went away without her. and. as we may
suppose, made an outcry among the people she came from; who, upon
notice, raised this great army upon us in three or four hours; and it was
great odds but we had all been destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the
beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had made: the
rest came all" free all but the fellow who was the occasion of all the mis-
chief, who paid dear enough for his black mistress, for we could not hear
what became of him a great while. We lay upon the shore two days
alter, though the wind presented, and made signals for him, and made
our boat sail up shore and down shore several leagues. but in vain, so we
were obliged to give him over; and if he alone had snfl'ered for it, the loss
had been less.

I could not satiety myself, however, without venturing on shore once
more, to try if X could learn any thing of him or them; it was the third
night alter the action that I had a great mind to learn, if I could by any
means, what mischief we had done. and how the game stood on the
Indians' side. I was earet'ul to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked
again: but I ought, indeed, to have been sure that the men I went with
had been under my command. before I engaged in a thing so hazardous
and mischievous as I was brought into by it, without design.
We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship, beside the
aupercargo and myself, and we landed two hours before midnight, at the
same place where the Indians stood drawn up in the evening before: I
landed here, because my design, as l have said, was chiefly to see if they
had quitted the field, and if they had left any marks behind them of the
mischief we had done them; and I thought if we could surprise one
or two of them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of ex-
change.

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two bodies.
whereof the boatswain commanded one and I the other. We neither
saw nor heard anybody stir when we landed: and we marched up, one
body at a distance from the other,to the place; but at first could see
nothing, it being very dark; till by-and-by our boatswain, who led the
first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This made them halt
awhile; for knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place
where the Indiana had stood, they waited for my coming up there. We
concluded to halt till the moon begun to rise, which we knew would be in
less than an hour. when we could easily discern the havoc we had made
among them. We told thirty-two bodies upon the ground. whereof two
were not quite dead; some had an arm, and some a leg shot off, and
one his head; those that were wounded, we suppose, they had carried
away.

When we had made, as I thought-a full discovery ofall we could come
to the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on board; but the boatswain
and his party sent me word that they were resolved to make a visit to the
Indian town, where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me
to go along with them ; and if they could find them, as they still fancied
they should, they did not doubt of getting a good booty: and it might
be they might find Tom Jefll'y there; that was the man's name we had
lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go I knew well enough what answer
to have given them; for I should have commanded them instantly on
board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a ship and
a ship-loading in our charge, and a voyage to make which depended very
much upon the lives of the men; but a; they sent me word they were
resolved to go, and only asked me and my company to go along with them,
I positively refused it. and rose up, for I was sitting on the ground, in
order to go to the boat. One or two of the men began to importune me
to go; and when I refused, began to grumble. and say that they were not
under my command, and they would go. Come, Jack, says one of the
men, will you go with me? I'll go for one. Jack laid he would,--and
then anotherhand, in a. word, they all left me but one. whom I per-
suaded to stay, and a boy leftin the boat. So the supercargo and I, witl'
the third man, went back to the boat, where we told them we would stay
for them, and take care to take in as many of them as should be left; for
I told them it was a mad thing they were going about, and supposed
most of them would run the fate of Tom Jeffry.

They told me. like seamen. they would warrant it they would come
ofl'again,and they would take care,ele.; so away they went. I entreated
them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives were not their
own, and that theywere intrusted with the voyage, in some measure:
that if they miscarried. the ship might be lost for want of their help, and
that they could not answer for it to God or man. But I might as well
have talked to the mainmast of the ship: they were mad upon their
journey, only they gave me good words, and begged I would not be angry:
that they did not doubt but they would be back again in about an hour
at farthest ; for the Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile off,
though they found it above two miles before they got to it.

Well, they all'went away: and though the attempt was desperate, and
such as none but madman would have gone about. yet. to give them their
due, they went about it as warily as bodly: they were gallantly armed,
for they had every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet. and a pistol; some
of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had hangers, and the boat-
swain and two more had poleaxes; beside all which, they had among
them thirteen hand-grenades: bolder fellows and better provided never
went about any wicked work in the world.

When they went out. their chief design was plunder, and they were in
mighty hopes of finding gold there: but a circumstance, which none of
them were aware of. set them on fire with revenge, and made devils of
them all. When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought
had been the town, which was not above half a mile 011'. they were under
a great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen
houses; and where the town was, or how, big, they knew not. They
consulted. therefore, what to do, and were some time before they'eould
resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut all their throats, and it
was ten toone but some of them might escape, it being in the night,
though the moon was up; and if one escaped. he would run and raise all
the town.so they should have a whole army upon them: again, on the
other hand. if they went away and let! those untouched, for the people
were all asleep, they could not tell which way to look for the town: how-
ever. the last was the best advice; so they resolved to leave them, and
look for the town as well as they could. They went on a little way, and
found a cow tied to a tree; this. they presently concluded, would be a
good guide to them: for they said, the cow certainly belonged to the
town before them. or to the town behind them; and if they untied her,
they should see which way she went; if she went back, they had nothing
.to say to her; but, if she went forward, they could follow her: so they
cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on
before them. directly to the town; which. as they reported, consisted of
above two hundred houses or huts. and in some of these they found
several families living together.

Here they found all in silence. as profoundly secure as sleep could
make them: and, first, they called another council, to consider what they
had to do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide themselves into three
bodies. and so set three houses on tire in three parts of the town: and as
the men csiue out, to seize them and bind them (if any resisted, they
need not be asked what to do then), and so to search the rest or the
houses for plunder; but they resolved to march silently first through the
town,and see what dimensions it was of, and if they might venture upon
it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would 'venture upon
them: but while they were animating one another to the work, three of
them, who were a little before the rest, called out aloud to them. and told
them that they had found Tom Jefl'ry: they all ran up to the place. where
they found the poor fellow hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat
cut. There was an lndian house just by the tree, where they found
sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians. who had been concerned
in the fray with us before, and two or three of them wounded with our
shot; and our men found they were awake, and talking one to another in
that house, but knew not their number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as before,
that they swore to one another they would be revenged, and that not an
Indian that came into their hands should have any quarter; and to work
they went immediately, and yet not so madly as might be expected from
the rage and fury they were in. Their first care was to get something
that would soon take tire, but, after a little search, they found that would
he to no purpose; for most of the houses were low. and thatched with
flags and rushes, of which the country is full; so they presently made
some wildflre.ss we call it, by wetting a little powder'in the palm of
their hands; and in a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four

'or five places, and particularly that house where the Indians were not
gone to bed.

As soon as the tire began to blaze, the poor frightened creatures began
to rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in the attempt;
and especially at the door. where they drove them back: the boatswain
himself killing one or two with his poleex; the house being large and
many in it. he did not care to go in. but called fora hand-grenade. and
threw it among them, which at first frightened them. but. when it burst,
made such havoc among them, that they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short. most of the Indians who were in the open part of the house
were killed or hurt with the grenade, except two or three who pressed to
the door. which the boatswain and two more kept, with their bayonets
on the mullet of their pieces, and dispatched all that came in their
way: but there was mother apartment in the house, where the prince.
or king. or whatever he was. and several others were; and these were
kept in till the house. which was by this time all in a light flame, fell in
upon them, and they were smothered together.

All this while they fired not a gun. because they would not waken the
people faster than they could master them; but the fire began to waken
them fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little together in
bodies; for the fire grewso raging, all the houses being made of light
combustible stuff, that they could hardly bear the street between them;
and their business was to follow the fire. for the surer execution : as fast
as the fire either forced the people out of those houses which were burn-
ing, or frightened them out of others. our people were ready at their
doors to knock them on the head, still calling and hallooing one to another
to remember Torn Jeffry. '

While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy. and especially
when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being night, seemed to be
just by me. My nephew, the captain. who was roused by his men, seeing
such a fire, was very uneasy. not knowing what the matter was. or what
danger l was in. especially hearing the guns too. for by this time they
began to use their fire-arms; a thousand thoughts oppressed his mind
concerning the and the aupercargo, what would become of us; and, at
last. though he could ill spare any more men. yet. not knowing what
exigence we might be in, he takes another boat, and with thirteen men
and himself comes on shore to me. .

He was surprised tosee me and the aupercargo in the boat, with no
more than two men; and though he was glad that we were well. yet he
was in the some impatience with us to know what was doing; for the
noise continued. and the flame increased; in short. it was next to an impos-
sibility for any man in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what
had happened. or theirconcem for the safety of the men: in a word, the
captain told me'he would go and help his men, let what would come. I
argued with him, as I did before with the men. the safety of the ship. the-
danger of the voyage. the interest of the owners and merchants. etc.. and
told him I and the two men would go. and only see if we could. at a dis- .
tance. learn what was like to be the event. and come back and tell him.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before;
he would go. he said; and he only wished he had left but ten men in the
ship; finr he could not think of having his men lost tor want of help.
he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and his life and all; and away he
went.

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade them
not to go; so. in short, the captain ordered two men to row back the pin-
nace and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and
that when they came back, six men should keep the two boats, and six
more come after us: so that he left only sixteen men in the ship; for the
whole ship's company consist ot' sixty-live men, whereof two were lost
in the late quarrel which brought this mischief on.

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of the ground
we trod on: and being guided by the tire, we kept no path, but went
directly to the place of the flame. If the noise of the guns wassurpris-
ing to us before. the cries of the poor people were now quite of another
nature, and tilled us with horror. I must confess Iwas never at the sack-
ing a city. or at the taking a town by storm. I had heard of Oliver
Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man, woman, and
child; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the city of Magdeburg, and
cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand of all sexes; but I never had
an idea or the thing itself before. nor is it possible to describe it, or the
horror that was upon our minds at hearing it. However. we went on.
and at length came to the town, though there was no entering the streets
of it for the fire. The first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or
house, or rather the ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just
before it, plain enough to be seen by the light of the hre,lay four men
and three women killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the
heap smong the lire; in short, there were such instances of rage alto-
gether barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what was human, that
we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it; for if they were
the authors of it, we thought they ought to be every one of them put to
the worst of deaths. But this was not all: we saw the fire increased for-
ward end the cry went on just as the fire went on; so that we were in
the utmost confusion. We advanced a little way farther: and, behold, to
our astonishment, three naked women, and crying in a most dreadful
manner. came flying as if they had wings, and alter them sixteen or
seventeen men. natives, in the same terror and consternation, with three
of our English butchers in the rear; who, when they could not overtake
them,flred in among them. and one that was killed by their shot fell
down in our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be their ene-
mies, and that we would murder them as well as those that pursued them,
they set up a most dreadful shriek. especially the women, and two of
them fell down as if already dead, with the fright.

My very soul shrank within me, and my blood ran chill in my veins,
when I saw this: and I believe, had the three English sailors that pur-
sued them come on, I had made our men kill them all; however we took
some way to let the poor dying creatures know that we would not hurt
them; and immediately they came up to us. and kneeling down with
their hands lifted up, made piteo_us lamentstion to us to save them, which
we let them know we would; whereupon they crept all together in a
huddle close behind us, as for protection. I left my men drawn up together,
and charging them to hurt nobody. but. if possible. to get at some of our
people, and see whatdevil it was possessed them, and what they intended
to do, and to command them otl'; assuring them that if they stayed till
daylight. they would havea hundred thousand men about their ears: I
say I lelt them. and went among those flying people, taking only two of
our men with me; and there was indeed a piteous spectacle among them;
some of them had their feet terribly burnt, with trampling and running
through the tire, others their hands burnt; one of the women had fallen
down in the tire, and was very much burnt before she could get out
again; and two or three of the men had cuts in their backs and thighs.
from our men pursuing; and another was shot through the body, and died
while I was there.

I would rain have learned what the occasion or all this was, but [could
not understand one word they said; though. by signs,l perceived aome
of them ltnew not what was the occasion themselves. 1 was so terrified
in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt. that I could not stay there,
but went back to my own men. and resolved to go into the mildde of the
town through the tire. or whatever might be in the way, and put an end
to it. cost what it would: accordingly. as I came back to my men, I told
them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me; when at the
very moment came {our of our men. with the boatswain at their head,
roving over heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and
dust, as it' they wanted more people to massacre. when our men hallooed
to them as loud as they could halloo; and with much ado one of them
made them hear. so that they knew who we~were. and came up to us.

As soon as the boatswain saw us. he set up a halloo like a shout of
triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come; and without wait-
ing to hear me. Captain, says he, noble captain! i am glad you are come;
we are not half done yet: villanous hell-hound dogs! I'll kill as many of
them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head: we have sworn to spare none
of them; we'll root out the very nation of them from the earth: and
thus he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would not give us
leave to speak a word.

At last. raising my voice. that 1 might silence him a little. barbarous
dog! said I. what are you doing! I won't have one creature touched
more, upon pain of death: I charge you. upon your life. to stop you!
hands. and stand still here. or you ares dead man this minute. Why.
sir. says he. do you know what you do, or what they have done! If you
want a reason for what we have done. come hither: and with that he
showed me the poor t'ellow hanging. with his throat cut.

I confess I was urged then myself. and at another time would have been
forward enough; but I thought they had carried their rage too far,
and remembered Jacob's words to his son Simeon and Levi--"Cursed be
their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel." But I
bad news new task upon my hands; for when the men I carried with
me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain them as
I should have had with the others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with
them. and told me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for {ear
of the men being overpowered; and as to the people, he thought not one
of them ought to live; for they had all glutted themselves with the mur-
der of the poor man. and that they ought to be used like murderers; upon
these words, away ran eight of my men, with the boatswain and his crew,
tocomplete their bloody work; and I seeing it quite out of my power to
restrain them, came away pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight,
much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretchos that fell into
their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two men,
and with these walked back to the boat. It was a very great piece
of folly in me, I confess, to venture back as it were alone; for as it began
now to be almost day, and the alarm had run over the country, there

stood about forty men, armed with lances and bows, at the little place -

where the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned before; but by
accident I missed the place. and came directly to the sea-side; and by the
time I got to the sea-side it was broad day; immediately I took the pin-
nace and went on board, and sent her back to assist the men in what
might happen.

lobserved, about the time that I came to the boat side, that the tlre
was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about half an hour
alter 1 got on board, I heard a volley of our men's fire-arms, and saw a
great smoke: this, as] understood aflerwsrd, was our men filling upon
the men who, as I said, stood at the'few houses on the way, of whom they
killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all the houses on fire, but did not
meddle with the women or children.

By the time the men get to the shore again with the plnnaee, our men
began to appear; they came dropping in, not in two bodies as they went,
but straggling here and there in such a'manner, that a small force of
resolute men might have cut them all off. But the dread of them was
upon the whole country; and the men were surprised, and so frightened,
that l believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but five
of our men; nor in all this terrible action was therea man that made
any considerable defense; they were so surprised between the terror of
the fire and the sudden attack of our men in the dark, that they knew not
which way to turn themselves; for if they fled one way they were met
by one party; if back again, by another; so that they were everywhere
knocked down : nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one
that sprained his foot, and another that had one of his hands burnt.

l was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and. indeed, with all
the men, in my mind, but with him in particular, as well for his acting
so out of his duty as commander of the ship. and having the charge of
the voyage upon him, as in his prompting. rather than cooling. the rage
of his blind men. in so bloody and cruel an enterprise. My nephew
answered me very respectfully, but told me that when he saw the body
of the poor seamen whom they had murdered in so cruel and barbarous
a manner. he was not master of himself", neither could he govern his
passion; he owned he should not have done so. as he was commander
of the ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved him, he could not
bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not subject to me at all,
and they knew it well enough; so they took no notice of my dislike.

The next day we set sail. so we never heard any more of it. Our men
differed in the account of the number they had killed; but, according to
the best of their accounts. put all together, they killed or destroyed about

no hundred and tiny people. men, women, and children, and lefl not a
house standing in the town. As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry." he
was quite dead (for his throat was so cut that his head was half oft'), it
would do him no service to bring him away: so they only took him down
from the tree where he was hanging by one hand.

However just our men thought this action,I was against them in it,
and I always. after that time, told them God would blast the voyage: for
I looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be murder in them:
for though it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry. yet Jeffry was the
aggressor. had broken the truce. and had violated or debauched a young
woman of theirs, who came down to them innocently, and on the hint
of the public capitulation.

The boatawain defended this quarrel when we were afterward on board.
He said it was true that we seemed to break the truce. but really had not;
and that the war was begun the night before by the natives themselves,
who had shot at us, and killed one of our men without any just provocae
tion; so that as we were in a capacity to fight them now, we might also
be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary
manner; that though the poor man had taken a little liberty with the
wench. he ought not to have been murdered.and that in such a villainous
manner; and that they did nothing but what wasjuet, and what the laws
of God allowed to be done to murderers.

One would think this should have been enough to have warned us
against going on shore among heathens and barbarians: but it is
impossible to make mankind wise but at their own expense; and their
experience seems to be always of most use to them when it is dearest
bought.

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia. and from thence to the coast
of Coromandel. only to touch at Surat: but the chief of the aupercargo'a
design lay at the bay of Bengal; where,if he missed his business outward--
hound, he was to go up to China. and return to the coast as be came home.
The first disaster that befell us was in the gulfof Persia, where five ofour
men venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the gulf. were surrounded
by the Arabians, and either all killed or carried away into slavery; the
rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them,and had but just
time to get off their boat. I began to upbrsid them with the just retribu-
tion of Heaven in this case: but the boatswain very warmly told me, he
thought! went farther in my censures than I could show any warrant for
in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii. 4, where our Saviour intimates that
those men on whom the tower of Siloam fell were not sinners above all
the Galileansz' but that which put me to silence in the case was, that not
one of these five men who were now lost were of those who went on
shore to the massacre of Madagascar, so I always called it, though our
men could not bear to hear the word massacre with any patience.

But my frequent preaching to them on the subject had worse conse-
quences than I expected; and the boatswain. who had been the head of
the attempt, came up boldly to me one time. and told me he found that
I brought that aEair continually upon the stage; that I made unjust
reflections upon it, and had used the men very ill on that account, and
himself in particular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no command
in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged to beer it:
that they did not know but I might have some ill design in my head, and
perhaps to call them to an account for it when they came to England:
and that, therefore. unless I would resolve to have done with it. and also
not to concern myself any farther with him, or any of his alfairs, he
would leave the ship; for he did not think it was safe to sail with me
among them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him. that
I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of Madagascar. and
that I had, on all occasions, spoke my mind freely about it, though not
more upon him than any of the rest; that as to having no command in
the ship, that was true; nor did I exercise any authority. only took the
liberty of speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us all;
and what concern I had in the voyage was none of his business; that I
was a considerable owner in the ship: in that claim, I conceived I had a
right to speak even farther than I had done, and would not be accountable
to him or any one else: and began to be a little warm with him. He
made but little reply to me at that time.and I thought the afi'air had been
over. We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being willing to
see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo, in the ship's boat, to
divert myself: and toward evening was preparing to go on board, when
one of the men came to me. and told me he would not have me trouble
myself to'come down to the boat. for they had orders not to carry me on
. board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so inso-
lent a message: and I asked the man who bade him deliver that message
to me! He told me the cockswain. I said no more to the fellow, but
bade him let them know he had delivered his message, and that I had
given him no answer to it.

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told him the
story; adding, what 1 presently foresaw, that there would be a mutiny
in the ship; and entreated him to go immediately on board the ship in an
Indian boat. and acquaint the captain of it. But I might have spared
this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore the matter was
ell'ected on board. The boatswain, the gunner. the carpenter, and all the
inferior officers, as soon as l was gone off in the boat, came up and desired
to speak with the captain; and there the boatswsin, making a long he-
rangue, and repeating all he had said to me, told the captain. in afew
words. that as l was now gone peaceably on shore, they were loth to use
any violence with me, which, ifl had not gone on shore, they would
otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone; they therefore thought
fit to tell him, that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship under
his command, they would perform it well and faithfully: but if I would
not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave
the ship, and sail no farther with him; and at that word all he turned his
face toward the mainmast, which was. it seems, the signal agreed on
between them, at which all the seamen, being got together there, cried
out. One and all! one and all!

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit. and of great presence of
mind; and though he was surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, yet
he told them calmly that he would consider of the matter; but that he
could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it. He used some
arguments with them to show them the unreasonableness and injustice
of the thing; but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands round
before his thee, that they would all go on shore, unless he would engage
to them not to sufi'er me to come any more on board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me and
did not know how I might take it: so he began to talk smartly to them;
told them that l was a very considerable owner of the ship, and that, in jus-
tice, he could not put me out of my own house; that this was next door
to serving me as the famous pirate Kidd had done, who made a mutiny
in the ship, set the captain on shore on an uninhabited island, and ran
away with the ship: that, let them go into whatship they would, ifever
they came to England again, it would cost them very dear; that the ship
was mine, and that he could not put me out of it; and that he would
rather lose the ship and the voyage too than disobligs me so much; so
they might do as they pleased: however, he would go on shore and talk
with me, and invited the boatswain to go with him.and perhaps they
might accommodate the matter with me. But they all rejected the pro-
posal, and said they would have nothing to do with me any more; and If
I came on board, they would all go on shore. Well. said the captain, if you
are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with him. So away he
came to me with this account,a little alter the message had been brought
to me from the coeksvgain.

I was very glad to see my nephew.I must confess: for I was not with-
out apprehensions that they would confine him by violence. set sail, and
run away with the ship: and then I had been stripped naked in a remote
country, having nothing to help myself; in short I had been in a worse
case than when I was alone in the island. But they had not come to that
length. it seems; to my satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what
they had said to him, and how they: had sworn and shook hands that they
would. one and all, leave the ship in was autl'ered to come on hoard,l
told him he should not be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore:
I only desired he would take care and send me all my necessary things on
shore, and leave me n suflicient sum of money, and I would find my way
to England as well as I could.

This was 'a heavy piece of news to my nephew, but there was no way
to help it but to comply: so, in short, he went on board the ship again,
and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to theirimportunity. and
had sent for his goods from on board the ship: so that the matter was
over in a few hours, the men returned to their duty, and I began to con-
sider what course I should steer.

I was now alone in the most remote part of the world. as I think] may
call it. fort was near three thousand leagues by sea farther otf from Eng-
land than I was at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here by land
over the great Mogul's country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora
by sea, up the gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the
Desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by see again
to Italy, and so overland into France; and this put together might at
least be a full diameter of the globe. or more.

I had another way before me. which was to wait for some English ships,
which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the Island of Sumatra, and
get passage on board" them for England. But as I came hither with.
out any concern with the English East India Company. so it would be

30
diflicult to go from hence without their license, unless with great favor of
the captains of the ships, or the Company's factors, and to both I was an
utter stranger.

Here I had the mortitleation tosee the ship set sail without men treatp
ment, 1 think, a man in my circumstances scarce ever met with. except
when pirates running away with the ship. and setting those that would
not agree with their villainy on shore. Indeed. this was next door to it,
both ways; however, my nephew left me two servants, or rather one
companion and one servant; the first was clerk to the purser, whom he
engaged to go with me, and the other was his own servant. I took me
also a good lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, where several mer-
chants lodged, some French, two Italians. or rather Jews,and one English--
man; here I was handsomely enough entertained; and. that I might not
he said to run rashly upon any thing. I stayed here above nine months.
considering what course to take, and how to manage myself. I had some
English goods with me of value, and a considerable sum of money; my
nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of
credit for more, if I had occasion, that I might not be straitened what-
ever might happen.

I quickly disposed of my goods to advantage, and. as I originally
intended. I bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all other
things, were the most proper for me in my present circumstances;
because 1 could always carry my whole estate about me.

Alter a long stay here, and many proposals made for my return to
England, but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant who
lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance
with, came to me one morning. Countryrnan, says he. 1 have a project
to communicate to you, which. as it suits with my thoughts. may, for
aught I know, suit with yours also. when you shall have thoroughly
considered it. Here we are posted, you by accident, and I by my own
choice, in a part of the world very remote from our own country; but it
is in a country where, by us who understand trade and business, a great
deal of money is to be got. it you will put one thousand pounds to my
one thousand pounds. we will hire a ship here, the first we can get to our
minds; you shall be captain, I'll be marehant,and we'll go a trading
voyage to China: for what should we stand still for'! The whole world
is in motion, rolling round and round: all the creatures of God, heavenly
bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent; why should we be idle!
There are no drones in the world but men; why should we be of that
number!

I liked this proposal very well, and the more because it seemed to he
expressed with so much good-will. and in so friendly amanner. I will
not say but that I might, by my loose, unhinged'circumstances, be the
filter to embrace a proposal for trade, or indeed any thing else; whereas,
otherwise. trade was none of my element. IIowever,I might perhaps say
with some truth, that if trade was not my element. rambling was. and
no proposal for seeing any part of the world which I had never seen
before could possibly some amiss to me. '

It was. however, some time before we could geta ship to our minds,
and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors: that
is to say, so many as were necessary to govern the voyage and manage
the sailors which we should pick up there. After some time we gets
mate, a boatswain. and a gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and three
foremast-men. With these we found we could do well enough. having
Indian seamen, such as they were, to make up.

There are so many travelers who have written the history of their
voyages and travels this way, that it would be very little diversion to
anybody to give a long account of the places we went to, and the people
who inhabit there; these things I leave to others. and refer the reader to
those journals and travels of Englishmen of which many, I find, are
published. and more promised, every day; it is enough for me to tell you
that we made this voyage to Achin. in the Island of Sumatra, and from
thence to Siam. where we exchanged some of our wares for opium and
some arraclr; the first a commodity which bears a great price among the
Chinese, and which, at that time, was much wanted there. In a word,
we went up to Susltan. made a very great voyage, were eight months out,
and returned to Bengal; and I was very well satisfied with my adventure.
I observe that our people in England otten admire how ofiicers which the
Company send into India, and the merchants which generally stay there,
get such very great estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth
sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time; but it is no wonder. or at
least we shallsee so much farther into it. when we consider the innumer-
able ports and places where they have a free commerce, that it will be
nonei and much less it will be so when we consider that at those places
and ports where the English ships come. there is such great and constant
demands for the growth of all other countries, that there is a certain vent
for the returns, as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much money by
my first adventure, and such an insight into the method of getting more,
that had I been twenty years younger,I should have been tempted to
have stayed here. and sought no farther for making any fortune; but
what was all this to a man upward of threescore. that was rich enough,
and came abroad more in obedience to' a restless desire of seeing the
world than a covetous desire of gaining by it? And, indeed, I think it is
with great justice I now call it restless desire. for it was so. When I was
at home, I was restless to go abroad; and when I was abroad I was rest-
less to be at home. I say, what was this gain to me! I was rich enough
already, nor had I any uneasy desires about getting more money; and
therefore the profit of the voyage to me was of no great force for the
prompting the forward to farther.undertakings; hence I thought by this
voyage I had made no progress at all. because I was some back, as I
might call it. to the place from whence I commas to a home: whereas
my eye. which. like that which Solomon speaks of. was never satisfied
wtth seeing. was still desirous of wandering and seeing more. I was
come into a part of the world which I was never in before, and that part.
in particular, which I had heard much of. and was resolved to see as
much of it as I could; and then I thought I might say I had seen all the
world that was worth seeing.

But my fellow-traveler and I had different notions: I do not name this to
insist on my own, for I acknowledge his were the most just, and the most
suited to the end ofa merchant's life; who. when he is abroad upon adven-
tum, it is his wisdom to stick to that,as the best thing for him, which he
is like to get the most money by. My new nephew friend kept himself
to the nature of the thing, and would have been content to have gone,
like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn. backward and forward, pro-
vided he could, as he called it. find his account in it. On the other hand,
mine was the notion of a mad. rambling boy. that never cares to see a
thing twice over. But this was not all: I had a kind of impatience upon
me to be nearer home. and yet the most unsettled resolution imaginable
which way to go. In the interval of these consultations, my friend. who
was always upon the search for business-proposed another voyage to me
among the Spice Islands, and to bring home a loading of cloves from the
Manillas, or thereabouts; places, indeed, where the Dutch trade. but
islands belonging partly to the Spaniards; though we went not so far,
but to some other. where they have not the whole power, as they have at
Batavia. Ceylon, etc.

We were not long in preparing for this voyage: the chief difficulty was
in bringing me to come into it; however. at last, nothing else offering,
and finding that really stirring about and trading, the profit being so
great, and, as I may say, certain, had more pleasure in it, and had more
satisfaction to my mind, than sitting still, which, to me especially. was
the unhappiest part of life,l resolved on this voyage too, which we made
very successfully. touching at Borneo, and several islands whose names I
do not remember, and came home in about five months. We sold our
spice, which was chiefiy cloves and some nutmegs, to the Persian mer-
chants, who earried them away to the golf; and making near five of one,
we really got a great deal of money.

My friend. when we made up this account. smiled at me: Well now,
said he, with a sort of agreeable insult upon my indolent temper, is not.
this better than walking about here. like a man or nothing to do, and
spending our time in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the
Pagans l--Why, truly, says I, my friend, I think it is, and I begin to be a
euovert to the principles of merchandising; but I must tell you, said I,
by the way, you do not know what I am doing; for if I once conquer my
backwardness, and embark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you up
and down the world till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly,l shall
never let you lie still.

But, to be short with my speculations,a little while after this there
came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she was a coaster, not a European
trader. of about two hundred tons burden; the men, as they pretended,
having been so sickly, that the captain had not hands enough to go to sea
with, he lay by at Bengal; and having, it seems, got money enough, or
being willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice
he would sell his ship. This came to my ears before my new partner
heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy it; so I went to him, and told
him of it. He considered awhile.for he was no rash man either; but
musing some time, he replied, She is a little too big; but, however, we
will have her. Accordingly. we bought the ship, and agreeing with the
master, we paid for, and took possession. When we had done so. we
resolved to entertain the men, if we could. to join them with those we
had, for the pursuing our business; but on a sudden, they having
received, not their wages, but their share of the money, as we afterward
learned, not one of them was to be found: we inquired much about
them, and at length were told that they were all gone together by land to
Agra. the great city of the Mogul's residence, and from thence to travel
to Surat, and go by sea to the gult'of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should miss
the opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble,l thought, and
in such company as would both have guarded and diverted me, would
have suited mightily with my great design; and I should have both seen
the-world and gone homeward too; but I was much better satisfied,a few
days alter, when I came to know what sort of fellows they were; for, in
short, their history was, that this man they called captain was the gunner
only, not the commander; that they had been a trading voyage, in which
they had been attacked on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed
the captain and three of his men; and that alter the captain was killed,
these men, eleven in number, had resolved to run away with the ship
which they did,and brought her to Bengal, leaving the mate_and tlve
men more on shore; of whom hereatter.

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly by her,
as we thought, though we did not, I confess, examine into things as
exactly as we ought; for we never inquired any thing of the seamen, who
would certainly have faltered in their account, contradicted one another,
and perhaps contradicted themselves; or onehow or other we should
have had reason to have suspected them: but the man showed us a bin
or sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such name.
for I suppose it was all a forgery. and called himself by that name. and
we could not contradict him; and withal having no suspicion of the
thing, we went through with our bargain.

We picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some
Dutch; and now we resolved for a second voyage to the southeast for
cloves. etc., that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca isles; and,
in short, not to fill up this part of my story with trifles, when what is to
come is so remarkable,l spent, from first to last, six years in this country.
trading from port to port. backward and forward, and with very good
success, and was now the last year with my new partner, going in the
ship above-mentioned, on a voyage to China, but designing first to Siam,
to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and down :1
great while in the straits of Malacca and among the islands, we were no
sooner got clear of those diflicult seas than we found our ship had sprung
a leak, and we were not able. by all our industry, to and out where it
was. This forced us to make some port:' and, my partner, who knew
the country better than I did, directed the captain to put into the river of
Cambodia; for I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson. captain,
not being willing to takothe charge of the ship upon myself. This river
lies on the north side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore for refreshment, there
comes to me one day an Englishman, and he was, it seems. a gunner'a
"mate on board an English East India ship which rode in the same river,
at or near the city of Cambodia: what brought him hither we knew not;
but he comes to me, and speaking English, Sir, says he, you are a stranger

to me, and I to you, but I have something to tell you that very nearly
concerns you.

I looked steadfastly at him a good while, and thought at first I had
known him, but I did not: If it very nearly concerns me, said I, and not
yourself, what moves you to tell it to mel--l am moved, says he. by the
imminent danger you are in, and, for aught I see, you have no knowledge
of it.--l know no danger I am in, says I, but that my ship is leaky, and I
can not find it out; out I intend to lay her aground to-morrow, to see it" I
can find it.--But. sir, says he, leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it,
you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, when you
hear what I have to say to you: do you know, sir, said he, the town of
Cambodia, lies about fifteen leagues up this river! and there are two
large English ships about five leagues on this side. and three Dutch.--
Well, said l, and what is that to me 'l--Why. air, said he, it is for a man
that is upon such adventures as you are,to come into a port and not
examine first what ships there are there, and whether he is able to
deal with them'! I suppose you do not think you are a match for them!
I was amused very much at his discourse, but not amazed at it, for I
could not conceive what he meant; and 1 turned short upon him, and
said, Sin] wish you would explain yourself; I can not imagine what
reason I have to be afraid of any of the Company's ships, or Dutch ships:
1 am no interloper; what can they have to say to me! He looked like a
man half angry and half pleased. and pausing awhile, but smiling, Well,
sir. says he, if you think yourself secure. you must take your chance; I
am sorry your fate should blind you against good advice; but assure
yourself, if you do not put to sea immediately. you will the very next
tide be attacked by live long-boats full of men, and perhaps, if you are
taken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined
aflerward. I thought, sir. added he, I should have met with a better re-
ception than this, for doing you a piece of service of such importance.--
1 can never be ungrateful, said I, for any service, or to any man that
ofl'ers me any kindness; but it is past my comprehension what they
should have such a design upon me for. however. since you say there is
no time to be lost, and that there is some villainous design on hand
against me, I will go on board this minute, and put to sea immediately,
it' my men can stop the leak, or if we can swim without stopping it: but.
sir, said I, shall I go away ignorant of the cause of all this! Can you
give me no further light into it 'l--I can tell you but part of the story, sir,
says he; but I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and I believe I could
persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is scarce time for it: but the
short of the story is this, the first part of which,l suppose, you know
well enough, viz: that you was with this ship at Sumatra; that there
your captain was murdered by the Malays, with three of his men; and
that you, or some of those that were on board with you, ran away with
the ship, and are since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story, and
you will all be seized as pirates,I can assure you. and executed with very
little ceremony; for you know merchant ships show but little law to
pirates. if they get them into their power.--Now you speak plain English,
said Land I thank you; and though Iknow nothing that we have done
Iike.what you talk of. for I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the
ship; yet. seeing such a work is doing as you say, and that you seem to
mean honestly, I will be upon my guard.--Nay, sir, says he. do not talk
of being upon your guard; the best defense is, to be out of danger; if you
have any regard for your life, and the lives of all your men. put to sea,
without fail at high water; and as you have a whole tide before you, you
will be gone too far out before they can come down; for they will come
away at high water, and as they have twenty miles to come, you will get
near two hours of them by. the dih'erence of the tide. not reckoning the
length of the way; beside, as they are only boats. and not ships. they
will not venture to follow you tin out to see, especially ifit blowsa--Well,
said I, you have been very kind in this; what shall I do for you to make
you amends 'l--Sir, says he. you may not be wiuing to make me any360 museums or

amends, because you may not be convinced of the truth of it: I will
make an ofl'er to you: I have nineteen months' pay due to me on board
the ship ' ' ', which [came out of England in: and the Dutchman that
is with me has seven months' pay due to him; if you will make good our-
pay to us, we will go along with you; if you find nothing more in it, we
will desire no more: but if we do convince you that we have saved your
lives. and the ship, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave the
rest to you .

l consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and the
two men with me. As soon asl came to the ship's side, my partner,
who was on board. came out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with
a great deal ofjoy. 0 ho! 0 ho! we have stopped the leak!--we have stop-
pad the leakl--Say you so l--said I, thank God: but weigh anchor then
immediately--Weigh! says he: what do you mean by that! What is
the matter l--Ask no questions. said 1; but all hands to work, and weigh
without losing a minute. He was surprised, but, however, he called
the captain. and he immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and
though the tide was not quite down, yet. a little land-breeze blowing, we
stood out to sea. Then 1 called him into the cabin. and told him the story;
and we called in the men.and they told us the rest ofit: but as it took up
a great deal of time before we had done, a seamen comes to the cabin door,
and called out to us that the captain bade him tell us we were chased.
Chased ! says I; by what I--By five sloops or boats, says the fellow. full of
mam--Very well, said I; then it is apparent there is something in it. In
the next place I ordered all our men to be called up, and told them there
was a design to seize the ship. and to take us for pirates, and asked them
it' they would stand by us, and by one another; the men answered cheer-
fully, one and all, that they would live and die with us. Then tasked
the captain what way he thought best for us to manage a fight with them;
for resist them I was resolved we would, and that to the last drop. He
said readily that the way was to keep them ofl' with our grape shot as long
as we could. and then to fire at. them with our small arms, to keep them
from boarding us; but when neither of these woutd do any longer, we
should retire to our close quarters: perhaps they had not materials to
break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us.

The gunner had. in the meantime. orders to bring two guns to bear
fore and alt, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and load them with
musket-bullets and small pieces ot'old iron, and what came next to hand;
and thus we made ready for fight: but all this while we kept out to sea,
with wind enough. and could see the boats at a distance, being live large
long-boats, following us with all the sail they could make.

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see were English)
outsailed the rest. were near two leagues ahead of them. and gained upon
us considerably,so that we found they would come up with us: upon
which we fired a gun without ball, to intimate that they should bring to:
and we put out a flag of truce. no a signal for pariey: but they came
crowding alter us till they came within shot, when we took in our white
flag. they having made no answer to it. and hung out a red flag. and fired
at them with a shot. Notwithstanding thie. they came on till they were
near enough to call to them with a speaking-trumpet which we had on
board; so we called to them. and bade them keep olf at their peril.

It was all one ; they crowded alter us, and endeavored to come under
our elem. so as to board us on our quarter; upon which, using they
were resolute for mischief, and depended upon the strength that followed
them, i ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside:
when immediately we fired five guns at them, one of which had been
leveled so true as to carry away the stern of the hinderrnoet boat, and
bring them to the necessity of taking down their sail, and running all to
the head of the boat to keep her from sinking; so she lay by, and had
enough of it; but seeing the foremost boat crowd on after us, we made
ready to fire at her in particular. While this was doing one of the three
boats that was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made up to
the boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could see her take
out the men: we called again to the foremost boat, and ofi'ered a truce to
parley again. and to know whet her business was with us; but had no
answer, only she crowded close under our stern. Upon this our gunner.
who was a very dextrous fellow, ran out his two chase guns, and fired
again at her, but the shot missing. the men in the boat shouted, waved
their caps. and came on; but the gunner. getting quickly ready again.
fired among the'm a second time. one shot of which, though it missed the
boat itself. yet fell in among the men. and we could easily see had done
a great deal of mischiefamong them; but we took no notice of that, were
the ship again and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and firing
three guns more, we found the boat was almost split to pieces; in par-
ticular, her rudder and a piece of her stern was shot quite away; so they
handed her sail immediately, and were in great disorder. But, to some
plete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them again; where
he hit them we could not tell, but we found the boat w's sinking. and
some ot'the men already in the water: upon this 1 immediately manned out
our pinnece, which we had kept close by our side, with orders to pick up
some of the men, it they oould.and save them from drowning, and im-
mediately come on board the ship with them, because we saw the rest of
the boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their
orders. and took up three men, one of whom was just drowning, and it
was a good while before we could recover him'. As soon as they were on
board. we crowded all the sail we could make, and stood farther out to
sea; and we found that when the other three boats came up to the first
they gave over their chase.

Being thus delivered from a danger, which. though I knew not the
reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehendedJ resolved
that we should change our course, and not let any one know whither we
were going: so we stood out to sea eastward. quite out of the course of
all European ships, whether they were bound to China or anywhere else
within the commerce of the European nations.

When we were at see, we began to consult with the two seamen, and
inquire what the meaning of all this should be; and the Dutchman let us
into the secret at once. telling us that the fellow who sold as the ship as
we said, was no more than a thief. that had run away with her. Then he
told us how the captain, whose name too he told us, though I do not re-
member it now, was treacherously murdered by the natives on the wast
of Malacca, with three of his men; and that he. this Dutchman. and four
more, got into the woods, where they wandered about a great while, till
at length he, in particular. in a miraculous manner made his escape, and
swam off to a Dutch ship. which sailing near the shore in its way to
China, had sent their boat on shore for fresh water: that he durst not
come to that part of the shore where the boat was. but made shit! in the
night to take the water farther ofl', and swimming a great while, at last
the ship's boat took him up.

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen
belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels,
and gave an account that the fellow who.had run away with the ship sold
her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who were gone a-cruising in her; and
that they had already taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very
richly laden.

This latter part was found to concern us directly, though we knew it to
be false; yet, as my partner said very justly, if we had fallen into their
hands, and they had had such a prepossession against us beforehand, it
had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves. or to hope for any
good quarter at their hands; and especially considering that our accusers
had been our judges,and that we could have expected nothing from them
but what rage would have dictated. and an ungoverned passion have exe-
cuted; and therefore it was his opinion we should go directly back to
Bengal, from whence we came. without putting in at any port whatever;
because there we could give a good account of ourselves. could prove
where we were when the ship put in. of whom we bought her. and the
like: and, which was more than all the rest. if we were put upon the
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we should be sure to
have some justice. and not to be hanged first and judged afterward.

I was some time of my partner's opinion: but, after a little more
serious thinkingJ told him I thought it was a very great hazard for us to
attempt returning to Bengal. for that we were on the wrong side of the
Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should be sure to
he waylaid on every side, as well by the Dutch at Batavia as the English
elsewhere; that if we should be lalten, as it were. running away, we
should even condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence
to destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said he was
of my mind. and that we should certainly be taken. This danger a little
startled my partner, and all the ship's compa'hy, and we immediately re-
solved to go away to the coast of Tonquin. and so on to the coast of China;
and, pursuing the first design as to trade, find some way or other to dis-
pose of the ship, and come back in some or the vessels of the country.
such as we could get. This was approved of as the best method for our
security: and accordingly we steered away N. N. E., keeping about fifty
leagues off from the usual course to the eastward. This, however, put
us to some inconvenience: for, first, the winds, when we came to that
distance from the shore. seemed to be more steadily against us, blowing
almoat trade. as we call it, from the E. and E>> N. 1-1., an that we were a
long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with victuals
for so long a run: and. which was still worse. there was some danger that
those English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, whereof some
were bound that .way, might be got in before us. and if not, some other
ship bound toChina might have information of us from them, and pursue
us with the same vigor.

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, including
the late escape from the long-boats. to have been in the most dangerous
condition that ever! was through my past life; for whatever ill circuni'c
stances] had been in.I was never pursued for a thief before; nor had I
ever done any thing that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent,
much less thievish; I had chiefly been my own enemy. or. as I may
rightly say. I had been nobody's enemy but my own: but now I was
embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable; for though I was per-
fectly innocent,I was in no condition to make that innocence appear:
and if I had been taken. it had been under a supposed guilt of the worst
kind. This made me very anxious to make an escape, though which
way to do it I knew not. or what port or place we could go to. My
partner, seeing are thus dejected. though he was the roost concerned at
first, began to encourage me. and, describing to me the several parts of
that coast, told me he would put in on the coast of CochimChina, or the
bay of Tonquin, intending to go afterward to Macao,a town once in
possession of the Portuguese, and where still a great many European
families'resided; and particularly the missionary priests usually went
thither. in order to their going forward to China.

Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly, though alter a tedious
and irregular course. and very much straitened for provisions, we came
within sight of tha'coast very early in the morning; and upon reflection
on the past circumstances we were in, and the danger if we had not
escaped, we resolved to put into a small river. which, however, had depth
enough of water for us. and to see if we could, either overland or by the
ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any port thereabouts.
This happy step was. indeed, our deliverance; for though we did not
immediately see any European ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet the next
morning there came into the bay two Dutch ships; and a third. without
any colors spread out. but which we believed to be a Dutchman. passed
by at about two leagues' distance, steering for the coast of China; and in
the afternoon went by two English ships steering the same course; and
thus we thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies both one way and
the other. The place we were in was wild and barbarous; the people
thieves, even by occupation or profession; and though, it is true, we had
not much to seek of them. and, except getting a few provisions,cared not
how little we had to do with them, yet it was with much difliculty 'that
we kept ourselves from being insulted by them, several ways. We were
in a small river of this country, within a few leagues of its utmost limits
northward; and by our boat we coasted northeast, to the point of land
which opens the great bay of Tonquin; and it was in this beating up
along the shore that we discovered we were surrounded with enemies.
The people we were among were the most barbarous 5! all the inhabit-
ants of the coast, having no correspondence with any other nation, and
dealing only in fish and oil. and such gross commodities; and it may be
prticularly seen that they are the most barbarous of any of the inhabit-
lnts. Among other customs, they have this one, viz: that if any vessel
has the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast, they presently
make the men all prisoners or slaves: and it was not long before we
found a piece of their kindness this way, on the occasion following.

I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at sea, and that we
could not find it out ; and it happened that, as I have said, it was stopped
unexpectedly, in the happy minufe ofous being to be seized by the
Dutch and English ships in the bay_ of Siam; yet, as we did not find the
ship so perfectly tight and sound as we desired. we resolved. while we
were at this place, to lay her on shore, and take out what heavy things
we had on board, and clean her bottom; and, if possible, to find out
where the leaks were. Accordingly, having lightened the ship. and
brought all our guns and other movables to one side, we tried to bring
her down. that we might come at her bottom; but. on second thoughts,
we did not care to lay her on dry ground, neither could we find outa
proper place for it.

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a sight,
came wondering down the shore to look at us; and seeing the ship lie
down on one side in such a manner.and heeling in toward the shore. and
not seeing our men, who were at work on her Uottorn with stages, and
with their boats on the off side, they presently concluded that the ship
was cast away, and lay so fast on the ground. On this supposition, they
all came about us in two or three hours' time, with ten or twelve large
boats, having some of them eight. some ten in a boat, intending. no
doubt. to have come on board and plundered the ship: and if they had
found us there, to have carried us away for slaves to their.king. or what-
ever they eall him. for we knew nothing of their governor.

When they came up to the ship and began to row round her, they
discovered ua all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom and
side. washing. and graving. and stopping, as every seafaring man knows
how. They stood for a while gazing at us. and we. who were a little Illh
prised could not imagine what their design was: but being willing to be
sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship. and other!
to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were at work to defend
themselves with, if there should be occasion: and it was no more than
need; for in less than a quarter of an hour's consultation. they agreed. it
seems. that the ship was really a wreck; and that we were all at work
endeavoring to save her. or to save our lives by the help of our boats: and
when we handed our arms into the boats. they concluded, by that motion,
that we were endeavoring to save some of our goods: upon this they took
it for granted we all belonged to them.and away they came directly upon
our men. as if it had been in a line of battle.

Our men seeing so many of them, began to be frightend. for we lay but
in an ill posture to fight. and cried out to us to know what they should
do. l immediately called to the men who worked upon the stages. to slip
them down and get up the side into the ship: and bade those in the boat
to row round. and come on board: and those few of us who were on board
worked with all the strength and hands we had. to bring the ship to rights;
but, however, neither the men upon the stages nur thou in the boats
could do as they were ordered. before the Cochin-Chinese were upon them:
and two of their boats boarded our long-boat, and began to lay hold on
the men as their prisoners.

The first man they laid hold on was an English seamfi'n, a stout. strong
fellow. who. having a musket in his hand, never ofl'ered to'flre it, but laid
it down in the boat. like a fool, as I thought; but he understood his busi-
ness better than I could teach him. for he grappled the pagan, and drag-
ged him by main force out of their boat into ours, where. talking him by
the ears, he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel. that the fellow
died in his hands; and. in the meantime. a Dutchman. who stood next,
took up the musket, and with the but end of it so laid about him, that he
knocked down five of them who attempted to enter the boat. But this
was doing little toward resisting thirty or forty men. who, fearless. because
ignorant of their danger began to throw themselves into the long-boat,
where we had but live men in all to defend it: but the following accident,

which deserves our laughter, gave our men a complete victory.
I
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as well
as to pay the seams where he had callied her to stop the leaks, had got
two kettles just let down into the boat, one filled with boiling pitch. and
the other with rosin. tallow. and oil, and such stutfas the shipwrights
use for that work; and the man who attended the carpenter had a great
iron ladle in his hand, with which be supplied the men that were at
work with the hot stuff: two of the enemy's men entered the boat just
where this fellow stood. being in the foresheets; he immediately saluted
them with a ladlel'ul of the stutl', boiling hot, which so burnt and scolded
them. being half naked. that they roared out like bulls, and, enraged with
the fire, leaped both into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out,
Well done Jack! give them some more of it: and stepping forward him-
self. takes one of the mops, and dipping it in the pitch-pot. he and his
man threw it among thetn so plentifully. that, in short. of all the men in
the three boats there was not one that escaped being scalded and burnt
with it, in a most frightful. pitiful manner. and made such a howling and
crying, that] never heard a worse noise: for it is worth observing. that
though pain naturally makes all people cry out, yetpvery nation hasa
particular way of exclamation. and makes noises as different from one
another as their speech. I can not give the noise these creatures made a
better name than howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it; for
1 never heard any thing more like the noise of the wolves, which, as l
have said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc.

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not only as it was
a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was imminent before, but,
as we had got this victory without any bluodshead, except of that man the
fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I was very much concerned
at, for I was sick of killing such poor savage wretches. even though it was
in my own defence. knowing they came on errands which they thought
just and knew no better; and that thouglt.it'may be ajust thing. because
necessary (for there is no necessary wickedness in nature), yet I thought
it was a sad life, when we must be always obliged to be killing our fellow-
creatures to preserve ourselves; and. indeed, I think so still. and I would
even now sulfer a great deal, rather than I would take away the life even
of the worst person injuring me; and l believe all considering people who
lmow the value of life would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously
into the consideration of it.

But to return to my story :--All the while this was doing, my partner
and I. who managed the rest of the men on board, had with great dexterity
brought the ship almost to rights, and having got the guns into their places
again. the gunner called to me to bid our boat to get out of the way. for he
would let fly among them. I called back again to him. and bid him not
offer to tire, for the carpenter would do the work without him; but bid
hurt but another pitch-kettle, which our cook, whom on board. took
care of: but the enemy was so terrifled with what they had met with in
their first attack. that they would not come on again; and some of them
who were thrthest oft'. seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright, began, as
we au ppose tosee their mistake,and give over the enterprise, finding it was
not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this merry fight, and having
got some rice, and some roots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on board,
two days before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward,
whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded
the next day with rogues enough. perhaps more than our pitch-kettle
would dispose of for us. We therefore got all our things on board the
same evening. and the next morning were ready to sail: in the meantime,
lying at anchor at some distance from the shore, we were not so much
concerned, being now in a fighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture
if any enemy had presented. The next day, having finished our work
within board, and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks,
we set sail. We would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted
to inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships
that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because we had
seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before; so we kept
on N. 1-1.. toward the Island of Formm, as much afraid of being seen by
a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a Dutch or English merchant ship
in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man-of-warL

When we were thus got to see, we kept on N. E. as if we would go to
the Manillas or the Philippine islands, and this we did _that we might not
fall into the way of any of the European ships; and then we steered
north till we came to the latitude of 22 degrees so minutes, by which
means we made the Island Formosa directly, where we came to an anchor,
in order to get water and fresh provisions, which the people there, who
are very courteous and civil in their manner. supplied us with willingly,
and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their agreements and
bargains, which is what we did not find among other people, and may be
owing to the remains of Christianity, which was once planted here by a
Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a testimony of what 1 have otten
observed, viz: that the Christian religion always civilises the people and
relorms their manners where it is received, whether it works saving etl'ects
upon them or no.

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an
equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports ot'China where
our European ships usually come; being resolved, if possible, not to fall
into any of their hands, especially in this country; where, as our circum
stances where, we could not fail of being entirely ruined.

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we resolved to put into
the tint trading port we should come at; and standing in for the shore, a
boat came ott' two leagues to us, with and old Portuguese pilot on board
who, knowing he to be a European ship, came to offer his service, which.
indeed, we were glad of. and took him on board: upon which, without
asking whither we would go, he dismissed theboat he came in and sent
it back.

I thought it was now so much in our choice to mate the old man carry
us whither we would. thatl began to talk to him about carrying us to
the gulf of Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the coast of
China. The old man said he knew the gulf of Nanquin very well. but
smiling, asked us what we would do there! I told him we would sell
our cargo, and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tee. wrought
silks, etc., and so would return by the same course we came. He told us
that our best port had been to have put in at Macao, where we could
not have fisiled of a market for our opium to our satisfaction, and might
for our money have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheapas we
could at Nanquin. -

Not being able to put the old man out of hie talk, of which he was very
opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well as mer-
chants, and that we had a mind to go and see the greet city of Pelrin, and
the tamous court of the monarch of China. Why then, says the old man,
you should go to Ningpo. where, by the river which runs into theses
there, you may go within five leagues of the great canal. This canal is a.
navigable stream, which goes through the heart of that vast empire of
China. crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable bills by the help of
sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin, being in length near
two hundred and seventy leagues.

Well, said I, Senhor Portuguese, but that is not our business now; the
great question is, if you can carry us up to the city of Nanquin, from
whence we can travel to Pekin afterward! He said we could do so very
well, and that there was a great Dutch ship gone up that way just before.
This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was now our terror, and we
had much rather have met the devil, at least if he had not come in too
frightful a figure; and we depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be
our destruction. for we were in no condition to fight them; all the ships
they trade with into those parts being of great burden, and of much
greater force than we were. .

The old man found me a little confused, and under some concern,
when he named a Dutch shiprand said to me, Sir, you need be under no
apprehensions of the Dutch: I suppose they are not now at war with
your nations l--No,said I, that's true; but i know not what liberties men
may take when they are out of the reach of the laws of their own
country.--Why. says be, you are no pirates; what need you fear? They
will not meddle with peaceable merchants, sure.

lf 1 had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face at that
word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to
circulate it, for it put me into the greatest disorder and confusion imagin-
able: nor was it possible for ms to conceal it so. but the old man easily
perceived it.

Sir, says he,I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts at my
talk; pray be pleased to go which way you think fit,and depend upon it,
1' ll do you all the service I cam--Why. Senhor, said I, it is true, l am a
little unsettled' in my resolution at this time, whither to go in particular;
and I am something more so {or what you said about pirates. I hope
there are no pirates in these seas; we are but in an ill condition to meet
with them, for you see we have but a small force. and are but very
weakly manned.--0h,sir, says he, don't be concerned.l do not know that
there have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years, except one.
which was seen. as I hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since; but
you may be assured she is gone to the southward; nor was she a ship of
any great force, or fit for the work: she was not built for a privateer, but
was run sway with by a reprobate crew that was on board, alter the
captain and some of his men had been murdered by the Malayans, at or
near the Island of Surname--What! said I, seeming to know nothing of
the matter, did they murder the captain'l--No, said he, I don't under-
stand that they murdered him; but as they afterward ran away with the
ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed him into the hands of the
Malayans, who did murder him; and perhaps they procured them to do
iL--Why then, said I, they deserve death as much as if they had done it
themselves.---Nay, says the old man, they do deserve it; and they will
certainly have it, if they light upon any English or Dutch ship; for they
have allagreed together, that it' they meet that rogue they' ll give him no
(marten--But, said I to him, you say the pirate is gone out of these seas;
how can they meet with him thent--Why, that's true, says be, they do
say so; but he was,as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river Cam-
bodia' and was discovered there by some Dutchmen who belonged to
the ship. and who were tell. on shore when they ran away with her; and .
some English and Dutch traderes being in the river, they were within a
litttle of taking him: nay. says he, if the foremost boats had been well
seconded by the rest, they had certainly taken him; but he. finding only
two boats within reach of him. tacked about, and fired at those two, and
disabled them before the others came up. and then standing of to sea,
the others were not able to follow, and so he got away; but they have all
so exact a description of the ship, that they will be sure to know her; and
wherever they find her, they have vowed to give no quarter either to the
captain or seamen, hot to hang them all up at the yardarm.---What! said
I, will they execute them right or wrong; hang them first. and judge
them afterward 1--Oh, sir, says the old pilot, there is no need to malts a
formal business of it with such rogues as those; let them tie them back
to back, and send them a diving, 'tis no more than they deserve.
I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that he could do no harm.
so that [turned shorttupon him: Well now. aenhor, said I, this is the
very reason why I would have you carry us up to Nanquin, and not put
back to Macao, or to any other part of the country where the English or
Dutch ships come; for be it known to you, senhor, those captains of the
English and Dutch ships are a parcel ofrash, proud, insolent fellows, that
neither know what belongs to justice, or how to behave themselves as the
laws or God and nature direct; but being proud of their otlices, and not
understanding their power, they would act the murderers to punish rob-
bers; would take upon them to insult men falsely accused. and determine
them guilty without due inquiry; and perhaps I may live to bring some
of them to account for it, when they may be taught how justice is to be
executed; and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some
evidence may be had of the crime, and that he is the man.

With this I told him that this was'the very ship they attacked, and
gave him a full account of the skirmish we had with their boats, and how
fimlishly and cowardly they behaved. I told him all the story of our
buying the ship. and how the Dutchman served us. I told him the
reasons I had to believe the story of killing the master by the Malayana
was true. as also the running away with the ship; but it was all a fiction
or their own to suggest that the men had turned pirates, and they ought
to have been sure it was so before they had ventured to attack us by sur-
prise, and oblige us to resist them; adding, that they would have the
blood or those men, whom we killed there in just defence, to answer for.

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were very
much in the right to go away to the north; and that if he might advise
us, it should be to sell the ship in China, which we might very well do,
and buy or build another in the country: and, said he. though you will
not got so good a ship, yet you may get one able enough to carry you and
all your goods back again to Bengal, or anywhere else. I told him I
would take his advice when I came to any port where I could find a ship
{or my turn, or get any customer to buy this. He replied, I should meet
with customers enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk
would serve me very well to go back again; and that he would procure
me people both to buy oils and sell the other. Well but. senhor, said I.
as you say they know the ship so well, I may, perhaps. tt' 1 follow your
measures, be instrumental to bring some honest innocent men into a ter~
rihle broil. and perhaps to be murdered in cold blood; for, wherever they
find the ship. they will prove the guilt upon the men, by proving
this was the ship. and so innocent men may probably be overpowered
and murdered.--Why,saya the old man, I'll find out a way to prevent
that also; for as I know all those commanders you speak of very well, and
shall see them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights
in the thing, and let them know that they had been so much in the
wrong; that though the people who were on board at first might run
away with the ship, yet it was not true that they had turned pirates; and
that in particular, these were not the men that first went elf with the
ship. but innocently bought her for meir trade; and I am persuaded they
will so far believe me, as at least to act more cautiously for the time to
come. -

While these things were passing between us, by way of discourse. we
went forward dimctly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days' sail came
to an anchor at the southwest point of the great gull'ot' Nanquin; where,
by the way, I came by accident to understand that two Dutch ships were
gone the length before me, and that I should certainly an into their
hands. I consulted my partner again in this exigence. and he was as
much at a loss as I was, and would very gladly have been safe on shore
almost anywhere: however I was not in such perplexity neither, but I
asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbor which I might put into
and pursue my business with the Chinese privately, and be in no danger
of the enemy. He told me if I would eail to the southward about forty-
two leagues. there was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers
of the mission usually landed from Macao, on their progress to teach the
Christian religion to the Chinese. and where no European ships ever put
in; and if I thought to put in there. I might consider what farther course
to take when 1 was on shore. He confessed. he said, it was not a place
for merchants. except that at some certain times they had a kind of a fair
there, when the merchants from Japan came over thither to buy the'
Chinese merchandises. .

We all agreed to go back to this place; the name or the port as he called
it,l may perhaps spell wrong, for I do not particularly remember it. having
lost this, together with the names of many other places set down in a
little pocketbook, which was spoiled by the water by an accident; but
this I remember, that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we corres-
ponded with called it by a different name from that which our Portuguese
pilot gave it. and pronounced it as above Quinchang.

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we weighed
the next day, having only gone twice on shore where we were to get fresh
water; on both which occasions the people of the country were very civil
to us. and brought us abundance of things to sell to us, I mean ofprovis-
ions. plants, roots, tea, rice, andsome fowls, but nothing without money.

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till five days,
but it was very much to our satisfaction; and I was joyful, and I may say
thankful, when I set my hot on shore, resolving, and my partner too. that
if it was possible to dispose ofourselvea and eil'ects any other way, though
not every way to our satisfaction. we would never set one foot on board
that unhappy vessel more; and. indeed, I must acknowledge. that of all
the circumstances oflifa that ever I had any experience of, nothing makes
mankind so completely miserable as that of being in constant fear. Well
does the Scripture say, "The fear of man brings a snare ;" it is a life or
death. and the mind is so entirely oppressed by it that it is capable of no
relief.

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy,try heightening
every da'nger, representing the English and Dutch captains to be men in-
capable of hearing reason or of distinguishing between honest men and
rogues: or between a story calculated for our own turn, made out of
nothing, on purpose to deceive. and a true genuine account of our whole
voyage, progress, and design; for we might many ways have convinced
any reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the goods we had on
board, the course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and entering
into such and such ports; and even our very manner, the bros we had,
the number of men, the few arms, little ammunition, short provisions;
all these would have served to convince any men that we were not pirates.
The opium and other goods we had on board would make it appear the
ship had been at Bengal. The Dutchmen, who, it was said, had the
names of all the men that were in the ship, might easily see that we
were a mixture of English, Portuguese. and Indians, and but two Dutchmen
on board. These, and many other particular circumstances, might have
made it evident to the understanding of any commander, whose hands
we might fall into, that we were no pirates. But fear, that blind, useless
passion, worked another way, and threw us into the vapors: it bewil-
dered our understandings, and set the imagination to work to form a thou-
sand terrible things that perhaps might never happen. We first supposed,
as indeed everybody had related to us. that the seamen on board the
English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at
the name ofa pirate and especially at our beating off their boats and
escaping, that they would not give themselves leave to inquire whether
we were pirates or no; but would execute us off-hand, as we call it with-
out giving us any room for a defence. We reflected that there really was
so much apparent evidence before them. that they would scarce inquire
alter any more; as. first, that the ship was certainly the same, and that
some or" the seamen among them knew her, and had been on board her;
and.secondly, that when we had intelligence at the river of Cambodia
that they were coming down to examine us, we fought their boats and
fled; so that we made no doubt but they were as fully satisfied of our
being pirates. as we were satisfied of the contrary: and, as l onen said. I
know not but I should have been apt to have taken those circumstances
for evidence, if the tables were turned. and my case was theirs: and have
made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, or
perhaps considering, what they might have to offer in their defence.

But let that be how it will. these were our apprehensions; and both my
partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of haltera and yard
arms: that is to say, gibbets; of fighting. and being taken: oflrililng, and
being killed: end one night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancyiug
the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my doubled tist against the side of the cabin I lay in
with such a force, as wounded my hand grievously. broke my knuckles,
and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it awaited me out of my sleep.

Another apprehension I had was the cruel usage_we might meet with
from them if we fell into their hands: then the story of Amboyna came
into my head, and how the Dutch might perhaps torture us as they did
our countrymen there, and make some of our men, by extremity of tor-
ture, confess those crimes they never were guilty of, or own themselves
and all of us to be pirates. and so they would put us to death with a for-
mal appearance of justice; and that they might be tempted to do this for
the gain of our ship and cargo, which was worth four or five thousand
pounds. put all together. _

These things tormented me and my partner too. night and day; nor did
we consider that the captains of ships have no authority to act thus: and
if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer the des-
troying us, or torturing us. but would be accountable for it when they
came to their own country; this, I say, gave me no satisfaction; for if
they were an act thus with us, what advantage would it he to us that they
should be called to an account for it! or if we were first to be murdered.
what satisfaction would it he to us to have them punished when they
came home?

1 can not refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had upon
the vast variety of my particular circumstances; how hard I thought it
was, that I. who had spent forty years in a life of continual difliculties,
and was at last come, as-it were, to the port or haven which all men drive
at, viz: to have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer in new sorrows by
my own unhappy choice: and that I. who had escamd so many dangers
in my youth, should now come to be hanged in my old age, and in so
remote a place. for a crime which sts not in the least inclined to, much
less guilty of.

Alter these thoughts. something ofreligion would come in ; and I should
be considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate
Providence, and I ought to look upon- it and submit to itas such: and
although I was innocent as to them! was 1hr from being innocent as to
my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine what other crimes in my
life were most obvious to me, and for which Providence might justly in-
flict this punishment as a retribution ; and that I ought to submit to this.
just as I would to a shipwreck, if it bad pleased God to have brought
such a disaster upon me. -

in its turn, natural courage would sometimes take its place, and then I
would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions; that I would not be
taken to be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in cold
blood: that it were much better to have fallen into the hands of the
savages, though I was sure they would feast upon me when they had
taken me, than those who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by in-
human tortures and barbarities; that in the ease of the savages 1 always
resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, and why should I not do so now,
seeing it was much more dreadful. to me at least, to think of falling into
these men's hands, than ever it was to think of being eaten by men? for
the savages, give them their due. would not eat a man till he was killed
and dead. but that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death.
Whenever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind
of fever with the agitation of a supposed fight; my blood would boil, and
my eyes sparkle," if] was engaged, and! always resolved to take no
quarter at their hands; but, even at last, it! could resist no longer, I
would blow up the ship and all that was in her, and leave them but little
booty to boast of.

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these things were
to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was our satisfaction
when we saw ourselves on shore: and my partner hold me he dreamed
that he had a very heavy load upon his back. which he was to carry up a
hill, and found that he was not able to stand longer under it; but that the
Portuguese pilot earns and took it 03' his back, and the hill disappeared.
the ground before him appearing all smooth and plain; and truly it was
so; they were all like men who had a load taken of their backs. For my
part.l had a weight taken off from my heart, that it was not able any
longer to hear; and, as I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in
that ship. When we came on shove, the old pilot who was now our
friend. got us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods, which, by the way.
was much the same: it was a little house or hut, with alarger house
adjoining to it. all built with canes. and palisaded round with large canes,
to keep out pilfering thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a few in
that country; however, the magistrates allowed us a little guard. and we
had a soldier with a kind of halberd, or half-pike, who stood sentinel at
our door; to whom we allowed a pint of rice, and alittle piece of money,
about the value of threepence, per day, so that our goods were kept very
safe.

The fair or mart. usually kept in this place. had been over some time:
however, we found that there were three or four junks in the river, and
'two Japaners, i mean ships from Japan, with goods which they had
bought in China, and were not gone away, having some Japanese mer-
chants on shore.

The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was to get us
acquainted with three missionary Bomish priests who were in town, and
who had been there some time, converting the people toChriatianity; hut
we thought they made but poor work of it, and made them but sorry
Christians when they had done; however, that was none of our business.
One orthese was a Frenchman. whom they called Father Simon: another
was a Portuguese, and the third a Genoeee; but Father Simon was cour-
teous,easy in his manner, and very agreeable company; the other two
were more reserved, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to
the work they came about, viz: to talk with and insinuate themselves
among the inhabitants, wherever they had opportunity. We often ate
and drank with these men; and though, I must confess, the conversion,
as they call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so for from the true con-
version required to bring hcathen people to the hith of Christ, that it
seems to amount to little more than letting them know the name 0
Christ. and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her son,in a tongue
which they understand not, and to cross themselves. and the like: yet it
must he confessed that the religionists, whom we called missionaries,
have a firm belief that these people will be saved. and that they are the
instruments of it; and, on this account, they undergo not only the fatigue
of the voyage, and the hoards of living in such places, but ottentimea
death itself, with the most violent tortures, for the sake of this work.

But to return to my story: This French priest, Father Simon, was
appointed it seems, by order of the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin,
the royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only foranother priest.
who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along with him; and
we scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that journey;
telling me how he would show me all the glorious things of that mighty
empire, and, among the rest, the greatest city in the world; a city, said
he, that your London and our Paris put together can not be equal to.
This was the city of Perkin, which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely
full of people; but as I looked on those things with ditferent eyes from
other men," laball give my opinion of them in a few words, when I
come in the course of my travels to speak more particularly of them.

But, first, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him one day,
and being very merry together, 1 showed some little inclination to go
with'him ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a great
many persuasions, to consent. Why, Father Simon, says my partner.
should you desire our company so much! you know we are heretics, and
you do not love us. nor can not keep us company with any plenum--Oh,
says he, you may perhaps be good Catholics in time; my business here
is to convert heathens, and who knows but I may convert you tool--Very
well. father, said I, so you will preach to us 'all the way 3--! will not he
troublesome to you. says he: our religion does not divest us of good
manners: beside. we are here like countrymen; and so we are, compared
to the place we are in; and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we
may all be Christians at last: at least, we are all gentlemen,degand we may
converse so, without being uneasy to one another. I liked this part ofbis
discourse very well, and it began to put me in mind of my priest that I
had left in the Brazils; but this Father Simon did not come up to his
character by a great deal; for though l-'ather Simon had no appearance
of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he had not that turn! of Christian
zeal. strict>> piety, and sincere alrection to religion, that my other good
eeclesiastic bad.

But to leave him'a little. though he never let! us, nor solicting us to go
with him; we had something else before us at first, for we had all this
while our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we began to he
very doubtful what we should do, for we were now in a place of very
little business; and once I was about toventure to sail for the river of
Kilam, and the city of Nanquin; but Providence seemed now more visibly,
as i thought, than ever. to concern itself in our affairs: and l was en-
couraged, from this very time, to think i should one way or other get out
of this entangled circumstance, and he brought home to my own country
again though 1 had not the least view of the manner. Providence, 1 say,
began here to clear up our way a little: and the first thing that offered
was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us. who
inquired what goods we had; end. in the first place, he bought ell our
opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold by weight,
some in small pieces of their own coin. and some in small wedges. of
about ten or eleven ounces each. While we were dealing with him for .
our opium, it came into my head that he might perhaps deal for the ship
too, and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him: he shrunk up his
shoulders at it when it was first proposed to him: but in a few days alter
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter,
and told me he bad a proposal to make to me. which was this :--he had
bought a great quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts of pro-
posals made to him of hying the ship; and that. therefore. he had not money
enough to pay for the ship: but it' i would let the same men who were
in the ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan; and
would send them from thence to the Philippine Islands with another
leading. which he would pay the freight of before they went from Japan;
and that at their return he would buy the ship. 1 began to listen to his
proposal, and so eagcr_did my head still run upon rambling. that I could
not but begin to entertain a notion of going myself with him, and so to
sail from the Philippine islands away to the South. Seas: accordingly I
asked the Japanese merchant it' he would not hire us to the Philippine
Islands, and discharge us there. He said, No. he could not do that, for
then he could not have the return of his cargo; but he would discharge
us in Japan, at the ship's return. Well. still 1 was for taking him at that
proposal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, per-
suaded me item it, representing the dangers, as well of the sees as of the
: sonmsos csosos. 377

Japanese, who are a false. cruel, and treacherous people; likewise those
of the Spaniards at the Philippines. more false, cruel. and treacherous
than they.

But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion: the first
thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the ship. and
with his men. and know if they were willing to go to Japan: and
while I was doing this, the young man whom .my nephew had left
with me as my companion for my travels came to me and told me that
he thought that voyage promised very fair. and that there was a great
prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but
that if! would not. and would give him leave, he would go as a merchant,
or how i pleased to order him; that if ever he came to England. and l
was there and alive, he would render me a faithful account of hie success.
which should be as much mine as l pleased. I was really loath to part
with him; but considering the prospect of advantage, which really was
considerable. and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well in it as
any I knew, I inclined to let him go: but I told him I would consult my
partner, and give him an answer the next day. My partner and I die-
counted about it, and my partner made a most generous often You
know it has been an unlucky ship, said he, and we both resolve not to go
to sea in it again; if your steward (so he called my men) will venture the
voyage, I will leave my share of the vessel to him,.snd let him make the
best of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with success
abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship's freight to
us; the other shall be his own.

if my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man, made
him such an otl'erJ could do no less than ofl'er him the same: and all the
ship's company being willing to go with him. we made over helfthe ship
to him in property, and took a writing from him.obliging him to account
for the other: and sway he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved
a very punctual, honest man to him; protected him at Japan, and got
him a license to come on shore. which the Europeans in general have not
lately obtained; paid him his freight very punctually: sent him to the
Philippines. loaded with Japan and China wares.and a supercergo of
their own, who, trafllcking with the Spaniards, brought back European
goods again, and a great quantity of cloves and other spices: and there
he was not only paid his freight very well, and at a very good price, but
not being willing to sell the ship then, the merchant furnished him goods
on his own account; and with some money. and some spices of his own
which he brought with him. he went back to the Menillas to the
Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having got a good
acquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made a free ship; and the gov-
ernor of Menills hired him to go to Acapulco in America, on the coast
of Mexico. and gave him a license to land there, and to travel to Mexico,

32
and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe with all his men. He made
the voyage to Acapulco very happily. and there he sold his ship; and
having there also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he
found means, somehow or other, to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure:
and about eight years after came to England exceeding rich, of which I
shall take notice in its place; in the meantime, I return to our particular
afl'airs.

Being now topart with the ship and ship's company, it came before
us, of course. to consider what recompense we should give to the two
men that gave us such timely notice of the design against us in the river
Cambodia. The truth was, they had done us a very considerable service,
and deserved well at our hands; though, by the way, they were a couple
of rogues too; for as they belleved the story of our being pirates, and
that we had really run away with the ship, they came down to us not
only to betray the design that was formed against us, but to go to sea
with us as pirates; and one of them confessed afterward that nothing
else but the tropes of going a roguing brought him to do it: however, the
service they did us was not the less: and. therefore, as I had promised to
bo gratetul to them, I first ordered the money to be paid them which
they said was due to them on board their respective ships; over and
above that, I gave each of them a small sum of money in gold, which
contented them very well; then I undo the Englishman gunner in the
ship, the gunner being now made second mate and purser: the Dutch-
man I made bostswsin; so they both were very well pleased, and proved
very serviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout follows.

We were now on shore in China: if I thought myself banished and
remote from my own country at Bengal, where I had many ways to get
home for my money, what could I think of myself now, when I was got
about a thousand leagues farther Elf from home, and perfectly destitute
of all manner of prospect of return! All we had for it was this, that in
about four months' time there was to be another fair at the place where
we were, and then we might be able to purchase all sorts of the manu-
factures of the country. and withal might possibly tlnd some Chinese
junks or vessels horn Tonquin. that would be to be sold, and would
carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This I liked very welband
resolved to wait: beside, as our particular persons were not obnoxious,
so if any English or Ducth ships came thither, perhaps we might have
an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage to some other place in
India, nearer home. Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here; -
but. to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the country.
First, we went ten days journey to the city well worth seeing. indeed:
they say it has a million of people in it: it is regularly built, the streets
all exactly straight, and cross one another in direct lines, which gives the
figure of it great advantage. But when I come to compare the miserable
people of these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living,
their government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory,as some
call it, I must confess that l scarcely think it worth my while to mention
them here. It is very observable, that we wonder at the grandeur, the
riches. the pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the manulhctures, the
commerce, and conduct of these people; not that it is to be wondered at,
or, indeed, in the least to be regarded, but because, having a true notion
of the barbarity of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that
prevail there, we do not expect to find any such thing so far ofl'. Other-
wise, what are their buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of
Europe? What their trade to the universal commerce of England, '
Holland, France, and Spain! What are their cities to ours, for wealth,
strength, gayety of apparel, rich thrniture, and infinite variety! What
are their ports. supplied with a few junks and barks, to our navigation,
our merchant fleets, our large and powerful navies'! Our city of London
has more trade than half their mighty empire: one English, Dutch. or
French man-of-war ot' eighty guns, would be able to tight almost all the
shipping belonging to China: but the greatness of their wealth, their
trade, the power of their government, a'nd the strength of their armies,
may he a little surprising to us. because, as I have said, considering them
as a barbarous nation of pagans. little better than savages, we did not
expect such things among them: and this, indeed, is the advantage with
which all their greatness and power is represented to us; otherwise, it is
in itself nothing at all; for what I have said of their ships may be said
of their armies and troops: all the' forces of their empire. though they
were to bring two millions of men into the field together, would be able
to do nothing but ruin the country, and starve themselves, if they were
to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to light a disciplined army; one
good line of German cuirassiers, or of French cavalry, might withstand
all the horse of China: a million of their foot could not stand before one
embattled body of our infintry, posted so as not to be surrounded,
though they were not to be one to twenty in number; nay, I do not boast
if I say that thirty thousand German or English foot. and ten thousand
horse, well managed, could defeat all the forces of China; and so of our
hrtiqed towns, and of the art of our engineers in multing and defend-
ing towns; there is not a fortified town in China could hold out one
month against the batteries and attacks of a European army; and. at the
same time. all the armies ofChina could never take such a town as Dunkirk.
provided it was not starved; no, not in a ten years' siege. "They have
tire-arms, it is true, but they are awkward and uncertain in their going
elf; and their powder has but little strength. Their armies are badly
disciplined. and want skill to attack, or temper to retreat: and, therefore,
1 must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard
our people say suchjne things of the power, glory, magnificence, and
trade of the Chinese: because, as far es law. they appeared to be e
contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant sordid slaves. subjected to a
government qualified only to rule such a people; and were not its
distance inconceivahly great from Muscovy,and the Muscovite empire
in a manner as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they. the Czar of
Muscovy might with'eese drive them all out of their country, and
conquer them in one campaign : and had the car (who is now a growing
prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the _warlike Swedes. and
equally-improved himself in the art of wanes they say he has done;
and if none of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted him, he
might by this time have been emperor of China. instead of being beaten
by the King of Sweden at Nerve. when the letter was not one to six in
number. As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation,
commerce. and husbandry, are very imperfect. compand to the same
things in Europe: also in their knowledge, their leerning,end in their
skill in the sciences, they are either very awkward or defective, though
they hate globe- and spheres. and a smattering of the mathematics, and
think they know more than all the world beside; but they know little of
the motions of the heavenly bodies: and so grossly and absurdly ignorant
are their common people. that when the sun is eclipsed. they think a
great dragon has assaulted it, and is going to run away with it: and they
fell a clettering with all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright
the monster away,just as we do to hive a swarm of bees.

As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made in all the
accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make no more such; it in
none of my business. nor any part of my design; but to give an account
of my own adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings, end a
long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that come afier me will
have heard the like of: I shall therefore say very little of all the mighty
places. desert countriee,and numerous people I have yet to pan through,
more than relates to my own story, and which my concern among them
will make necessary.

degrees north of the line, for we were returned item Nanquin: I had,
indeed, a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I had heard so much of,

not such a mighty favor in him, but was a great advantage to him, con-
sidering above thirty other people traveling in the lame manner, beside
us, under the protection of his retinue; for the country furnilhed all the
provisioue for nothing to him, and yet he took our money for them.

We were twenty-live day- traveling to Perkin, through a country intio

I must confess I'traveled more pleasantly alterward in the deserts and
vast wilderneaa of Grand Tartary than here; and yet the made here are
well paved and well kept, and very convenient for travelers: but nothing
was more awkward to me than to ace ouch a haughty, imperious, ineolent
people, in the midat ot' the groeaeet simplicity and ignonnce; and my
friend Father Simon and I ueed to he very merry upon theae occasions,
to see the heggarly pride of these people: for example, coming by the
house or a country gentleman, as Father Simon called him. about ten
leagues ol!' the 'city of Nanquin, we had date! all the honor to ride with

feet Don Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and poverty. His habit
was very proper for a scaramsuch or merry-andrew. being a dirty calico
with hanging sleeves, tassela, and cuts and slashes almost on every side;
it covered a tatfeta vest. as greasy as a butcher's, and which testified that
his honor must be a most exquisite sloven. His horse was but a poor,
starved, hobbling creature, and he had two slaves followed him on foot to
drive the poor creature along; he had a whip in his hand,and he bela-
bored the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and
thus he rode by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from the
city to his country-seat. about half a league before us. We traveled on
gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away before III. and as we
stopped at a village about and hour to refresh us, when we came by.
the country-seat of this great man, we saw him in a little place before
his door, eating his reput. It was a kind of a garden, but he was easy to
be seen; end we were given to understand that the more we looked at
him the better he would be pleased. He sat under a tree something like
the palmetto, which effectually shaded him over the head, and on the
shouth side; but under the tree was also placed a large umbrella, which
made that part look well enough; he sat lolling back in a great elbow-
chair. being a heavy, corpulent man, and had his meat brought him by two
women slaves; he had two more, one of which fed the squire with a
spoon. and the other held the dish with one hand. and scraped off what
he let fall upon his worship's beard and taffata vest with the other; while
the great fat brute thought it below him to employ his own hands in any
of those familiar otlices which kings and monarchs would rather do than
be troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants.

I took this time to think what pains men's pride puts them to, and how
troublesomea haughty temper, thus ill managed, must be to a man of
common sense; and leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our
looking at him. as if we admired his pomp, though we really pitied and
comtemned him. we pursued our journey; only Father Simon had the
curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the country justice had
to feed on in all his state, which he had the honor to taste of, and which
was. I think. a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and
a little bag filled with green pepper. and another plant which they have
there, something like our ginger, but smelling like musk. and tasting like
mustard; all this was put together. and a small piece of lean mutton
boiled in it, and this was his worship's repast; four or five servants more
attended at a distance, who, we supposed, were to eat of the same alter
their master.

As for our mandarin with whom we traveled, he was respected as a
king, .aurrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended in all his
appearances.with such pomp. that I saw little of him but at a distance;
but this 1 observed, that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our
carriers' pack-horses in England seemed to me to look much better:
though it was hard to judge rightly. for they were so covered with
equipage, mantles, trappings, etc.. that we could scarce see any thing but
their feet and their heads as they went along.

1 was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity that] have
given an account of being over, I had no anxious thought about me,
which made this journey the pleasenter to me; nor had 1 any ill accident
attended me, only in passing or fording a small river my horse fell, and
made me lies of the country. as they call it, that is to say, threw me in;
the place was not deep, but it wet me all over. I mention it, because it
ppoiled my pocket-book. wherein I had set down the names of several
people and places which I had occasion to remember, and which, not
taking due care of. the leaves rotted. and the words were never aner to
be read. to my great loss as to the names of some places I touched at in
this journey.

At length we arrived at Pekin; I had nobody with me but the youth
whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as aservant,
and who proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner had nobody
with him but one servant, who wuss kinsman. As {or the Portuguese
pilot, he being desirous to see the court, we bore his charges for his com-
pany, and to use him asan interpreter, for he understood the language
of the country, and spoke good Franch,snd a little English; and, indeed,
this old man was a most useful implement to us everywhere; for we had
not been above a week at Pekin, when he came lsughing,Ah.8enhor
lnglese, says he.I have something to tell you wilealre your heart glad.--
My heart glad! says 13 what can that be'! I don't know any thing in
this country can either give me joy or grief, to any great degreef--Yes,
yes, said the old man, ln broken English, make you glad, me sorry.--
Why. said I. will it make you sorry l--Because, said be, you have brought

- me here twenty-five days' journey, and will leave me to go been alone,
and which way shall I get to my port alterward without a ship. without
a horse, without pecans.- so he called mony, being his broken Latin, of
which he had abundance to make us merry with. In short, he told us
there was a great caravan of Muscovite and Polish merchants in the city,
preparing to set out on their journey by land to Muscovy within four or
five weeks, and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with
them, and leave him behind, to go back alone.

I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and had scarce
power to speak to him for some time; but at last I turned to him, How
do you know this! said i. Are you sure it is true 1--Yes, says he; I met
this morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine.nn Armenian,
who is among them: he came last from Astracan. and was designing to
go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind,
and is now resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the384' sovaxrnnss or

river Wolga, to Astracsn.--Well, senhor, says I, do not be uneasy about
being let! to go back alone; if this be a method for my return to England,
it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at all. We then went to
consult together what was to be done; and I asked my partner what he
thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his attain!
He told me he would do just as I would; {or he had settled all his afl'airs
so well at Bengal. and left his etfeets in such good hands, that as we had
made a good voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought and
raw, such as might be worth the carriage. he would be content to go to
England. and then make his voyage back to Bengal by the Company's
ships.

Having resolved upon this. we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot
would go with us. we would hear his charges to Moscow, or to England,
if he pleased: nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over-generous in that
neither, it' we had not rewarded him farther, the service he had done us
being really worth more than that: for he had not only been a pilot to us
at sea, but he had been like a broker for us on shore; and his procuring
for us the Japan merchant was some hundred of pounds in our pockets.
So we consulted together about it, and being willing to gratify him,
which was but doing him justice, and very willing also to have him with
us beside, for he was a most necessary man on all occasions. we agreed
to give him a quantity of coined gold, which,as [compute it, came to
about one hundred and seventy-five pounds sterling between us, and to
bear all his charges, both for himself and horse, except only a horse to
carry his goods. Having settled this between ourselves, we called him to
let him know what we had resolved. I told him he had complained of
our being to let him go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were
resolved he should not go back at all; that as we had resolved togo to
Europe with the caravan. we resolved also he should go with us; and
that we called him to know his mind. He shook his head, and said it
was a long journey, and he had no peersru to carry him thither, or to
subsist himself when he came there. We told him we believed it was so,
and therefore we had resolved to do something for him that should let '
him see how sensible we were of the service he had done us, and also how
agrpeable he was to us; and then I told him what we had resolved to give
him here, which he might lay out as we would do our own; and that as
for his charges, if he would go with us, we would set him safe on shore'
(life and casualties excepted) either in Muscovy or England, which he
would, at our own charge,sxcept only the carriage of his goods. He
received the proposal likeaman transported, and told us he would go
with us over the whole world; and so we all prepared fl>r our journey.
However. as it was with us,so it was with the other merchants; they
had many things to do; and instead of being ready in five Weeks, it was
tour months and some days before all things were got together.
It was the beginning of February. our style, when we set out from
Pekin. My psrtner and the old pilot had gone express back to the port
where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods which we had left
there; and I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some knowledge of
at Nanquin, and who came to Pekin on his own all'airs, went to Nanquin.
where I bought ninety pieces of tlne damasks, with about two hundred
pieces of other very fine silks of several sorts, some mixed with gold. and
had all these brought to Pekin against my partner's return; beside this.
we bought a very large quantity of raw silk, and some other goods, our
cargo amounting. in these goods only, to about three thousand five
hundred pounds sterling; which, together with tea and some fine calio
coes. and three camels' loads of nutmege and cloves, loaded in all eigh-
teen camels for our share, beside those we rode upon; which, with two
or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in
short. twenty-six camels and houses in our retinue. '

The company was very great, and. as near as i can remember, made
between three and four hundred horse, and upward of one hundred and
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all events: for as the
eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the Arabs. so are these by
the Tartan; but they are not altogether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor
so barbarous, when they prevail.

The company consisted of people of several nations; but there were
above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of
them some were Livonians: and to our particular satislhction, five of
them were Scots, who appeared e'so to be men of great experience in
business, and ofvery good substance.

When we had traveled one day's journey, the guides. who were five in
number, called all the gentlemen and merchants: that is to say, all the
passengers except the servants, to a great council, as they called it. At
this council every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a
common stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage on the way,
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the guides.
getting horses, and the like: and here they constituted the journey. as
they call it. viz: they named captains and officers to draw us all up, and
give the word of command in case of an attack. and give every one their
turn of command: nor was this forming us into order any more than
what we found needt'ul upon the way, as shall he observed.

The road all on this side of the country is very populous and is full of
putters and earth-makers: that is to say, people that temper the earth for
the Chinaavare; and as I was coming along, our Portugal pilot, who had
always something or other to say to make us merry. came sneering to
me, and told me he would show me the greatest rarity in all the
country, and that I should have this to say of China. after all the ill-
humored things I had said of it, that I had seen one thing which was not

33
to be seen in all the world beside. I was very importunate to know what
it was: at last he told me it was a gentlI-man'a house built with China-
ware. Well, says I, are not the materials of their buildings the product
of their own country, and so it is all China-ware, is it not l--No. no, says
he,I mean it is a house all made of China-wars, such as you call it in
England, or as it is called in our country, porcelainPWell, says I, such
a thing may be; how big is it! Can we carryit in a box upon a camel!
"we an, we will buy iL--Upon a camel! says the old pilot, holding up
both his hands; why there is a t'amily of thirty people lives in it.

I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when 1 came to it. it was
nothing but this: it was a timber-house, or a house built, as we call it in
England, with lath and plaster; but all this plastering was really Chins-
ware: that is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes China-
ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon. was glazed, and
looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures,as the
large China-ware in England is painted, and hard as if it had been burnt.
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainseoat, were lined with hard-
ened and painted tiles. like the little square tiles we call galley-tiles in
England, all made of the finest China, and the figures exceeding fine,
indeed, with extraordinary variety of colors, mixed with gold; many
tiles making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being
made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see where the tiles met.
The floors of the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as
the earthen fioors we have in use in several parts of England; as hard as
stone. and smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller
moms, like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile;
the ceiling. and all the plastering work in the whole house, were of the '
same earth; and. after all. the roof was covered with tiles of the same,
but of a deep shining black. This was a China warehouse, indeed. truly
and literally to be called so, and had I not been upon the jonmeyJ could
have stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They
told me there were fountains and fi'sh'ponds in the garden, all paved on
the bottom and sides with the same; and fins statues set up in rows on
the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt whole.

As this is one of the singularities of China. so they may be allowed to
excel in it; but i am very sure they excel in their accountant it; for
they told me such incredible things of their performance in crockery
were, for such is it. that I care not to relate, as knowing it could not be
true. They told me, in particular, of one workman, that made a ship
with all its tackle. and masts, and sails, in earthenware, big enough to
carry fifty men. If they had told me he launched it. and made a voyage
to Japan in it. I might have said something to it, indeed: hut as it want
knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, asking pardon for the
Word. that the fellow lied; so I smiled, and said nothing to it.
This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for which the
leader of~it for the day fined me about the value of three shillings; and
told me, if it .had been three days' journey without the wall, as it has
three days withithe must have lined me four times as much, and made
me ask pardon the next council day: I promised to be more orderly;
and. indeed, I -found afterward the orders made for keeping all together
were absolutely necessary for our common safety.

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a fortifica-
tion against the Tartan; and a very great work it is, going over hills and
mountains in a needless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the
precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or
where, if they did, no wall could hinder them. They tell us its length is
near a thousand English miles, but that the country is five hundred in a
straight measured line,which the wall bounds without measuring the
windings and tumings it takes; it is about four fathoms high, and as
many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespassing our orders (for
so long the caravan was in pending the gate), to look at it on every side.
near and far all, I mean that was within my view; and the guide of our
caravan. who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was
mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was a most excel-
lent thing to keep out the Tartan; which he happened not to understand
as I meant it, and so took it l'ora com pliment; but the old pilot laughed:
0h, Senhor lnglese,aaya he, you speak in oolors.--ln colors! said I; what
do you mean by that I--Why you speak what looks white this way, and
black that way; gay one way, and dull another. You tell him it is a
good wall to keep out Tartan; you tell me by that it is good far nothing
but to keep out Tartan. I understand you, Senhor Inglese; I understand
you: but Senhor Chinese understood you his own way.---Well, says I,
senhor, do you think it would stand out an army of our country people.
with a good train of artillery, or our engineers, with two companies of
miners! Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an army might
enter in batallia: or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there
should he no sign of it [alt l--Ay, ay. says he, I know that. The Chinese
wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him leave to tell him a
few days alter, for we were then almost out of their country, and he was
to leave us in a little time alter this; but when he knew what I said. he
was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no more of his fine story
of the Chinese power and greatness while he stayed.

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something like the
Picts' wall, so tau-cue in Northumberland, built by the Romans. we
began to find the country thinlyinhabited. and the people rather confined
to live in fortified towns and cities. as being subject to the inroads and
depredations of the Tartan, who rob in great armies, and therefore are
not to be resisted by the naked inhabitans of an open country. And here
I began to find the necessity of keeping together in a caravan as we trav-
eled, for we saw several troops of Tartan roving about; but when I
came to see them distinctly.I wondered more that the Chinese empire
could be conquered but such contemptible fellows; for they are a mere
horde of wild follows. keeping no order, and understanding no discipline
or manner of tight. Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing,
and tit for nothing; and this we found the first day we saw them, which
was after we entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader for the
day gave leave for about sixteen ofus to go a hunting, as they call it, and
what was this but hunting of sheep: however, it may be called hunting
too. {or the creatures are the wildest and awifteat of foot that ever I saw
of their kind; only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chase. tor they appear generally thirty or forty
in a flock. and, like true sheep, alway keep together when they fly. _

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet with about
forty Tartars ; whether they were hunting mutton as we were. or whether
they looked for another kind of prey, we know not: but as soon as they
saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very loud, but with a barbarous
sound that I had never heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear
again; we all supposed this was to call their friends about them, and so
it was; for in less than ten minutes, a troop of forty or fltty more
appeared at about a mile distance; but our work was over flrst, as it
happened.

One orthe Scots merchants ot'Mosoow happend to be among us. and as
soon as he heard the horn he told us that we had nothing todo but to
charge them immediately, without loss of time; and drawing us up in a
line, he asked if we were resolved. We told him we were ready to follow
him; so he rode directly toward them. They stood gazing at us likea
mere crowd. dmtvn up in no order, nor showing the lice of any order at
all; but as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly their arrows, which,
however, missed us very happily; it seems they mistook not their aim,
but their distance; for their arrows all fell a little short ofus, but with so
true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards nearer, we must have
had several men wounded, it' not killed.

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance, we flred,
and sent them loaden bullets for wooden arrows, following our shot full
gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand" for so our Soot thad led us
directed. He was, indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that
vigor and t - \'ery on this occasion, and yet with such cool courage too.
that I never saw any man in action fitter for command. As soon as We
came up to them. we tired our pistols in their faces. and then drew; but
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable. The only stand any of
them made was on our right, where three of them stood, and, by signs
called 'the rest to come beef to them, having a kind of clmeter in their
hands, end their bowl hanging to their backs. Our brave commander,
without asking anybody to follow him, gallop: up cloee to them, and
with hie fuaee knocks one of them ofl' his hone, killed the eecond with
hie piatol, and the third ran away; and thue ended our tight: but we had
this misfortune attending it. that all our mutton we had in chase got
away. We had note man killed or hurt; but an for the Terters, there
were about five of them Ruled; how many were wounded, we knew nut;
but thie we knew, that the other party were an frightened with the naiee
of our guns, that they made all, and never made any attempt upon us.

We were all thia while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore the
Tartan were not so hold an etterwerd; hut in about five days we entered
a vast, greet wild desert, which held no three.daya and nights' march;
and'we were obliged to carry our water with us in great leethern bottles,
and to encamp ell night, just as I have heard they do in the desert of
Arabia.

I staked our guidee whose dominion thia was in :. and they hold me this
was a kind of border, that might be called no man'- lend, being a part of
great Karelrathay. or Grand Tartary; but, however, it was all reckoned
as belonging to Chine, but that there was no care taken here to preserve
it from the inroads of thievee, and therefore it wee reckoned the wont
desert in the whole-march, though we were to go over some much larger.

In passing this wilderneae, which was at first very frightful to me. we
saw, two or three times, little parties of the Tartan. but they seemed to
be upon their own alfaire, and to have no design upon.us: end so, like
the man who met the devil, if they had nothing to any to til, we had
nothing to lay to them; we let them go. Once, however, a party of
them came so near as to stand and gaze at ne: whether it wee to consider
if they should attack he or not, we knew not; but when we were passed
at some dietanee by them, we made a rear guard of forty men, and stood
ready for them. letting the caravan peas halfe mile or thereaboute before
us: but allere while they marched ofl'; only we found they saluted us
with live arrows at their parting, one of which wounded a horse, so that
it disabled him, and we let! him the next day. poor creature, in great
need of a good ferrier: they might shoot more arrows, which might fill
short of us. but we eew no more arrows or Tartan that time.

We traveled near a month after this, the ways not being so good an at
first, though atill in the dominiona of the Emperor of China, but lay for
the moat part in villages, some of which were fortified, because of the
incuraions of the Tartan. When we were come to one of these towns
(it was about two daye and a half journey before we were to come to the
city of Naum). I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be
sold all the way upon that roed, and horses aleo,auch as they are, because
ao many convene coming that way they' are often wanted._ The person
that I spoke to to get me a camel would have gone and fetched one for
me; but I. like a fool, must be officious, and go myself along with him :
the place was about two miles out of the village where it seems they
kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard.

I walked it on foot. with my old pilot and a Chinese, being very
desirous of a little variety. When we came to the place. it was a low
marshy ground, walled round with a stone "wall, piled up dry. without
mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese
soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel. and agreed for the price. I
came away, and the Chineaeman that went with me led the camel, when
on a sudden came up five Tartan on horseback; two of them seized the
fellow and tool; the camel from him, while the other three stepped up to
me and my old pilot. seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no
weapon about me but my sword, which could but ill defend me against
three horsemen. The first that came up stopped short upon 'my
drawing my sword, for they are arrant cowards; but a second coming
upon my left, gave me a blow on the head. which I never felt till sher-
ward, and wondcrd, when I came to myself, what was the matter. and
where l was, for he. laid me flat on the ground; but my never-failing old
pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, unloolted for, directs deliverances
from dangers which to us are unforaeen). had a pistol in his pocket,
which 1 knew nothing of. nor the 'I'artars neither, if they had. I suppose
they would not have attacked us; but cowards are always boldest when
there is no danger. The old man seeing me down. with a bold heart
stepped up to the follow that had struck me. and laying hold of his arm
with one hand. and pulling him down by main force a little toward him
with the other, shot him in the head, and laid him dead upon the spot.
He then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us. as] said,
and before he could come forward again, made a blow at him with a
cilneter which he always wore. but missing the man. out his horse in the
side of his head,cut one of the canon" by the root. and a great slice
down by the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged with the wound.
was no more to be governed by his rider. though the fellow eat well
enough too, but away he dew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's
reach; and at some distance rising upon his hind legs, threw down the
Tartar. and fell upon him.

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had lost the camel, but
he had no weapon: however, seeing the Tartar down, and his horse
fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly ill-
favored weapon he had by his side. something like a poleax, but not a
poleax neither. he wrenched it from him.and made shin to knock his
antnrian brains out with it. But my old man had the third Tartarto
deal with still; and seeing he did not fly as he expected. nor come on to
tight him. as he apprehended, but stand stock still, the old man stood still
too,end fell to work with hie tackle, to charge hie pietol again; but ae
eoon u the Tartar aew the pietol, away he scoured. and left my pilot,
my champion I called him afterward, a complete victory.

By thie time I we! a little recovered; for! thought. when I liret began
to wake, that I had been in a sweet eleep; but, II I eaid above. I
wondered where I wee, how I came upon the ground. and what was the
matter; but a few momenta after. ae aenee returned, I felt pain, though I
did not know where; eo I clapped my hand to my head,and took it away
bloody; then I felt my head ache; and then, in a moment, memory
returned, and every thing wee preeent to me again. I jumped upon my
feet inetently, and got hold of my aword, but no enemiee in view: 1 found
a Tartar lie deed, end hie hone etanding very quietly by him; and,
looking farther, I eew my champion end deliverer, who had been to see
whet the Chineee had done, coming back with his hanger in hie band:

end aeeing me bloody, would eee how I wee hurt; but it was not much.
only what we calla broken head; neither did I atterwerd llud any great
inconvenience from the blow, for it wee well again in two or three days.

We made no great gain, however, by thie victory. for we loat a camel
and gained a bone; but that which wee remarkable, when we came back
to the village, the men demanded to be paid for the camel; I diaputed it,
end it wee brought toe hearing betbre the Chineee judge of the place.
To give him hie due, he acted with a great deal of prudence end impar-
tiality; and, having heard both aides. he gravely asked the Chineecmen
that went with me to buy the camel whoee eervant he wee! I am no
aervant, aeya be, but went with the etrenger.--At whoee requcat'! eeye

juetic'e, you were the etnnger'e servant for the time; and the camel
being delivered to hie eervant, it wee delivered to him, and he must pay
for it.

I confeea the thing wae no clear that I had not e word to eey: but,
admiring to eee euch juet reaeoning upon the coneequence. and an
accurate etating of the use, I paid willingly for the camel, and sent for
another; but, you may obaerve, I did not go to fetch it myaelf any more,
for I had had enough of that. I

The city of Neum iea frontier of the Chineee empire; they call it for-
tified, end so it it, as fortificatione go there; for thie I will venture to
amrm, that all the Tertere in Karahethay, which, I believe, are some
millione, could not better down the walle with their bowe and arrowe;
but to call it strong, if it were attacked with cannon, would be to make
those that underetand it laugh at you.

We wanted, an I have laid, above two daya' journey of thie city, when
meeeengere were lent express to every part of the road, to tell all
traveler: and caravans to halt till they had a guard sent for them; for
that an unusual body of Tartan. making ten thousand in all, had
appeared in the way. about thirty miles beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travelers; however, it was carelhlly done
of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have a guard.
Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a
ga'rrison of the Chinese. on our left, and three hundred more from the
city of Naum,and with these we advanced boldly: the three hundred
soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear.
and our men on each side of our camels. with our baggage, and the whole
caravan in the center; in this order, and well prepared lbr battle.wo
thought ourselves a match for the whole ten thouaand Mogul Tartan. if
they had appeared; butthe next day, when they did appear, it was quite
cnnther thing.

It was'early in the morning. when, marching from a well-situated little
town, called Changu, we had a river to pass, which we were obliged to
ferry; and, had the Tartars any intelligence, then had been the time to
have attacked us, When. the caravan being over, the rearguard was behind;
but they did not appear there. About three houra alter, when we were
entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by a
cloud of "dust they raised. we saw an enemy waa at hand; and they were
at hand. indeed. for they came on upon the spur.

The Chinese. our guard on the front, who had talked so big the day
before. began to stagger; and the soldies frequently looked behind them.
which is a certain sign in asoldier that be is just ready to run away.
My old pilot was of my mind; and, being near me. called out, Senhor
lngleee, says he. those fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us
all: for if the Tartan come on, they will never stand iL--l am of your
mind, said I: but what must be dental--Done! says he, let fifty of our
men advance. and flank them on each wing. and encourage there: and
they will fight like brave fellows in brave company; but without this,
they will every man turn his back. Immediately! rode up to our leader.
and told him. who was exactly of our mind: and accordingly fifty of us
marched to the right wing, and filly to the left, and the rest made a line
of rescue: and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to
make a body by themselves. and to guard the camels; only that, if need
were, they should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty.

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they
were: how many we could not tell. but ten thousand, we thought, was
the least: a party of them came on first, and viewed our posture, traver-
sing the ground in the front of our line; and," we found them within
gunshot. our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give
them asalvo on each wing with their shot, which was done; but they
went all, and I supposed back, to give an account of the reception they
were like to meet with; and, indeed, that salute cloyed their stomachs,
for they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider of it. and wheeling
ofl'to the let], they gave over their design. and said no more to us for that
time; which was very agreeable to our circumstances, which were but
very inditl'crent for a battle with such a number.

Two days alter we came to the city of Naun.or Naum; we thanked
the governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred
crowns or thereabouts. which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us;
and here we rested one day. This is a garrison. indeed. and there were
nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly
the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do. the
Muscovites having abandoned that part of the country which lies from
this city for about two hundred miles, as desolate and unfit for use: and
more especially being so very remote, and so difficult to send troops
thither for its defence: for we had yet above two thousond miles to '
Muscovy, properly so called.

Alter this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful deserts; one
of which we were sixteen days passing over: and which, as I said, was
to he called no man's land; and. on the 13th of April. we came to the
fiontier of the Muscovite dominions. I think the tlrst town or fortress
whichever it may be called, that belonged to the Czar of Museovy, was
called Arguna, being on the west side of the river Arguns.

I could not but discover an infinite satislhction that I was so soon
arrived in, as I called it,a Christian country,or, at least, in a country gov-
erned by Christians: for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, but
just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are
very devout in their way. It would certainly occur to any man who
travels the world as l have done, and who had any power of reflection,
what a blessing his to be brought into the world where the name of God
and a Redeemer is known, adored, and worshiped; and not where the
peopl'iven up by Heaven to strong delusions, worship the devil, and
prostrate themselves to stocks and stones; worship monsters. elements,
horrid-shaped animals, and statues or images of monsters. Nuts town
or city we pamed through but had their pagoda. their idols. and their
temples. and ignorant people worshiping even the works of their own
hands. Now we came where, at least, a. tics of the Christian worship
appeared; where the knee was bowed to Jesus; and. whether ignorantly
or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name of the true
God was called upon and adored. and it made my soul rejoice to as it.
I saluted the brave Scots merchant I mentioned above with my first
acknowledgment of this: and taking him by the hand. I said to him.
Blessed be God. we are once again among Christians. He smiled. and
answered. do -not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are

. but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it, you may see
very little of the substance for some months farther of your journey.
Well, says 1, but still it is better than paganism and worshiping of
devils--Why, I will tell you, says he, except the Russian soldiers in the
garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the
rest of this country, for above a thousand miles farther. is inhabited by
the worst and most ignorant of pagans: and so, indeed, we found it.

We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth. if I
undersand any thing of the surface of the globe, that is to be found in
any part of the world; we had. at least, twelve thousand miles to the sea,
eastward; two thousand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, wutward; and
above three thousand. if we tell that see and went on west, to the British
and French channels: we had full five thousand miles to the lndian, or
Persian Sea. south; and about eight hundred to the Frozen Sea, north.
Nay, if some people may be believed. there might be no sea northeast till
we came round the pole. and consequently into the northwest. and so had
a continent of land into America, the Lord knows where; though I could
give some reasons why I believe that to be a mistake.

As we entered into the Muscovite dominions a good while before we
came to any considerable towns. we had nothing to observe there but
this: first, that all the rivers run to the east; as I understood by the
charts, which some in our caravan had with them. it was plain anhose
rivers ran into the great river Yamour. or Amour: which river. by the
natural course of it. must run into the East Sea, or Chinese Ocean. The
story they tell us that the mouth of this river is checked up with
bulrushes ot' a monstrous growth, viz: three feet about, and twenty or
thirty feet high, 1 must be allowed to say, I believe nothing of it; but. as
its navigation is of no use. because there is no trade that way, the
Tartan, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in nothing but cattle, so
nobody. that ever I heard of, has been curious enough either to go down
to the mouth of it in boats, or come up from the mouth of it in ships, as
far as I can find: but this is certain. that this river running east, in the
latitude of about fifty degrees, carries a vast concourse of rivers along
with it. and finds an ocean to empty itself in that latitude; so we are
sure of see there.
Some leagues to the north of this river there are several considerable
rivers. whose streams run as due north as the Yamour runs east, and
these are all found to join their waters with the great river Tartarus,
named so horn the northernmost nations of the Mogul Tartars; who, as
the Chinese say. were the first Tartars in the world; and who,as our
geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred story.
These rivers running all northward, as well as all the other rivers l am
yet to speak of, make it evident that the Northern Ocean bounds the land
also on that side; so that it does not seem rational in the least to think.
that the land can extend itself tojoin with America on that side, or that
there is nota communication between the northern and eastern ocean:
but of this 1 shall say no more; it was my observation at that time. and
therefore I take notice of it in this place.

We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate
journeys. and were very visibly obliged by the care the Czar of Museovy
has taken to have cities and towns built in as many places as it is possible
to place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the sta-
tionary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest countries of their
empire; some of which that I had read of were placed in Britain, for the
security of commerce, and for the lodging travelers: and thus it was
here: for wherever we came, though at these towns and stations the gar-
risons and governors were Russians and professed Christians, yet the
inhabitants were mere pagans; sacrificing to idols, and worshiping the
sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven; and not only so, but
were of all the heathens and pagans that ever 1 met with. the most
barbarous, except only that they did not eat men's flesh, as our savages
of America did. '

Some instances of this we met with in the country between Arguna,
where we enter the Muscovite dominions. end a city of Tartan and
Russians together, called Nertzinskoi, in which is a continued desert or
forest. which cost us twenty days to travel over. In avillage near the
last of these places, I had the curiosity to go and see their way of living,
which is most brutish and unsufi'erable: they had, I suppose, a great
sacrifice that day; for there stood out. upon an old stump of a tree, an
idol, made of wood. frightful as the devil: at least. as any thing we can
think of to represent the devil can be made: it had a head not so much
as resembling any creature that the world ever saw; ears as big as goals'
horns. and as high; eyes as big as a crown piece; a nose like a crooked
mm's horn. and a mouth extended four cornered. like that of a lion, with
hurrihle teeth. hooked like a parrot's under bill: it was dressed up in the
filthiest manner that you could suppose: its upper garment was ofsheep-
skins, with the wool outward: a great Tartar bonnet on the head,with
two horns growing through it: it was about eight feet high, yet had no
feet or legs, nor any other proportion of parts-
This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village; and, when I
came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures, whether men
or women I could not tell, for they made no distinction by their habits,
all lying flat upon the ground round this formidable block of shapeless
wood: I saw no motion among them any more than if they had been all
logs of wood, like the idol, and at first I really thought they had been
so; but, when I came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet, and
raised a howling cry as if it had been so many deep-mouthed hounds,
and walked away, as if they were displeased at our disturbing them. A
little way 00' from the idol, and at the door of a tent or hut, made all of
sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, stood three butchers,--l thought they
were such; when I came nearer to them, I found they had long knives in
their hands; and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed.
and one young bullock or steer. These. it seems. were sacrifices to that
senseless log of an idol; the three men were priests belonging to it, and
the seventeen proatrated wretchos were the people who brought the
offering. and were making their prayers to that stock.

I confess, I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish worship of a
hobgoblin than ever 1 was at any thing in my life; to see God's most
glorious and best creature. to whom he had granted so many advantages,
even by creation above the rest of the works of his hands, vested with a
reasonable soul, and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities
adapted both to honor his Maker and be honored by him. sunk and
degenerated to a degree so very stupid as to prostrate itself to a frightful
nothing.a mere imaginary object, dressed up by themselves. and made
terrible to themselves by their own contrivance. adorned only with clouts
and rags; and that this should be the effect of mere ignoranceI wrought
up into the hellish devotion by the devil himself; who,envying to his
Maker the homage and adoration of his creatures, had deluded them into
such sordid and brutish thingsasone would think should shock nature
itself! .

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection of thoughts;
thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes, and there was no room to
wonder at it, or think it impossible: all my admiration turned to rage.
and I rode up to the image or monster.call it what you will. and with
my sword made a stroke at the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it in
two: and one of our men that was with me took hold of the sheepskin
that covered it, and pulled at it: when. behold,a most hideous outcry
and howling ran through the village; and two or three hundred people
came about my ears. so that l was glad to scour for it, for we saw some
had bows and snow: but lreaolved iron: that moment to visit them
again.

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about four
miles off, in order to provide some horses which they wanted, several of
the horses having been lamed and jaded with the hedness ot' the way.
and long march over the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put
my design in execution. I communicated my design to the Scots
merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I had suflieient testimony: I
told him what I had seen.snd with what indignation I had since thought
that human nature could he so degenerate; I told him, it' I could get but
four or five men well armed to go with me. I was resolved to go and
destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them see that it had no power
to help itself; and consequently could not be an object of worship, or to
he prayed to. much less help them that offered sacrifices to it.

He laughed at me:----says he, Your zeal may be good, but what do you
propose to yourself by it! Propose! said I; to vindicate the honor or God,
which is insulted by this devil-worship. But how will it vindicate the
honor of God. said he. while the people will not be able to know what
you mean by it, unless you could speak to them, and tell them so'! and
then they will fight you, and beat you too, I'll assure you; for they are
desperate fellows, and that especially in defense of their idolatry. Can
we not, said I, do it in the night, and then leave them the reasons and the
causes in writing in their own language! Writing! said he; why there
is not a man in five nations of them that knows any thing of a letter, or
how to read a word any way. Wretched ignorance! said I to him: how-
ever, 1 have a great mind to do it; perhaps nature may draw inferences
from it to them, to let them 'see how brutish they are to worship such
horrid things. Look you, sir, said he, if your zeal prompts you to itso
warmly, you must do it; but, in the next place, I would have you con-
sider, these wild nations of people are subjected by form to the Car of
Muscovy's dominion, and if you do this, it is ten to one but they will
come by thousands to the governor of Nertzinskoi, and demand satisfac-
tion; and if he can not give them satisfaction, it is ten toone but they
revolt; end it will occasion a new war with all the Tartan in the
country.

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for awhile. but I harped
upon the same string still; and all that day I was unosy to put my
project in execution. Toward the evening the Scots merchant met me
by accident in our walk about the town, and desired to speak with me: I
believe, said he, I have put you off your good design; I have been a little
concerned about it since; for I abhor idolatry as much as you can do.
Truly, said I. you have put it on'a little, as to the execution of it, but
you have not put it out ofmy thoughts; and I believe I shall do it bethre
I quit this place, though I were to be delivered up to them for satisfac-
tion. No, no. said he, God forbid they should deliver you up to such a
crew of monsters! they shall not do that neither; that would be murder-
ing you indeed. Why, acid I. how would they use me! Use you! said
be, I'll tell you how they served a poor Russian. who smonted them in
their worship.just as you did, and whom they took prisoner,afler they
had lamed him with an arrow, that he could not run away: they took him
and stripped him stark naked, and set him upon the top of the idol-
monster,and stood all around him, and shot as many arrows into him as
would stick over his whole body; and then they burnt him, and all the
arrows sticking in him. as a sacrifice to the idol. And was this the same
idnl'! said I. Yes, said he, the very same. Well, said I. I will tell you a
story. So I related the story of our men at Madagascar, and how they
burnt and sacked the village there,and killed man, woman, and child.
for their murdering one of our men, just as it is related before: and 1
added, that I thought we ought to do so to this village.

He listened very attentively to the story; but when I talked of doing so
to that village, said be, You mistake very much; it was not this village,
it was almost a hundred miles trom this place; but it was the some idol,
for they carry him about in procession all over the country. Well, said
I, then that idol ought to be punished for it; and it shall, said I, if 1 live '
this night out. ' ' '

In a word. finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me I
should not go alone, but he would go with me, but he would go first and
bring a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with us; and one,
said he.ss famous for his seat as you can desire any one to be against
such devilish things as these. in a word. he brought me his comrade. a
Scotsman. whom he called Captain Richardson; and i gave him a full
account of what! had seen. and also what I intended; and he told me
readily, he would go with me if it cost him his life. So we agreed to go.
only we three. I had, indeed, proposed it to my partner, but he declined
it. He said he was ready to assist me to the utmost, and upon all occa-
sions, for my defense; but this was an adventure quite out of his way;
so, I say. we resolved upon our work, only we three and my man-servant,
and to put it in execution that night about midnight, with all the secrecy
imaginable.

However,upon second thoughts, we' were willing to delay it till the
next night. becguse, the caravan being to set forward in the morning,
we supposed the governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction
upon us when we were out of his power. The Scots merchant.as steady
in his resolution for the enterprise as bold in executing. brought mea
Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and
arrows. and had provided the same for himself and his countryman, that
the people, if they saw us, should not determine who we were.

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter
with aqua vita, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could get;
and, having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour after
night we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found that the
people hed not-the leelt jeelouey ol' denger etiending their idol. The
night wee cloudy; yet the moon geve ue light enough to eee thet the idol
stood juet in the some poeture end piece thet it did before. The people
seemed to he ell et their reet: only thet in the greet hut, or tent. u we

- celled it, where we eew the three prieete whom we mistook for butohere,
we eew e light; end going up cloee to the door, we heerd people telking
as if they were five or eix of them', we concluded, therefore, thet if we
eat wildfire to the idol, theee men would come out immedietely end run
up to the piece to reecue it from the destruction thet we intended for it;
end whet lo.do with them we_knery,not. Once we thought of carrying it
ewey.end eetting fire to it et e dietence. but when we ceme to hurdle it,
we found it too bulky for our cerriege; lo we were et e loee egein. The
eecond Scotemen wee for letting fire to the tent or hut, end knocking the
cmturee thet were there on the heed, when they ceme out: but i could
not join with thet; I wee egein'et killing them, if it were poeeible to evoid
it. Well. then, laid the Boole merchent, I will tell you whet we will do:
we will try to meke them prieonere, tie their hende,end meke them etend
end eee their idol destroyed.

As it heppened, we bed twine or peckthreed enough ehout or, which
we need to tie our firelocke together with; no we reeolved to etteck theee
people first, end with no little noiee ee we could. The first thing we did
we knocked et the door, when, one of the prieete coming to it, we imme-
dietely eeized upon him, stopped hie month, end tied hie hende behind
him, end led him to the idol. where we gegged him thet he might not
meke e noise, tied hie feet eleo together, end let! him on the ground.

Two of Ire then weited et the door, expecting that mother would come
out to eee whet the metter wee; but we weiled to long till the third men
came heck to in; end then nobody coming out, we knocked egein gently.
and immedietely out ceme two more, end we eerved them juet in the
ceme menner, but were obliged to go ell with them, end ley them down
by the idol some dietenee from one enother; when. going heck, we found
two more were come out to the door. end e third etood behind them
within the door. We eeiud the two, end immediately tied them, when
the third etepping heck, end crying out, my Seote merchent went in eller

leh. them there to eee it their idol would relieve them, meking heete back

When the fume we had thrown in hed filled the but with en much
emoke thet they were elmoet eud'oceted, we then threw in e emell leather
beg of enother kind, which fiemed like e cendle. end thllowing it in, we
found there were but four people, end, u we euppoeed, had been ebout
some of their diabolical sacrifices. They appeared, in short, frightened to
death. at least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak
neither, for the smoke.

ln s word. we took them, bound them as we had done the other, and all
without any noise. I should have said we brought them out of the
house, or hut, first; for indeed we were not able to hear the smoke any
more then they were. When we had done this, we carried them ell
together to the idol: when we came there we fell to work with him; and
first we daubed him all over, and his robes also, with tar, end such
other stutt' as we had, which was tellow mixed with brimstone: then we
stopped his eyes, and ears. and niouth full of gunpowder: then we
wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; and then sticking
all the combustihles we had brought with us upon him, we looked about
to see if we could find any thing else to help burn him; when my Scots-
men remembered that by the tent. or but, where the men were. there lay
a heap of dry forage, whether straw or rushes I do not remember: sway '
he end the other Scotsman ran and fetched their arms run of that.
When we had done this, we took all our prisoners, and brought them,
having untied their feet and ungsgged their mouths, end made them
stand up. end set them before their monstrous Idol, and then set tire to
the whole.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts, till the powdc' In
the eyes, end mouth. and ears of the idol blew up, end, as we could
perceive, hsd split and deformed the shape of it: end, in a word, till we
saw it burn into a mere block or log of wood; end setting dry forage to
it, we found it would be soon quite consumed; so we began to think of
going awey; but the Scotsman said. no, we must not go, for these poor
deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn them-
selves with the idol. So we resolvul to stay till the forage was burnt
down too, and then came away and left them.

After the feet was performed. we appeared in the morning among our
fellow-travelers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for our journey; nor
could any man suggest that we had been any where but in our beds, as
travelers might be supposed to be, to lit themselves for the fatiguee of
the day's Journey.

But the afl'eir did not end so, the next day came a great number of the
country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous manner
demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting their
priests, and burning their Chem Chi-Thaungu. The people of Nertzine-
Iroi were at first in a great consternation. for they 'said the Tartar-s were
elresdy no less than thirty thousand strong. The Russian governor sent
out messengers to appease them,'and gave them all the good word:
imaginable; assuring them that he knew nothing.of it, and that there
had notasoul in his garrison been abroad.>> that it could not be from
any body there: but if they could let him know who did it. they should
be exemplary punished. They returned haughtily that all the country
reverenc'ed the great Cham Chi-Thaungn, who dewlt in the sun, and no
mortal would have dared to ofi'er violence to his image but some Christian
miscreant; and they therefore resolved to denounce war against him and
- all the Russians, who, they mid, were miscreants and Christians.

The governor. still patient. and unwilling to make a breach or to have
any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the cur having strictly
charged them to treat the conquered country with gentleness and civility,
gave them still all the good words he could. At last he told them tllere
was a caravan gone toward Russia that morning, and perhaps it was
some of them who had done them this injury; and that if they would be
satisfied with that. he would send after them to inquire into it. This
seemed to appease them a little; and awordingly the governor sent after
us, and gave its a particular account how the thing was: intimating
withal, that it any in our caravan had done it, they should make their
escape; but that. whether we had done it or no, we should make all the
haste forward that was possible; and that, in the meantime, he would
keep them in play as long as he could.

This was very friendly in the governor; however, when it came to the.
caravan, there was nobody knew any thing of the matter; and as for us
that were guilty, we were least of all suspected. However, the captain
of the caravan lbr the time took the hint that the governor gave us, and
we traveled two days and two nights without any considerable stop, and
then we lay at a village called Plothua: nor did we make any long stop
here, but hastened on toward Jarawena,another or the Czar orMuscovy's
colonies, and where we expected we should be safe. But upon the
second day's march from Plothns, by the clouds of dust behind us at a
great distance, some of our people began to be sensible we were pursued.
We had entered a great desert, and had passed by a great lake called
Schaks anr, when we perceived every great body of horse appear on
the other side of the lake, to the north. we traveling west. We observed
they went away west, as we did, but had-supposed we would have taken
that side of the lake, whereas we very happily took the south side; and
in two days more they disappeared again: for they, believing we were
still before them, pushed on till they came to the river Udda,a very great
river when it passes firther north, but when we came to it we found it
narrow and fordable.

The third day they had either Sound their mistake or had intelligence
of us, and mute pouring in upon us toward the dusk of the evening.
We had, to our great satisfation, just pitched upon a piece for our camp,
which was very convenient for the fiht: for as we were upon a desert,
though but at the beginning of it, that was shove live hundred miles

over, we had no towns to lodge at. and, indeed, expected none but the
4
city Jarawena, which we had yet two days' march to; the desert
however, had some few woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which
ran all into the great river Udda; it was in a narrow strait. between little,
but very thick woods, that we pitched our little camp for that night,
expecting to be attacked before morning.

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for: but as it was
usual for the Mogul Tartan to go about in troops in that desert, so the
caravans always fortify themselves every night against them, as against
armies of robbers: and it was therefore no new thing to be pursued.

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a most adven-
tageous camp; for we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet
running just before our front, so that we could not be surrounded, or
attacked any way but in our {tent or rear. We took care also to make
our front as strong as we could, by placing our packs, with our camels
and horses. all in a line, on the inside of the river, and telling some trees
in our rear.

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy was upon
us before we had finished our situation. They did not come on us like
thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers to us. to demand the
men to be delivered to them that had abused their priests. and burnt
their god Chem Chi-Thaungu with fire, that they might burn them with
fire; and upon this, they said, they would go away, and do us no ferther
harm, otherwise they would destroy us all. Our men looked very blank
at this message, and began to stare at one another, to we who looked
with the most guilt in their faces: but nobody was the word; nobody
did it. The leader of the caravan aent word he was well assured that it
was not done by any of our camp; 'that we were peaceable merchants,
traveling on our husineu; that we had done no harm to them or to any.
one else; and that, therethre, they must look firther for their enemies
who had injured them, for we were not the people; so desired them not
to disturb us, for it' they did we should defend ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied withthis thr an answer: and a great
crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break of day, to
our camp; but seeing us in such a well fortified situation, they durst
come no tirther than the brook in our front, where they stood, and
showed us such a number that indeed terrified us very much; for those
that spoke least of them spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood and
looked at us awhile, and then setting up a great howl. they let fly a cloud
of arrows among us; but we were well enough fortified for that. for we
sheltered under our baggage, and I do not remember that one of us was
hurt.

Some time alter this we saw 'em move a little to our right, and
expected them on the rear; when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of Jerawe-
no, in the.pay ot' the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the caravan
said to him, I'll go send all these people away to Siheilhaflhis was a city
four or live day! journey at least to the right, and rather behind us. So
he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides away
from our rear directly, asit were back to Nertzinskoi; alter this he takes
a great circuit about, and comes directly on the army of the Tartan, as
if he had been sent express to tellthem a long story, that the people
who had humt the Cham Chi-Thaungu were gone to Siheillta, with a
caravan of miscreants, as he called them, that is to say. Christians; and
that they had resolved to burn the god Schal-lsar, belonging to the Ton-
gueses.

As this fellow was himselfa mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke their
language, he counterl'eited so well that they all took it lion: him, and
away they drove in a most violent hurry to Siheillta, which, it seems, was
five days' journey to the north; and in less than three hours they were
entirely out of our sight, and we never heard any more of them. nor
whether they went to Siheillta or no. So we passed away safely on to
Jarswena, where there was s garrison ot' Muacovites, and there we rested
five days; the caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day's
hard march, and with want ofrest in the night.

From this city we had a lhghtl'ul desert. which held us twenty-three
days' march. We furnished ourselves with some tents here, for the
better accommodating ourselves in the night; and the leader of the
caravan procured sixteen carriages or wagons of the country, for carrying
our water or provisions: and these carriages were our defense. every
night. round our little camp; so that had the Tartan appeared, unless
they had been very numerous indeed, they would not have been able to
hurt us.

We may well be supposed to want rest again after this long journey;
for in this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and scarce a bush;
though we saw abundance of the sable hunters, who are all Tartan of
the Mogul Tartary. of which this country is a part; and they frequently
attack small caravans, but we saw no numbers of them together.

Atter we had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty well
inhabited; that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled by the Czar
of Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect the caravans,
anddel'end the country against the Tartars, who would otherwise make
it very dangerous traveling; and his mrish majesty has given such strict
orders for the we" guarding the caravans and merchants, that, if there
are any Tartan heard of in the country, detachments of the garrisons are
always sent to see the travelers safe from station to station. And thus
the governor of Adinslroy, whom I an opportunity to make a visit to
by means of the Scots merchant, was acquainted with him,ofl'ered
us a guard of any men, if we thought there was any danger, to the next
station.

but Hound myself mistelren in both; for we had yet the netion ol' the

I have nothing material to say of my particular eifeirs till I came to
'lobolski, the capital city of Siberis, where 1 continued some time on the
following occesion.

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and winter
begun to come on space; whereupon my partner end [celled a council
about our particular strain, in which we found it propenes we were
bound for Englond. and not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of
ourselves. They told no of sledges and reindeer to carry us ever the
snow in the winter time; end, indeed, they have such things that it
would be incredible to relete the particulars of, by which means the
Rue-ions travel more in the winter then they can in summer, as in these
sledges they are able to run night and day; the snow being frozen. is one
universal covering to nature, by which the hills, voles, rivers, and lakes,
are all smooth and hard as e stone, end they run upon the surface with-
out eny regard to whet is underneath.

But I had no occasion to push st s winter journey of this kind: I was _
bound to England, not to Moscow, end my route lsy two ways; either I
must go on so the csrsven went, till I came to Jeroslew, end then go oh'
west for Nerve, end the Gulf of Finlsnd, and so to Dentzic, where I
might possibly sell my Chins cargo to good advantage; or] must lesva
the cereven at a little town on the Dwine, item whence I bed but six
days by water to Archengel, Ind from thence might be sure of shipping
either to Englend. Holland. or Hsmbnrgh.

Now, to go shy of these journeys in the winter would have been pre-
posterous: for, as to Dentzic, the Baltic would heve been fioun up, and
I could not get passage; end to go by lend in those countries was fer less
safe than among the Mogul Tartan; likewise, to go to Archangel in
October. ell the ships would be gone trons thence, a'nd even the merchants
who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow in the winter. when
the ships are gone; so that I could have nothing but extremity of cold
to encounter, with s scarcity of provisions, end must lie in on empty
town ell the winter: so that, upon the whole, Ithonght it much my
better wsy to let the caravan go, snd make provisions to winter where I
was, at Tobolslri, in Siberia, in the latitude of shout sixty degrees, where
l was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with, viz: plenty of
provisions. such as the country atl'orded, e worm house, with fuel enough,
end excellent compsny.

I was now in a quite difl'erent climste from my beloved island, where I
never felt cold. except when I had my egue: on the contrary.l hsd much
to do to beer any clothes on my back, and never made my tire but with-
out doors, which wss necessary for dressing my food, etc. Now 1 made
me three good vests, with lerge robes or gowns over them, to hang down
to the feet, and button close to the wrists; and sit these lined with furs,
to make them sufllciently warm.
As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our way in
England of making tires in every room in the house in open chimneys.
which. when the tire was out. always kept the air in the room cold as the
climate: but taking an apartment in a good house in the town. I ordered
a chimney to be built like a furnace. in the center of six several rooms,
like a stove; the funnel to carry the smoke Went up one way. the door to
come at the tire went in another, and all the rooms were kept equally
warm, but no tire seen,just as they heat the bagnioa in England. By
this means we had always the same climate in all the rooms. and an
equal heat was preserved: and how cold soever it was without, it was
always warm within; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded
with smoke.

The most wonderml thing ofall was, that it should be possible to meet
with good company here. in the'country so barbarous as that of the most
northerly parts of Europe, near the noun Ocean, within but a very few
degrees of Nova Zembla. But this being the country where the state .
criminals of Muscovy, as I'observed before. are all banished, this city
was full of noblemen, gentlemen, soldiers. and courtiers of Muscovy.
Here was the famous Prince Gallitun' the old General Robostiski.and
several other persons of note.and some ladien. By means of my Scots
merchant, whom,nevertheless.l parted with here,l made an acquaint- '
ance with several of these gentleman; and from these, in the long winter
nights in which I stayed here. I received several very agreeable visits.

It was. taking one night with Prince--,one of the banished ministers
of state belonging to the Car of Muscmly. that the discourse of my par- '
ticular case began. He had been telling me abundance of fine things of
the greatness. the magnificence. the dominions. and the absolute power
of the Emperor of the Russians: I interrupted him. and told him I was
a greater and more powerml prince than even the Car of Muscovy was.
though my dominions were not so large.ur my people so many. The
Russian grandee looked a little surprised, and fixing his eyes steadily
upon me, began to wonder what I meant.- I told him his wondemould
cease when I had explained myself. First.l told him I had absolutedia-
posal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects; that. notwithstanding
my absolute power,I had not one.person disaffected to my government
or to my person in all my dominions. He shook his head at that. and
said there. indeed. I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him that all the
lands in my kingdom were my own. and all my subject: were not only
my tenants. but tenants at will; that they would all tlght for me to the
last drop; and that never tyrant, for such l'acknowledged myself to be.
was ever so universally beloved, and yet an horribly feared by his
subjects.

Alter amusing him with these riddles in government for a while, 1
opened the ease, and told him the story at large of my living in the
island; and how I managed both myself and the people that were under
me,just as l have since minuted it down. They were exceedingly taken
with the story,eepecielly the prince, who told me, with a sigh, that the
true greatness of life was to be masters of ourselves; that he would not
have exchanged such a state of life as mine to be Car of Muscovy; and
that he found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to be banished
to there, than ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the
court of his .master the car; that the hight of human wisdom was to
bring our tempers down to our circumstances, and to make a calm with-
in, under the weight of the greatest storms without. When he came
first hither. he said he used to tear the heir (tom his head, and the clothes
from his beck, as others had done before him; buts little time and con-
sideration had made him look into himself, as well as round him, to
things without: that be mind the mind of man, if it was but once
brought to reflect upon the state of universal lite, and how little this
world was concerned in its true felicity. was perfectly capable of making
a felicity for itself, fully satietying to itself, and suitable to its own best
ends and desires, with but very little assistance from the world; the air
to breathe in, ibod to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and liberty for
exercise. in order to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the
world could do for us: and though the greatness, the authority, the
riches, and the pleasures which some enjoyed in the world. had much in
them that was agreeable to us, yet all those things chiefly gratified the
coarsest of our afl'cctions, such as our ambition, our particular pride,
avarice, vanity, and sensuality; all which, being the mere product of the
worst part of man, were in themselves crimes, and had in them the seeds
of all manner of crimes: but neither were related to nor concerned with
any of those virtues that constituted us wise men,'or of those graces that
distinguished us as Christians; that being now deprived of all the fanci-
thl felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices, he said
he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of them, where he found all
manner of deformity. and was now convinced that virtne only makes a
man truly wise, rich, and greet, and preserves him in the way to a
superior happiness in a future state; and in this, he said, they were
more happy in their banishment than all their enemies were, who
had the full possession of ell the wealth and power they bed left behind
them. Nor. sir, says he. do I bring my mind to this politically, by the
newssity of my circumstances, which some cell miserable; but, if I
know any thing of myself,l would not now go back. though the czar my
master should call me, and reinstate me in all my former grandeur: I
say. I would no more go baclt to it than I believe my soul, when it shall be '
delivered from this prison of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious
state beyond life, would come back to the jail of flesh and blood it is new
tnclosod iqend leave heaven, to deal in the dirt and crime ofhumenafliirs.
He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper.>> much semesta
ness and motion of his spirits. that it was evident it was the true sense
of his soul; there was no room to doubt his sincerity. I told him I once
thought myself a kind of monarch in my old station, of which I had
given him an account; but that I thought he was not only a monarch,
but a great conqueror: for that he that has got a victory over his own
exorbitant desires, and the absolute dominion over himself, whose reason
entirely governs his will. is certainly greater than he that conquers a city.
But. my lord, said I, shall I take the liberty to ask you a question 3---
With all my heart, says he.--It'the door of your liberty was opened. said
I, would you not take hold of it to deliver you from this exile? Hold,
said he; your question is subtle, and requires some serious,just distinc-
tions. to give it a sincere answer; and I will give it you fiom the bottom
of my heart. Nothing that I know of in this world would move me to
deliver myself from this state of banishment, except these two; first, the
enjoyment of my relations; and. secondly, a little warmer climate: but
I protest to you, that to go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the
power. the hurry of a minister of state; the wealth, the gayety, and the
pleasures of a courtier; if my master should send ms word this moment
that he restores me to all he banished me from, I protest, if I know
myself at all, I would not leave this wilderness, these deserts. and these
frozen lakes, for the palace at Moscow. But, my lord, said I. perhaps
you not only are. banished from the pleasures of the court, and Item the
power, authority, and wealth you enjoyed before, but you may be absent
too from some of the conveniences of life; your estates, perhaps. confis-
cated, and your ed'ects plundered; and the supplies let! you here may
not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life. Ay,says he. that is as
you suppose me to be a lord, or a prince, etc.; so. indeed. I am; but you
are now to consider me only as a man, a human creature, not at all distin-
guished from another; and so I can sutfer no want, unless I should be
visited with sickness and distempers. However, to put the question out
of dispute, you see our manner: we are. in this place tire persons of
rank; we live perfectly retired," suited to a state of banishment: we
have something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes, which keeps
us from the mere necessity of hunting for food, but the poor soldiers,
who are here without that help, live in as much plenty as we, who go
into the woods and catch sables and foxes; the labor of a month will
maintain them a year; and, as the way of living is not expensive, so it is
not hard to get sufficient to ourselves. So that objection is out of doors.

I have not room to give a full account of the moat agreeable conversa-
tion I had with this truly great man; in all which he showed that his
mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so supported
by religion, as well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his contempt of
the world was really as much as he had expressed, and that he was
always the same to the last, as will appear in the story 1 am going
to tell.

1 had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I thought it;
the cold so intense that I could not so much as look abroad without being
wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before my toe, or rather a hood, with .
only a hole for breath, and two for sight: the little daylight we had was,
as we reckoned, for three months, not above five hours a day, and six at
most; only that the snow lying on the ground continually, and the
weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses were kept, or rather
starved, under ground; and as for our servants, whom we hired here to
look alter ourselves and horses, we had. every now and then, their fingers
and toes to thaw and take care of, last they should mortify and till off.

It is true. within doors we were warm, the houses being close, the walls
thick, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our food was chiefly
the flesh of deer, cured in the season; breed good enough, but baked as
biscuits; dried fish of several sorts. and some flesh of mutton and of the
buffaloes, which is pretty good meat. All the stores of provisions for
the winter are laid up in the summer, and well cured: our drink was
water. mixed with sons vita instead of brandy; and lbr a treat, mead
instead of wine. which, however, they have excellent good. The hunters,
who venture abroad all weathers, flequently brought us in line venison,
and sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much care for the last. We
had a good stock of us, with which we treated our friends, as above, and
we lived very cheerfully and well. all things considered.

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and the
weather at least tolerable; so the other travelers began to prepare sledges
to carry them over the snow, and to get things ready to be going; but
my measum being fixed, as l have said, for Archangel, and not for Mus-
covy or the Baltic, I made no motion: knowing very well that the ships
item the south do not set out for that part of the world till May or June,
and that if I was there by the beginning of August, it would be as soon
as any ships would be ready to go'away; and therefore I made no haste
to be gone, as others did: in a word, I saw a great many people, nay, all
the travelers, go away before me. It seems every year they go flom
thence to Muscovy for trade, via: to earry furs. and buy necessaries,
which they bring back with them to furnish their shops: also others
went on the same errand to Archangel; but then they all being to come
back again, above eight hundred miles, went all out before me.

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up; and, as I
was doing this, 'it occurod to me that, seeing all these people were
banished by the Gear of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when they came
there, were lelt at libery to go whither they would, why they did not
then go away to any part of the world, wherever they thought tit; and I
began to examine what should hinder them ll'om making such an

35410 sovauwaas or

attempt. But my wonder was over when I entered upon that Inject
with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus: Consider,
first, sir. said he. the place where we are; and, secondly, the condition
we are in; especially the generality of the people who are banished
hither. We are surrounded with stronger things than bars or bolts; on
the north side an unnavigable oceamwhere ship never sailed, and boat
never swam; every other way, we have above a thousand miles to pass
through the car's own dominions, and by ways utterly impassable,
except by the roads made by the government, and through the towns
garrisoned by his troops; so that we could neither pass undiscovered by
the road, nor subsist any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt it.

I was silenced indeed, at once, and found that they were in a prison
every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle at
Moscow: however, it came into my thoughts that I might certainly be
made an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent person; and
that, whatever hanrd I ran, I would certainly try if! could carry him
elf. Upon this I took an occasion, one evening. to tell him my thoughts.
I represented to him that it was very easy for me to carry him away,
there being no guard over him in the country; and as I was not going to
Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the retinue of a caravan,
by which I was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the desert,
but could encamp every night where I would, we might easily pass un-
interrupted to Archangel, where I would immediately secure him on
board an English ship, and carry him safe along with me; and as to his
subsistence, and other particulars, it should be my care, till he could
better supply himself.

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnesz on me all the while
I spoke; nay, I could see in his very fies that what I said put'his spirits
into an exceeding ferment: his color flequently changed, his eyes looked
red, and his heart fluttered, that it might be even perceived in his coun-
tenance: nor could he immediately answer me when I had done, and as
it were hesitated what he would say to it: but alter he had pauseda
little, he embraced me, and said, How unhappy are we, unguarded crea-
tures as we are, that even our greatest acts of Mendsbip are made snares
unto us. and we are made tempters ol'one another! My dear friend, said
he, your offer is so sincere, has such kindness in it, is so disinterested in
itself, and is so calculated for my advantage. that I must have very little
knowledge of the world if I did not both wonder at it. and acknowledge
the obligation I have upon me to you for it. But did you believe I was
sincere in what I have oflen said to you of my contempt of the werld'l
Did you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had really
obtained that degree of felicity here that had placed me above all that
the world could give me'! Did you believe I was sincere when I told
you I would not go back if I was recalled even to be all that I once was
in the court, with the hvor of the cur my master! Did you believe me,
my friend. to be an honest man: or did you believe me to be a boasting
hypocrite? Here he stopped," it he would hear what I would say; but,
indeed, I soon alter perceived that he stopped because his spirits were in
motion, his great heart was full of struggles, and he could not go on. I
was, I confess, astonished at the thing as well as at the man, and I used
some arguments with him to urge him to set himself free; that he ought
to look upon this as a door opened by Heaven tbr his deliverance, and a
summons by Providence, who has the care and disposition of all events,
to do himself good, and to render himself useful in the world.

' He had by this time recovered himself: How do you know, sir, says
he warmly, but that, instead of a summons from Heaven, it may be e
feint or another instrument; representing in alluring colors to me the
show of {slicity as a deliverance, which may in itself be my snare, and
tend directly to my ruin! Here I am ties Rom temptation of returning
to my former miserable greatness: there I am not sure but that all the
seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in
nature, may revive and take root, and, in a. word, again overwhelm- me;
and then the happy prisoner, whom you \see new master of his soul's
liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his own seams, in the full of ell
personal liberty. Dear air. let me remain in this blessed confinement,
banished from the crimes or rm, rather than purchase a show offieedom
at the expense of the liberty of my reason, end at the nature happiness
which I now have in my view, but shall then,I fear, quickly lose eight
of: for I am but flesh; a men, a mere man; have passions and adections
as likely to possess end overthrow me as any man: 0h be not my friend
end tempter both together!

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, end stood silent,
looking at him, end, indeed, admiring whet I saw. The struggle in
his soul was so greet, that though the weather was extremely cold,
it put him into a most violent sweat, and I found he wanwd to give
vent to his mind; so I said a word or two, that I would leave him to
consider of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my own
apartment.

About two hours alter I heard somebody at or near the door or my
room, and I was going to open the door, but he had opened it, and came
in. My dear Mend, says he, you had almost overset me, but I am
recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not close with your ofl'er; I assure
you it is not for want of sense of the kindness of it in you; and I came
to make the moat sincere acknowledgment of it to you: but I hope I
have got the victory over myself. My lord,said I, I hope you are 'fully
satisfied that you do not resist the call of Heaven. sir, said be, if it had
been "om Heaven, the same power would have influenced me to have
accepted it: but I hope,and am fully satisfied, that it is Rom Heaven

I
that I declined it: and l have infinite satisfaction in the parting. that you
shall leave me an hottest than still, though not. a free man.

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to him of
my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. He embraced
me very pawionatelymnd assured me he was sensible of that, and should
always acknowledge it; and with that he oll'ered me a very fine present
of Babies. too much. indeed. for me to accept from a man in his circum-
stances, and I would have avoided them. but he would not he refused.

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with a small pres-
entoftes. and two pieces ofChina damask, and four little wedges of Japan
gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces or thereabout, but were far
short of the value of his sabtes, which when I came to England. I found
worth near two hundred pounds. lle accepted the tea. and one piece of tho
damask and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it of
the Japan coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of it, but would
not take any more: and he sent word by my servant that he desired to
speak with we.

When I came to him. he told me! knewwhat had passed between us,
and hoped lwould not move him anymore in that affair: but that, sinco
I had made such a generous offer to him. he asked me in had kindn ess
enough to offer the some to another person that he would name to me, in
whom he had a great share ofconcern. I told him that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any but himself. for whom I hada particular
value,and should have been glad to have been the instrument of his de-
liverance ; hon-ever, ifhe would please to name the person to me l would
give him my answer. He told me it was his only son; who. though I had
not seen him. yet he was in the same condition with himself, and above
two hundred miles {torn him. on the other side the Oby; but that,ifl
consented. he would send for him.

I made no hesitation. but told him I would do it. I made some ceremo-
ny in letting him understand that it was wholly on his account; and that
seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show my respect to him by
concern for his son; but these things are too tedious to repeat here. He sent
away the next day for his son : and in about twenty days he came back
with the messenger. bringing six or seven horses loaded with very rich
furs. and which, in the whole. amounted to a very great value. His ser-
vants brought the horses into the town, but left the young lord at a dis.
tance till night. when he came incognito into our apartment. and his fa-
ther presented him to me. and, in short. we concerted the mannner of
our traveling. and every thing proper for the journey.

I had bought a considerable quantity of sahtes. black fox-skins, tine er-
mines. and such other furs as are very rich, in that city,in exchange for
seine of the goods I had brought tron: China ; in particular for the cloves
and uutmegs.of which hold the greatest part here, and the rest anerward
at Archangel, {or a much better price than I could have got at London;
and my partner. who was sensible of the profit. and whose business more
particularly than mine was merchandise. was mightily pleased with our
stay, on account of the tratfic we made here.

It was the beginning or June when I left this remote place, a city, I be-
livo, little heard of in the world; and, indeed, it is so far out of the road
of commerce, that I know not how it should be much talked of. We
were now reduced toa very small caravan, having only thirty-two horses
and camels in all, and all of them passed for mine. though my new guest
was proprietor of eleven of them ; it was most natural also that I should

. take more servants with me than I had before: and the young lord passed
for my steward; what great man I passed for] know not, neither did it
concern me to inquire. We had here the worst and the largest desert to
passover that we met with in our whole journey ; I call it the worst be-
cause the way was very deep in some places, and very uneven in others;
the best we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of
Tartars or robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side of the
river ()by, or at least but very seldom, but we found it otherwise.

My young lord had a faithful Muscovite. or rather a Siberian servant
who was perfectly acquainted with the country, and led us by private
roads, so that we avoided coming into the principal towns and cities upon
the great road. such as Tumen, Soloy Kamakoi, and several others; be-
cause the Musoovite garrisons which are kept there are very curious and
strict in their observation upon travelers, and searching lest any of the
banished persons of note should make their escape that way into Mus-
covy; but by this means, as we were kept out of the cities, so our whole
journey was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our
tents, when we might have had very good accommodation in the cities on
the way: this the young lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow
us to lie abroad when we came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad
himself, with his servant, in the woods and met us always at the appoint-
places .

We were just entered Europe, having just passed the river Kama. which
in these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia and the first city
on the European side was called Soloy Kamslroi. which is as much as to
say, the great city on the river Kama; and here we thought to see some
evident alteration in the people; but we were mistaken; {hr as we had
a vast desert to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long in some pla-
ces but not above two hundred miles over where we passed it, so till we
came past that horrible place, we found very little difference between
that country and the Mogul Tartary ; the people are mostly pagans. and
little better than the savages of America ; their houses and towns full of
idols, and their way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities, as
above, and the villages near them, where they are Christains,as they call41-! sevens-vase or

themselves. of the Greek church: but have their religion mingled will a
many relics of superstition. that it is scarce to be known in some plau--
from mere sorcery and witchcraft.

In passing this forest, I thought. indeed, we must (alter all our dangers
were to our imagination escaped, as before) have been plundered and rob-
bed and perhaps murdered. by a troop of thieves; of what country they
were I am yet at a loss to know, but they were all on horse back, carried
bows and arrows, and were at first about forty-live in number: they came
so near to us as to be within two musket shots, and asking no questions,
surrounded us with their horses. and looked very earnestly upon us twice;
at length they placed themselvesjust in our way; upon which we drew
up in a little line before our camels, being not above sixteen men in all ;
and being drawn up thus, we halted. and sentout the Siberian servant.
who attended his lord, to see who they were: his master was the more
willing to let him go, because he was not a little apprehensive that they
were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The men came up near them
with a flag of truce, and called to them; but though he spoke several of
their languages, or dialects of languages rather, he could not understand
a word they said; however, alter some signs to him not to come nearer
to them at his peril, the fellow earns hack no wiser than he went: only
that by their dress, hesaid he belived them to be some Tartars ot' Kal-
muclt. or of the Circaseian hordes, and that there must be more of them
upon the greet desert, though he never heard that any of them were seen
so far north before. _

About an hour alter they again made a motion to attack us, and rode
round our little wood to see where they might break in; but finding
us always ready to face them. they went 03' again; and we resolved not
to stir for that night.

This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy; there was
on our lelt hand. at about a quarter of a mile distance. a little grove, and
very near the road ; 1 immediately resolved we should advance to those
trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there; for, tint, l consid-
ered that the trees would in a great measure cover us from their arrows;
and, in the next place. they could not come to charge us in a body; it
was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this
excellence attending him, that he was always readiest and most apt to
direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger. We advanced im-
mediatly with what speed we could. and gained that little wood; the Tar-
tan: or thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keeping their stand,
and not attempting to hinder us. When we came thither, we found, to
our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy piece of ground, and on the
one side. a very great spring of water, which running out in a little brook,
was. a little farther. joined by another of the like size; and was in short,
the source of a considerable river, called afterward the Wirtalta: the trees
which grew ebont thie epring were not ebove two hundred, but very lerge,
end etood pretty thick,>> that ee eoon u we got in we eew oureelvee per-

While we eteyed here waiting the motion of the enemy eome home,

but they ceme on with e double fury up to the wood eide, not imagining
we were no herriceded thet they could not eeeily break in. Our old pilot
