Preface. 

Now that I have arrived at the termination of the first 
part of my treatise — the second part, for which I already 
have a complete collection of materials, and parts of which 
are ready in MS, will, I trust, be out in print within the very 
near future — it is for me a pleasant duty to express my 
sincere thanks to all those who in one way or another have 
assisted me in the preparation of this little work. In parti- 
cular, I beg to acknowledge my deep obligation to my 
esteemed teachers during the course of my academic studies, 
the Professors AxEL Erdmann, Uppsala, Erik Bjorkman, 
Goteborg, and ElLERT Ekwall, Lund, whose advice and many 
valuable suggestions have been of great service to me. Finally, 
for looking through the English of my MS and for assistance 
in reading the proof-sheets I am indebted to Mr. Grenville 
Grove (Late Scholar of Hertford College, Oxford), and Mr. 
William Savage, English teachers at Stockholm. 

Stockholm, May 19 lo.

^ This grammar, perhaps the best of all I have used and quoted, 
must be considered to be a very remarkable work, written by a scholar 
of uncommon linguistic talent for his time. It has also received the 
estimation rightly due to it not only from modern scholars and grammarians, 
but also from those of the 18th c. 

In A Student's pastwie (1896) Skeat gives us a collection of some 
older English grammars which, 'should certainly be examined' for NED. 
Among those that first of all should be read he mentions Wallis, to whicli 
alone he gives the epithet 'valuable'. That even the contemp. and 
succeeding generation of Wallis shared Skeat's opinion in this respect is 
obvious from the great popularitv the work enjoyed, and not least 
among his fellow grammarians, who, to use Greenwood's words about 
his literary pirates, 'were pleased to take such particular notice of the 
book, as to make frequent abstracts and abridgements of it', generally 
without ever indicating any source at all. — 'Editio Prima' of this 
grammar was published 'Oxoniae 1653'. Long after the death of Wallis 
(1703) Thomas Hollis, (see BB) edited the fifth and last ed. of the 
very popular work 1765. — As far as 1 can judge from a hasty collation 
of the ed. from 'editio tertia' 1664 up to the ed. of 1765, those sections 
that are of special interest for my present work — De Sonorutn Fortna- 
tiofie^ De Pronunciatiotie, and the section De Anglicanae Linguae Struc- 
tura, very nearly corresponding to \\hat nowadays is called accidence^ 
— are in the main only reprinted word for word from preceding issues. 
On this account the statements given in the ed. of 1765 can by no 
means be considered as giving us an}' satisfactory information of the 
language written and spoken about the middle of the i8th c. The same 
remark applies of course in the first place to S. Johnsox and also mutatis 
mutandis to Walhs's pirates at the beginning of the century: Brightland, 
Greenwood, Maittaire and Arnold. Herewith we have also arrived 
at the question as to what extent the 18th c. gram, have, without more 
ado, translated and copied Wallis. (Here some general remarks; parti- 
culars will be pointed out in their resp. places). The most assiduous 
in this respect are Brightland and Johnson. But as far as I can disco- 
ver, the former never indicates any source at all. — In 'Etymology', 
Wallis's 'De Anglicanae Linguae Structura', we can trace on every page 
how Johnson has more or less obviously been influenced by Wallis. As 
regards the section of Irregt/lar verbs this strong influence practi- 
cally assumes the character of plagiarism. In an introductory remark to 
'Derivation', which upon the whole is only an abridgment of Wallis's 
'Etymologia', he is, however, candid enough to express in different places 
his obligation to Wallis.

In order to show Greenwood's free and easy style of proceeding, I 
can here mention that both his introductory remarks to 'A Praxis on the 
Grammar' and the explanatory notes on 'The Apostles' Creed' and' The 
Lord's Prayer' (copied in their turn, together with many other things, by 
Arnold) are practically nothing but a translation, line for line, of Wallis's 
Traxis Grammatica' appearing, for the first time, besides many other addi- 
tions, as an appendix to 'Editio Qiiarta' 1674. 

^ The work, which is wantten in the form of letters, is a very bulky 
volume in three parts, 761 pages. Its principal value consists, perhaps, in 
the author's giving us specimens of all phases, esp. of spoken English 
trom the most vulgar, right up to the most refined speech of well edu- 
cated ladies and gentlemen. Lowest in the scale among the characters 

as represented by the author comes Madame Duval [D] 'a late waiting 
girl at a tavern, vulgar and illiterate'. — The footmen and coachmen (e. 
g. II. 216) are represented as on the same level of erudition and gram, 
knowledge in their way of speaking as their successors of the present 
day. — Mr. Mirvan [c] the very coarse sea-captain, 'a surly, vulgar and 
disagreeable fellow' stands scarcely an}' higher as regards his way of 
speaking. — Then comes the cockney family Branghtoit. The tather 
[Mr. Br.] is married to a 'chandler's shop woman' He has a son [Br.], 
'a young fellow of twenty years of age, weak in his understanding' 
and two daughters: the eldest [Miss Br.] looks 'illtempered and conceited', 
the younger, Miss Polly [Miss P] is 'very foolish, very ignorant'. The 
speech of Br. is to be looked upon as really vulgar, and that of his sisters 
as very careless, to say the least of it. — Furthermore we have Mr. Brown 
'a young, awkward and rather simple swain', represented as anything but 
a gentleman. — In quoting an expression, etc. used by any of the above 
mentioned characters I have always indicated the speaker. This distinctive 
procedure I have found superfluous with regard to the other persons in- 
troduced, as their language seems exclusively to belong to, and characterize

the lang. of C S and M F diff"ers from that of P Y, for inst., I have only 
cited some stray examples from the first few pages of these works. 

■* Though Defoe in many wa\'s portrays the great want of education 
amongst the 'untaught gentry', I cannot find that he has aimed at giving 
an}^ vulgar tone to their speech, at least from a linguistic point of view. 
This will become apparent if we, for inst., go over the 'warm discourse 
about learning and wit' (p. 44 fi"; cf p. 124 If.) between the two brothers, 
the elder represented as an uneducated country gentleman, the vounger 
as educated at the University. 

^ My quotations from REd. (a fragmentarv treatise of 36 pp.) are 
verv scantv. 

^ Most of the papers from which quotations are taken are written 
by Addison, as can be seen from the signature, Addison usually signing 
his contributions with one of the following initials C, L, I, O. When a 
quotation is taken out of a number not written bv Addison, this will 
gen. be called attention to. 

' I regret not having been able in this case, either to obtain the orig. 
ed. of 1738, or the reprint ed. by Saintsbury. — As regards the purpose 
of the pamphlet, which is much the same as that of Defoe's CG, and 
esp. the general character of its language, see Scott's preface to it in 
the ed. used by me; Sh.\w 948 and Storm 925, 948 also for the title. — 
(Quotations from PC are gen. given only in such cases where the lang. 
seems to diff'er from that of other contemp. works which may be consi- 
dered as representative of the standard English of that date.

General remark 011 the quotations. In the quotations the figures 
(e. g. 56) refer to a certain page: in Sir. Let., however, they 
denote a certain letter. — When two sets of figures are used 
(e. g. 56. 2) they indicate in RC p. and 1.; in quotations from 
Sp. and Ta. the first denotes the number of the paper, the 
second the paragraph in the resp. ed. — In Ev. the Roman 
number refers to the part, the Arabic to the page.

Title page to the lirst edition of Robinson Crusoe, 4/5 size. 



was registered at Stationers' ilall on the 23rd of April 17 19, 
and it was also published by William Taylor 'at the Ship in 
Pater-Noster-Row' on the 25th of the same month. 

The volume is in octavo, of 364 pages, title page and pre- 
face (2 leaves) not included. On the page opposite the title 
there is a rude copper plate engraving/ in which Crusoe 
is represented standing on the sea-shore in his 'short Jacket 
of Goat-Skin . . . and a Pair of open-knee' d Breeches of the 
same: Stockings and Shoes I had none' (RC 176). He car- 
ries a big gun on each shoulder, a pistol is stuck in his 
belt, and an enormous basket-hilted sword hanging from his 
left hip. Far in the background of the engraving a ship is 
seen rolling in a rough sea. At the foot is written Clark & 
Pine S. C. The second part of the last page contains 12 
lines Errata.^ 

In the Preface where Defoe masquerades as editor him- 
self, he holds forth the excellent qualities of his work in 
terms such as: 'The Story is told with Modesty, with Serious- 
ness, and with a religious Application of Events to the Uses 
to which wise Men always apply them (viz.) to the Instruc- 
tion of others and to justify and honour the Wisdom of Pro- 
vidence,' and expresses at last as his opinion that 'he thinks, 
without farther Compliment to the World, he does them 
a great Service in the Publication'. 

The immediate and enormous success of the book shows Ed. b. 
that he was quite right in his suppositions.^ Alreadj^ on 
May 1 2th 'The Second Edition [B] was published which, 
with some small corrections and changes, is only a reprint 
page by page from A. 



' A facsimile reprint of this trontispiece is to be found in Thoma.s 
Wright's Life of Defoe. 

- These Errata, being onlv a small portion of the great number extant, 
are all corrected in B. 

^ Those who want to enter upon any closer study of the hundreds, 
nay thousands of more or less strictly original editions, translations, imita- 
tions and the like, which became a consequence of the enormous success 
of the book in England, I refer to Ullrich : Robitjson unci Robinsonaden.

As regards the sequence of lines, differences occur, though 
not to any very great extent, e.g. 71.16 — 36; 139.20 — 23; 
276.29 — 30, etc. — For further examples see p. XXXVII. — 
Nevertheless, it will be observed that in setting up B, the 
printer managed, practically always, to make the correspond- 
ing pages agree as regards the end-words. Only in two or 
three cases have I noticed some slight differences: pp. 215 — 
216; 264—265; 320 — 321. 

Upon the title page, moreover, there appears for the first 
time the emblem of the publisher, a ship with the English 
merchant flag astern and the Union Jack on the mizzen-mast. 

Though the differences in text between A and B will 
generally be called attention to in their respective places, I 
.shall here give a 



Comprehensive survey of the different readings 
of A and B. 

[In this list I have not considered it either necessary or 
desirable to include any examples of the many obvious mis- 
prints (cf. p. XV) in A, generally corrected in B, e. g. inagast 
> against 2.^\ zvetr > where 200.23, etc. etc. — a few, however, 
are left in B, e. g. Ingeino 38.37, a State Health of (of 
health) 43.28 — or such as are to be found in B, but not 
in A, e. g. clam < calm 8.31, the < they, 191. 19, etc. etc. 
This also applies to the exceedingly great number of purely 
orthographical dissimilarities existing between A and B. Such 
examples are to be found in the general text-survey on 
pp. XXXVI— XXXVII].

These deviations, in many respects very important from 
a linguistic point of view, raise of course the question as 
to their origin. The best means of determining the mat- 
ter will, I think, be to undertake a comparative examina- 
tion of Defoe's autograph MS of C G and a printed proof 
sheet containing the beginning of the work, preserved toge- 
ther with the MS; cf. CG p. X. — In the MS Defoe 
hardly ever puts any punctuation marks, and never uses any 
Jiyphcn or apostrophe in the Saxon genitive; before / {^ox-ed) 
in verbs, on the contrary, as pufft, suck't, burnt, furnislit, 
pass't, etc., and such modes of writing as hio , thro' (throw) 
227, etc., the apostrophe occurs very frequently; capitals are 
used quite at random, a small letter being even written after 
a full stop. In the printed sheet, on the other hand, these 
peculiarities are corrected in agreement with the commonly 
accepted style of the time. — The final c after i> is very 
frequently omitted:^ bcliev, giv, prcserv, etc. (cf. sojii); in 
other cases we find it used contrary to the proof: baronettc, 
darkc, mobbe; cus tomes, aliuayes, dayes, sayes, saies; transla- 
teing, nrriteing, etc. — Such spellings as bodyes, capascityes:^ 
i?zfinnitys, ladys, etc. are no less common than the use of ci 
instead o( ti, which never occurs in ^C: erudicion, rezfelacion 
and inspiration 157, accions, his imperfections are no imper- 
feccions 185. — The doubling of the final consonant \^ cextvanXy 

Mil R C only negativ, positiv once p. 77.21 (B -ive). 

^ In R C I have onlv found a single similar inst. left: Cryes 27.57 
(B Cries). — In Sw. Let. Cherryes, Toiyes, cnrryes, copyes, etc. are equally 
common as arrivall, counsel/, admitt, att, icritt, etc. — In his printed 
works, on tlie contrary, similar spellings hardly ever occur. 

G. Lannert. II 



found in the proof, but its occurrence can in no way be 
compared with its frequency in the M S, e. g. naturall, ras- 
cally fan-. Jilt, regrett, etc. etc. 

As in all the above adduced cases the orthography of 
R C practically agrees with that of the printed proof, I believe 
one may safely infer that at least in these cases the differen- 
ces in spelling existing between A and the MS of C G are 
to be ascribed wholly to the printers.^ The same inference 
may be drawn regarding the very great number of instances 
(cf. p. XXXVII) where B has changed the orthography of A 
and esp. in such cases where this differs from that of C G. 

But even in other more important respects the M S and 
the proof have different readings, e. g. p. 21: the nations 
a ye y is: the degenerated xd^c^y degenerate: p. 22: antient 
history: instead of this the print has a long stroke, etc. — 
Finally some alterations made in the text of the printed proof 
such as p. II, the Born Gentleman, in the Common, or Mo- 
dern, or Present Acception of the Word in the M S, is correc- 
ted in the printed sheet to tJie Gentleman born and the 
words or Modern, or Prese^it are struck out and marked for 
deletion; — / matter not p. ii and Shines ?aithout Beams p. 
20, have by the corrector been altered to / value not and 
Fair without Beams respectively. — These corrections, not in 
Defoe's Jiamhvriting, show better than the former textual diffe- 
rences, as regards C G at least, the correctors' highhanded 
way of dealing with the M S S sent in for printing.^ 

* That this opinion is really in agreement with the then prevailing 
printing practice, is confirmed bj' a statement in Dyche against the spel- 
ling of the time (e. g.: -ck, our, etc.) beginning as follows: 'By the leave 
of my good Friends, the Printers and Correctors of the Press, I would 
propose' . . . and Dryden complains of the 'false pointings' of the printers 
he 'has to answer for'. — Cf. van D.am & Stoffel: William Shake- 
speare, Prosody and Text (1900) p. 273 fl". and Chapters on English 
Printing, etc. (15^0—1700), 1902; Est. 29.440. 

- Swift's works suffered from the same arbitrary methods ot correction. 
On seeing his Trai'eh in print he laments (Sw. Let. 46) that 'it hath 
been mangled in the press, for in some parts it doth not seem of a 
piece'. — In another letter to Pope (Nov. 17, 1726) he repeats this, saying 
he 'observed several passages which appear to be patched and altered, 
and tlie style of a different sort' . . . 



XXI 

The lacts adduced above certainly give us no immediate 
information on the point whether Defoe was responsible for 
the textual differences between A and B, or not. But if one 
may take for granted that the compositors, proof-readers, etc. 
of R C played the same part as those of C G, I think one 
cannot but conjecture that much of what we find in A (and 
B) is not to be looked upon as extant in Defoe's M S. — One 
needs, moreover, only to remember Defoe's unceasing politi- 
cal activity, his businesslike way of writing" and his simply 
marvellous productivity during the time immediately subse- 
quent to the appearance of R C, to be fully persuaded that 
Defoe in his busy life had no time left for such a weary and 
time-consuming task as proof-reading, far less for superintend- 
ing the publishing of the several reprints of R C, appearing 
with hardly a month's interval between them.^ 

But if these variations cannot be ascribed to Defoe him- 
self, how are they to be explained? I think this will be 
somewhat difficult question to give a decided answer to. — 
For various reasons,^ however, the most plausible explana- 
tion seems to be that, when B was being reprinted, it was set 
up from a copy of A where the proof-readers, probably also 
the compositors, corrected most of the misprints and some 
modes of spelling, esp. such as probably corresponded with 
Defoe's MS. — The differences enumerated on page XVI ff. 
may indeed be explained in the same manner. But I think 
that the following alternative deserves consideration: that A 
was collated with, and corrected in agreement with the read- 
ings of Defoe's own M S, which for some reason or other 
had been altered in A; and it was from this revised copy 
that B was then set up. This has been one of the reasons 
for my usually giving the reading of B beside that of A. — 
A similar supposition can hardly be made, I think, to explain 
the text differences between A (B) and the third, fourth and 

' For particulars see Lee's preface in L; Ullrich p. 8 and Wright's 
l.ij'e pp. 405 — 427 containing a list of Defoe's works, 254 entries; of. also

following editions. (For dates of publication see references 
in note i, p. XXI). As far as they are concerned they may have 
an interest of their own. For the study of Defoe's language, 
however, I think they are of very doubtful value. 



Pirated Editions. 

It is quite natural that in those days, when the notions 
of copyright were most vague — if there were any at all — 
a book with such an enormous success as RC should be 
very often pirated. Thus it was once reprinted at Dublin, and 
a printer 7". Cox at tJie Amsterdam Coffee House in Lon- 
don published before August 7 a mutilated abridgment of 
the famous book. On account of this unauthorized reprint 
the legitimate publisher in an advertisement in the vSV. James's 
Post of August 7 warned the public against that issue, to 
which the printer answered in an article in The Flying 
Post of Oct. 29; the article is full of recriminations, but at all 
events it is rather valuable, as it contains a confirmation that 
Defoe is the real author of the book, a fact which later on 
was often doubted, as all the ed. only state on the title page: 
'Written by himself'^ Another protest against this illegiti- 
mate abridging of the book is found in the Preface of The 
Farther Adventures (published only twelve days after the 
issue of the fourth ed. of Part I) which he says will be in 
every way as profitable and diverting; 'and this makes the 
abridging this Work as scandalous, as it is knavish and ridi- 
culous' and goes on, almost forgetting his editorial character: 
'The Injury these Men do the Proprietor of this Work is a 
Practice all honest Men abhor; and he believes he may 
challenge them to shew the Difference between that and 
Robbing on the Highway, or Breaking open a House'. 

'If they can't shew any Difference in the Crime, they 
will find it hard to shew why there should be any Difference 
in the Punishment: And he will answer for it, that nothing 
shall be wanting on his Part, to do them Justice.' 

» Cf. L p. IX. 



Another pirated edition of the story came out in succes- 
sive numbers of a wretchedly printed periodical publication 
entitled The Original Loudon Post or Heathcofs Intelli- 
gence,^ Being a Collection of the Freshest Advices Foreign 
and Dome stick between Friday, October 7, 17 19 and Octo- 
ber 20, 1720. This is a collection consisting of the first 
leaves of each number from 125 to 289 taken out and bound 
together, containing the Life of R. C. part I and 11.^ — It is 
a very common mistake, based on the statement of the 
bibliographer Dibdin, found even in Storm p. 920, (though 
even Chalmers, and after him Wilson, have proved Dibdin's 
statement to be an error) to consider this the original edi- 
tion. As is shown above (p. XV) the genuine original of RC 
was published already on April 25, 17 19, and moreover 'The 
Farther Adi'cntiires had long been published before being 
reprinted in Heathcot's Intelligence. 



Later reprints. 

In the Preliuiinary of L the publisher tells the readers of 
his edition that 'after making a careful examination of every 
accessible reprint of importance from 17 19 down to the pre- 
sent time, great was his surprise to find that not one of the 
hundreds of so called revised editions had given the correct 
text of the Author, but had, to all appearance, copied from 
each other, adding a few variations here and there to give 
an air of originality.' 

I cannot quite decide how far this statement of the 
publisher is to be trusted, but I am sure there is much truth 
in it, judging from my own investigations in this respect. 

Both in the British Museum and in libraries here in 
Sweden I have had an opportunity of examining a very 
great number of reprints, many of them 'with illustrations' 



' A facsimile of the frontispiece is given in A. Wherry's Daniel 
Defoe (Bell's Miniature Series of Great Writers). 

' The principal interest in these leaves consists, no doubt, in their 
being the tirst serial publication in the English language. 



nitz [T]. 



and 'engravings', and all of them are alike at least in the 
one respect : tliey differ all more or less from tlie original 
edition, which no doubt arises from the fact that most mo- 
dern editions are only reprintings from reprints, so that error 
has been added to error. 

These variations do not extend to the spelling only, 
which is almost always modernized, but in many cases forms 
and expressions that the publishers may have found old- 
fashioned, have without further ado been 'corrected' or 'revised' 
to suit the modern usage of language.^ 

To these kinds of editions where, of course, there is 
not the slightest intimation given as to the high-handed way 
of changing the text of the original edition, I think one can reckon 
the editions published by CoOKE 'embellished with engrav- 
ings', London probably 1793, and another published by 
Tauchnitz in the Collection of BriiisJi Authors, Leipzig 1845 [T]- 
Ed. Tauch- In the latter edition, as in the whole collection, which 

is intended for the general public, the spelling is altogether 
modernized. Cooke, on the contrary, probably to make his 
readers believe that his text agrees with the original edition, 
has put in a capital letter or an apostrophized pret. (pa. pple.) 
form here and there^, e. g. P^/r;?/ 37.25, /zV^37. 12^, etc. etc. 

As, for the sake of brevity, I shall refer to further 
differences between A and T in my examining the text 
of R, I will here confine myself to giving some few cases, 
where Cooke and T (L and R) have altered the original text.* 

' I consider it lying outside my province to enter upon any investigation 
of the quite modernized texts of especially Geniian and Fretich school edi- 
tiofis (see Storm 658 ff.): »fur den schul- und privatgebrauch eingerichtet» 
H. Lowe, Halle 1882; — »die Sprache ist nur da geiindert, wo sie die 
grammatische Sicherheit des Schiilers zu gefahrden schien; die Formenlehre 
muss auf dieser Stufe korrect sein», Karl Foth, Leipzig 1893; — »nous 
avons du faire subir au texte original de de Foe des changements noni- 
breux« (Douglas Gibb, Paris 1892). — As an ex. of similar E/ig-/. editions 
for the use of schools, with expJa7iato7y notes» I can mention that 
published by W. and R. Chambers, L. 1884.

Another type of editions of RC may be said to be repre- 
Ed. Aitken sented by the first volume of Romances and Nai'ratives by 
Daniel Defoe, edited by G. A. AlTKEN, in sixteen vohitnes, 
L. 1895. 

This work, which, no doubt, is the only complete collec- 
tion of Defoe's romances and narratives, looks at first sight 
very trustworthy indeed, being neatly printed on very fine 
paper and adorned with really tasteful and artistic illustrations.^ 

And this good first impression of the reliability of the 
book is still more heightened by the editor's intimation that 
'great care has been bestowed upon the text', and that 'the 
first editions have been carefully followed, a course which 
was the more needful in view of the extraordinarily corrupt 
text af all the modern reprints of some of the works'. 

' 'This Library Edition (is) limited to Five Hundred Copies' at 4/6 
per volume, being now out of print, a cheaper reprint has been issued 
at 2/6 per vol. 



XXVII 

In one respect, however, he is candid enough to tell us 
that he has undertaken some corrections of the first edition, 
referring, however, only to 'Defoe's spelling and punc- 
tuation (or rather that of his printers, for he seems to have 
been too busy to correct his proof-sheets)', which, he says, are 
often erratic, and therefore 'such slight corrections as modern 
conventions render necessary have been made in these re- 
spects'. But I am sorry to say everybody would be greatly mis- 
taken and disappointed in believing that the editor, except 
for these 'slight corrections", has really 'carefully followed the 
first editions'. — The following illustrations will, I think, 
give a good idea of the real circumstances of the case. 

Sometimes he changes letters into numbers or vice 
versa, e. g: 

121.23 September the thirtieth > Sept. jo 114; 

331.20 t7uo hundred Founds Sterling > £, 200 sterling 312. 

Most of the phenomena mentioned under the heading 
Some Phonological Notes (see p. 24 ff.), and further such word- 
forms as are now more or le.ss obsolete in P E (these will 
be dealt with in Part II of this treatise) are simply corrected' 
in R. In many instances this is also applicable to L and T. 
For example: 

147.14 Africk > Africa 138; 

47.26 Amozones > Amazon 45; 

43.32 Brasiloy Brazils 41; 

62.35 hoise > hoist 59 = L 47, T 45; 

177.18 Molettay mulatto 166 = L 134, T 125; 

47.26 Oronoquey Orinoco 45; 

318.23 uninhabitated y tininhalnted 300 == T 223, etc. 

The old plurals Fathom, Foot, Mile, Pound, Turi, Year 
are always changed into the modern forms. 

Though he does not agree with T in changing jr 300.12 
into you, the two ed. coincide however in always altering 'em 
into tJiem, quite as L. — The ace. form of the rel. pron. 
who is, as far as I can see, always corrected into ichom. — 



The indefinite pronoun t'other is sometimes kept 72.31; 
242.26, 347.8; but in other cases, e. g. in. 14; 317.12 it is 
corrected into the modern the other (L, T always the other). 
The same is the case with the old pkiral form other. 

Regarding the verb forms the text of A has been sub- 
jected to the most thorough revision. I will confine myself 
to pointing out here only a comparatively small number of 
the instances which I have observed, 

25.3 he rise y rose 23 ==^ L 18, T 18; 
32.36 they run y ran 31 =L 24. T 23; 
51.35 I strook > struck 49 = L 37, T 37. 
65.10 overloaden > overladen 61 = L 50, T 46; 
97.30 was broke y broken 91: 
110.35 I di-unk y drank 104 = T 78: 
150.16 have began y begun 141 =T 106: 
277.32 he see > sees 261 = K 238; 
278.8 leaden > loaded 261 = L 209; 
2^8.26 I see y sa7v 262 = L 209, T 196; 
281.12 had took y take 265 = T 197; 
352.16 the Bear seeysees 331: etc. etc. 

It is, moreover, quite obvious that in cases where A 
and B differ, the editor's statement, that 'the first edition has 
been carefully followed', is inaccurate: in most cases, e. g. 
54.15, 109.6, 122.26, 165.34, 230.17, 241.25, 272.23, 351.10, 
etc. etc. the reading of B bas been adopted. — In all these 
instances and many others, L and T agree with R. 

* 

I now proceed to examine another kind of editions, viz 
such as are represented to be 'careful' reprints of the origi- 
nal edition. — In this category I have not found sufficient 
reason to enter upon any closer examination of such editions 
as claim either to be 'carefully compared with the original 
edition of 17 ig like the one 'illustrated in oil-colours by 
Kronheim, L. 1864', or 'carefiilly reprinted from the original 
edition' (The Household Robinson Crusoe, L. 1871), or 'Newly 



XXIX 

iditcd after the original editions, with 20 illustrations by Kajijj- 
nian (T. Fisher Unwin, L. 1884) or 'froni the Author s Edition 
17 ig, illustrated by C. Browne (Blackie, L. 1884), as the 
spelling, etc. in them has always been modernized. 

There are, however, three of these 'carefully reprinted' 
editions that I have thought fit to subject to closer exami- 
nation, among other reasons especially because Storm in his 
' Englischc Philologic p. 920 fF. gives some rather misleading 
information about them. 

Of these I will first consider The Life, etc. Noiv first Ed. Lee [li. 
correctly reprinted from the original edition of IJIQ. With 
an introduction by WiLLlAM Lee, London 1869, etc. [L]. 

As I have mentioned above, the publisher of L has 
strongly, and rightly so, criticized the reprints of RC. He is 
careful to let us know that he is not like other men, and to 
inform us of the great value and reliability of his own pub- 
lication, as compared with 'every other accessible reprint 
from 1 7 19 down to the present time', and he therefore tells 
us that 'b}- the kindness of Mr. Lee, a copy of the very valuable 
and rare first edition in two vol., 17 19, has been deposited 
with the printers during the progress of the work through 
the press, and there, in a glass case, every word and letter(!!) 
have been examined in preparing the present edition, which 
is believed to represent the only(!!) perfect text of Defoe's 
narrative since the time of its Author'. 

After these big promises, one might expect to find 
a reprint closely following 'the text of the Author'. But 
indeed, 'great is our surprize' to find that this edition is 
far less to be trusted, and to be received with much more 
suspicion than any of all those 'carefully reprinted from the 
original edition , that I have examined. 

Storm (p. 921) expresses his just indignation at L:s way 
of fulfilling his big promises, but as his statements do not 
quite agree with the facts, I shall here endeavour to show 
how matters really stand. 

As I have shown previously. Storm's review of the edi- 
tions of RC is based on the wrong hypothesis that Heatli- 
cof s Intelligence should be the first issue of the work. But 



XXX 

even if this were the case, Storm's remark that 'Lee still- 
schweigend die Schreibung durchvveg modernisiert hat' is 
misleading. It is quite true that L generally alters the 
spelling of A (and B); but in many cases he retains ortho- 
graphical peculiarities and characteristics current in printing 
in the earlier part of the i8th cent. Thus, for example, he 
sometimes leaves out the apostrophe in the genitive, but 
occasionally retains the apostrophized pret. and pa. pple. e. g: 

L loi apply'd, occurr'd, open'd. 

271 (last page) destroy'd, enter'd famish'd, master'd, per- 
form'd, renew'd, ruin'd, reservM, etc. 

One might perhaps ascribe such archaisms as these onl)/ 
to an oversight of the printer, as in most cases similar forms 
are modernized. But in my opinion they ought to be looked 
upon as a mere sham, and this supposition is still further 
confirmed by his constant use of italics and capitals, which, 
no doubt, he considered to be the cheapest and most con- 
venient way to give the uninitiated public the impression that 
the ed. is really reprinted 'every word and letter from the 
original edition of 1719. 

And his conscientiousness in these respects is so great 
that, in spite of much hunting for divergencies, I must admit 
I have not found a single one. — To alter a word in any 
other respect whatever, he never scruples; but, to leave out 
a capital — never, e. g: 

177.18 Moktta (adj.) > Mulatto (134.33);^ 300.37 Two a Clock 
> Two Clock (226.15); 23.1 A?!tient> Ancient {i"]. 4); 
302.3 Cloatli d y Clothed (227.7); 312.22 Job b y Job 

(235-10). 

In my previous review of T and R I have pointed out 
at the same time the readings of L, as far as they differ 
from A (and B). Here are further contributions to show 
L:s method of examining 'every word and letter': 

' The figures in parentliesis refer to L.

Now in Ullrich (p. 18) the following statement concerning 
L is to be found : 'Wohl die erste Ausgabe, die wirklich auf 
den Text des Originals von 17 19 zuriickgeht, was, in Ver- 
bindung mit einer wertvollen Einleitung des Defoe-Biographen 
William Lee und dem ausserst billigen Preise sie zur wei- 
tester Verbreitung empfielt . . .' In consideration of the facts 
adduced above it will at once be obvious that this remark 
must be regarded as absolutely unreliable and misleading. 

* 

The only two editions that at least approximately fulfil the 
usual, but never trustworthy, promise of being 'edited after 
the original editions' or the like, are those published by Mac- 
millan & Co. One is entitled Robinson Crusoe, edited after ^a. ciark [C]. 
the original editions by J. W. Clark, M. A., L. 1866, etc. 
[Cj. In the preface^ the editor tells us that his 'aim has been 
to reproduce faithfully the original text. The edition used 
to print from was that of 1719, but I have collated it with 
otJier editions. I have in no case modernized the spel- 
ling or phraseology. The Archaisms', he goes on, 'are 
hardly ever such as to render the meaning doubtful, even to 
the ordinary reader, and it has appeared to me likely to 
prove useful and interesting to young and old in modern 
times to have our English Classics preserved in all their inte- 
grity in popular editions such as this aims to be'. 

The other, The Globe Edition, edited after the original 
editions, witJi a biographical introduction by Henry Kings- Ed. Kggsiey 
LE\', L. 1868, etc. [K] printed like C in Cambridge by C. J. 
Clay & Son at the University Press, has exactly the same 
text as C, the former being reprinted not only page for page, 



' In K this preface is left out; instead, as will appear from tlic title, 
KiNGSLEV has written a 'Biographical Introduction' (I — XXXI), not in C. 



XXXII 

but also line for line and word for word in the same type as C. 
The only difference being that K has left out the title page 
and 'The Preface' by Defoe, which, on the other hand, is to 
be found in C. 

Now in L:s 'Prelhiiinary we read the following rather 
inappropriate, and, as is usual with L, irresponsible effusion: 
'Even the text of a late Edition in the 'Globe Library' must 
be received with some suspicion when the Editor tells us 
that he « printed from the edition of 17 19 but collated it 
with earlier editions\-i> which is all nonsense, because there are 
no editions earlier than 1719.' 

Fully aware of the fact that L:s veracity and relia- 
bility should only be received with the greatest caution, 
especially as there is no silcJi statement to be foimd in the 
'Globe Edition', I applied to the publisher, who kindly gave 
the following information : 'The statement in the edition 
in the Chandos Classics (= L) refers not to the Globe Li- 
brary, but to the Golden Treasury edition, in the first issue 
of which by a misprint the word earlier appeared instead 
of the word otJier\ which is also the reading of my edition 1899. 

In my previous textual review of T, R and L, where I 
have always pointed out the readings of all the other edi- 
tions, provided that they, in some way or other, differed 
from A (and B), the letter K is only once to be seen: page 
XXVIII. As the cases examined amount to hundreds and hun- 
dreds, this single difference from the orig. ed being the only 
one found, I think this is a fair proof of the reliability of the 
text. This careful way of reprinting is also maintained in purely 
orthographical matters, the exceedingly rare differences being 
no doubt due to an oversight of the compositor, e. g: 

deliver d (title page) > delivered; 6.17 my selj > tnyself {^.loY; 
302.3 Cloaih'd > cloatlid (259.13); 361.30 Providences 
> Providence 's (310.16). 

Amongst quite accidental over-sights (misprints?) I think 
one ought also to include 20.3 entred y enter d [ij] and 11. 16 

* The figures in parenthesis refer to K. 



XXXI II 

dt'fp loaden > deeply (9) especially as in all other cases such 
forms agree with A, as far as I can see. (Cf. 12.17 deep 
loaden -= K.) 

These slight differences may also be explained by the 
statement of the editor in the above mentioned preface to C: 
'The edition used to print from was that of 17 19 but I have 
collated it with other editions'. — In any case I have not 
thought it necessary to try to discover whether he consulted 
any other editions than A and B, or not. 

Regarding K:s (and C:s) relation to these editions at 
least, this statement of Clark's has proved applicable: in such 
instances when A and B show different readings, he follows 
in most cases B. This is especially so, when B uses the more 
modern forms and expressions as 24.8; 50.5; 54.15; 109.6; 
157.25; 166.3; 185.2; 228.9; 257.31; 314-34; 351-10. etc. 

In some cases, however, he retains the reading of B, 
though this is out of use now: e. g. ']%.'] (cf. 24.8); 213.17; 
225.8; 253.30; 345-24; 352.21, etc.; cf. p. XVI ff. 

Quite the same eclectic procedure is used with respect 
to orthographical text dififerences, of which I do not think 
it necessary to give any examples. 

Finally it remains for us to investigate if the Facsimile Re-ihe Facsimile 
print of the first edition published in 17 ig; with an introduc- 
tion by Au.STiN DOBSON, L. 1883^ really satisfies the claims 
one has on a printed work described as a facsimile. — For 
this reason I have here and there collated the facsimile with 
the editio princeps in the British Museum, and, as will appear 
from my list, the dissimilarities are surprisingly numerous, 
not only from a purely orthographical point of view, but 
also in other respects, and to such an extent as to jeopardize 
the use of the volume for linguistic purposes.

In view of these differences I wrote to the publish- 
ers for further information as to the copy used by them 
for their own production, well knowing that there was only 
a very limited number of first ed. in existence. [Even the 
famous Bodleian library at Oxford does not possess a first 
ed., the earliest in its possession being the third and fourth.] 
The reply was rather disappointing, reading as follows: 

'You may take it that our reprint of Robinson Crusoe 
1719 is an exact (!!) facsimile of the 1st Ed. in all respects. 
We cannot now remember whose copy was used in the re- 
print, for it is 24 years since issue and enquiry has been 
futile also.' 

From Mr. Austin Dobson, however, I have a very impor- 
tant written communication that will show what share he has 
in the responsibility of the inadvertencies pointed out above: 

He writes : ' The facsimile of i88j was prepared before 
I was asked to Diake an introduction to it.' 

This shows as plainly as possible that Mr. Dobson had 
nothing at all to do with the facsimile itself, and I am quite 
convinced that the same applies in estimating Lee's relation 
to L. Without controlling the assertions of the publisher, Mr. 
Lee wrote his introduction in good faith, relying upon their 
bona fides. Without this supposition it is quite unaccoun- 
table how such a learned and scrupulous student as Lee, after 
criticizing other mutilated editions rather sharply,^ could bring 
himself to lend his name to the following statement (L p. 
XVI), diverging so greatly from facts: T am able to affirm 
that the present is an exact reproduction from my own copy 
of the first edition.' 

As a final judgment of this facsimile, I think it can be 
said that it can in no way lay claim to this title. It is 
after all simply a more or less trustworthy reprint of the 
first edition, set up with special type and printed on paper 
specially prepared to suggest the original. Such a proce- 



^ 'Scarcely any work has been more mutilated by printers; and there 
is reason to doubt whether, in modern times, the original has ever been 
reprinted verbatim.' 

G. Lanneri. HI

dure cannot, I think, but be termed highly unfair which 
is not lessened by the unreasonably high price (io/6) the 
publisher sees fit to charge for it. 

The above examination of the texts of Cooke, T, R, L, 
etc., and also with due reservation of K (C) and the so 
called Facsimile will more than sufficiently show that they^ 
are in no way to be trusted and practicall}- useless from a 
linguistic point of view. — This is no special characteristic 
of the text either of Robinson Crusoe or of Defoe's works 
in general. In the British Museum I have had the oppor- 
tunity of collating a very great number of 1 8th and 19th cen- 
tury reprints with the original editions, and though I consider 
it outside the scope of my present treatise to detail the 
discrepancies in justification of my opinion, I hope the reader 
will trust my statement, that these reprints are of exactly the 
same nature as those of RC. The statements and results 
arrived at by authors like Borst, Uhrstrom, Widholm, etc. 
using such modern reprints without going to the trouble of 
comparing them with the original editions, are consequently 
more or less v^alueless. 



To conclude this section I now proceed to give a short 
survey of the differences between the texts examined. The 
following are the passages collated: 

I. A 166 = K 142, L 125, R 155, T 117. They who 
know what it is to have a Reprieve'^ brought to them upon

Introduction. 

The language of the i8th century has in its phonctical 
aspect been subjected to very careful examination; in other 
respects, however, (accidence, syntax, vocabulary, etc.) it on^'isth^cent* 
has been comparatively little investigated. — A great deal English, 
of valuable material can be gleaned by consulting NED and 
the linguistic works of Bradley, Franz, Hall, Kriiger, Stoffel, 
Sweet, and others; but there exists not a single monograph 
of any value on the subject, except the section of Storm's 
EngliscJie PJiilologie entitled 'Die Sprache des achtzehnten 
Jahrhunderts' (pp. 918 — 950), which, however, is far from 
being exhaustive. — On pp. 944 — 45 Storm mentions and 
criticizes in a few lines a couple of works dealing with 18th 
century English: Franz: Ziir Syntax des iilteren Neu-eng- 
liscJi (ESt. 17, 18), and Klapperich: Zur Sprache des Liist- 
spieldichters SJieridan, Program, Elberfeld 1892. As these 
works have already been reviewed in our leading English 
periodicals, I shall refrain from adverting to them here. 

A little paper by C. Stoffel entitled Antiquated and 
Obsolescent Phrases m the Vicar of Wakefield occurring in 
Taalstudie, which, as the author acknowledges, is 'largely drawn 
upon the admirable work of Prof. Storm', contains, as far 
as I can see, nothing new towards the study of 1 8th century 
English, beyond what has already been given by Storm. 
This paper was not reviewed by Storm, who was unable to 
procure a copy of it. 

Another, more ambitious work on i8th century English: 
Studies on the language of Samuel Richardson by W. Uhr- 
STROM (180 pp.) was published in 1907. — In the introduc- 

G. Lannert. t 



tion which consists to a great extent of quotations and bio- 
graphical items of doubtful value for the treatise, the author 
states that the object of his work is 'to show the most 
important points on which the language of Richardson's 
time dififers from modern English, as it is spoken by educated 
people of our days', and he 'ventures to hope he has suc- 
ceeded in bringing out some of the most characteristic features 
of the language of Richardson's time as compared with that 
of our own.' — For sundry reasons I do not feel inclined 
to subject this work to a detailed criticism, even though the 
points on which I have to find fault with are neither few nor 
trivial; but a few general remarks may not be out of place. 

As the texts which Mr, U. used were published 20, 40, and 
even 60 years after the original editions, we have no security 
whatever that the readings given in them are really faithful to 
those editions; cf. pp. XXV, XXXVI. — In the bibliography 
p. 5, which, as it is, is scanty enough, we find a comparatively 
large number of works of very dubious value for the purpose 
of the treatise, while, on the other hand, we look in vain 
for many of the names and works of the leading scholars 
of our day. — Furthermore Richardson's language in the 
works Mr. U. used can in no way be said to be represen- 
tative of the 'language of Richardson s time', as most people 
would understand the phrase. The author says on the very 
same page (3): 'to study the spoken^ language of his time 
we can hardly find a better source than his works' (cf. Hall 
p. 320), and he further accentuates this assertion by saying 
that Richardson's 'mode of writing' enables him 'to make 
use of certain liberties of style which otherwise would hardly 
be tolerated by the reader.' — The author has moreover 
failed to support his assertion that Richardson's language 
is exactly the same as that of his contemporaries with 
any material gathered from the authors of Richardson's 
time. 

And as to the author's 'comparison' between 'the lan- 
guage of Richardson's time' and PE, what does it after all 



' The italics are mine. 



amount to? It consists simply and solely in stating that a 
particular form, etc. found in Richardson — as to which 
he has no more illuminative information to give us than 
that it is 'often', 'sometimes', 'frequently used', 'met with' 
— does not occur in PE 'as it is spoken by educated 
people of our days'. This he has tried to show by quoting 
or referring to NED and Storm, or else by giving illustra- 
tive examples from PE novelists. On the other hand he 
fails to notice obvious instances of alternate forms, etc., such 
as pret. drunk, drank (pp. 22 — 29); is couic, has come {p. 19), etc. 
In such works as those of Klapperich (24 pp.). and Stoffel 
(8. pp.), which were written especially for pedagogical purposes, 
merely to draw the attention of their readers to certain diffe- 
rences between the language of Sheridan and Goldsmith and 
PE idiom, comments of this kind are well enough. But surely 
something more is looked for in a treatise which claims 'to 
have made some contributions to the study of the language 
of the eighteenth century'.^ 



When I first began this work, of which I regret that at My plan of 

work. 

present I can only publish the first part, it was my intention 
merely to endeavour to call attention to the points in which 
the language of RC deviates from present day standard 
English. But a study of such works as that of Mr. Uhrstrom 
on the one hand, and the views put forward, and the prin- 
ciples enunciated in the works of Elster and Ostergren, on 
the other hand, brought home to me more and more the 
unsatisfactoriness of this method of work. I saw that for a 
work of this description it was also a matter of great importance 
to endeavour to ascertain the relation in which the language 
of RC may be said to stand to that of other works both 
of Defoe and his contemporaries. And in this view I have 
been confirmed by the advice and information obligingly 
given me by eminent English scholars. With this object in 



^ Since the above remarks were printed Dr. Swaen has published a 
somewhat nusjatorv review of Mr. U:s worli in ESt. 



view I have examined, though not so minutely as RC, some 
works from the beginning of the century, viz., RC II, CS, 
MF, PY, CG, REd.; TT, Sw. Let., Ta., Sp., PC, etc. and 
I have in commenting on RC given references, as a rule in 
footnotes, to the works just mentioned. 

As regards the Hnguistic phenomena dealt with I have 
endeavoured, with regard to RC at least, to give as complete 
and exact information as possible. In cases where a complete 
list of examples of a certain linguistic phenomenon would have 
unreasonably swelled the bulk of the book, or where the 
examples are unimpeachable instances of the phenomenon 
in question I have, however, as a rule contented myself with 
giving only two or three examples, but then I have invariabh' 
added figures indicating the total number of times examples 
of this kind occur. In all other cases an exhaustive list of 
examples has been given. In cases where the language 
shows great oscillation between alternate forms and expres- 
sions, I have given the relative frequency of the alternate 
forms. In some cases I have given statistical data from 
other works as well, but as a rule I have contented myself 
with noting the occurrence of cases similar to those in RC. 
illustrating them with a few selected examples. In one or 
two instances I have ventured to mention in footnotes points 
which are quite common in works contemporary with RC, 
though it may chance that no example of them occurs in RC. 
— In cases where an author appears to be deliberately using 
archaic language, or reflecting the colloquial or vulgar speech 
of his day, I have as a rule called attention to the fact. 

To shed light on the subject from another point of view, 
that is to endeavour to show not only what was current, but 
also what was regarded as standard English by the learned 
of the time, I have given the views, statements, etc. found 
in the works of grammarians and lexicographers of the 
beginning of the i8th and the latter part of the 17th century, 
particularly Wallis. I have, however, not merely quoted their 
statements with regard to the forms etc. actually occurring 
in the works examined by me, but often also as to pheno- 
mena of a similar character. 



The general condition of the language of the latter part 
of the century, and especially the by no means inconsiderable 
modifications which the language underwent as far back as 
the 1 8th century, I have endeavoured to illustrate by giving 
statements and views brought forward by Dr. Johnson and 
Ward, as well as by giving a number of examples of the 
language of Evelina, which evidently shows that much of 
what at the beginning of the century may have been regarded 
as perfectly correct, must by this time have already sunk down 
to the lower strata of the language : the colloquial and vulgar 
style. In many respects these facts have been further backed 
up by quotations, etc. from Pegge. 

In certain cases it may perhaps be remarked that these 
grammatical notes are unnecessarily minute, or have sometimes 
not given results corresponding in value to the space they 
take up. An independent and, if possible, more detailed and 
exact examination of the existing grammars might be thought 
to have been preferable. But I regard them at any rate as 
quite as much in place in a work of this description as in a 
work dealing with the history of English sounds. Nor ought 
the novelty of my methods to diminish the value of these 
notes, as such, or of the value of the treatise in general: with 
a few exceptions these grammatical items are now brought 
before the reader for the first time and have not, as far as I 
know, been previously given in any other PE linguistic work. 

As far as comparison with PE usage is concerned, I 
have thought it fit to assign to it a subordinate place. — 
Crediting my readers with a knowledge of PE usage I have 
often contented myself with merely giving references to linguistic 
works written during the last few decades by eminent scholars 
in this department.

sentences. ,^,. 7, ,,,n ^ i 

Defoe had acquired the remarkably fluent and easy style, 

characteristic of RC, which both explains, and was the na- 
tural result of his unusual literary productiveness. As it was 
very often important for him to produce as much copy as 
possible in a very limited time, he had simply no leisure to 
pay attention to the graces of composition : he had no time 
to give conciseness to his diction, or to consider the pro- 
portions between the lengths of his sentences. His great 
verbosity, together with his predilection for long sentences 
— which often occupied from lO to 15 lines — is one of 
the most obvious features of Defoe's style. These characte- 
ristics are so salient (examples of them abound on almost 
every page) that it seems to me unnecessary to illustrate 
them by quotations. — Let us take and examine a few 
pages of the MS of CG, and we get a good idea of Defoe's 
method of composition in general, and specially his mode ot 
building up sentences. It was his practice often to insert into 
his main sentences, already of a goodly length, clauses, long 
or short, subordinate or disconnected, qualifying or ampli- 
fying the former. 



* Many of the features of the language of RC which will he pointed 
out here have previously been brought forward in most of the numerous 
Biographical Sketches and Lives of Defoe as characteristic of Defoe's 
style in general, though, to be sure, as we might expect from the character 
of those works, not with any degree of completeness. As, moreover, the 
results at which I have arrived in my comparative researches are in com- 
plete accordance with the statements made in the worlds just alluded to, 
I have not deemed it necessary to give any examples to show that Defoe's 
style in these points agrees with that of his other works. — Those who 
might wish for further particulars on the style of Defoe in general, I refer 
to the works published from Chalmers and Wilson up to Th. Wright, 
and AiTKEN (in R) and especially to Bulbrixg, to whose editions of CG 
and REd. with their valuable 'Forewords' 1 feel greatly indebted. 



Much the same impression of something added on second 
thoughts is produced by the frequent use of tacking on re- 
lative sentences introduced by and ?(>ho, and ivhich, as . . . 
'my Mother, whose Relations were named Robinson, a very 
good Family in that Country, and from zv/ioni I was called 
Robinson Kreutznaer' 1.15 — 'he had appointed to go out 
with two Moors of some Distinction in that Place, and for 
whom he had provided extraordinarily' 22.27 — 'Tho' I did 
not carry quite lOO 1. of my new gain'd Wealth, so that I 
had 200 left, and zu/uch I lodg'd with my Friend's Widow, 
yet' . . . 19.14. — 'Another lay bound which they would kill 
next ajid lohicJi fir'd all the very soul within me' 276.18 — 
'He gets his Boots off, and put on a Pair of Pumps (as we 
call the flat Shoes they wear) and ivhich he had in his Pocket' 
349.24, etc. etc. 

In many cases, when the accumulation of sentences and 
their somewhat intricate arrangement threaten to destroy the 
continuity of the narrative for the reader, Defoe tries to 
bridge over the difficulty by inserting some such expressions 
as / say, in a Word, etc., repeating the beginning of the 
long period, either with the same or a slightly varying phrase, 
such as 'I went ... I found . . . and as the few Books . . . lay 
there too, I took out one of the Bibles . . . I say, I took it 
out and' . . . 109.19-27; 326.15-21 — 'Two of the Ships which 
I had singl'd out to go in, I mean, more particularly singl'd 
out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them to 
put my things on Board, and in the other to have agreed 
with the Captain; / say two of these Ships miscarry'd, viz. 
One was taken' . . . 342.24-36 — 'To Day we love what to 
Morrow we hate . . . nay even tremble at the Apprehensions 
. . . this was exemplify'd in me (184.29) . . . / say that I should 
now tremble at the very Apprehensions' . . . 185.9 — '^ raging 
Wave, Mountain-like came rowling . . . and plainly bad us 
expect the Coup de Grace. /;/ a tvord, it took us with such 
a Fury, that' . . . 50.26 — 'I brought away . . . Rigging . . . 
Ropes and Rope-twine . . . Canvass . . . In a Word, I brought 
away all the Sails' ... 64.12-21; 64.22-34.

The joining together of sentences with as — ^^ is another 
frequently occurring method of connecting the clauses of the 
long periods. This so introducing a consequent clause, which 
may be compared with the German and Swedish so, sd in 
simular use, is now almost obsolete in PE. F'or instance, 
. . . 'and tho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as it 
was not possible she could swim till . . . so the Master con- 
tinued firing Guns 13. ii — I saw the Ship had floated and 
was driven on Shore again . . . which as it was some Com- 
fort on one hand, for seeing her sit upright and not broken 
to Pieces, I hop'd, if I might get on board, and get . . . so 
on the other hand, it renew'd my Grief at the Loss of my 
Comrades, who I imagin'd if we had all staid on board might 
have sav'd the Ship, or at least that they would not have 
been all drown'd . . . and that' . . . 81. 22-82.1 — 'As the Bear 
is . . . and does not gallop as the Wolf does, who is swift . . . 
so he has two particular Qualities, First, As to Men, who 
are not his proper Prey; / saj', not his proper Prey; because 
tho' I cannot say what Hunger might do, which was now 
their Case, the Ground being all cover'd with Snow; but as 
to Men, he does not attempt them unless they first attack 
him' 348.16-25 — Further ex: 98.1-5; 180.18-30; 185.16-28; 
291.25, etc. 

But in these extremely long periods, jotted down in the 
greatest haste, we must not be surprised that sometimes the 
strict grammatical sequence between the difl*erent clauses of 
the period is broken. The author often begins with a cer- 
tain grammatical construction, but further on in the sentence 
he either forgets the beginning of the statement, or by some 
confusion of thought caused by the complex arrangement of 
the clauses, he finds himself unable to finish the sentence as 
he first intended, and so flounders into another construction. 
Notwithstanding these loose constructions, anaco/ui/m, the 
clearness and point of the periods is never lost, so far as I 
can see. I have already had occasion to mention a couple 
of periods in which similar grammatical breaks occur. Here 
are some additional examples: 'The Master, tho' vigilent . . ., 



yet as he went in and out ... I could hear him say' . . . 
10.32-37 -=- 239.1 — 'perhaps this is all befallen us on your 
Account, like Jonah in the Ship of Tarshish' 1530 — • ■ . 'I 
consulted neither Father or Mother nor so much as sent them 
Word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, 
without asking God's Blessing . . . and in an ill Hour ... I 
went on Board a Ship' 7.5-11 — 'I took up the second Piece 
. . . and shot him into the Head, and had the Pleasure to 
see him drop, and make but little Noise, but lay struggling 
for Life' 31. 14-19 — ... 'for unless I was sure to kill every 
one that not only should be on Shore . . . but that should 
ever come on Shore afterwards, if but one of them escap'd, 
to tell . . . they would come again' 204.1-11. — 



Without the author himself being conscious of the fact. Characteristic 

^ phrases, 

his lively imagination, and the fluency of his language often 

seem to have carried him away from his proper subject. Thus 
when he wishes to return to his original train of thought 
after such a long digression, he very often does so by means 
of some connecting phrase, as: 'But this is by the Way 286. 17 
— 'But to return to my Journal' 92.32; 106.35 — ^"Jt leaving 
this Part, I return to my Journal' 113.36, etc. In other cases 
also, as for example when he passes from one section of his 
continuous narrative to another, for the sake of lucidity, he 
marks the transition by connecting phrases such as 'But I must 
first give some little Account of my self 72.6 — 'Be pleas'd 
to take a Scetch of my Figure as follows' 176.19 — 'But 
some Adventures that happen'd to us in this tedious and 
difficult Journey, I must not omit' 344.1 =--- 186.4 — 'But now 
I come to a new Scene of my Life' 181.28, etc. 

In order to excite his readers' interest beforehand he has 
a way of mentioning in a few words a subject which he after- 
wards intended to treat more fully, e. g. 'what I did ... I 
shall give a full Account of in its Place' 72.5 — 'a Dog and 
two Cats, of whose eminent History I may have occasion to 



10 

say something in its Place' 75.3; 208.9 — • • • 'as I shall say 
afterwards in its Order' 92.20 — 'as I shall observe in its Order' 
124.18 — 'as shall be observ'd' 139.31; 218.25; 330-36, etc. 
etc. On the other hand, to remind his readers of something 
which has gone before, and which he wishes to impress on 
them again, he often uses one of his favourite expressions, 
such as 'But as I said' 357.31 — 'as I have said' 201.35 

— 'As I said above' 300.35 — 'as is said above' 178.7 — 'as 
before' 300.25, etc. etc. 

And finally in order to summarize or explain, sometimes 
in order to qualify or apologize for a previous statement 
Defoe frequently makes use of phrases such as 'in short' 
45-35 — '^?-' 72.14; 137-29 — 'that is to say' 179.35 ; 253.1 1 

— 'as it were' 234.32; 237.35 — 'as I may call it' 230.20; 
232.6 — 'as I may say' 53.1 — 'as it might be said' 137.24, 
etc. etc. 

But the most common of these parenthetical expressions 
of his are the following, which, together with his very frequent 
use of the historical present, contribute perhaps more than 
anything to lend life and colour to his language, e. g. 'I go! 
says I (next line) No, No, says he 266.33 — '^'^^ comes and 
gives . . . says I . . . says he' 268.27; 'Friday looks . . . falls a 
jumping and calls out . . . says he 265.7 — 'well Xury, said I' 
27.2; 'besides, said he 37.18 etc. etc.; cf. p. 60. 

The frequent use of the nominative form who for the 
objective ivJiom, e. g. 'a Goat ndio I found' 212.30; 'wJio he 
told me of 276.20; 'ivho must we yield to' 317.16, etc.; 
Defoe's predilection for using the personal gender (cf. p. 39) 
and the relative pronoun zvho in regard to animals and 
things, and the exceedingly frequent use of the perfect infini- 
tive instead of the present infinitive, e. g. I carry'd the Kid 
over my Pale, in hopes to Jiave bred it up tame 71.32, etc. 
are further characteristic features of the language of RC 
which will be treated at length in the second part of my 
treatise. 



All these pecularities noticed above, the overlong sen- 
tences, these loose constructions often pointing to sudden 
breaks in the train of thought, these long digressions, infinite 
repetitions, and exaggerated exactness of expression, the use 
of such set phrases as 'I say', 'as above', 'says I' etc. which 
give, as it were, a more personal and original touch to Defoe's 
style, often constituting a safe means of identifying his works, 
are rather characteristic of the easy, colloquial speech than 
of the more refined, conventional, literary language, where 
the original thought is worked out and developed in a more 
grammatical and logical form. — Defoe did not trouble him- 
self to try to clothe his thoughts in the dress generally given 
to them in more serious, 'literary' language. He never aimed, 
I think, at being a stylist in the modern sense of the word, 
i. e. a literary artist who for merely aesthetic purposes takes 
pains to turn out sentences of fine rhythm and choice phras- 
ing; any elegancies of style would have been wholly wasted 
upon the audience which he adressed. He was always emi- 
nently practical, and didactic, a man of affairs and of busi- 
ness (cf. Wright: Life of D. p. 284 fi".). His great object 
was to speak clearly and forcibly, his one thought to give 
a sense of reality to his readers, to make his words do their 
work, and strike home. 

Defoe reached this goal more nearly than probably any 
other English author, by his simple, matter-of-fact, homely 
language, very often corresponding to the free and easy, 
e very-day speech. He wrote his story in the simplest possible 
way, hardly ever using a word that could puzzle even the 
meanest artisan; both learned and unlearned could understand, 
and find pleasure in it. This is no doubt one of the chief 
reasons for the never failing popularity of Robinson Crusoe. 

Defoe's own works give us very valuable information on 
this subject. Thus in the first number of the Universal Spec- 
tator (1728), containing a prospectus and an introductory 
essay on the qualifications of a good writer, he states his 
principles of composition as to 'what is required to denominate 
a good writer'. — 'The writer that strives to be useful', he 



states, 'writes to serve you, and at the same time, by an im- 
perceptible art, draws you on to be pleased^ also'. — And 
in CG (p. 219) he developes more fully his opinions of the 
characteristics of a good style. Thus he writes: 'He taught 
his pupils to write a masculine and manly stile, to write the 
most polite English ... to kno' how to suit their manner as 
well to the subject they were to write upon as to the persons 
or degrees of persons they were to write to; and all equally 
free and plain, without foolish flourishes and ridiculous flights 
of jingling bombast in stile, or dull meanesses of expression 
below the dignity of the subject or the character of the 
writer.' 

And I think it may be said that, on the whole, Defoe 
carried out quite satisfactorily in practice his theories on the 
style of a good author set forth in the above passages. 



''*m(Mi"sf' * Defoe had this much in common with his contemporary 

essayists that he addressed himself to a very heterogeneous 
circle of readers and wrote, like them, in an easy, simple and 
perspicuous style, which seems more or less closely to reflect 
the colloquial idiom of the day. However on closer exami- 
nation we shall find that at least in one respect, viz. the use of 
words of foreign extraction, there is a marked divergence 
between his own language and theirs. 

If, for instance, we compare a few numbers of Sp. and 
Ta. with similar PE works we shall find — esp. in the papers 
which were written by Addison — a much larger percentage of 
words of Romanic origin than are in common use at the present 
day, but not so many as we meet with in Dr. Johnson and 
other writers of the middle and later parts of the i8th century 
where the culmination with regard to the use of learned 
words in ordinary literary style was reached (cf. Jesp. Str. 
p. 146). — On the other hand in RC and Defoe's works as 
a whole, even in those of a more discursive and learned 
character, e. g. CG, the percentage of Romanic words is 
small in comparison with PE works. 



13 

That this is actually the case will soon be evident to 
anyone who takes the trouble to read attentiveh" some score 
of pages in any of Defoe's works. However, in order more 
thoroughly to confirm my views on this point, and in order 
to determine the proportion between words of Germanic and 
foreign (esp. Romanic) origin I have counted the words which 
occur in the first five pages of RC and CG and on pp. 200 
— 204 of PY. The result is as follows. Of 1397 words (each 
word being counted every time it occurs) in RC 1144 are 
of Germanic, 253 of Romanic origin; the few words of other 
or doubtful origin do not affect the result at all. The cor- 
responding figures in CG are 1476, 11 74, 302; in PY 1706, 
1 41 8, 288. Any comments on these figures are, I think, not 
called for. — As we see, RC has an extremely low percentage 
of words of Romanic origin. In this respect the pureh- de- 
mocratic character of RC exhibits itself perhaps more than 
in any other w^ay. In this connection it is well worth noting 
that RC and Pilgrivi s Progress, the books which English 
people have read and no doubt always will read, more than 
any others next to the Bible, are with respect to the purity 
of language from loan words unrivalled in the whole reach of 
English literature (cf. Jesp. Str. p. 130). 

Whereas the works of practically all contemporary authors 
are crowded with allusions, quotations and phrases from clas- 
sical literature, every number of Sp. and Ta., for inst,, being 
headed by a Latin or Greek quotation, we find nothing of 
the kind in RC.^ Not only this. In CG (p. 222) Defoe 
gives vent to his distinct disapproval of 'the humour or usage 
of the day, that nothing but classic reading is call'd litera- 



^In CG, the contents ol" which are of a more discursive and learned 
character, a good manv Latin phrases and quotations (as a rule printed in 
italics, which is always the case in RC with the foreign words) are met 
with, e. g. Ecce Platonis kovio 93 ; idem est non esse et non apperire 
188; Novitm Castrum 115; in ceterniim 173, etc. In PY, however, there 
occurs, as far as I can see, not a single word borrowed either trom Latin 
or any other foreign language. — Note that in PY the scene of Defoe's 
storv is laid in London.

tiire' and continues: 'It is the vanity of this perticular kind 
that has brought it into a proverb to the scandal of our 
nation, that an Englishman has his mouth full of borrow'd 
phrases, that he is alwayes borrowing other men's languages 
and quoteing other men's sentences in Latin, but saies none 
of his own; not an author writes a pamphlet, not a poet a 
coppy of verses, no, not to his mistress, tho' she knows 
nothing of the matter, but he draws a bill upon Horace or 
Virgil or some of the old chiming train, and talks as famil- 
liarly of them as if they had been brought up together' ^ And 
in a reply to Swift, who had spoken of him scornfully 
as 'an illiterate fellow, whose name I forget' he declares that 
'he had been in his time pretty well master of five languages, 
and not lost them yet, though he wrote no bill at his door, 
nor set Latin quotations on the front of his Review.'^ 

In RC the Holy Scripture is the only book Defoe quotes 
or alludes to. But then these quotations, etc. are so much 
the more frequent. And in order to .set them in relief, these 
quotations, possibly by Defoe's instructions, are generally 
printed in italics. — One or other example of archaisms, pro- 
bably due to reminiscences from the Bible, are also met with 
in RC. For instance: I sat down to my Meat with Thank- 
fulness 153.14; Lord be merciful to us, we shall all be lost, 
we shall all be tmdone 10.36; 129.12; You will meet with nothing 
but Disasters . . . till your Father's Words are fullfilled upon 
you i6.li; I did not take ... by Crying to God . . . and resting 
upon his Providence 188.35. — Whether the reflexive use of 
the perso7ial pronoun is also to be considered as due to the 
influence of the Bible (cf. Storm p. 1003) or as a colloquia- 
lism from Defoe's point of view, it is very difficult to deter- 



* Swift too was no great admirer of Greet; and Latin words, esp. in 
sermons, whicli in liis view ought to be specially simple and easy of 
comprehension. In Letters to a young clergy?iiaft^ etc. he protests against 
the clergy's use oi obscure terms which the women call 'hard words' and 
others call 'fine language', and rejoices that he has lived to see Greek 
and Latin almost entirely driven out of the pulpit.

mine, e. g. I gat iite up tlie Hill 195.18; I sat me down 
52.30; I got nic a Piece 107.13, etc. 

The divergences in the language of Defoe and his con- 
temporaries that have been pointed out above are also 
without doubt to be ascribed to some extent to the difference 
in .school teaching which fell to Defoe's lot, and to that of 
his contemporaries in general. Even in his school-days, at 
the Nonconformist academy at Newington Green, Defoe was 
already imbued with an ardent love of his mother-tongue. 
Here also the first foundation was laid of his lifelong^ feud 
against 'these Greek and Latin mongers' (CG 201) who 
entirely neglected the study of their mother-tongue, and 'lock- 
ed up all science in Greek and Latin. '^ This 'defficiency 
of education' was by no means confined to the universities;^ 
'that custome has so prevail'd at our universities that all the 
publick exercises in the schooles are perform'd in the learned 
language'. — 'To rectifye this great mistake of the schools' 
Defoe proposes to set up an academy wherein to teach 'all 
the parts of academick learning and all this in English.' 'It 
would be a happy encouraging step', he says, 'if the learned 
labours of the masters of the age were made to speak Eng- 
lish, to be levell'd to the capascities of the more unlearned 
part of man-kind'. 

The man who was first and foremost Defoe's model, and 
in many respects influenced his reformatory endeavours, was 
without doubt the 'polite and profound scholar' the Rev. 



^ Already in his Essay on Projects (1698) he suggests the foundation 
of an academy 'in Conformity to what was the Case in France to refine 
and correct the Language ... a Subject not at all less worthy the Labours 
of such a Society than the French'. 

- In CG Defoe has devoted the whole chapter pp. 184 — 231 to com- 
bating the absurd school methods prevalent in his day. 

' 'Gentlemen from the University', he says, "can hardly spell their 
mother-tongue . . . have no stile, no diction, no beauty or cadence of ex- 
pression . . . 'twould be a shame to hear one of them declaim in English' . . . 
(CG p. 198).

Charles Morton, to whom Defoe always referred with grati- 
tude (see CG p. 218). By his method of teaching very much 
contrary to the custom of the times (he both drilled his 
pupils in good English, and read his lectures in English) 
'the pupils', says Defoe, 'were made masters of the English 
tongue, and more of them excelled in that particular than 
any school at that time'. 



Borrowed 
words.' 



Latin 



French, 



As I have mentioned before, we find in RC neither allu- 
sions to nor quotations from classical literature. In some few 
cases, however, I have found him use isolated Latin words, 
which, on account of the context, were doubtless intelligible 
to the great majority of Defoe's readers. 

The following are the instances found: If I kill'd one 
Party, suppose Ten, or a Dozen, I was to kill another and 
so another, even ad infinitum, 218.4; I have been ... a Me- 
mento to those who are touched with the general Plague of 
Mankind 230.12; a daily Memora7idum 122.1 i^; I was oblig'd 
to let it (the Canoe) lye there as a Memorandum to teach 
me to be wiser next Time 161.5; the Size of it (the Periagua) 
was not answerable to . . . venturing over to the Terra Firma 
161. 17. 

As a result of the constant wars with France, English 
was by this time flooded by a large number of French words 
and phrases, and the colloquial speech, letters and periodical 
publications and pamphlets of the day especially, abounded 
with them. This influx of French words seems to have influ- 
enced Defoe just as little as the other great authors of that 
time.^ Only in one single case have I come across a French 



^ The so-called 'citatord', see Ostergren, p. 7. 

' Ta. and Sp. contain several sharp aspersions on 'the French humours' 
and 'the \'anity of the time'. I may give, by wa}' of example, the following 
quotation from Sp.165, containing, besides specimens of hard Words and dark 
Expressions', a letter, 'very modishly chequered with this Modern Military 
Eloquence': — 'I have often wished, that as in our Constitution there are 
several Persons whose Business it is to watch over our Laws . . . certain 
Men might be set apart, as Super-intendants of our Language, to hinder

phrase of this kind: the Wave bad us expect the Coup de 
Grace 50.27. 

A similar use of a Dutch expression occurs only in the Dutch, 
following sentence: the sea went dreadful high . . . and might 
well be call'd Dai wild Zee, as the Dutch Call the Sea 
in a Storm 49.36. 

The few Spanish and Italian words which occur are, I Spanish and 

, Italian. 

think, only to be regarded as one of Defoe s many attempts 
to give an air of verisimilitude and local colour to the style, 
e. g. Seignior Inglese, says he 40.33; . . . and \\QS^\A,Espag- 
niole . . . Seignor, said I, with as much Spanish as I could 
make up 279.5, 9; I made my Escape in the Barco-Longo, from 
among the Moors of Sallee 330.17; the Ingenio, so they 
call'd the Sugar-House 334.7, 19 etc.; I wrote . . . desiring the 
good Padres Prayers for me 341.28; my whole Army . . . viz. my 
self Generalissinw 316.33. 

We must, no doubt, regard from the same point of view Negro English, 
the language which Defoe puts in the mouth of his man 
Friday and the young Moor Xury 'who spoke such English 
by conversing with us Slaves' (RC p. 27). Here I shall only 
give a few examples of Defoe's attempts at representing Negro 
English: Two Canoe 255.34; Wild Mans 28.22; 254.7; me 
shakee te Hand 349.8; me speakee wit you 349.33; ugly 
Dog eat all up self 283.10; He eat me at one Mouth 30.35; 
much enough Vittle 267.35, etc., etc. — The main interest 
of this language lies, no doubt, in the fact that it is one of 
the earliest, if not the earliest, attempts to represent in fiction 
the speech of the savage. 



any Words of Foreign Coin from passing among us; and in particular to 
prohibit any French Phrases from becoming Current in this Kingdom, 
when those of our own Stamp are altogether as valuable. The present 
War has so adulterated our Tongue with strange Words, that it would 
be impossible for one of our Great Grandfathers to know what his Poste- 
rity have been doing, were he to read their Exploits in a Modern News- 
Paper.'

Archaism of Stomi is probably the first to draw attention to the 

language. * -' 

mistake that the language of the classical authors of the i8th 
century was regarded as an unrivalled model of correct Eng- 
lish, even from a PE point of view. ^ 'Die klassischen Werke 
aus dem 18. Jh.', he says (p. 652), 'sind alle sprachlich mehr 
oder weniger veraltet; es wiirde lacherlich sein, sich wic 
Defoe, Swift, Johnson, Goldsmith auszudriicken. Die klassi- 
sche Sprachform ist nicht mehr dieselbe. Gerade der Ro- 
binson wimmelt von Archaismen.' — As we see, Storm in 
this respect singles out especially the language of RC, and he 
is by no means alone in this view. It is a very widely 
diffused notion, the truth of which, as far as I know, has 
never been questioned, that the language of RC is more 
archaic than that of his contemporary authors, or even that of 
Defoe's other works, but I have been unable to discover who 
is the prime originator of this idea. In the great biographers 
of Defoe from Chalmers and Wilson down to Wright and 
Aitken, who I suppose must be regarded as well acquainted 
with the English of the beginning of the iSth century, 
there is, as far as I can see, nothing which can serve in the 
least to bear out an idea of this kind. In Shaw,^ how- 
ever, we find the following passage p. 335: 'Defoe's object 
was not to instruct (!) but to amuse, to captivate, that myster- 
ious faculty by which we identify ourselves with imaginary 
events, and this the most successfully he did by imitating 
not only the plain, straight forward unaffected narratives of 
the old navigators, but their simple idiomatic unadorned 
diction.' 

This view which has no authority whatever to support 
it must, when weighed against the views of later historians 
of literature, be regarded as a mere fancy. — That the mo- 
dern annotated school-editions of RC should reproduce this 
unfounded statement of Shaw's, merely remodelling it and 



' Cf. Stoffel VW and Est. 17.280. 

- Thomas Shaw, A History of English Literatia-e, i6th ed. 1887, 
cd. bv W. Smith. — The passage quoted is no doubt to be found in earlier 
editions also.

commenting upon it each after their own fashion, ought not to 
occasion very much surprise. But it is rather astonishing 
that Storm (p. 932) on the basis of this apparently loose 
statement can found his assertion that: 'Defoe scheint in 
seinem Robinson geflissentlich die altertiimliche Sprache der 
alten Entdecker nachgeahmt zu haben; er steht hier auf dem 
iJbergang vom 17. zum 18. Jh.; in seinen iibrigen Schriften 
ist sein Styl moderner'. 

As we have seen both Shaw and Storm declare that 
Defoe imitated the language of the old navigators, but they 
are both equally careful not to give us any inkling which of 
the 'old navigators' are intended. For my own part I have 
not succeeded in discovering these models of his, nor 
have I been able to find anything which could give even a 
shadow of support to Storm's talk about deliberate imitation 
(Cf. the opinions of Aitken and Dobson quoted below). The 
untenableness of the statement thrown out by Shaw seems 
also to have been realized by Hamilton Thompson, who, in 
the 1 90 1 edition of Shaw's works prepared by him, has found 
it advisable to omit the above quoted passage. 

That Defoe during his eventful life both at home and 
abroad hobnobbed with a great number of 'travellers, voiagers, 
surveyors, soldiers', etc. (CG p. 226) and that he was well 
read in the narratives of the contemporary navigators and 
travellers, etc. is a well known and recognized fact. That, 
on the other hand, he read the adventures of some of the 
'old navigators' — by this phrase we should understand first 
and foremost the old navigators of the i6th and early 17th 
century — I consider very improbable and at any rate in no way 
proved. The contemporary literature was too well supplied 
with descriptions of voyages and romances of adventure both 
by land and sea. There he found without doubt sufficient 
food both for his desire for knowledge and his imagination,^ 

' In CG p. 225 fl". Defoe tells us the delight that the readmg of simi- 
lar books and essays gave him; besides — and this is for us the most 
important point — he gives us an exact description of how he read them 
and gathered his material, namelv with a map or a chart before him. — 'If 



and did not require to grope about in musty old books to 
seek for models in any respect. He was too practical, and 
his time was too much occupied for him to concern himself 
with such trifles as imitating the style of works he had read. 

Further, as regards Storm's second statement 'in seinen 
iibrigen Schriften ist sein Styl moderner' I cannot see that 
a greater value ought to be attached to it than to his opinion 
as to Defoe's relation to the old navigators. Although I 
have not considered it necessary to give as numerous illu- 
strations out of, e. g. PY (MF, CS) and CG as from RC. 
nevertheless the examples I have selected from very rich 
collections are, I think, sufficient to disprove a statement of 
this kind. 

On the other hand, as regards the language of the con- 
temporary authors, and especially in the works out of which 
illustrative examples have been quoted here, my studies on the 
subject have not, I consider, been sufficiently deep to warrant 
my expressing any conclusive judgment for the present. In one 
respect, however, namely with regard to accidence in a strict 
sense, the researches which have been made in this depart- 
ment may have tended to show that the language of RC cannot 
be said to possess any more archaic character than that of con- 
temporary works of fiction. In certain cases these works 
actually show even greater divergences from PE than RC. 



By way of concluding this section and the whole of 
my introduction I consider it desirable to quote with due 

he has not travell'd in his vouth ... he may make the tour of the \vorld 
in books. He mav travell by land with the historian, by sea with the 
navigators. He may go round the globe with Dampier and Rogers, 
and kno' a thousand times more by doing it than all tliose illiterate 
sailors . . . those kno' but every man his share, and that shar but httle . . . 
But he receives the idea of the whole at one view. The studious geo- 
grapher and the well read historian travells with not this or that navi- 
gator or traveller ... but he keeps them all company... 



reservation some opinions which Mr. Aitken and Mr. Dob- 
son, probably two of the leading authorities of the present 
day on Defoe and Defoe's language, have been obliging 
enough to send to me privately. — Mr. Aitken writes: 
'I do not think that there is any foundation for the statement 
in Shaw's book which you quote. The 'old navigators' were 
not remarkable for idiomatic diction, and Defoe wrote simply 
in his own natural style, as you will see by comparing 'Ro- 
binson Crusoe' with such books as 'Religious Courtship' or 
'Moll Flanders.' — 'Robinson Crusoe' is not, in my opinion, 
more archaic in language than Defoe's other works, or than 
the writings of Defoe's contemporaries. Defoe did not write 
in a dialect, but he used in his works the current speech of 
the people more unhesitatingly than Addison or Swift. He 
was fond of colloquial expressions («'tis» for «it is», etc.) and 
he used fewer words of classical origin. Naturally the language 
in political treatises is stiffer and more 'literary' than that in 
a story written in the first person, and intended for a wide 
audience. The colloquial expressions of the day are to be 
found in plays and in such a book as Swift's 'Journal to 
Stella' — letters not written for publication — or in Swift's 
'Genteel Conversation' which is in the form of dialogue. 
Simple diction was of course eminently fitting in a book 
which purports to be by an unlearned man like Crusoe.' 

Mr. Dobson says: 'In reply to your guesses ... I do not 
think that Defoe troubled himself about imitating the written 
style of the old navigators. He wrote in his own plain Eng- 
lish — nothing more. — Of course, Defoe, as a realist, used 
seafaring terms and endeavoured to get the to7ie of the old 
navigators; but I do not think he went out of his way to 
mimic their phraseology'. 



Orthography. 

As late as in the early part of the i8th century there 
still prevailed very great negligence and confusion in spel- 
ling matters, which in those days, in contrast to our times, 
were often looked upon as trifles not worth considering. 
This state of things is always reflected and often deeply 
lamented in the dictionaries, the grammars, and numerous 
spelling-books, etc. of the time published to regulate and 
settle the spelling. Even the great essayists Addison and 
Swift express, e. g. in Sp. 105, 135, etc., Ta. 230, Sw. 
Prop. p. 16, and PC p. 360 their indignation at the wretched, 
inconsistent orthography of their day, and especially at the 
phonetic spelling then in vogue 'among our English Writers 
whose usual Pretence is. That they spell as they speak (Ta. 
230; cf. p. 27). But the one who most sharply criticizes the 
wretched spelling is Defoe, who, esp. in CG (e. g. p. 120 
and XXIII) incessantly points out and scoff's at the igno- 
rance in this respect then existing, esp. among the nobility 
and gentry. 

In view of this one cannot, on comparing Defoe's MSS 
on the one hand, with Steele's and Swift's on the other, but 
be very much surprised at finding that especially Defoe in 
his MSS by his negligent and faulty spelling lays himself 
open to criticism, perhaps even to a greater extent than 
any of his contemporaries; cf. p. XIX and 84. To include 
here the rather ample material upon which the above state- 
ment is based might possibly be of a certain amount of in- 
terest; but I consider this hardly suitable. 

On page XIX I called, on the one hand, attention to a few 
instances in which the spelling in CG and RC differ; on the 



23 

other hand I pointed out that the orthography in RC does 
not on the whole seem to differ from the accepted style 
of the time, such as it appears from the printed works of 
the period. Neither did I consider it necessary to prove 
this assertion of mine in the latter case. The examples 
quoted from the works examined by me, the spelling of which 
has always been retained, might in this case be quite suffi- 
cient to prove the real circumstances. Any more detailed 
statement concerning orthography in general must, in my 
opinion, be considered of rather doubtful value for a treatise 
of this nature. The above general remarks may therefore 
be taken as quite sufficient. — ■ Those who desire to have a 
more detailed statement concerning the conditions of spelling 
in Defoe's time I refer specially to the works of Ellis, Sweet, 
Biilbring (CG), Ekwall. and Horn, in which most of the points 
here in question are touched upon. And finally to a work 
by F. Schnaar: Die Englische OrtlwgrapJiic scit Shakespeare 
(1907), which, in spite of its many inaccuracies, gives us a 
very good idea of the confusion in the spelling of the time. 
— In the second half of the century, however, matters assume 
quite a different aspect: Dr. Johnson tells us in his dictionary 
that he has been adjusting 'the orthography which has been 
to this time unsettled and fortuitous', and the fact is that 
JDict. brought about uniformity out of the previous confusion 
in spelling and gave the stamp of authority to the prevalent 
habits of the London printers, and only now can one truly 
say that a standard orthography has been arrived at. 



Some Phonological Notes. 

In this connection I will only point out a few cases of 
syncope and aphaeresis which seem to have been of very 
frequent occurrence in the early part of the i8th century. — 
In the first place this applies to the very numerous cases of 
syncope before the consonants /, «, r (esp. in verbs ending 
in -el, -en, -er) occurring side by side with the unsyncopated 
ones to much the same extent in all the printed works of 
the time. In poetry the syncopated forms seem to be even 
at the very least just as common as the full ones. 

In Defoe's MSS such forms (esp. regarding substantives 
and adjectives) are even more frequently met with than in 
his printed works, which may no doubt be laid to the printer's 
charge. This suppo-sition is, I think, also confirmed by the 
fact that B has very often changed the syncopated forms in 
A in agreement with PE use : 

fastned (4)^ 347.1; freshning 166.7; hardned(2) 103.15; 
heartned 273.17; heartning 187. 1 1; shortned 36.27; straitned 
12037; thickned 190.17, 21; - — oftner (3) 21.21. — fastned

wandred 206.8; wandring (7) 43.13; wondring 307.8. —

' The figures in brackets indicate the number of times a certain 
form quoted occurs. 

' The forms in italics are in B the same as tlie PE forms. 
' PY abounds with similar ex. 



25 

The existence of such pronunciations with the e synco- 
pated is confirmed by the statements of contemporary gram- 
marians, e. g, Jones (see Ekvvall p. CCLII) and Maittairc p. 
25. — The author of Observations expresses his decided 
disapproval of these syncopated forms which are styled as 
a 'poets' abbreviating license inexcusable in Prose'. 



Words that occur fairly frequently in the sentence in a 
weak stressed position are often liable to a reduction and to 
be contracted with other words of stronger stress. The same 
as in PE, such contractions (esp. of pronouns and auxiliaries) 
were very common in Defoe's time to denote spoken langu- 
age, e. g:^ 



CG brightn'd 161; enlightn'd 173; lessning 255; threatning (2) 249;

254; remembred 71; thundring 106; wandred (2) 117; wandring 243; watring 
44; wondred 102. 

It is a particularly noteworthy fact that Swift in his own MSS 
(Sw. Let.) uses such contracted forms e. g: endeavrd 31; entring 51; hindred 
(2) 17; squandring 41; tattred 47. 

Sp. listned 56.3; listning 454.6; softned 121. 2; streightned (3) 68.1;

t/ie7'c's your Ship 323.24, etc. etc. 

Note: All these passages are printed in italics to denote spoken 
language, as was the custom in those davs. 

But yet there is a very striking difiference between PE 
and the English of the early i8th century; we find such 
contracted forms practically in all styles of writing: in essays, 
in the prose of the ordinary novel, and even in the stiff style 
of the grammars. ^ — Thus RC, the same as other contem- 
porary works, teems with such forms as the following even 
in the ordinary narrative: 

'tis certain 207.35; 275.11; 'twas my Duty 185.33; 305.2; 
'Tivas to me as... 228.31; 'twas (B it was) Ten Thousand 
183.15, etc. — you don't 348.26; he won't 348,30, etc. 

Note: The form it's, commonly used in colloquial PE practically 
never occurs in the works from the first half of the iStli centurv. I 
came across this form onlv once, CG p. 139: Look Ye, Sir, //'.c no matter 
what . . . 

Similar contractions which first in the 17th century and 
probably only in the last decades of it came into fairly 
current use in literature, had become, as hinted above, quite 
fashionable at the beginning of the i8th century; cf. Dietze 
p. 43 and NED. Only a couple of authors express a decided 
disapproval of them. In Ta. 230, in 'a Copy of a Letter 
from a most accomplished Person' SwiFT gives us a long 
list of 'the false Refinements of Twenty Years past', which 
he doubts any 'Man of Wit who died forty Years ago' would 
be able either to read or far less to understand. And in 

^ CG 'tis 94; 'twas II, 1 30; Twould 94, 123; tJiafs past and cari t

'tis i^,i(): you' tt 10, 11, etc. — Brigutlanu always 'tis.

Svv. Prop, he abuses the poets of the Restoration that spoiled 
the EngHsh tongue by introducing 'that barbarous custom of 
abbreviating words'. Besides that he is utterly offended with 
the 'foolish Opinion advanced of late Years that we ought 
to spell exactly as we speak' which among other things 
'would utterly destroy our Etymology and entirely confound 
Orthography'.^ — These opinions by 'one of the greatest 
Geniuses this Age has produced' (Sp. 135) are subsequently 
only repeated and further commented upon by Addison 
'communicating to the Publick his Speculations upon the 
English Tongue' (Sp. 135); furthermore in the introduction 
of PC and also by the author of Observations . (Cf pp. 22 
and 93).^

Swift on 'barbarous contractions', lie constantly tell into that error in his 
private letters to Stella.

Accidence. 

I. The indefinite article. 

Quite as in the 17th cent., there was still at the beginning 
of tlie 1 8th cent, great irregularity and uncertainty prevailing 
as to the use of the indefinite article a, an before a word 
beginning with //, or in certain cases, a vowel: eii.u, o. 

Ben Jonson states (p. 74) that 'A gooth before Words 
beginning with consonants; and before all vowells, (diphthongs, 
whose first letter is Y. or W. excepted) it is turn'd into an: 
an eville turne, a good turne. So may it also before h: 
an high heart.' ^ 

By the beginning of the l8th cent., however, when the 
aspiration of // seems to have become more audible (see 
note I below), the grammarians are in general beginning to 
decree before what words beginning with h a or an respecti- 
vely should be used. Thus JONES says (p. 20) that \i is written 
before Words that begin with a Consonant, an . . . before a 
Vowel or the Sound of a Vowel, as an herb, an hour, wherein 
the h is not sounded: But you must write a where 'tis 
sounded, as a hat, a hen . Cf. Ekwall p. CCXXX ff. 

Many of his words where h is apt to be mute (Jones p. 
57) are enumerated in Lediard p. 131: 'In folgenden Wor- 



^ This is probably the passage S. Johnsox has in his mind writing 
in his Diet: 'Grammarians of the last age direct, that a7i should be used 
before h (whence it appears that the English anciently aspirated less)'. 
Cf. also VoDoz p. 91. 



29 

tern ist das H. stumm und wird gar nicht gehort : hcir^ hoiicst, 
honour, hospital, hostler, hostile, hour, huvible, Jiuniour, Hum- 
phrey} N. P., und in ihren Derivativen und Compositis. Jedoch 
in Hereditary wird das // von einigen prononcirt. Herb: 
(Kraut) wird von einigen Erb, von anderen aber Hyerb (in 
einem Klang) ausgesprochen.' 

Greenwoc^d (p. 78) seems, if he really means what he 
says, to hold the same opinion as to the use of an, before 
vowels, as will appear from many of my instances {an Euro- 
pean, such a]i one, etc.) quoted below : 'when the Substantive 
begins with a vowel or Ji,^ then we write an instead of a, 
if the // be sounded; as an Eye, an Hour; but a Hare, a 
Hand, an Habit or a Habit' 

I now pass to my examples. — Before words of 
Germa7tic origin a is the usual form: a Hammer 23.33; ^ 
hand 22.15; ^ Hammock (origin uncertain) 69.18, etc. ■ — 
Before half and hundred the use varies, ajt half being found 
twice 296.13, 15, a half {onr txvaes: 68.22, 30; 69.31; 99.30. — 
With hundred a and aji are equally frequent, seven of 
each, e. g. an hundred Pounds 340.19; 73.6, etc; a hundred 
fold 339.4; 100 Lights (B a hundred) 211.20. — An Horn is 
met with once 60.33. 

Before words of Romanic origin we find a used before 
Habitation 191. 12, Hatchet 23.33; horrible 76.24; Hypocrite 
133-37; — before honest 18. 11, Hour (some fifteen times, e. g. 
94.26), and humble 244.8 only an is used. 

In one case half an Hour 282.23 an is altered to a in B. 
(In Ta. and Sp. an is, as far as I can see, the only occurring 
form before similar words. But even before words of Ger- 
manic origin a)i is by far the most frequent). 

Before words beginning with a voivel: eu as an European 

' The same words are given by S. Johnson except Hiiiiipln-ey, 
Hcreditaty ; 

'-' sounded softly is added by Ward p. 103. 



3° 

42.20; 243-25; 276.26 {ti as ati universal, ex. below ^) an is 
the only form occurring in all contemporary works. 

Particularly noteworthy is the form of the indefinite ar- 
ticle before o)t(\ While in RC we only meet with a one, 
^- g- 9-34; 149-23; 270.35, the form a7i is almost the rule 
in Sp. This phenomenon may possibly be put down to the 
arbitrariness of the printer, who just put in the an before the 
vowel without enquiring whether the voiuel sigji also repre- 
sented the itoxvcl sound or not. (cf. ESt. 17.281). But an- 
other explanation which seems to me much more probable 
is the following. In the early 1 8th century, or possibly shortly 
before, these and similar words were as a rule pronounced 
with a vowel (diphthong) and not a consonantal sound as in 
PE. (For further particulars I refer to Ekwall, Horn and 
NED). - The fact that Defoe in CG almost in the same line 
uses both a and an before one may be explained as due to 
the fact that the pronunciation of one was not yet settled.

unsettled use of it, an before an unaccented H.

Concerning the use of a, a?! in RC and CG, REd. there 
is one thing I think well worth calling attention to. While 
in RC the instances of c7)i used contrary to modern usage 
amount to no less than fouvtccn, in CG I have not been 
able to find more than tivo (and these 'before a vowel'); in 
REd. not a single one. 

As these last mentioned works are with some few trifling 
exceptions accurate reproductions of the original MSS, I be- 
lieve the inference, that many or most cases where an is 
used in Re are due to the printer, and not to Defoe himself, 
ought not to be considered as a very bold one. 



II. Substantives. 
A. Plural of Substantives. 

1. 

Some Substantives denoting ]ncasurc, weight, time and 
nuuiber: Fathom, Foot, Mile, Pound, Tun and Year; 
Dozen and Pair, are very often unchanged in the plural 
when preceded by a cardinal number. 

As a rule these plural forms, that are mainly a relic from 
older stages of the language (see, e. g. Sweet p. 311), were 
still rather commonly occurring in the great authors of the 
17th century, as Shakespeare and Bunyan.^ 



^ See Schmidt Sh. Lex.; Sattler ESt. 16.39 ff- "^^'^ ^ gieat many exam- 
ples also from modern autliors, where statistics of the forms occurring will 
be found; also Franz p. 28 and 7«aA7;/i7';> VI. 92 ff. where Prof Ten Brug- 
GE\XATE in a little paper On the Plural of Substantives in Englisli 
gives many interesting views and examples (esp. from Sh.) of the use in 
modern English of words like the above mentioned. — For MnE usage 



With the exception o{ Fathom, Foot^ and Tim, that only 
occur unchanged in the plural, [Foot, some 20 examples, 
FatJiom and Tun only those quoted) the plural forms in s 
are predominant, Miles and Years being found 15 and about 
40 times resp., while of Mile and Year I have only come 
across 4 and 2 examples respectively. The frequency of Pound 
is almost as great at that of Pounds (8 to 10): 

Forty-five Fathom of Land 149.8. 

Two Foot Diameter 145.9; Twenty Foot Deep 15 1.6; 
Five /77(?/ and a Half 68.22, etc. 

A distance of about two AFle 214.36; 173.21; three 
Mile 167,24; it was ten Mile about 173.23, etc. — Two 
Miles 115.10; near an hundred Miles 30.7: 150 Miles So\.\\.h 
of Sallee 26.14. 

Five or six Found 24.9; the other hundred /<?z/;;^ 45.12 : 
two Found of Tobacco 325.15; two /'<;'//«</ of Powder 84.30; 
228.26; 212.20; six Found of Gun-Powder 199.21; I had 
near sixty Found of Powder 212.16 — this Hundred Founds 
41.30; four thousand Founds Sterling 45.15: 4 Founds of 
Powder 227.22. 

Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen 46.19. 

I went on Board in an evil Hour, being the same Day 
eight Year that I went from my Father 46.15; I had my 
Life saved 26 Year (B Years) after 157.25 — all this (B 
the) two Years 230.2, etc." 



see also Fr. Di.\l. 221 fF; Storm 777; Sweet I. 316; Wright 263; also 
Reusch who has collected a considerable number of plurals like hour, lueek, 
shilling, etc. from Dickens, Bret Harte and Tro/tope. 

^ The Plural form Fcets 278.34 (B Feet) must no doubt be looked 
upon as an oversight onl}'. 

'^ CS Twenty six Fathom water 13. 

PY Two Bushel of Wheat 168; 200 Ch aider of Coals 255 ; (in another 
ex. quoted in NED, Defoe uses the pi. form Chalders); They continued 
this wretched Course three or four Day after this 80 ; Forty Foot (always ) 
71; Some got five Found 39; She lay in the Garret four Stojy high 62 
he liv'd above 20 Year 105; three Year after the Plague was ceased 267. 
MF She was twelve Year a Thief (from the title page). 



33 

Though in CG the proportion between pound and 
pounds seems to be much the same as in RC, the occurrence 
of the plural form year in CG and REd. (only 2 ex. in 



REd, CG — Qiiite as in RC the unchanged plural forms /£>?/««', v^ar 
only occur after cardinals: 

at the end of viany yeairs (I think it was 5 yea}-) CG 15^. 

Li REd. no instances of pound-pounds are to be found. 

In CG I have counted 8 plurals poufid to 10 pounds: 

how many thousand pounds do they come to 139; an hundred 
pounds a year 213; one thousand pound a. year 65; 400 /(?«;/fl^ fortune 258. 

On page 266 within ten lines there occur three instances of pounds: 
'thirty thousand potoids ; four hundred pounds; twelv thousand pounds' ; 
and one of pound : 'three hundred thousand pound', which will clearly 
show the promiscuous use of the forms. 

As to the relative use of year and years, the form year is in CG by 
far the commoner, 15 year to only \q years {yeares')\)^\xi% found, — In REd. 
they seem to be equally divided: 7 of each, e. g. 

CG 30 years later loi; those 4 yeares and half 207; a hundred 
yeares before 224; — for seaven j/^ar 205; iowr year and a half 212; 13 
year old XVI; at \'i year old 269. 

REd. at 6 yeares of age 57; \oo yeares after 9; — he was king six and 
fifty year 23; a child abov 5 year old 41; he came to the crown at 
IX year old 23. 

TT Two Foot 142 = Sw. Let. 21 : 18 Foot; Three Story high 103; 
five Miles 41; 

Steele: Letter to Prue, Aug. 20th 1708: 'I have paid Mr. Addison his 
whole thousand pound' — some few lines further below: 'the afternoon 
coach shall bring you ten pounds' . 

Sp. Five Foot 529.6= Ta. 102.5; Four Foot 79.1; Fourscore Pound 
274.3 (in a letter from a bawd);. 

In PC pounds, years, etc. are practically the only forms occurring 
the plural form pound being only found a single time: 

a hundred pound 392. 

In Ev. where in so many other respects we find specimens of the 
colloquial and vulgar language after the middle of the i8th cent. I have, in 
spite of much hunting for such forms, not been able to trace a single 
unchanged plural.

RC as in PY) is very great, though it seems the language, in 
which the forms are to be found, is in no way intended to 
represent any special style. 

On account of the great dissimilarity existing as regards 
the occurrence of the plural year in RC and PY on the one 
hand, and CG and REd. on the other, whose texts were 
edited some years ago with but few immaterial changes, 
after Defoe's MSS, I think the supposition that the printer 
not considering these forms as quite good English changed 
them without any further ado into years (cf. 157.25: 26 
Year > B years) should not be received as an out-of-the-way 
inference. 

Dozen and Pair always occur unchanged in the plural:^ 

two Dozen of my Loaves 224.17; 158.8, etc. 
I found two pair more 229.2; two Pair of Gloves 
325.24; 228.33, etc. 

All other similar substantives belonging to this category 
take JT in the plural: 

80 Barrels 293.22; two Bushels of Rice two Biishels . . . 
and half af Barley 138.14; six Days 9.28; two Furlongs 
353.34; six Gallons of Rack 57.29; three Hours 27.12; 
three Leagues 61.4; eight Minutes 93.29; three Afonths 40.31; 
9 Ounces 18.33; three Runlets of Rum 64.27; an Hundred 
Yards 68.6, etc. 



The grammars I have examined give very little information 
about these plurals. Wallis is absolutely silent concerning 
them. Lediard (p. 312) gives the double plurals oi Pound, 



^ Those who want to have some special information on PE use, 
which is still far from settled, I refer to Jesp. Str. p. 190; Poutsma 
190 ff, and Sattler: ESt. 16.39 ff- Besides NED and Taalsttidie VI. 
95, who all (esp. Sattler) by a great multitude of instances taken from 
modem authors, show how matters stand at present. 



35 

Mile and Tun side by side with each other: 'Pound and 
Pounds, Ppiinde, Mile and Miles, Meilen, Tun and 7'uns, 
Tonnen , while GREENWOOD (p. 60) advances as his opinion 
that Fish, Mile are 'rather ill speaking; Ten pound is good 
English upon the old foot — — — But ten pounds is better 
English upon the modern analogy'. 

Arnold (p. 32) Voti dem Nuuiero Pluvali says that 
'einige Worte werden in beyden Numeris gebrauchet als Sheep, 
. . . People; ingleichen Pair, Pound, Mile, Foot [Fuszvolk- 
Fuszvdlker), etc. 'Davon diese 12 letzten auch die Endung 
des Plur. annehmen'. But on page ']'] Voni Accusativo in 
denoting measure, etc. he gives six Foot long; two Fathom 
deep; fifty Years old; seven Leags distant; eight Shillings; 
and in examples on the use of the prepositions (pp. 109, 
no): over ttvo Month; ^oo Pound. 

As one would expect, Johnson in his grammar has as 
little to say on the subject as Wallis. In his Dictionary, 
however, he quotes; three mile (Sh.); thousand Pound, sum of 
money (Peacham) ; fathoms and tuns only; about year he calls 
attention to its being used plurally without a plural termina- 
tion (ex. from Sh.) and informs us on foot that, when it 
signifies measure, it has often, but 'vitiously, foot in the 
plural. One of his contemporaries — WARD — mentions 
(p. 341) in connection with deer, sheep, etc. that 'Pound is 
also used as a plural in the expressions ten, twenty, an 
hundred pound! 



2. 

Some substantives, when used in a collective^ sense 
often remain unchanged in the plural, such as acquaintance. 



^ After cardinals the inflected form in -s is practically the only one 
occurring : 

I also loaded my Pistols with about four Bullets each 200.37; Six large 
Candles 21 1.9; My two broken Oars 60.16; Two Pistols k'if.T^b, etc.; cf. Shot. 



36 

ball, bullet, cannon, shot, pistol, oar, bisket, rusk, 
candle, provision, tortoise, turtle.^ 

I concluded I should make some Acquaintance, or find 
some Relations 341.16; I had not many Relations nor had 
I contracted much Acquaintance 362.3. 
Note. In some cases it is very difficult to determine whether 

Acquaintance is to be looked upon as used in a collective sense or 

whether is has a purely abstract signification. 

The collectiv^e form is by far the commoner, the plural 
form in s being only once met with : 

Among all my Relations, or Acquaintances, I could not 
pitch upon one 340.28; 

They had neither Powder or Ball. 289. I3; eight Charges 
of Powder and Ball 294.32; here are three Muskets with 
Powder and Ball 303.30; 

No instance of Balls found. 

I let him into the Mystery of Gunpowder and Bullet 
263.13; I gave Friday a Bag with Powder and Bullet 274.35. 

In all other (6) cases only Bullets, e. g: 

two Barrels of Musquet Bullets 62.3 1; as big as Pistol 
Bullets 273.37, 

Cannon and SJwt never occur with plural inflection, the 
latter not even after a cardinal: 



* PY they were able to supply with cliaritable Proinston the Wants 
of many Thousands 257; and perhaps to get their Substinence going about 
for Provision the Infection got in among them 133; — what quantity of 
Provisions will you send us 159, 69; 92, 93. 

But we have no Acquaintance, no Friends 143 ; they . . . having no 
Acquainta?tce or Relations to fly to, were fled further 163; 

TT Send as many of your Acquaintatice as you will 186. 

Sp. She is impertinently Blunt to all her Acquaintance 79.9. This 
Declaration was followed bv my being denied to all my Acquaintance 21 2.1. 



37 

I loaded all my Cannon . . . that is to say my Muskets . . . 
all my Pistols 215.18; — I was loath to spend our last Shot 
too hastily 357.27; They had so well aim'd their .S"//^/ at the 
Men they knew 304.34, etc. (Cf. Kriiger I. 19). — Friday 
made three SJwt at them 281.10. 

I order'd my last Pistol to be fir'd ofTin one Volley 358.9. 
Only this instance, else Pistols: 

we fir'd two Volleys of our Pistols TiSI ■'2 Z\ 215-18, etc. ■'^ 

The following are the only instances of oar, oars occur- 
ring in RC: 

The Men labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat near 
the Shore 14.8; We work'd at the Oar towards the Land, 
pulling as well as we could 50.6; I began to think how I 
should get to Shore with them, having neither Sail, Oar, or 
Rudder 58.24. 

When we had carry'd all these Things on Shore (the 
Oars, Mast, Sail and Rudder were carry'd before) we . . . 
307-27; 305-23- 
Of Biskct and Rusk no plural forms in -s are found: 

he brought a large Basket of Rusk or Bisket of their 
kind 23.23; I fiU'd my Pockets with Bisket, and eat it . . . 
56.15; The next Thing was that of my Bread, I mean the 
Bisket which . . . , this I husbanded to the last degree 157.29; 

The mutual relation between Candle- Cayidles is the same 
as with Bullet- Bullets: 2 to 6. 

I was at a great Loss for Candle 90.2; Having no 
Candle, I gave it over, but resolv'd to come again the next 
Day provided with Candles 21 1.3. 

the Lump of Bees-wax with which I made Candles 
90.5, 21 1. 10, etc. 



^ For PE usage with similar substantives see esp. Kruger and Sweet 
II. 44- 



38 

Provisions is a little commoner than Provision, the pro- 
portion being as ii to 7: 

He resolved he would not go a fishing without some 
Provision 22.9, 213.32; I began to starve for Provision 
187.4, 234.4; they brought me a great deal more of their 
Provision 35.11; the first of these Chests I fiU'd with Pro- 
vision (B Provisions') 57.18. 

A larger Store of their Provisions 309.36. I made the 
other two carry Provisions 321.26. he heard . . . the Manner 
of my being fumish'd with Provisitions (B Provisions') and 
Ammunition 305.35. 

While tortoise only occurs in the singular form, turtle 
and turtles are used alternately: 

I had Tortoise or Turtles ^Vioxx^ 152.4. I had no Want 
of Food especially these three Sorts, viz. Goats, Pidgeons 
and Turtle or Tortoise 128.33. I could not have so much 
as got any Food, except Fish and Turtles 154.10. 



To judge from the grammars I usually refer to, this 
collective use of the words above mentioned seems to have 
been totally overlooked, or at least not considered worth cal- 
ling attention to. 

The only statement referring to this phenomenon is given 
by S. Johnson who in his dictionary under Acquaintance: 

'The Person with whom we are acquainted; him of whom 
we have some knowledge, without the intimacy of friendship' 
says: 'In this sense the plural is, in some authors acquain- 
tance, in others acquaintances . — 

For further particulars see CD; NED; Kriiger 1.19, and 
Sweet I, 315, II. 44.

B. Gender. 

The use of the personal gender with regard to animals, 
esp. higher and domestic ones, and sometimes also with 
regard to the names of things, does not essentially deviate 
from present day English. 

Thus Dog, Goat, Horse; Bear, Lyon, Wolf, are 
generally spoken of as vmsadine; while Cat, Turtle; Boat, 
Mainmast and Ship are feminine. 

a Dog,^ who "... I gave him a Cake, and he eat it 
226.1 7; 

the old Goat who . . . cover him . . . drag him out 
212.30; 

the Wolf that had fastned upon the Horse, left him . . . 
upon his Head 347.29; 

Bear ... if you meet him, he won't meddle with you 
348.26; 

a Lyon ... I shot him 31.17 . . . the Hide of him 

32-7; 

Friday went close up to him and shot///?« (the Wolf) 347.15. 

a Wild Cat . . . she sat ... I presented my Gun at 
her 63.10, 83.36; 

the Turtle ... I found in her . . . and her Flesh was 
100.34; 

my Boat ... to get her about the Island 176.4; 

the Main-Mast . . . they were obliged to cut her away 
11.32; 

the Ship . . . seeing her sit upright 81.26. 

With others Kid, Parrot^, the use is not quite settled, 
the masc. and fem. gender being used promiscuously: 



^ I need not say, that I could give many more ex. of every word, 
but I think one of each will do. 

* Cf. Introduction p. 10 

^ Cf. Storm p. 1018 quoting an extract from a letter from Sweet: 'a 
dog- is he and a cat she, a parrot is she" . 



4° 



a Kid ... I led him and enclos'd him 131.3; I had 
kept a young Kid, and bred her up tame 171. 10; 

a young Parrot ... I could make him speak 128.20; 
The Parrot was flutter'd from the Place where she fell 
25^.15- 



It is very interesting to see Defoe's varying application 
of gender as to animals. When spoken of in their wild state 
they are generally referred to as neuter, e. g.: 

my Dog surpriz'd a young Kid, and seiz'd upon it, I 
caught it, and sav'd // alive from the Dog 130.29. 

But as soon as he gets a little more familiar with the animal, 
he gives it a personal gender, as: 

I came to my Bower, and there I enclos'd him 131.5. 

I did catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd it down 
with a Stick, and having recover'd //, I brought // home; 
but it was some years before I could make him speak: 
However, at last I taught hitii to call me by Name 128.17. 

And when the bird has got a name of its own nothing 
but the personal gender is used: 

I quickly learn'd him to know his own Name 140.30; 
I saw Poll and knew that it was he that spoke 168.24, etc. 



The principal intention of Defoe in giving the personal 
gender to animals and things was no doubt to give a more 
homely and familiar touch to his diction; of PE. The use 
of the relative pronoun loho in similar cases may also be 
looked upon from this point of view. — For a detailed in- 
vestigation of questions connected with the use of personal 
gender with such substantives as those treated above, parti- 
cularly to indicate the higher or lower position of a certain 
object in the scale of rank, see Franz p. 42 ff; Storm p. 



41 

7/6, I0I7; Sweet II. 42 and esp. Noreen, Vdrt Sprdk,W. 302 fif. 
where this question has been treated with great thorough- 
ness. 



III. Adjectives. 
Comparison of Adjectives. 

A. Regular Comparison. 

As will be clear from the very numerous instances quoted 
by Storm, page 682 ff. (further ex. in Koch, Matzner and 
ESt. 17.225) and from those given by m}'self below, the MnE 
mode of comparison, as far as it is settled, at least in the 
written standard prose, and propounded in the grammars of 
our day, differs in no small degree from the English of the 
classical authors of the beginning of the i8th century ^ 

Several of the examples quoted by Storm may possibly 
belong to the spoken language of the day; but I think many 
of the forms referred to will not often be found in good PE 
writers, or even heard in the speech of educated persons. — 
To judge from the instances I have found in Ev. the PE 



* For information as to the comparison of adjectives in the 16 — 17 
cent, see Abbott p. 21; Franz p. 54; Vodoz p. 78, and especially Miss 
Pound's dissertation, where many questions connected with the history 
of the comparison of adjectives in English are dealt with. — As regards 
the opinions and the different rules of comparison given by PE gramma- 
rians see Kruger III. 85 ; Storm p. 685 and Pound p. 5 ff. where we 
find quotations from a great number of modern grammars, etc. — On PE 
coUoq., vulgar and dial, use see Storm pp. 682, 778, etc.; Fr. Dial. p. 230 
and Wright p. 267. 



42 

tendency of restricting the inflectional mode of comparison 
to monosyllables and certain dissyllables seems to have been 
already prevalent after the middle of the century. Forms 
now commonly considered as belonging to very careless 
speech, are there only used in decidedly vulgar style. 



In the works of Defoe and his contemporaries which I 
have examined, the periphrastic mode of comparison of real 
adjectives is decidedly predominant. — In RC, for instance, 
I have counted no less than twenty-two instances of it; with 
participles and adverbs only the periphrastic mode with more, 
)nost is used, e. g: 

nothing could be more terrible 105.11; it might have 
been more miserable 132.10; — the jnost pleasant Place 
164.24; the most delightful I ever saw 8.27; the most des- 
perate Qon6ii\on I ever had been in 220.26; the most miser- 
able of all Conditions 38.20, etc. etc. — the most hardned 
Wretch 9.35; the most suited 'i\.2Xt.\\}vi\% more perfectly z.va.Vi'S,^^. 
him 319.14. 

On the other hand we find no small number of adjectives 
compared according to the inflectional mode of comparison, 
many of which cannot be looked upon as indisputably belong- 
ing to the standard English of our day:^ 

a little pleasanter than ordinary 5.29; much pleasanter 
129.33 — the bitterest Providences 17 5.1; the dismallest 
Howling 547.22; the pleasaritest Year 253.4 — the diffi- 
cultest thing 71.7; the /;//i'<rr^(^/^i'/ Wretch 6.26; the unhappiest 
Voyage 19.12.- 



^ I need hardly say that under the examples of inflectional com- 
parison I only give such adjectives as in some way or other differ from 
the rules given by our modern English grammarians or have been discussed 
by them. 

" CS The horridest Yell 69; — MF handsomest 15; — PY honester 
Men 78; the worst and ordinariest 79; the haj-dnedest Creatures 42. 



43 

If we now pass on to examine the statements in the 
grammars of the 17th and i8th centuries, we shall find that 
the distinctions in usage between the two ways of comparison, 
propounded in our modern grammars, did not appear till the 
beginning of the i8th cent. 

Wallis's statements p. 74 'De Comparationibus' are not 
particularly instructive. Noteworthy is at any rate his com- 
paring the English periphrastic comparison with the Latin 
comparison with magis, uiaxiuic, possibly inferring that this 
has influenced the English: 

'Gradus Comparativus formatur a Positivo addendo er; 
Superlativus addendo est. Ut 7^z> formosus,/^/;^;' formosior, 
fairest formosissimus. Sed et uterque gradus per circumlocu- 
tionem formantur, ut aptid Latmos;^ nt, jnore fair, most fair, 
very fair, magis formosus, maxime formosus, valde formosus'. 

The first rough attempt at setting up any distinction in 
the usage of comparison I have found in Maittaire (17 12) 
p. 43: 'The Comparative and the Superlative are made by 
adding -cr and -est to the Positive; z.?) great, greater, greatest. 
Some Adjectives, such especially as are derived from the 



CG they may be honester; these are honester times 95; the beanti- 
fullest and best improv'd language 122; \\\s plcascuitest x&zxqs 115; the 
properest method 196; the question whether the learned or the unlearned 
world are the wickedest iji. 

TT nothing backivnj-der 210; profounder Antiquaries 25; the Pro

Sp. the rigider Part 266.1; the hojiestcst Fellow 88.6.

11.40 (D); the suprisingesf part 11.66 (D); the untkinkingest manner II.65 
(D); the ilt-bredest creature 1. 78 (D). 

But the most able 1. 189; the most profound III. 27, etc. as used by 
well-bred people. 

^ The italics are mine. 



44 

Latin, or end in -7is pure, are compared by the signs viore, 
most; as prudent from prudens, more prudent, most prudent 
(harshly and very rarely prudenter, prudetitcst); ne- 
cessary from neces sarins, more Jiecessary, 7/iost 7iecessary; pious 
from pins, more pious, most pious . 

Lediard is, as far as I can see, the first to give us a 
detailed account of the comparison of adjectives. Having 
given some examples of inflectional comparison: Jioly, holier, 
holiest, merry, merrier, merriest, he continues p. 334: 

'Viele zwey und mehrsilbige Adjectiva und in sonder- 
heit die sich auf -al -ant -ary -ate -ent -full -oly -ory -ous und 
some endige exprimiren den Comparativum und Superlativum

digal, most pr odigdA, fragant, wary, obstinate, tiresome u. s. w'. 
On page 327 however we find such forms as foolishest, god- 
liest, wickedest. 

While here both the length and ending of the adj. are 
decisive for the mode of comparison, in GREENWOOD the 
periphrastic comparison seems to depend only on the ending. 
After mentioning the inflectional comparison with -er, -est 
he writes (p. 113.): 

'But Adjectives, such chiefly as come from the Latin, ^ 
and that end in ain, as certain; in ive, ^.s fugitive; in cal, as 
Angelical; in en, as Golden; in ly, as Fatherly; in less, as 
Friendless ; in ry, as Necessary; in Al as General; Able as 
Commendable; Ing as Loving; Ish as Peevish; Est as Honest; 
Ous as Vertuous; Ant as Constant; Ent as Excellent; Lble as 
Visible; Ed as Wicked; Ld as Rigid; Some as Troublesorne; 
Form or make the Comparative Degree by putting the word 
More before them, and the Superlative by putting the word 
Most before them. Except Able and Handsome, which are 
compared according to the Rule.' 

Words like learned, natured, he says, are compared by 
the words better and best. Here I think we find expressed 
his opinion of the comparison of participles in general. 

If we now at last turn to S. JOHNSON and Ward (p. 

^ As in Maittaire this statement is no doubt due to their using both 
the same authority: Wallis. 



45 

347) ^^'^ shall find in their statements such a striking accor- 
dance that we cannot help suspecting that one of them must 
have copied the other. According to them all adjectives 
may be compared by viore, )nost} Monosyllables, however, 
'are commonly compared by -cr, -est.' Polysyllables are seldom 
compared otherwise than by move, most. Dissyllables, they 
state, are seldom compared if they terminate in certain en- 
dings, and these endings are almost the same as those given 
in Greenwood. — The following statements of Dr. Johnson 
give us some notion of the unsettled state of the comparison 
of adjectives in the early i8th century: — The comparison 
of adjectives is very uncertain; and being much regulated by 
commodiousness of utterance, or agreeableness of sound, is 
not easily reduced to rules. — Some comparatives and super- 
latives are yet found in good writers formed without regard 
to the foregoing rules; but in a language subjected so little 
and so lately to grammar, such anomalies must frequently 
occur'. 



B. Double Comparison. 

During the first two centuries of the MnE period the 
use of the double comparison was very common. In the 
course of the 17th century, however, its use was growing less 
and less common (see De Vere p. 236; Pound p. 49 ff. and 
Franz p. 56) and in all the works of the classical authors 
from the beginning of the i8th century (also Dryden), I 
have only found one example of its occurrence, viz. in 
Defoe's RC (B): 



^ Here Johnson has a note: 'In adjectives that admh a regular 
comparison, the comparative 7no7-e is oftener used than the superla- 
tive most, as more fair., is oftener written ior fairer, than most fair for 
fairest.' 



46 

if he goes abroad he will be the most miserablest Wretch 
that ever was born 6.26.' 

The above facts may be considered quite sufficient to 
refute Miss Pound's statement (p. 51) that the 'Intensification 
of terminational comparatives by prefixing viore and most 
is lasting into the eighteenth century in literary English'. 
But I will here call attention to a few other facts. In the 
edition of Shakespeare's works w^hich RoWE published in 
1709 he undertook, besides other more or less happy emen- 
dations and changes of the text, to remove instances of 
double comparison, e. g. more better, etc. 

The same procedure was adopted by Pope in his edition 
of Shakespeare (printed for Tonson 1725) where, for instance, 
more sounder, most poorest, etc. are changed into sounder, 
poorest, etc.; cf. Franz p. 56. 

I think these facts are a conclusive proof that these edi- 
tors considered the original forms as not being quite correct. 
And indeed, if any examples at all occur in the i8th century 
English, they are, as far as I can ascertain, only used to 
represent the language of vulgar persons^. Thus in Ev. the au- 
thor makes only the exceedingly vulgar Madame Duval use 
this form of speech.^ This opinion is also confirmed by two 
grammarians from the beginning of the 19th century. The 
author of Vulg. corr. says p. 204 that 'Nothing is more 
common, nor more offensive to those who are well educated, 
than such very incorrect and vulgar expressions as more 
greater: most beautiftdlest; more prettier; most commonest; 



^ Perhaps it mav be thought that I have gone to too much trouble 
for this single passage, but I hope future students will acknowledge my con- 
tribution towards the refutation of Miss Pound's unfounded statement. 

^ Cf. Storm p. 949. 

^ Ev. I would have you learn to be more politer I.97; it i'n't the less 
provokinger for that II.45; so much the worserl.\22\ — T\v^ most cruellest 
thing II.14; the most dullest place II.63 ; the most ttnpertinentest person 
II. 6; the most imptidentest person II.155; this is the most provoki7igest 
pair of all II.151; the most rudest boy II. 169. 



47 



and many other phrases of the same kind'. — After referring 
to Pegge (pp. 94—96), whose views on this question are in 
perfect agreement with those given above, he quotes a great 
number of similar instances, especially out of Shakespeare.^ 



IV. Numerals. 

The OE mode of placing the units before the tens, 
nowadays fairly seldom^ adopted, was of frequent occurrence 
in Defoe's time; cf German. As far as I can see, such 
cumulative groups as one and hventy, etc. seem actually to 
be the only forms employed in RC: 

all of one and twenty 280.30; 274.9; two or three and 
twenty Years 267.32; 337.22; six and twenty (B 26) Years 
270.21; two and forty Days 135.8, 174.14 etc.; cf: thirty 
and Jive Years 330.21; — in vay four and twentieth Year 
218.29; the four and twentieth Year 231.29; the seven and 
twentieth Year 271.34.^ 



^ In pres. vulgar English, and esp. in the dialects (Wright 267) where 
tnore and most are as a rule only used to supplement or intensify the 
regular comparison, as more beautifuller^ most beautifuUest, most worst, 
the comparative and the superlative suffix -er -est being added to practi- 
cally all adjectives, polysyllabic as well as monosyllabic, the double com- 
parison is still very frequently occurring. Cf. Storm 778; Fr. Dial. 230.

p. 362.

V. Pronouns. 

A. Personal Pronouns. 

1. Thou. 

The use of thou etc., as shown by the instances given, 
corresponds entirely with the statements of the various gram- 
marians, it being used either as a mark of famiUarity, inti- 
macy or affection ^, and sometimes even to give a touch of 
superiority or condescension towards the person spoken to, 
or as expressing the highest degree of 'Contempt, Anger, 
Disdain'. In this latter use it is often found together with 
an abusive word. — It is often interesting to notice the 
interchange of tJioti^ gen. in the beginning of an adress, and 
you as the conversation goes on, to mark the different shades 
of feeling and emotion of the speaker, e. g: 

1. Alas! Friday, (says I), thou knowest not what thou 
say'st; (two lines below) Friday, says I, iw^ shall go without 
me 268.21; Now Friday, do as I bad thee, (next line) do 
as you see me do 277.10; O happy Desart, I shall never 
see thee more 164.29.^ 



1 Such inst. -xs Jesus thou, etc. 113.5, I33-I5, etc. where ///^« should 
still be used nowadays will not be mentioned. 

- MF Thou foolish Child, prithee, what do'st cry for 5 ; I wish thou 
(his sister) hadst half her Stock of both for thy Portion 40. 

PY Master, save thy self 11; Poor Man, how much hast thou gotten 
125; thou hast . . . thy self 126; Well, did jj/c« leave . . . you said . . . 
Hark thee, Friend, said I, come hither; for I beheve thou art in Health, 
tliat I may venture thee 127 (to a 'poor Waterman'). — See my remark 
under the ex. quoted from Sp. concerning the use of thee in the nom. 

TT You my Children dear and thou my beauteous Sister 257; I 
can assure thee courteous Reader ... 215. — Cf. Jokes 140; If />^^« (the 
reader) wilt have . . . you inay. 



49 

2. Seeing all these Things have not brought thee to 
Repentance, thou shalt die 102.30; How canst tlioti be 



Ta. Isaac, said he, thou art too late (Steele) 25.8; Jack, thou hast a 
Head, and so has a Pin (to a servant) 83.9; Thou dear Will Shoestring! 
I profess my self in Love with tJiee . . . Will you be combing your 
Whig ... Or chusest thou rather to be . . . 38.10; I pray thee Friend, 
as thoi/ art . . . (in a letter from a quaker) 72. 

Sp. O, thou (the voung maiden) dear Picture, if thou . . . that fair 
Creature you represent (Steele) 118.2; Is it no Consolation to such a Man 
as thou art to d\'e with Phocion (Steele) 133.2; I suppose this Letter will 
find thee picking of Daisies thou wilt . . . thy Conversations . . . thiue 
Eternally Will Honeycomb 131. 9; 499-5, etc. — My good Friend, thee and 
I are to part . . . When two such as thee and I meet . . . thou shouldst 
rejoice 132.4. 

The last passage is put into the mouth of a Q.uaker, in whose lang- 
uage thee must have been the prevaihng nom. form in the i8th cent., 
judging at least from the fol. statement in Pegge (1844) p. 131 : 'a Q.uaker 
rarely savs / hope thou «;'/ 7vell ; unit thou come and dine ivith me?' but 
/ hope thee are well^ will thee, etc' — For further particulars, even as to 
PE dial, use, see esp. Jespersen p. 266 ft.; Wright p. 272. 

Ev. if tJiou hast, pry'thee give it us (to the conductor of a museum)

* 

The contracted form prethee which seems to have survived in ordi- 
nary conversation right up to the first half of the 19th century (cf. Storm 
p. 628), occurs occasionally in passages which no doubt represent the stan- 
dard English of the time. — In PC and Ev., on the other hand, this form 
is extremely common, the same as such forms as harkee, lookee, thankee 
which latter, however, only occur in the speech of the vulgar characters; 
cf. p. 53. For instance: 

MF Thou fooHsh Child, Prithee, what do'st cry for 5. 

CG Change? prethee what hav you to change 56; Prethee, sayes 
my Lord 163. 

Ta. Why, prithee Isaac . . . You 53.10; a Gentleman whispered me, 
Prithee^ Isaac . . . 75.10; Prithee Jack, says I (Steele) if /"/wz/ aimest ... I 
have heard thee 206.2. 

Sp. PritJiee, don't send any more Stories (Will Honeycomb) 13 1.9 

G. Lannert. 4 



5° 

sueh a Hypocrite 133.37; Unhappy Wretch, I would not set 
my Foot in the same Ship with thee for a Thousand Pounds 
16.1; Wretch! dost thou ask what thou hast done . . . ask 
thv self what thou hast not done? ask Why is it that thou 
wert not long ago destroy'd? Why perish'd but thy self, 
etc. 108.31 — 109.2; O Drug! what art thou good for, Thou 
art not worth to me ... I have no Manner of use for 
thee, e'en remain where thou art 65.5.^ 

In all other cases only you, as: 

I turn'd to the Boy... Xury; '\i you 25.24; You Fool 
349.19; You Dog 350.20, etc.; — Cf. Sp. 242.2: you lye, 

you Slut. 

Among the grammars examined by me Wallis is the 
first to mention the occurrence of you in the second pers. 
sing. His opinion as to this is expressed by the following 
remarkable and very interesting passage (p. ^6), being, as 
far as I can see, the first of its kind found in all the 
grammars of the 17th century, to indicate any distinction 
between both thou-you, and you-ye: 'Notandum item apud nos 
morem obtinuisse (sicut apud Gallos aliosque nunc dierum) 
dum quis alium alloquitur, singularem licet, numerum tamen 
pluralem adhibendi; verum \.\xnc you dicimus non yce. Singulari 



PC But, prithee. Sir John 452, etc. 

Ev. Prithee, whispered his lordship III. 7, 8, 175; But pry thee 
friend . . . will you I. 127, 134, etc. (c). 

^ CS Thou art born to do a World of Mischief; Thou hast commenc- 
ed Pyrate very young 33; thou wilt be an eminent Thief 34. 

TT What art thou but a Vagabond . . . Born to no Possession of 
your own . . . Your Livelihood is an universal Plunder 246; Miscreant 
Prater, Eloquent only in thine own Eyes, Thou railest . . . The Malignity 
of thy Temper perverteth Nature. Courts have taught thee ill Manners, 
etc. 269. 

Ta. I am come (quoth he) to insult thee, as thou art . . . (but in the 
continuation) you . . . (Steele) 266.2. 

Ev. O wr'.;tch, cried he, in what dungeon canst thou hide thy head 
111. 222. 



51 

vero numero siquis aliuni compellet, vel dedignantis illud esse 
solet, vel familiariter blaiidientur'.^ — Much the same opinion 
is expressed by CooPER p. 122. 

The grammars from the earUer part of the i8th cent- 
ury give practically fully concordant opinions as to the em- 
ployment of thou-you. — Maittaire (p. 50) says that 'com- 
mon speech and civility in modern language uses the plurals 
you, your, yours instead of the singulars thou, thy, thine, and 
Brightland asserts that 'by Custom we say you when we 
but speak to one Person, thoit being seldom us'd but to God, 
and on solemn occasions to Princes . . . otherwise thou is never 
us'd but in Contempt, Anger, Disdain or Familiarity'. — 
Quite the same view is taken by GREENWOOD p. 119. 

Lediard certainly mentions the use of thou in the above 
cases, but the following quotation shows clearly that upon 
the whole he does not seem to deviate in his opinion from 
present day standard English:^ 'Heutiges Tages braucht man 
durchgehends you so wohl pluraliter als singulariter. Es giebt 
zwar in England . . . Quakers . . . bei welchen es fast ein 
Glaubens-Artickel ist allezeit in Sec. Pers. Sg. thou zu spre- 
chen ... ist affectiert ... sie sind hierinnen keinesweges zu 
folgen'. 

These above statements, expressed by the grammarians 
from the beginning of the i8th century, agree on the whole 
with the opinions and views taken by S. Johnson and Ward. 

With the great essayists of the day the use of thou 
seems to have been in no great favour. In the following 
passage in the Tatler 254 I think Addison has quite clearly 



* Already at the end of the i6th cent, you was the commonly used 
pronoun in the common speech of the higher chtsses and the middle class. 
With the lower, uneducated people thou was still prevalent. This state 
of things will be explained by the fact that you, influenced by French 
custom, (cf. the statement of Wallis) was originally used as a mere court- 
eous form of addressing a single person. Cf.jESP. SxR.p. 236; Franz p. 109. 

- For particulars as to PE use see esp. Bradley p. 62 ; Jespersen p. 
260 ff. ; Jesp. Str. p. 235 fl'.; Sweet p. 342; Wright p. 272. 



52 

expressed his opinion on it: — ... 'seeing a Book in his 
Hand ... it was the Quakers ReHgion. Upon Perusal, I 
found it to be nothing but a new-fashioned Grammar. The 
principal of his Pronouns was Thou; and as for You, Ye and 
Yours, I found they were not looked upon as Parts of Speech 
in this Grammar. All the Verbs wanted the second Person 
Plural ..." 

One gets the same impression, regarding the use of tJioii, 
from Steele's description (Sp. 132) of the dispute between 
•Ephraim the Quaker' and 'the military Captain'. The Quaker 
only uses tJioii or tJiee (see note p. 49), the captain, on the 
other hand, only you; at the end of the dispute, however, 
when begging the quaker's pardon for his bad behaviour, 
'the Captain with an happy and incommon Impudence cries, 
Faith, Friend, I thank thee; I should have been a little Im- 
pertinent, if thou hadst not reprimanded me. Come, thou 
art, I see, a smoaky old Fellow'. - And in fact, with the 
exception of those papers where the elderly and rather old- 
fashioned beau Will Honeycomb is introduced as writing or 
speaking, instances of thou are very scarce in Sp. 

With hardly more than a couple of exceptions the use 
of tJioii, you in Ev. seems practically to coincide with PE 
custom; (see notes pp. 49, 50). 

2. Ye. 

While in other works of Defoe and his contempararies 
ye is met with very frequently (both in a stressed and un- 
stressed position), the instances found in RC are compara- 
tively few and only occur in an enclitical position after a 
verb. Cf. Greenwood's statement below. 

What are ye. Gentlemen 301.16; — Bob, d'lr see what 
charming Weather 'tis now 9.7; Let her alone, Jack, cant ir 
300.12; Hark ye, hark ye (the Bear) says Friday 349.32.^ 

In all other similar imperatives you is the only form 
employed in Defoe's works, e. g.: 

^ PY What d'j'<? want, that ye make such a knocking (to the Watch- 
man 'with an angrv, quick Tone') 59; What Ao ye want? says the Centi- 



53 

RC Look you Sir, said I .305.5, etc. — [PY Why, look 
vou 165; CG Look jYW Sir, says the gentleman 140]. 

With regard to the use ofjr, when applying to only one 
person, it is well worth noting that the current usage of the 

nel. — What do j'^ intend to do? says the Constable. [But then during 
the course of the convensation only you is used] 157; — what are ye 
doing here (to 'two pilfering Women') 103; Hark v,?, good People, says 
the Joyner 151. 

CG how do ye make out that 45; A commission d'ye call it? What 
d'ye mean by that 49; 275; d'ye think I had not... 119; Look jd?, Sir, it's 
no matter what they are 139 — What d'ye think of that 47; But harke 
ve Sir, how come you to understand Latin 188. — [The last is said by 
the author himself, tlie last but one is put into the mouth of the educated 
vounger brother]. 

TT O Ve Eves, I'e blind Guides, miserable Guardians are Ve of 
our frail Noses 200; Look ye, Gentlemen, cries Peter 106. 

Ta. To put them to the Trial, Look Ve, said I 34.4. 

Sp. The how-dj'^ servants of our women 143.3; Monsieur What- 
d'v^-call him's Domesticks 481.2; 4.2. 

PC and Ev. abound with examples: 

PC Why then, John, d'ye see, if you are sure . . . d'ye mark . . . 
441; 417; 456; Lord What-d'j/i?-call him 398; 459; Thank r^, Colonel 379; 
439; here's I'ye 443; 454, etc. etc. 

Ev. if thou hast, pry'thee give it us, for d'ye see L 128; L 207 (c); 

Hark j'<?, hast never another pine apple L 128 (c): Why, look j/^, Madam, 

You mav L 97 (c), etc. 

* 

With the exception of a couple of instances in Ta., one of which 
(38.9) no doubt is intended to take off the speech of a 'Courtier' whose 
'Levity of Mind is visible in his every Word and Gesture', the contracted 
forms ha7-kee, lookee, thankee occur only in very careless or vulgar speech. 
For instance: 

Ta. And harkee, No Names 58.9; Look'ee Jack, I have heard thee 
talk like an oracle 206.2. 

PC Harkee, You fellow; d'ye hear . . . 422; No, thankee 441, etc. 

Ev. Hark'ee Miss Anville, Pve a favour for to ask of you IL 62 (c); 
Hark'ee, my spark in.247 (c); Why, look'ee. Madam, if you L 210 (c); 
Look'ee, Monsieur, this here mav be a French fashion L 207 (c). 



54 

language, as shown by the examples given, deviates so consi- 
derably from the statements and views expressed by con- 
temporary grammarians. 

In the same manner as the grammarians of the first half 
of the 17th century — Gill and Ben Jonson — so does 
Wallis in his grammar no longer insist on the old case 
difference between ye-you which occurs, for example, in the 
Bible (see Storm p. looi). The following statement of his 
(p. 79 Dc Prono minibus) must undoubtedly be considered as 
a fully adequate expression of his real opinion in this re- 
spect: 'Secundam Personam designat tJioti tu, in obliquo 
thee . . .; PluraUter (tam in recto quam ohXxo^wo) ye, you vos.' — 
In my opinion only a limited value may be placed upon his 
Syyiopsis of 'omnia Pronomina' found on page 'j'jy and his 
paradigms of verbs (p. 84), when it is a question af deter- 
mining what was in Wallis's time, and by himself, considered 
current English. The only thing worth noting in his para- 
digms are the forms of the second person singular: '■You 
will (thou wilt), you shall (thou shalt)'. In the plural onlyjjr 
zvill, etc.; cf p. 50. 

Brightland and Greenwood give in the plural 'you 
and ye; tho' by Custom we say you when we speak but to 
one particular Person'. This is also the opinion advanced 
by Lediard p. 346: 'aus diesem ye singulariter gebraucht 
ist erstlich you geworden; da man dann zur Destinction sich 
des ye Plur. bedienet'. Cf. my quotation from him p. 51. 

The following statement by Greenw^ood (p. 119) as to 
the use of ye — the only one of its kind I have come across 
in all the grammars examined — is very interesting as it 
agrees on the whole with my examples: 'We seldom use ye 
before the Verb, unless by Way of Distinction, Familiarity 
or Contempt: As, Ye are the Men: But it is oftener used 
after the Verb or Preposition : As, / will give Ye a Taste of 
it: And I will go away from ye'. 

Already in the middle of the century ye was no doubt 
considered quite oldfashioned. — JOHNSON states that 'you 
is commonly used in modern WTiters for ye, particularly in 
the language of ceremony, where the second person plural is 



55 

used for the second person singular, You are my friend', 
concerning which WARD is still more explicit, saying that 
' + ye seldom appears' (and then only in the plural) 'except in 
the solemn stile of the Scriptures'.^ 



3. 'Em. 

^Em, the orig. unstressed form of hem, which nowadays 
is still preserved, but only in very familiar, vulgar and dial, 
speech,^ enjoyed in Defoe's day a much higher reputation 
among the classical authors, as will be seen from the examples 
quoted.^ There are many facts to corroborate my supposition. 
Even if many of the ex. in the printed works (cf. Sp. Index) 
may be laid at the printer's door, I dare say that MSS of 
those days will give the requisite confirmation. 

CG abounds with examples. Those under I. are Defoe's 
own; and then, even if those under II. are put into the mouths 
of 'country gentlemen', one cannot from this draw any infe- 
rence as to its colloquial, still less vulgar character. 

Swifts censure upon the use of 'em [um) in the Tatler 
230 * does not prove anything beyond the fact as to how wide- 
spread it was; it only shows his own prejudice against the 
use of any abbreviations. 

In Brightland, who no doubt went over the proofs 
himself, the form is most frequently met with, e. g. 'You

^ The ex. given are but a very small portion of all I have collected 

from the various authors. Them is however always the commoner form. 

* 'I should be glad if you would bestow some Advice upon several young

'em 80; before 'em 81; between 'em 115', etc. 

Vulg. corr. (p. 26): gives the following statement regarding 
'em. 'Another vulgar contraction (which was, however, con- 
sidered elegant about fifty years ago) ^ is the leaving out of 
the tk in the word t/wm. In conversation this contraction is 
still very common, but ought to be avoided by correct spea- 
kers whom we never hear saying 'I got V;« from the coun- 
try'; etc. In all these cases, and wherever this vulgar 'em 
occurs, t/iem should always be substituted. To those who 
have got into the habit of using the contraction this will at 
first be difficult, but a little attention will easily conquer it. 
T'ot/ier for t/ie other is a vulgar contraction of the same kind'.

57 

When an author in PE makes one of his characters use 
the form \i)i, he wants thereby to stamp him as an illiterate 
or vulgar person. This use of 'em occurs already in Ev.: 
tJieui is there the only form used by the educated characters, 
em exclusively in the speech of vulgar persons. 



B. Indefinite Pronouns. 
I. T'other, the t'other. 

The form f other (tJie f other) which nowadays only 
survives chiefly in vulgar language, ^ seems in Defoe's day to 
have been quite as correct as the the other. Many facts go 
to prove this. — In the grammars of Lediard and Arnold 
we find the following ex., probably made by the gramma- 
rians themselves: 'he is as rich as fothei' Led. 553; 'on 
father Side (of) the water' ARNOLD p. 119; and Pegge (p. 
'j'^ in a note on the use of 'the father for the other) states 
that 'this, that and father or the other are allowable; but 
the father is a redundancy, and in fact is the th' other' . - — 
See further the quotation from Vulg. Corr. p. 56. 

But the best proof of its being considered quite literary 
is the fact that SwiFT in his letters very frequently uses the 
form. This is the more noteworthy as he otherwise always 
strongly objects to all sorts of 'Abbreviations and Elisions'. 

To judge from Ev. the form seems to have been losing 
its former respectability already in the latter part of the 
cent., the author only making vulgar or very careless people 
use it in their speech. — Examples: 

Reason expostulated with me father way 72.31; first 
on one Side then on father 242.26; he hollow'd as loud 
as f other 347.8; T'other answer'd 317.12; Be that one 
way or th' other (B father) 111.14.^ 



' Fr. Dial. 229; Storm 779. 

' CS than t'other 41; - TT the t'other Scouts 271. 

Sw. Let. father day 12, 32, 37, 49; to one and then to t'other 29. 



58 

In all other cases the PE form the other is used, e. g. : 

one of them (Men) lying on Shore, the other being in 
the Boat 314.23; one of them (Wolves) fastned upon his 
Horse, and the other attack'd the Man 347.2; The other 
Prisoners 310.11, etc. 

2. Plural form other instead of PE others. 

The plural form other (now archaic) which was rather 
common during the i6th and 17th cent.^ besides the regular 
modern form others, is still greatly in favour with Defoe. 
With the exception of a couple of instances — the Cave 
zvhere the others [Pfisoiiers] lay 319.24 (cf 1. 30); the others 
[Men] 7vho 354.35 — the form other is, as far as I can see, 
the only one used in RC after the definite article, e. g. : 

I had loaded my Gun and bad Xury load both the 
other 34.8. I found in one of them a He — Goat, and in 
one of the other, three Kids 172.4; (I saw eleven Sa- 
vages) . . . seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the 
other sought him I show'd my self to him. 235.20; Two of 
them could Swim, but the Third cou'd not ... he look'd 
at the other, but went no further 239.37; he told me, he 
thought it would be more advisable, to let him and the 
two other, dig and cultivate some more Land 291.35; they 
row'd up to the same Place, where the other (they were in 
all eleven Men) had landed, and where the Boat lay 308.25; 
I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own 
Men, knowing the other were very well armed 316.6; The 
other I order'd to my Bower, and as it was fenc'd in, and 
they pinion'd . . . 319.30.

Otherwise always otJicrs:

dry . . . but others 159.10; three others (Savages) 238.35; 
several others (Guns) 220.3, etc. 

In other writings of Defoe the PE form seems to be the 
predominant one.^ — I regret I cannot give many instances of 
the plural form otJier from other i8th century works, which 
in no small degree ought to be ascribed to the fact that it 
is so very easy to overlook this phenomenon.

VI. Verbs. 
A. Simple Tenses. 

I. Present Tense. 

1. 

The ending of the first person singular. 

With the exception of such expressions as / says, saj'S 
I (cf. says he, says she) which are very frequent, esp. in the 
works of Defoe, ^ instances of the PE use of adopting the 
3rd sing, (possibly the ME North of England plural) ending 
s for all persons in the present indicative — now chiefly 
occurring in dialectal and vulgar language " — are very 
scarce in literary i8th century English, e-g: 

No says I 27.27; hold says I 249.37; ^Vell, says I 
326.16, etc, etc.; I fetches my two Guns 240.11; / takes my 
Man Friday with me 245.16.^ 



^ Cf. Introduction p. 10. 

^ See ESt. 12.221; Storm pp. 804, 828, 949; Wright p. 296. 

^ Ta. Nay, says I 25.11; Prithee Jack, says 1 206.2 \ Methinks, says I 
{says he, two lines below) 275.2. 

Sp. Mary, says /, if it be so 60.9. 

Ev. / gives 11.83 (Br.); / puts II.82 (Br.); So / says, says I, my Lord, 
says I 11.224 (Br.); but then, thitiks I 1. 156 (Br.); to be sure thinks I, 
she'll stay II.69 (Miss Br.); for / sees 1. 125, II. 149 (D); / ivants to speak 
to him II.216 (D). 

If I understand Stor.m (p. 804, note i) rightly, he seems to assert 
that in Ev. thinks I was used in quite correct speech. This is how^ever 
a mistake. The examples quoted by him are to be found here above: 
I.156, 11.69. 



6i 

Even if such phrases as says /, etc. in the beginning 
of the i8th century were considered as quite correct (see 
Storm p. 804), I think one can conckide from the instances 
in Ev., that already in the latter part of the century they 
were considered as no longer proper even in the spoken 
language of educated people; cf. note p. 60. 



The ending of the 3rd person singular. 

But for a single example in the introduction of CG page 
4: 'a. man that /lat/i the naturall beauties of his mind' . . . 
and some intentionally archaic forms as dot/i remove 49; Jiath 
been 52; falleth^ sendeth 60, etc. found in PY, the ending th 
does not occur in the original ^ editions of Defoe's works 
examined by me. — In B, however. JiatJi plac d 230.17 is 
put in instead of has plac d in A, which change ought pro- 
bably to be attributed to the printer. 

In contemporary prose works, on the other hand, the 
case is quite different. Though in Ta. and Sp. Jiath and 
doth are not so very uncommon, the ending (^e^th does not 
occur in other verbs but for giving a specially oldfashioned 
touch to the language. — In the works of SwiFT, on the 
other hand, the (^)//^-forms are very common; as to hatJi, at 
least, this form is certainly even more common than lias} 



^ The form hath [God hath yet Mercy i?t Store) occurring on page 
156. 1 in the so-called facsimile must be due to a 'misprint', A having //art'. 

- TT hath been 58; hath p7-ociired ']'] \ hath saved 121; has found 
(two lines below) hath pass'd 290, etc. etc. — Whoever hath an Ambition 
33; The Disposition hath not the least Use 306. — The Man doth never 
stop 154, etc. — the Brain disposeth its Owner to . . . 170; Learning 
puffeth Men up 149; a greater Coward burdeneth not the Army . . . 
Perverteth (in an attack on a 'Miscreant Prater') 270. 

In Sw. Let. hath is likewise much commoner than has, as for in- 
stance hath heeti ivritten 25; hath lyen 57; a man who hath planting 
going on A,'), etc. — has ivritt 11. — Only does, goes, passes, etc. 



62 

In the same way as Swift (Ta. 230; cf. note 4, p. 54), 
Addison and Steele are very conservative in their utterances 
as to the ending th. In Sp. 135, which is wholly devoted 
to linguistic matters, AddisON deeply regrets that the sub- 
stitution of an s for 'the Pronunciation of our Forefathers' 
as 'di'ozi'ncth, lualketh, an'ivctJt has 'added to the /ussing 
in our Language which is taken so much notice of by 
Foreigners', and STEELE ('on the well reading of Prayers', 
Sp. 147) expresses his indignation with 'a Sett of Readers, 
who affect, forsooth, a certain Gentleman-like Familiarity of 
Tone crying instead of Pardoneth and Absolveth, Pardons 
and Absolves'. 

When comparing PE usage with that of the early i8th 
century it is interesting to see that PoPE neither in his prose 
nor his poetry employs the ending th. The present poetical 
use thereof came into prominence only towards the end of 
the century; cf. Jesp. Str. p. 195. In ordinary prose style 
the ///-forms do not seem to occur in the latter part of the 
century. 



In the Introduction to the original edition 1738 of Polite Conversa- 
tion, where Swift affects a quasi scientific tone, hath is, as far as I can 
see, the only occurring form, e. g. pp. 3, 15, 25, 26, etc.; doth, however, 
is used alternately with does, e. g. doth not require 1 5 ; does too much 
Honour 82, etc. With other verbs no ///-forms are found. 

In the conversations themselves, on the other hand, has, does, 
passes, etc. are the forms constantly used. — Cf. Jespersen's not quite 
correct statements in Jesp. Str. (p. 194, 195) where also information as to 
the use of th in other 17th and i8th cent, works can be obtained. 

Ta. hath taken 158.2; every Verse hath something 163.7, ^^c.; a 
Catalogue that doth r\o\. comt 158.1; — hath ayoided, doth poll, etc. (arch, 
style) 73.16. 

Sp. hath been 70.5; hath filled 40.4; hath struck 72.11, etc.; a Mul- 
titude which hath not in it . . . 70.1; one that ha/h not a Tendency 
to . . . 542.4= 529.1; wit doth not consist in . . . 253.6; — he hath born 
me (arch, style) 468.2; — containeth, expresseth, savottj-eth, soundeth only 
in intentionally archaic style as used by 'Ephraim the Qiiaker' 133. 



63 

It 

The unsettled state concerning the use of the ending s 
and /// is clearly shown by the statements of the gramma- 
rians of the time.^ 

Lediard declares that besides \e)th: dcnietJi the 3rd 
sing, has 'noch eine andere Endung, vvelche heutiges Tages 
(absonderlich im geschwinden Reden) am meisten gebraucht 
•^'vcdi'. fears, loves, denies, has, etc'. 

According to Greenwood 'the S instead of the ending 
EtJi is now most commonly used, but this change is very 
blameable, unless it may be allowable in Poetry . And in 
order further to support his statement he copies Addi- 
son's words in Sp. 135. — Greenwood is probably the 
first grammarian who has at least some vague idea that this 
s is not merely a 'blameable' innovation. This appears from 
a note referring to 'blameable', in which he states that 'the 
changing of etJi or atJi into as, es, is is of pretty long stand- 
ing, introduced by the Danes' . . . 

Other grammarians as, e. g. MiEGE (p. 25) and Mait- 
TAIRE (p. 62), express as their opinion that s is only a short- 
ening or contraction of th. 

S. Johnson mentions the forms side by side with each 
other: HovetJi or loves ; 'hath or has , which he says 'is a 
termination corrupted from hath, but now more frequently 
used both in verse and prose'. — The following quotation 
from Ward (p. 422) will show that about the middle of the 
1 8th century the present feeling of archaism as to the use 
of the /// was already noticeable: 'The third person singular 
of the simple present tense was anciently formed from the 
first, by subjoining the syllable eth; as from call, calleth; 
[has + hatli p. 393] but this form is now disused, except in 
the solemn stile of the Scripture'. 



1 In the text of their works Lediard, Dr. Johnson and Ward seem 
only to use the j- forms. So does Jones as a rule, th being found only 
once: as folloiueth p. 13. — Maittaire uses the forms quite promiscu- 
ously, e. g. beloveth, pleaseth 157; repenteth 157, next line repetits ; 
riseth, in the Preface, next line reaps, etc. 



64 

By quotations from 17th century grammars Jespersen 
(p. 194) shows that already at that period 'it was usual to 
read s where the book had ///. According to his opinion 
/lat/i and dof/i would be exceptions to this rule. — It is 
quite possible that at the beginning of the i8th century /laf/i 
and do^/i are not merely to be considered as orthographical 
variants o{ has, does; on the other hand, it does not seem to me 
very probable that in ordinary style they were 'prevalent till 
about the middle of the eighteenth century'; [c^. Jones p. 107). 



2. 

The use of ha in Defoe is quite remarkable. While in 
all the contemporary works I have examined scarcely a 
single instance of hd alone occurs, this form is very frequent 
in all the works of Defoe, even his MSS.^ — Biilbring (CG 
p. XVII) seems merely to consider the form as a specimen 
of Defoe's fancy for abbreviations, placing it side by side 
with such shortenings as ace*, hoji^^ for account, honourable, 



^ PY would hd been, would hd sunk 113; might hd travelled 141, 
etc. etc. 

In a passage in Sp. 274 'which is verbatim the Copy of a Letter 

written by a Bawd' we find the form still further reduced to «.• 'expecting 

to a found ... as to « set her up'. 

* 

CG I write no stile, I han't words 132. 

The following words put into the mouth of 'a man of letters' shows 
that Defoe considered the co?ttracted form ha?it (and ati't) quite correct: 
Han't you a vast estate? An't you rich? 129. 

Bv Defoe's contemporaries, however, hafi't is only used to denote 
vulgar or very careless speech, e. g. : 

Sp. You han't that Simper for nothing, says the Gipsie 130.1. 

PC I hdfi'i eaten it 447; you hdfi't tasted it 443, etc. 

Ev. (only as a vulgarism): You ha'7it no eyes I.78 (D); hdn't we a 
right to know that much I.95 (c); you hdn't been o'top of the Monu- 
ment II.106 (Br.). — Cf. hdn't she, Miss II.214 (Br.). 

For PE usage see esp. Sweets Elementarbuch p. 21 and NED. 



65 

etc., which abbreviations he says he 'has always expanded'. 
In my opinion this must be due to a mistake: ha was no 
doubt used by Defoe as a separate form of pronunciation 
by the side of the full Jiat>c\ cf. ArcJiio no, p. 202 ff. 

In its use as an auxiliary this form occurs no less than 
fifteen times; in three of these cases (pp. 25.20, 32.33, 50.5) 
ha has been replaced by have in B. As a principal verb 
ha is met with only once. For instance : 

I could ha' been content to hd taken and hd^ drown'd 
the Boy 25.20. I was inclin'd to Jia' gone on Shoar 32.34; 
I might hd staid 40.1; I could scarce ha' fail'd 45.14; — 
Lord ha' Mercy upon me 94.21. 

Note. It is well worth noting that hd only occurs in the first six 
printed sheets of RC. The explanation of this is no doubt to be sought in 
the fact that the compositors or even possibly the proofreaders of these 
sheets have on the whole 'followed copy' ; in the other sheets, however, 
the full form have was inserted instead. — In other works of Defoe hd 
occurs fairh- evenly distributed all over the works. 



As is well known SwiFT was a sworn enemy to all sorts 
of abbreviations and contractions. In a letter to Th. Beach, 
12 April 1735, we find his view of the matter unmistakably 
expressed: . . . 'for haiit read want. I abhor those harit's 
and zvonts, etc. etc., they are detestable in verse as well as 
in prose' ; cf. wont, etc. p. 26. — ARNOLD p. 73 states 
that a is used instead of hd or haz>e ('he would a fled') 
'iedoch nicht zum besten, und mehr in geschwinder Rede, 
als im Schreiben'. — Other grammarians are quite silent on 
this point.

2. Past Tenses. 

Strong verbs. ^ 

Preterite. 

a. Preterite forms, dating back to a pret. used in an 

earlier period of the language, but which no longer 

exists in standard PE, of get, speak, strike. 

Got, spoke and struck are by far the commonest; gat, 
spake and strook being only met with some few times in 
the instances quoted below: 

we got 13.24; he spoke 27.6; she struck 73.6 etc., etc. 
1 cou'd not bear to stay; so I gat me up the Hill 195.18; 
As soon as I ^''a/ thither 217.2; they launch'd their Boat and 
gat them on board 311. 13; when I spake 249.18; If they 
met... or spake (B spoke) 257.31; I began to return; I 
strook forward 51.35 — [Only broke 5.1 7; .$■/<' wr 25.29; /I'v/r 
5.23, etc.].- 

To judge from the very few instances met with in the 
prose writings of those days I think forms like gat, spake, 
strook must already in the beginning of the i8th century 

' As regards the grouping of the preterites and pa. pples. of these 
verbs it has been very difficult to find a satisfactory system of classi- 
fication. On account of the slight material at my disposal I di(3, however, 
not consider it necessary to group them in any other way than the one 
adopted. 

- PY As it had gotten some Vent into the Discourse, the Secre- 
taries gat Knowledge of it 2; they heard Voices that never spnke and 
Sights that never appear'd 27. 

CG His father gat no amends 259.

67 

have been considered somewhat archaic, (see Brightland 
below). The forms given in the grammars no doubt de- 
pend upon their being taken either from the Bible, or Shake- 
speare, or high flown and poetical language from the middle 
and latter part of the 17th century.* 

VVallis says (p. 97) that besides the usual form broke, 
spoke, etc., 'quaedam etiam formantur per a ut brake, spake, 
bare, share, sware, tare, ivare, clave, gat, begat, forgat et 
ibrtasse etiam alia sed rarius', which statement Brightland, 
as usual, entirel)'^ follows, but adds at the same time that 'this 
way is seldom a?id very impolite . 



Greenwood and Leuiaru always indicate with a * or 
a + that forms like brake, gat (not even mentioned by Gr.), 
spake, S7vare, tare are already out of common use; only once 
in the case of the pret. of speak Lediard places the a and 

form on the same level: 'spoke, spake'. [Strook I have not 
even found mentioned by the above grammarians]. 

S. Johnson's statements in his grammar, being only 
copied from Wallis, cannot of course give us any guidance 
as to the use of these forms in the English language in the 
first part of the i8th cent., and far less in the middle of it. 
But even if we accepted his own words in his Dictionary, 

1 think we should get a very erroneous conception of the 
real circumstances: with the exception of shear, luear (cf. 
my statements p. 91, 92) and forget all the rest enumerated in 
Wallis are here given with double forms, the a form however 
(resp. strookY always ^spake or spoke' excepted] being placed 
second. 

He certainly tells us that draue (not in Wallis) gat, tare 
were used 'anciently ; but on examining the examples upon 
which he has no doubt based his statements, one very 
soon realizes that he ought to have put this word beside 

' Storm p. 997; Craik pp. 257, 291, 295; Franz 9; Vodoz 56. — 
Pope Essay 011 Man III. 171 : the Voice spake (rhyming with take).

'^ 'the preterite of strike used in poetrv for struck' . 



6S 

most of the forms, his examples being as a rule, either, 
and this for the greater part, taken from the Bible, where, 
as is well known, forms like bare, gat are far commoner than 
those like bore, got, or from Shakespeare, where they still 
occurred rather frequently. 

This opinion is all the more plausible as even in the 
poets quoted, e. g. Dryden and Pope, the PE standard forms 
are as a rule the only ones occurring; and Ward (p. 416) 
puts a r as a sign of obsoleteness before: brake, spake, 
bare, share, siuare, tare, luare, clave, gat, d?'ai>e. 



p. Preterite forms being historically due to the in- 
fluence of either the original pret. sing, or the pret. 
plural (pa. pple.) form of begin, drink, spring, run; 
cling, fling, sing, sink, sling, ^vring; swim. 

Began is beyond comparison the most common form 
(some forty instances) begun only being found eight times : 

I began 54.8; the Wind began 49.10; the Stakes bcga/i 
1 8 1. 7; — I begun 104.34; My Life /'^i.v/^ 157.27; 135.20, etc. 

The preterite run, on the contrary, is much commoner 
{forty instances), while lan is only met with twenty-one times: 

I ran 80.18; it ran 63.9; the Creature swam and ran . . . 
34.34; — ■ I run 34.7; he run 350.14; I found they run 
32.36; My Thoughts run and I was 146.20. 

The linguistic sense can certainly not have been ver}- 
strongly developed as regards the different forms of these 
verbs, both forms being found almost in the same line, as: 

Conscience begun to awake and I began to reproach my 
self 105.24. 

In other instances again the two editions differ, e. g. : 

The Bear began to totter, and begun (B began) to look 
351.10: I run (B ran) and 1 got 93.23; a strong Eddy, 



69

Of drink and spring the examples are rather scarce, 
drank occurring three times, and drunk only once. Sprang

began to eat 284. 12; — I drunk 110.35; It sprang <^2.io\

If we now pass on to an examination of the statements 
of the grammars of that time we find no slight deviation 
from what are given as standard forms by modern gramma- 
rians. Cf. note I, p. 71. — Wallis (p. 95) gives decided 
preference to forms with u 'tam in Preterito Imperfecto quam 
in Participio Passivo: taonne, spun begun siviLui struck stuck 
sung stung filing rung wrung sprung szvung drunk sunk shrunk 
stutik hung come [cf. p. 75] rtin. Sed et eorum pieraque 
formantur etiam in Preterito Imperfecto per «, ut ioan began 
sang rang sprang drank came ran: et quaedam alia, sed 
rarius'. 

The u forms seem also to be greatly preferred by 
Maittaire and Lediard, the former giving as a rule only 
n forms; begun or began, sung and sang being the only 
variants extant. The latter giving either one of these forms 
alone as 7'ung, slung, spun, stung, ivrtmg (= Gr.), or both, 
indicating by the order of words or a — that the a form is 
much less used: drunk, drank; sting, + sang: sunk, -;- sank: 
sprung, + sprang; sioum, swam (Gr. swum, *swam);^ ivon, — 
^van (= Gr.); swung, + siuang (= Gr.). 

Greenwood, however, seems in this respect to hold an 
opinion, very often differing both from preceding and suc- 
ceeding grammarians. Quite contrary to Lediard he gives 
the following preterites: rang (only); drank or * drunk ;^ 
sang and *s7ing\ sank or '*sunk; sprang or sprung. 

As will clearly be seen from these extracts from the 
grammars of the latter part of the 17th century up to the 
three first decades of the i8th, the // forms were then consi- 
dered beyond comparison the most common. To show that 
this is still the century, case throughout the century, I shall 
here give statements of three grammatical authors: Samuel 
Johnson and Ward, in the middle, and Pegge, at the end of 
the century. 

In his grammar S. JOHNSON'S statements are exactly the. 
same as Brightland's, both, in this case, as in many others, 

' The star before a certain form indicates, as Gr. states in a note, 
that this form is 'not proper or usual'. 



71 

being merely translated from VVallis without any statement 
of the source. 

In his Dictionary, however, which no doubt may be 
considered to express his own opinions more or less influ- 
enced by the common usage of his time, he gives the preterite 
forms of the subsequent verbs as follows: 

1. only It: fling, hang {hanged, anciently hong) ring, sink 

(anciently sank), sling, slink. 

2. u or a: shrink, spin, spri)ig (anciently sprong), sting, stink. 

3. a or 21: begin, drink, sing, sunni [swam, sivovi, or swum), 

sunng, ivin {wan and 7oon). 

4. only a: ran. 

Ward (p. 413) considers the a forms of verbs in 
ing as cling, ring, etc. to be obsolete; the same is the case 
with began, span: drank, sank, slank, shrank, stank; swam, 
ivan. Of run, however, he only gives the preterite form ran. 
Pegge (p. 324) laments that by modern affectation the 
language is rendered 'much more clouded and less intelli- 
gible upon the first glance or coup d'oeil, than it was an- 
ciently. Begun has taken the place oi Began in the preterit, Run 
of Ran; Drunk of Drank; Sprung of sprang, etc' — As it 
appears from this quotation, Pegge's opinions in this matter 
do not seem to have been shared by his own contemporaries; 
most of our modern writers and grammarians, hovvev^er, quite 
evidently consider as standard forms those vindicated by 
him. ^ 



' Those who want to have a comprehensive view of the fairly di- 
vided opinions of our modern grammarians concerning the current and 
correct pret. forms of verbs belonging to this category I refer to a paper 
(29 pages) in Anglia 17, p. 486 fF. by Dr. Swaen, where he quotes and 
criticizes the opinions given by them. Finally he states the results he has 
arrived at himself by means of his own investigations. A great collection 
of instances from authors of the 17th and i8th century are also to be 
found in the paper. See further Kruger II. 161, III. 410.

Y- Preterite forms, due to the influence of analogy with 

the pa. pple. form, of bid (forbid), come (become), 

give, ride, rise (arise), see.^ 

With the exception of the pret. forms of bid and nde 
(see below) the forms came, gave, (ajrose, saw, current in 
present standard English, are incomparably the most fre- 
quent: 

I run over . . . since I cawr 232. 8; we saw no more 
Wolwes, 'till we cau/r and entred the Plain 354-8; I ga7Je 



' CS he come running 98; we r/d 13; the ship r/W 19. 

MF she did me 5, 8; she d/d her Maid go up 39; (she dad me 61); 

PY he fi/d her stay 185, 126; they/ordad 255: I da(/ him go lay them 
127, 85,86; It matter'd not from whence it come \; Tiie Ships ;'/«' 128; they 
rid at their Roads 135; the Aldermen rid 181; the hifection spread in a 
dreadful Manner, and the Bills rise high 8; as they saw the consequence 
they soon see the Danger they were in so they resolv'd to divide them- 
selves again 160; she was terribly frighted and she run . . . When she- 
see he would . . . she turn'd 184; this was a most afflicting thing to me, 
who see it all from my own windows 197. — [Sato 28, 29 is, however, the 
same as in RC the usual form.] 

CG if you were never taught, how cofne vou to understand Latin 
188; In a word his pupils came . . . and severall of them tw//<? afterward 
to speak in all those places 219. 

TT They Writ and Sung 56; he writ 185. 

Sw. Let. Your Letter come this moment 39; I icrit 53. 

Sp. he bid him stop 529.3; the Captain /^/^ Sir Roger fear nothing 355.2;

rode (Steele) 11 3.3; a Couple who rid 122.2; two Fellows who rid 152.3; 
the Author writ 40.4; who ivrit 25.2; 105.3; ^^^Y ^'''''^ 253.7; 545-- (2 
ex.); 454.7. 

hi Ev. only used as a vulgarism in the speech of D, e. g. : in all 
my travels, I never see nothing eleganter L128; I'm sure, I had n't given 
him no offence, as I know of, for I never see his face all the time II.43;

boy ever I .s^'^ II. 169, etc. 



73 

over the Hopes of the Boat 148.9; 263.25; he sunk but 
rose instantly 34.11; there arose . . . Fowls 61.16; we spy'd 
the Bear come . . . the biggest that ever 1 sow 349.13, 
etc. etc. 

The preterite form hid, which now like the pa. pple. bid. 
generally only occurs in the sense o{ hid at an auction (see NED) 
is almost as common as bad (always spelt thus in A), 12 bid 
being found to 16 bad. As far as I can see from the in- 
vestigations made, the sense of the different forms is quite the 
same (cf. Kriiger II. 161) told, ordered being in both predo- 
minant : 

I call'd to Friday and bid him go 273.3, 347-6 (9 ex. 
= told); he (my father) bid me observe it 3.21; our Guide 
hid us be easy 346.26, 354.4 (3 ex. = asked); their Fate 
forbid it 223.13; — I bad him (the boy) lye still 31.1; 
34.7 ; his Ankles were so swell'd, so I had him sit still 
284.21, etc. 

He added, they learn'd much of the Bearded-Mans that 
come in the Boat 266.28; The Tide was turn'd and the Flood 
come on 225.8; I ask'd him then what become of them 
264.18. 

In the last two instances B has altered the form come 
into came, while, on the contrary, in the following examples A 
has the PE form came: 

. . . came ... if your Nation beat them, how come you 
to be taken 253.30; He got ... then he rw//^' down the Tree 
352-21. 

The same is the case with give: 

This appear'd so clear .... and I give (A gave') most 
humble thanks to God, who had 205.1. 

The preterite forms rid and rode occur respectively 4 
and 6 times: 

Our Ship rid 10.24; Two Ships that rid 11. 15; a 
Ship which rid 11. 17; We mended our Pace and rid up 



74 

348.4; — our ship rid (10.24)... "^^ >'^^^^ 10.28; I bid him 
ride up . . . he rode 347.9; we ?-od nearer 351-1; [cf. CG 
he rod 251; they 7vrot 209, etc]. 

He rise and call'd 25.3; 1 had not a Word to say 
but rise up (B rose) 109.6. 

He see 'me cock, and present, he did the same . . . 
277.32; I thought he had kill'd them all; for I see them 
all fall of a Heap into the Boat; though I saio . . . 278.26 
(Cf. began-beguH p. 68). I gave them Provisions . . . and 
wishing them a good voyage I see them go 295.5; ^^hen 
the Bear see his Enemy gone he comes 352.16.^ 

[Of drive, zvritc only the PE standard forms occur: 
three drove and came 11.22; I ivrote 341.34, etcj. 

Similar preterite forms were no doubt not so very usual 
either in the 17th or the i8th century. That they occur in 
hterature at all, though rather seldom with the exception of 
hid, rid and ivrit, is shown by instances quoted by Franz 
p. 10; Vodoz p. 56; Storm pp. 753, 781, 810 and 948, and 
by my pwn examples. 

From this, I think, it will appear that such forms as come, 
see particularly, must have been in especial favour with Defoe, 
these not having been found in any of the other works I have, 
though not so minutely, gone through. The others seem to 
be considered quite standard forms by his greatest contem- 
porary stylists.^ 

* 

I now proceed to give the statements and views con- 
cerning these verb forms as expressed in the grammars exa- 
mined by me. — In Wali>IS p. 97 the pret. forms o{give, bid. 
sit are said to ho. gave, bad, sate; pa. pple. ^giveyi, bidde?i, sitten. 
Sed utrobique bidd sitf . Morover he states that besides the

forms with o as t/nvuc, etc. 'utrobique dicimus ctiain t/irine, 
iise,^ sinitf, ivrit, abidd. ridd, [for come see pp. 70], which 
statement, as is always the case, is copied by Brightland 
and Johnson. — In JDict. the following are the only forms 
given side by side with the PE standard preterites : bid; rid; 
'■rise, pret. rosc\ part, risen. Cowley has riss, for rose; so 
has Jonson'; u>rit. — Except the double pret. forms ^nd or 
rode; 'ivrit and zvrote {w rote-writ Led.) the pret. forms 
given in GREENWOOD entirely agree with the PE standard 
use. Besides the above mentioned double forms Lediard 
also gives the preterites: rise and rose (pple. risen as Gr.); 
thro If e. -f thrive (Gr. throi>e, -\- thrived)} 



Past participle. 

a. Past participles, due to the analogy with the pret. 
sing, form, of begin, drink; shake take. ^ 

Begun is practically the only past participle, began being 
met with in one solitary instance. Drank, on the other hand, 



^ The occurrence of rise is also stated in Mihgf. p. 14: 'rise pour rose 
au preterite oil I'i a le son Frangais'. 

■ Cf. p. 90 ft". 

•' PY Begim^ shaken, taken are the onlv pa. pple. forms found. 
While Defoe in RC only uses the pa. pple. form struck (cf. strook in 
CG) struck and stricketi occur here alternately with each other, e. g: — 
those were struck with Death 97; ... struck with the Distemper 193; 80; 
221; People had been stricke7t with the Infection 88; if the Blow is insen- 
sibly stricken 233. 

CG he is but a mongrell begat by a gentleman 79; have 7nistook\b^\ 
the impression was strook at a heat 193; 1 would liave took him 165; 
having tvrote 88; friends are wrote to 132. 

TT had arose 211; 237; [cf hath af'isen 290; be arisen 251]; hath 
btew up 146; have mistook i'j6\ be shook 183 ; has ivrote 9 = Sw. Prop. 146. 

Ta. is drank 24.12; to be drank 62.12; had ran 102.6; have ivrote 
24.19. 



76 

probably to avoid the inebriate associations with drunk, which 
is only once used as a genuine adjective in the sense of 
'intoxicated', is the only form occurring, e. g: 

I had /u'xiin 45.10; My Hedge was /ic,i^ini 173.29; 
I should have l/e^t^an 150.16; — When he had drank it 273.35; 
having drajik a little too much I... 299.35; ^ was made 
drunk 9.10. 

Shook and shaken are found only once each; took is 
very rarely met with (only twice), while there are some 60 
instances of take7t, 30 with the auxiliary bt\ and 28 with 
have^ this form also being the only one used in compounds 
(8 times). 

I had shook 91.34; if it should be shaken 95.35; had 
the Powder took fire 70.14; Friday would fain have had me 
took one of their Canoes 281. 11: the third had taken water 
58.20; it would be his Fate to be taken 20.34, 36; was mis- 
taken 88.16; was overtaken 7.20; had overtaken 20,26; was 
undertaken 198.33, etc. 



p. Past participles, with or without the original pa. 

pple. ending - en, of bid, bite, break, (for)get, (hide) 

ride write. ^ 

Friday kept his Eyes upon me that as I had bid him 
he might observe . . . 277.28; the Creature had bit\axQ. 347.34; 
(having the Events hid from his Eyes 232.31). 

Sp. have drank 72.7; 167.3; S}i^^^ forsook < The Freeholder 22.2]; 
he has rose 44.1; it has I'ose 61.5; had took 44.5. 

In the text of 'Observations' wrote seems to be the onlv occurring 
pa. pple. form, e. g. be wrote [4 lines below] ire wrote p. 9. 

Ev. he should 'nt Jiave y'^// I. 122 (D); is he rode out this morning 
III. 16 (Ly. L); having rode II. 20; Printed as wrote by the authors [in 
a list of books 'just published'] I. 236.

CS I had eat it 5; hadi forgot 15; having gotten 6; be gotten 53; 69:

In connection with the auxiUary Jiave the proportion 
between broke and broken is as j to 2, e. g: 

MF he had hid 23; \\ixs forbid \<^\ he had .v/i^/'i? 23; I would have 
spoke 38. 

PY thev have b7-oke in and murther'd ... 98; the SweUing is bi-oke 
126; 284: The Lock was bj'okc 104; Men who were broke owx 160; 34; 231; 
the Man with his Heart bj-ohc 158. [Broken is, however, the usual form, 
e. g:] had broken 84; 85; 114; 202; 266, etc.; was broken 34; 43; 60; 235; 
thev have forbid 84; were, forbid 35; ht forgot (always) 22, 245, etc.; has

(four lines below) they were written ['the Bookseller to the Reader']; 
has ivritten lO; 62; be iffritten 50; 69. 

^^'ith regard to Swift's use of the language — esp. in TT — it is 
well worth noting that these shortened pa. pple. forms are not only con- 
siderablv more numerous than similar forms in RC, although TT is a 
volume of much less bulk than RC, but thev are moreover proportion- 
ately much more common than the PE full forms, e. g: — these broken 
Ends 62; a drioiken Beau 133; had taken 25; be taken \j\o\\v3.% niistalien 
165; 290; be undertaken 116.

which would have broke my Heart 59.11; the Wreck 
had broke itself 99.7; we had broke a Hole 308.7; the Ship 
had broke 12.37; Bears had broke into the Village 358.30; 
Chests, which 1 had broken open 57- 16; the Juice having 
broken them 1 18.2. 

Together with the auxlHary be, however, broken is much 
commoner, S broken to only 2 broke. In a purely adjectival 
sense broken is solely used (8 ex.): 

She was broken 49.28; 1 found them broken 171.24; 
the Stern was broke 9730; finding his Leg broke 31.11; 
three broken Oars 5831. 

Used as a tr. verb with the auxiliary have the forms ^7?/ 
and gotten are almost equally common, (p got and 10 gotten: 

I had got a Victory 9.27; 154.8, 10, etc. I resolv'd 
to harbour what I had gotten in my Cave 227.33: I had 
gotten two pair of Shoes 228.36. 

In an intransitive sense the proportion is as 5 to 2: 

We had got on Shore 55.23; I had got to the Top 
55.13; 60.36; Had I not ^^//^// upon this Hill 163.16. Having 
gotten over these things 80.34.^

are the usual torms both in Ta. and Sp., e. g. Ta. 100.5; Sp. 61.5; 158.4, etc. 

hi the text of Ward spoke and spoke?! are used quite promiscuously: 
to be spoke 59; the person spoke of 75; words are spoke (some tew lines 
lov^'er down) tlie person spoken to 128. 

Ev. having broke the glass II.222 (Br,); the lamps are broke II. 120 
(Br.); the coach would be broke down II.221 (Br.); the glass being broke 
11.222 (Br.); — had he broke it III.30; \\€ve all spoke first II.114 (Miss Br.); 
the villain has stole all my curls II. 31 (D). 

' In all these instances get is used as a verb of motion. For further 
ex. see below p. 100. 



79 

In connection with to he, i^ottcn is much commoner, 13 
gottoi to only 5 got: 

They are got safe ashore 104.24, 351.3, 5; Some were 
got up 357.36; We were gotten far enough 36.9. 

0{ forgot, forgotten there are only two instances: 

I had forgot what I learn'd 172.13. My Tears being 
forgotten 9.18. 

U'e had rid lo.u; A Ship who had rid 13.14; 
The Captain had writ 41.32. 

With regard to the pa. pple. forms of bid, bite, (hide), 
ride, write special attention ought to be called to the fact 
that Defoe in RC only uses the shortened forms bid, ivrit, 
etc. In other works of Defoe and his contemporaries, on 
the other hand, the full forms bidden, written, etc, occur 
either alone, or also side by side with the abbreviated ones; 
see note i p. ']6 fif.^ 



I could quote a con.siderable number of similar pa. pple. 
forms such as those mentioned above in section a and [3, not 
only from other writings by Defoe, but also by Addison, 
Steele, Swift, Pope, etc. besides those given, and moreover 
such as are not to be found in any of the grammatical works 
mentioned in my Bibliography. But I trust those above will 
be quite suflicient to show not only how exceedingly com- 
mon such pa. pple. forms as shook, broke, etc, were, but also 
that they were undoubtedly considered quite correct by the 
classical authors of the iSth century. 



' To show how \ague the distinction was between the forms writ 
(both pret. and pa. pple.) and loritten I may quote the corrections made 
by Dryden himself in the text of his Essay on Dram. Poetry (1668): pa. pple. 
writ > ivritten 14.17; who /rr// > who had writ 8.19; (page and line refer 
to Smith's ed.). 



So 

All other strong verbs occurring in RC have only such 
pa. pple. forms as are recognized in present day standard 
English, e. g: 

She was hcaicn in Pieces 263.28; had chosen 148.28: 
Ships being driven ir.i8; had eaten 57.26; \)€\ngeaten 146.35: 
zxt fallen 214.23; God \idLdi forsaken him 18835; have ,<,''//Y7/ 
37.22; (I had hit him 31.14); the}'^ were sJwt out and ,i,';w/v/ 
with... 123.35; have sunk 250.7: being sunk 34.22; they 
got her slunii- over the Ship's-side 49.31; to have spoken 
222.16; the rooting them out... is spoken of 203.15; the 
first Word I ever heard spoken 140.33; the Ship having 
stn/ek upon the Sand 49.14; I was j'/rz/rX' with Surprize 210.10; 
109.4; had I thrown 92.10; overthroirn 93.1 1 ; had trod 186.33 ; 
I found them trod to Pieces iiS.i; had irorn 158.32: was 
irorn 103.5. 

* 

If we now turn to the grammars^ we shall find that pa. 
pple. forms like began, drank, etc. must be considered to be 
far less in vogue ; the 11 forms being the only ones mentioned 
at all. Only once (in Lediard) have I found an a form sprang, 
but with a i to show that it is 'not proper or usual'." 

On the other pa. pple. forms, on the contrary, the gram- 
mars have long dissertations, but agree with each other 
in the main. 

Wallis (Participia in en, p. 94) tells us that 'tarn 7vrittcn, 
bitten, eaten, beaten, liidden. chidden. sJiotten, rotten (not in 



* As the verbs belonging to sections a and ^ are in the grammars

The pronouncements of the grammarians of Defoe's own 
day, Maittaire, Greenwood and Lediard, only serve to 
show how very unsettled the state with respect to the usage 
of these pa. pple. forms still was. 

Mattaire (p. 88) seems to give decided preference to 
the abbreviated pa. pple. forms, putting forms like got, wove, 
clove, stole, trod, bid before gotten, woven, cloven, stol'n, 
trodden, bidden, etc. 

Led. generally gives both forms as bit(ten); broke(n); 
drunk (en) ; got(teti); [hid(den)]; rid(den); shook(en) (sicl); spoke (n); 
trod(den); but where this method of abbreviation cannot be em- 
ployed he always places the shorter forms first, as drove, 
driven; throve, thriven; (Gr. only driven, thriven); zvrote, zvrit, 
zvntten; took, taken; tore, torn, etc. 

Gr. in his list of verbs (p. 158 ff.) always places the forms 
in -en first, e. g. broken and broke; ridden or rode; ( spitten, 
spit and spat; Led. only spit); stolen or stole; stricken and 
stiiick (Led. only struck); sivorn only, as Led.; zvritten, zvrit 
and wrote; but he also speaks of (p. 157) the promiscuous use 
of the 'Passive participle', stating that 'we do also use zvritten, 
bitten, eaten, beaten, sJiotten, rotten, chosen, broken, as well as 
writ, bit, eat, beat, shot, rot, chose, broke, etc. in the Passive 
Participle though not in the Preter. Tense'. 

Some few pages further on (p. 169) he gives in Chapter 
XIX 'Of the Formation of the Times of the Verb Passive' his 
opinion on the use of the different pple. forms zvrit, zvritten; 
spoke, spoken, etc. This, I think, is rather interesting and 
well worth quoting, both as a counterpart to the examples 
given above, and to the opinion set forth by Johnson in 

G. Lanneri. 6 



82 

his dictionary. The ending ^«, Greenwood states, 'is frequently 
neglected in the Tenses of the Active Verb formed by Have 
and Had; as, / Jiave or / had spoke to him. Yet when this 
Participle is used as an Adjective or helps to make the 
Passive Verb, it is better and more usual to use the Ending 
en, as; It is a zvritten Book, not a writ Book; It is spoken 
abroad, not, spoke abroad; It ivas zvritteyi, not lurit.' 

'Concerning these double participles' copied from Wallis 
(also 'loadeu, laden as well as loaded, laded'), JoHNSON tells 
us that 'it is difficult to give any rule; but', he continues, 'he 
shall seldom err who remembers that, when a verb has a 
participle distinct from its preterit, as zurite, ivrote, uritten, 
that distinct participle is more proper and elegant, as T/ie 
book is "cvritten is better than the book is wrote. — Wrote 
however may be used in poetry; at least if we allow any 
authority to poets, who, in the exultation of genius, think 
themselves perhaps entitled to trample on grammarians'. 

If we now examine his Dictionary we shall find that his 
statements here do not quite agree with those set forth in 
his grammar. Double forms like bid, bidden; sJiook, shaken, 
etc. are given of the following verbs: bear, beat, bid, bite, break, 
(chide, chid, chidden), choose, drink (drunk-en), drive (driven or 
drove), eat, forsake, get, (Jnde), ride (rid ridden), shake ('shook 
in poetry'), shoot, si7ik (sunk, sunken), smite (sniit, smitten), 
strike (struck, strucken the old participle passive, stricken the 
ancient participle, strook^),take ('sometimes took"), tread, weave, 
write (written, writ or zvrote). 

On account of the somewhat unclear method of arranging 
the strong verbs used by WARD it is often very difficult to 
get at his real meaning with any degree of certainty. On 
the whole however he seems to share the opinion advanced 
by Johnson, augmenting the above list collected from JDict. 
only by the verbs (chide), seeth (+ sod, sodden), sit (sat-sitten), 
slide, speak, steal, stride (strode-stridden). — Born, drunk, 
eaten, forsaken, (shake not mentioned), su7ik, on the other 
hand, are the only pa. pples. given. As far as I have been

cf. pret. strook p. 67.

able to find out, he himself does not use any other participles 
in the text of his work than such as are considered standard 
forms in FE. 

According to Storm (p. 8 lo), Johnson does not himself use 
in his own writings forms like iviit, wrote, etc., but only 
those now recognized, i. e. ivritten, etc. In order, if possible, 
to check this statement I have perused a few hundred pages 
of Johnson s works and discover that it agrees with the 
actual circumstances. That such forms were probably not 
considered quite correct already after the middle of the 
century might also be supported by the fact that in Ev. 
the author generally makes only those of his characters 
use such forms, whom he wanted to represent as careless 
or vulgar of speech. To further strengthen this opinion 
I may refer to Pegge's statement (p. 123): 'Already towards 
the end of the century participles like took, rose, fell, wrote 
though still employed by many authors, were yet felt as rather 
vulgar'.^ 

Weak Verbs. 

1. There is not very much to be said about the weak 
(regular) verbs. — In regard to certain verbs, which even in 
PE have double pret. and pa. pples., I have, however, consi- 
dered It to be of some interest to find out how matters stood 
in Defoe's time, and esp. in RC. 

The only pret. and pa. pple. forms of dream, kneel, 
smell, spoil, build, learn are in RC dreani d (11 ex: only 
pret.); kneel' d (6 ex: only pret.); spoil d (12 ex: 2 pret., 10 
pa. pples.); smell d (i ex: pret.); builded (i ex: pa. pple.); 
learn d (20 ex: 15 pret., 5 pa. pples.). — In the case of 
builded, this form is in B altered to built; the same applies to 
learn d^ which in four instances (84.10, 114.24, 122.17; 98.14) 
has been altered to learnt. Examples: 

' On 19th cent. Engl, use, esp. in vulgar and dialectal speech, see 
among others, Fr. Dial. 217; Storm 753, 809, 830 etc.; Sweet 404 ff.; 
Wright 281 ff. 



84 

I drcaind 218.34, 37: 235.9, ^°i I kneel' d 110,31; he 
knecFd down 235.23; I learn d him 140.31; having learn'd 
him 253.20; She smell'd of it 63.19; I spoiFd 159.37; had 
spoiFd 228.11; what was spoil'd 64.31; the Corn should remain 
unspoiPd 92.6; — I had gotten Timber enough to have builded 
(B built) a Boat 100.21; I learn d (B learnt) 84.10; I had 
learn' d (B learnt) 98.14. 

Of the verbs burn, dAvell and mean, on the other 
hand, no other pret. and pa. pple. forms occur in A than 
burnt (6 ex: 3 pret., 3 pa. pples.); dwelt (i ex. pret.) meant 
(13 ex: 12 pret., i pa. pple.) — In five cases (253.24; 255.26, 
33. 34' 35) the pret. form meant has been altered to mean d 
n B. Examples: 

I burnt iio.i; it had been burtjt 92.11; a N e^%%Q\. burnt 
in the Sun 35.19; there dwelt 255.22; he w^^;// 30.37; what 
was meant 13.36; he meant (B tnean'd) 255.26. 



With respect to these and similar forms it is extremely 
difficult, on account of, amongst other things, the scanty and 
rather inexplicit information we can obtain from grammatical 
works of the time, to decide whether, for instance, such a 
form as learn d was really distinct in pronunciation from 
learnt or not. ^ Neither can we get any definite idea from 



^ In this connection I may be permitted to mention some purely 
orthographical peculiarities of the time in the case of forming the pret. 
and pa. pple. of the weak verbs (cf. p. 22). — Side by side with the 
full ending ed as envied, fastened, etc. we find, perhaps equally often — 
at least in RC — the apostrophized ending 'd (both after a voiced and 
voiceless sound): envy'd, fasten' d, look'd ste(p)p'd, pass'd, scorch'd etc. — 
This style of spelling seems, as a rule, to have been approved of by the 
contemporary grammarians, even Dr. Johnson. Swift (Ta. 250, Prop. p. 
21) and Addison (Sp. 135) and the author of 'Observations', on the other 
hand, express their decided disapproval of this style of writing 'that has 
very much disfigured the tongue', After the middle of the century such 
forms occur verv rarely in prose works (cf p. XXIV). 



85 

the statements of the grammarians, or, on account of the 
unsettled use of the language made by the novelists, etc. of 
the time, as to which of these forms they considered prefe- 
rable (see, e. g. JGr.). ^ — For PE usage see NED, Sweet 
p. 396 fif. and Kriiger II. 154. 

There is besides, in the case of verbs ending in a voiceless consonant, 
a further method of forming these tenses, viz. by adding the ending /, e. g: 

lookt 17.5; markt 219.5; workt 17.19; clapt 219.18; dipt 60.3; dropt 
92.7; jumpt 235.16; outstript 239.19; stept 36.3; stoopt 24.37; stopt 173.31; 
wrapt 53.13; imprest 17.9; we past 47.2; had past 167.32; is past 103.19 (cf. 
PE); tost 25.2; liarrast 4.6; mixt 117.9; crusht 222.36; fisht 24.27; catcht 
24.27; reacht 24.23; scorcht 358.2 

which forms occur ahernately with look'd-Iooked, etc. In the printed 
works of the time (PY, TT, Ta., Sp., etc.) such phonetically spelt pret. 
and pa. pple. forms seem to be at least equally common as in RC. In 
Defoe's MSS, e. g. CG, they are even much more common than in RC ; 
(cf. p. 22). — It is specially noteworthy that Swift, who always blames 
the use of 'contracted forms' and never uses any apostrophized pret. or 
pa. pple. forms in his letters, very often employs such forms in his MSS, 
e. g. Sw. Let: stackt 2, dropt 13, stoppt 23, addrest 44, mixt 31, reacht 
50; cf. note p. 25. 

This phonetic way of spelling, which was prevalent right through 
the whole of the i8th and even into the 19th cent., is mentioned and 
more or less warmly advocated by contemporary grammarians from the 
beginning of the i8th cent. According to Dr. Johnson, in the middle of 
the cent., 7 is used in pronunciation, but very seldom in writing, rather 
than d'. — With reference to PE endeavours in this direction see amongst 
others Horn pp. 12, 149; ESt. 17.283; Angl. Beibl. 4.38 and K.\luz.\, p. 197. 

• PY (Only) builf 161; 173; they dwelt 132; ixspoil'd 2']^; was spoil'd 
134 = MF 23; 

CG (Only) meant 49; 139 = Ta. 14.5; she smelt 239; I am a spoilt 
man 191. 

Whilst burtit seems to be the only form in PY, REd. and CG, (e. g. 
were burnt PY 109 = CG 154; they bur7it REd. 46, etc.) learnt and learn d 
alternate. Learn d appears however to be the form gen. used, except in 
REd. where only learnt occurs (pp. 42, 46, etc.), e. g: 

CG he learn d 216 = MF 13, CS 46; having learned 100 = MF 43; 
things are learned 197; few learned writers 209; the most learn d 204; —

2. Preterite and past participle ef catch, -work. 

In the preterite the PE 'irregular' form caught is predo- 
minant: 5 caught to 2 catch' d being found. In the pa. pple., 
however, the 'regular' form catch'd, catcht (2 ex.) is even 
commoner than caught (i ex.): 



— is there nothing to be leafttf because we learn t nothing 196 = MF 
33, CS 6; he had learn'd it as a speech as well as learnt .. . 207. 

Regarding other contemp. works I confine mvself to onl3' a few ex: 
TT he dream'd 272; is built 41.246; it burnt 265; had dwelt 243, 
to be dwelt on 143; The Nauplians learned the Art 85; they have learnt 
5; he meant i34 = hitr. 2; it smelt 112; had spoiled 262. 

Sp. is built 266.2; I learned 11 5.8; Things to be spoiled 132; 
the groom has spoiVd the Pad 88.1. 

^ RC II Things catch'd out of the Flames 24. 

PY the People catch'd the Distemper 92; when any one Body had 
catch'd the Distemper 65; he caught 184 — IVork quite as in PE: — they 
uwrk'd on 115; John wrought so upon the Townsmen that they went 
away 165. 

CG Caught (pret. 271, pa. pple. 28) as in PE. — we know not know 
'tis (the intellectuall part) is wrought 109; the strait tree is tvrought with 
less pains than the crooked 109. 

Ta. My Mother catched me in her Arms (Defoe) 18 1.2; — This is 
an effect wrought by meer Lights and Shades 8.1; This Passage wrought 
my Imagination into the following Drama 146.3. 

Sp. The Appearance of the Ghost (in Hamlet) is a Master-piece in 
its kind and tvrought up with all the Circumstances that can create either 
Attention or Horror 44.1; The sound of it was exceeding sweet, and 
wrought into a variet}' of tunes that were inexpressibly melodious 159.2; 
The Materials are no sooner wroifght into Paper 367.3; Utensils wrought 
in Brass 585.7. 

[IVrought was, however, used rather late in the signification oimade, 
even by the very best authors, as will be clear from the following ex. 
from Goldsmith (Stoffel VW): They wrought with chearfulness on days 
of labour, — Further ex. in Storm pp. 686,809.] 

Ev. Caught is practically the only occurring form: — they've caught 
1. 1 60 (Br.) — But yet I have come across one instance of catched in the 



87 

I caught Fish 98.26; Fowls, who I caught 214.6; I would 
have caught one 128.15. — I catch' d it 87.27; I catch' d 
hold of Friday 249.36; we had catcht nothing 24.27; I had 
catch' d 134.28. 

The only instance of wrought in RC, used as a pa. pple. 
occurs on page 79.29: 

I had wrought out some Boards. 

In all other cases the pret. and pa. pple. form of zuork 
is work'd, e. g : 

We ii'ork'd on 13.9; I had work'd so hard 192.24, etc. 
* 

The rather divergent statements of the grammarians con- 
cerning the past tenses of these verbs (catch, tvork) may 
be taken as a reflex of the anything but settled use of 
the day. — Wallis's statement (p. 96): ' Teach, reach, seek, 
beseech, catch, work faciunt taught, raught, sought, besought, 
caught, wrought. Sed et ex his non pauca analogiam retinent 
ut teached, reached, beseeched, catched, worked, etc', seems to 
infer that he preferred the irregular forms to the regular ones. 
The same applies to Greek WOOD who gives caught (only 
this form), 'wrought and ivork'd' . Maittaire, on the other 
hand, seems to prefer the regular form: ' catch' t or caught' and 
Lediard indicates by a + that the irregular forms are in 
his opinion obsolete: 'catcht, + caught; work'd, -f zvroughf . 

In JGr. the above statement by Wallis is, as usual, only 
plagiarized. In JDlCT. the forms are given as follows: 'taught, 
sometimes teached, which is now obsolete; reached, ancient 
preterite raught; sought; besought; catched or caught; tvorked 
or wrougrJif . 



text; but as it is printed in italics, I think the author herewith only 
wanted to indicate it as a rendering of Br:s. own vulgar way of speaking: 
— 'the brother was highly delighted, he said, that his sisters had been 
catched II.79. 



88 



Mixing of strong and weak inflection. 
Preterite and past participle forms of dig; blow, load. 

Dig. Dug is the common form : In the pret. always 
dug, 5 ex.; pa. pple. 4 ex. The pa. pple. form digged occurs 
only once : 

I dug 86.3; I had dug 190.3; 136.3; It was to be dug 
i5o-37i — they were fallen into the Pit they \i'a.A digged '[ox 
others 326.32. ^ 

As far as I can see this is the only instance of digged 
occurring in all the i8th century writings I have gone through. 
In view of Defoe's unusual knowledge of the Bible it is quite 
possible that this passage may only be looked upon as a 
reminiscence thereof; cf. p. 14 and Kriiger III.411. 

Blow. The PE forms blew, bloivn are by far the com- 
monest: 6 pret. blczv, and 4 pa. pple. bloivn; of bloivd (pa. 
pple.) only one instance occurs; e. g : 

It blew 10.13; had it blown 24.21: my Powder being 
Mown up 73.31; I saw some Pieces blown on Shore loo.i 
147.16; — it had blow'd hard 99.33.^ 

Load. Together with the auxiliary verb have the form 
loaded is the only one met with (4 ex.): 



^ PY Dug only: they dug^ had dug 71; be dug 72, etc. 

CG Dug only: is dug up 42, 163, etc. — In other contemp. works 
I have not come across anv ex. of dug^ digged. 

' PY they blow'd up a Watchman 64; the wind blowd from the 
side where. . . 147; — the Wind bleiv 147; he bleiv up the Roof 280. 

CG The post bloiv'd his horn 126 (in a note written by Defoe 
himself). 

TT only blew 149, blown 148, etc. 



89 

I had Grapes to have loaded that Fleet 152.8; 229.15; 
I had loaded my gun 34.6; We had but Httle more than 
loaded our Fusees 355.24. 

With to be, on the other hand, loadcn is practically the 
rule (9 ex.): 

Ships being deep loaden 11. 16; 12. 11; being /(?<7^^// with 
Arms 217.3; 278.14; the Raft was ooerloadeu 65.10; one 
Gun and that loaden with small Shot 206.15; the Musket 
which was loaden 278.8; our Pieces were loaden with Swan 
shot 277.36. 

Only in a single similar instance have I found the form 
loaded used : 

I would place myself in Ambush with my Guns all 
double loaded 199.34.^ 

Note. The PE participle form laden^ on the analogy of which 
loaden was formed, and which is very often found in the 'exactly reprinted 
editions' is not found in RC. Cf. note i below. 



^ RC II a loaden Ship. 12. 

PY Servants loaded witli Baggage 9. — Vessels loaden with corn 
252; Goods to be tinloaden 175; — The inf. form is gen. (tt}j)lade, e. g. 
246, 247 ; to unlade . . . the Vessels loaden with Corn 256. 

CG be loaded and opprest with heavy particles 85; His estate is 
heavily loaded 250; — the\' left him loaden with wealth 6; a musqueteer 
loaden with 7 bullets 30. 

TT They have loaded him with Curses 301. — Air loaden hy Words 
39; Pockets loaden with Stones 204; laden with his Spoils 274. 

Ta. Vessels laden with Corn 21.25. 

Sp. I saw them march out, the Brother loaded with a great cheese 
266.5; ^he Thames loaded ^'xih. ,. , 454,3. — The Men would have loaden 
themselves 499.3; Sticks loade?i with Lead 11 5.8; Men as heavy loaden 
as... 558.6; finding herself so overloaden 499.4; 499.5. 



90 

Note. In PE the verbs {ci)wake and stuell may occur both with 
weak and strong forms. See Kruger II. 157 ff; III.411 fl; Sweet pp. 414, 
419. — In RC the weak forms are the onlv ones occurring, e. g: the 
Noise awak'd me 94.8; when I awak'd in. 15; when I ivak'd ^i\.T,i; in. 5, 
etc. (5 ex.); his Ankles were very much swell' d with the Bandage 284.9; 
358.36. — Between Jiang d and Jning the difi'erence in use and signification 
is quite the same as is given by NED, e. g: I hung my Sword 274.2; 

tlie Hair hung down 176.13; lie v.'ould be hang'd 318.31, etc. In PY 

(a)uiake and Jiang are inflected in the same way as in RC, e. g: he 
aicaJced 107, lie lias been hang'd 99, etc. — TT having sivelled himself 
(usually) 245; sirollen up by 243. 

* 

As is well known there is in the language, and esp. in 
the speech of the lower classes, a general tendency to uni- 
formity in the verb inflection, either by keeping to the old 
weak forms, or by replacing the strong forms by weak ones. 
That this tendency was very strong in the 17th and the 
beginning of the i8th century appears clearly enough, 
not only from the writings of the acknowledged best authors 
of the early part of the i8th century.^ 

Thus, for instance, Wallis states (p. 95): 'Item (see 
p. 80) promiscue formantur Participia sozvn, loaden, laden; 
atque, sow' d, sheivd, hezv'd inow'd, loaded, laded' (I). ^ To 
these weak forms he adds (p. 97) some others dealing with 
the pret. and pa. pple. forms of verbs like take, speake, etc. 
suggesting here that some verbs instead of the common pret. 
and pa. pple. form took, ivoke, etc. (see p. 81) have another

weak form due to analogy with the weak verbs as: zvaked, 
aivaked, beared, sheared, zceared (ed. 1688), lueaved, thrived, 
cJioosed, etc. (II). And some few lines further below he says 
under 'Preterita imperfecta': dreiv, blew kneiv, etc., and 'Parti- 
cipia Passiva per en : drazvn knaivn blojuji, etc.: 'Sed et 
utrobique draivd, snow'd, throio'd, blozvd, croiv d (III). More- 
over in connection with pret. and pa. pple. forms of vbs. 
such as ztw, spin. etc. (IV) he says (p. 96): 'Sed et utrobique 
forma analogia fere in omnibus retinetur, ut spinned, szvimmed, 
etc'. 

Of the grammarians of Defoe's day Brightland (p. 93 
ft'.) almost entirely follows Wallis's statements and differs 
from him only in so far as he leaves out the weak form 
throjvd, but on the other hand he professes a preference for 
the weak pret. form of bloxu: 'bleiv (or rather bloiv'd/. — 
Greenwood certainly copied Wallis's statement I; the same 
is the case with JGr. As regards other verbs pointed out 
it may be worth while to note the following. Of the verbs 
awake, blozu, ha7ig, he gives exclusively strong forms; the 
pret. and pa. pple. forms of dig, szvell and thrive, however, 
he quotes in the following manner: dug and '^digged; siueld 
pret; sivoln or swel'd pa. pple.; throve and '^thrived. ['Those 
that have this Mark* before them are not proper or usual'. — 
Note by Gr.]. — h.Y.'DlkKD gives aivoke, awake; blow' d, bloiv'd; 
digged, dug; hangd. As he is silent concerning load and 
swell, I think we may, judging from his general predilection 
for weak forms, presume that he regards the weak forms 
loaded, szvell'd to be the only 'usual and proper' ones. 

If we now compare Wallis's statements with the forms 
given by Dr. JOHNSON, we find that a decided change in the 
language took place in the middle of the i8th cent. — JGr., 
which otherwise plagiarizes Wallis practically word for word, 
has in part completely excluded his statements III and IV; 
in section II the verbs beared, choosed, thrived are omitted. 
— In JDict. we find only strong forms in the pa. pple. of load 
and inozv (I). Likewise only strong forms of spin, zviji (IV), 
blozv, drazv, throzv (III) are given. In the case of crozv 
double forms are quoted; of snozv only the weak inflection 



92 

is given. Sheared, zveaved and wrmged are ce''tainly placed 
on the same level as the corresponding strong forms: pret. 
shore and sheared^ pa. pple. shorn; pret. wove and weaved, 
pa. pple. zvoven and toeaved; ivringed and wrung; but accor- 
ding to his opinion the weak forms of shine, strive and tJirive 
do not belong to the ordinary use of the language of his 
period. All the other verbs in section II are given with the 
strong forms only. — The forms given as correct by Ward 
agree on the whole with PE standard use. 

The possibility is not to be entirely lost sight of that 
Dr. Johnson, on account of the sway he held by reason of 
his Dictionary, and by means of the opinions expressed by him 
therein, may have influenced his contemporary authors and 
probably in this way hastened the disappearance from literary 
English of such weak forms as those mentioned above. What- 
ever the circumstances may be (cf. Bradley p. 51), it is, 
however, a fact that this levelling tendency began to receive 
a check already in the latter part of the i8th century and 
in Ev., for example, it is only the extremely vulgar Madame 
Duval whom the author makes use such forms. ^ 

Concerning PE use see NED and modern gram, works, 
esp. Hall (p. 206) Otir grandfathers'' English and Recent Ex. 
p. 65, where numerous instances of all these forms mentioned 
above are given. 



Auxiliaries. 

Wert. The modern analogical wast has displaced the 
etymological ivere, chiefly under the influence of Tindale and 
the Bible; the intermediate wert (Shakespeare's form) prevailed 
in literature during the 17th and i8th centuries, and has 
been used by many 19th century writers (NED). — In RC 
wert is the only form occurring: 



* Ev. what is becovied of my hair II. 31; have coined II. 150; So you 
are corned here II.131; you knowed 1. 122; II.32; had lumt'd 1. 123; he had 
shooked W i^,; is looked u^ II. 14. 



93 

Why is it that thou wcrt not long ago destroy'd? Why 
wert thou not drown'd io8.'?4.* 

Lediard (p. 427) mentions the occurrence of ivcrt for 
wast, which he thinks is 'ein Vitium und also gar nicht zu 
gebrauchen'. 



Wa'n't. This form, that is sometimes met with in i8th 
century dramatists, occurs a couple of times in Defoe: 

I warrant yow were frighted, wan't you 8.37.' 



^ For further ex. from i8ih cent, authors see NED. 
' CG I think you was nurst abroad, irafit vou 51. 

In this connection, I think, I may be allowed to call attention to the 
very common 18th cent, use of was instead of tuej'e when referring to 
only one person, now generally considered rather careless, e. g: 

CG yoti was nurst abroad, wa'nt you 51; Was noi you at the tavern 
226; — yott ivas so sharp upon me 49. [The last words are the utteran- 
ces of the younger, 'educated' brother]. 

Sp. You unis my Master's Friend [in a letter from a butler] 517.2. 

Ev. li yoic wasn't the most impudentest person II. 153; 1. 95 (D); 'twas 
plaguy unlucky, you was not whh him II. 15 {c); you ivas never so happy 
II. 1 20 (Br.); you are paler than you was 1II.8; \.i you teas not the cruellest 
angel III.77. [The last two passages are put in the mouth of a lord]. 

As will be seen from the examples given, it is not only in the 
speech of vulgar and careless people that we find this peculiarity; it was 
widely spread long after the middle of the cent., even among persons 
of rank and education; (cf. NED; Hall p. 206; Storm pp. 745, 755; 
Sweet p. 426). 

This usage is also sanctioned by the grammarians of the day. 
Lediard (p. 427) refers to it in the following note: 'Im Imperfecto gar 
oft mit dem Pronomen im Plural you und mit dem Verbum im Singular 
ivas: you was, statt ivere . — The same is stated by Greenwood p. 164: 
'Singular: You tvet'e ox you was bicrning (cf. an ex. on page 167: 'What 
ivas you a doi?tg.- /was' . . .), and Gr. 1737 p. 85: 'thou wast or you 
was burning ; Plural : ye or you were . . . 



94 

The form occurring together with other expressions deno- 
ting colloquial language (you re, d'ye, etc.) may possibly be 
looked upon as an attempt at giving a dialectal touch to 
the speech of the simple sailor in whose mouth they are put. 



B. Periphrastic Tenses, 

I. The formation of the perfect and phiperfect of 
certain intransitive verbs. 

The OE and — though to a less extent — the ME 
mode of forming the perfect and pluperfect of all intransitive 
verbs with to be, still survives as a very characteristic feature 
of the language of Defoe and other i8th century authors in 
general, esp. so far as verbs of motion, change (increasing, 
decreasing) and the like are concerned. — In the following 
collection of examples, which I trust is fairly complete, I 
have adduced all such verbs as in ME historical grammars, 
etc. are generally given as occurring conjugated with be. By 
this statistical investigation, I think I have proved that in 
RC the use of be is far commoner than that of have. Con- 
cerning other works of Defoe I regret that I have had no 
opportunity of making equally careful researches, but I pre- 
sume one would not be far wrong in saying that in the 
other works of Defoe at least, more or less the same pheno- 
mena occur as in RC;^ with Defoe's contemporaries this use 



^ The examples which I have collected from PY (287 pp.), illustrating 
the relative frequency of have and be, have left upon me the impression 
that the use of be is even more frequent there than in RC. — Owing to 
the great difference in subject and treatment between RC and CG it is 
not in the least surprising to find such a small number, comparatively 
speaking, of instances of verbs conjugated with io be in CG. The propor- 
tion between the use of the two auxiliaries seems, however, to be the 
same as in RC. Cf p. loi. 



95 

». 

seems to be somewhat less in favour. — In the latter part 
of the century the use seems to be very much on the decrease, 
the examples found in Ev. (700 pp.) not being very numerous. ^

99 

Especially noteworthy is the case when be is used with 
verbs of motion, even when they are followed by an object, 
or when the verb followed by a preposition forms a phrase 
equivalent to a transitive verb e. g: 

This is befallen us 15. 

we were entred a vast great Forest 349. 

we were pass'd the Height of the Mountains, without 
being imcumbred with tlie Snow 346; we had some rough 
Way to pass yet ... he bid us be easy, we should soon be 
past it all 346. 

when I was got through the Strait 211; he was gotten 
over his Fright 274. — Further examples above. 

In consideration of Defoe's pronounced predilection for 
the perfect infinitive (cf Introduction p. 10) one is prepared 
to expect such phrases as the following: 

It was my Business to be gone before the Tide began 
66; Fowls who stood watching till I should be gone 136; 

24; ^(>- 

It blew so hard before they could be gotten a Quarter 
of their Way 282. 



General observations concerning the examples. 

In certain instances it is no easy matter to decide — even 
from an i8th century point of view — whether certain forms, 
e. g. was broken 49.28; were driven 48.34 are to be consi- 
dered as an actual perfect tense = PE had broken, etc. or 
whether we have to do with a real passive. 



The following examples, few as they are in comparison 
with those previously given, are the only ones where the auxi- 
liary have is used with similar verbs: 



Abate, the Wind having abated over Night, the Sea was 
calm 163. 

Arrive. I had arriv'd to some Diversions 213. 

Befall. The Miseries that had befallen me 103. 

Break, some Bears had broke into the Village 358. 

Come, J ex. We thought our Anchor had come home 10; 
a Contemplation, which often had eon/e to my Thoughts 207; 
— I had come this Voyage only for a Trial 15; 123; 229. 

Drive, see row. 

Enter, 2 ex. An Offence which I ]iad not entred into a 
Discussion of 201; 306. 

Fall, many Europeans who had fallen into their Hands . . .

Float. I saw the Ship had floated with the Tide and was 
driven on Shore 81. 

Get (got), 5 ex. we might have got under the Lee of 
the Land 50; 19; 55.13, 23; 60. — Get (gotten) 2 ex. 80; 
163 (cf. p. 78). 

Go, 9 ex. I could perceive the Goats had gone in 171; 
I was inclin'd to ha' gone on Shoar 32; — I had not gone 
three Steps in, but... 210; when I had gofie through this 
Work, I... 150; 151; 169; 194; 340; 357. 

Jump. They had jump' d into a Canoe 278.

Ru/i, J ex. we had no sooner run out of the Cabbin . . . 
but 48; as her Forecastle had run on with great Violence, 
her Mainmast was... 226; 326. 

Spread. The Vines had spread over the Trees 116. 

Sail. I would not stop 'till I had sail'd five Days 26.

Strike. The Ship having struck upon the Sand 49. 



Si?ik. he look'd so amaz'd tliat I thought he would /lave 
sunk down 250. 

IVafider. Savages, who had wander' d out to Sea 183.^ 



In hypothetical clauses, where the condition is rejected, 
the use of haw is practically the rule, both in the subordinate 
and principal clause: 

if they had come down 191. 

if God had ... he would have come better Cloath'd 302. 

Money, which if I had eseap'd, would have lain safe 229. 

to have fallen into the Hands of any of the Savages, 
had been as bad as to have fallen into ... 28. 

had I not gotten up, it would have been so 163. 

had I used ... I had certainly never gone away 46; 
had haizy Weather interveiid, I had been undone 165. 

otherwise they would have landed at my Door 297. 

had it returned, I . . . 52. 

had not the man run ... I had dy'd 338, etc. etc. 

The following are the only cases where in all contempo- 
rary works perused by me be is used in a similar connection: 

they only waited till I was gone ... for as I walk'd 
off as if I was gone, they. . . RC 137. 

if the Disease was, as I may say, only frozen up it 
would have returned to its usual Force, when . . . CG 235. 



' As on pp. 95, 96 I have given in footnotes comparative examples 
illustrating the use of to be in other works than RC, I ought, in order 
to be consistent, in the same way to have given instances showing the 
use of to have in the same works. But this would have swelled unduly 
the bulk of my book, and moreover, for sufficiently obvious reasons, 
would be practically superfluous. 



Only two of all the grammatical works examined by me 
devote any special attention to this question. — Maittaire 
(p. 82 ff.) contents himself merely with mentioning the occur- 
rence of 'some sorts of verbs which are declined partly Acti- 
\ely, partly Passively as / have g07ie, I am gone, I have been 
gone". Some lines below he tells us that 'such forms of verbs 
as / am entered the Toztm^ I am passed the River resemble 
what the Latins and Greeks call Deponent verbs, because 
they have indeed a Passive ending, but lay aside the Passive 
signification'. 

Lediard, however, gives (p. 475) a somewhat more de- 
tailed account of the difference in use and signification of 
the auxiliaires be and have with ' Neutro-Passivd . Be, he 
says, is used to denote 'dass die angedeutete Bewegung von 
einem Orte oder Zustande in einen anderen in der That 
geschehen say, oder nun wiirklich werde geschehen seyn 
oder nicht: / am arrivd^ I shall be arrivd\ — dass man 
nach einer solchen gewissen, wiirklich geschehenen Bewegung 
fragt, e. g. Is he arrived} Was he arriv d? Will he be 
arrivd? oder eine solche wiirklich geschehene Bewegung 
presupponiert, e. g. Do you knoiv whether he were arrived" . 
In other cases 'wen man indefinite ohne von dieser gewissen, 
wiirklich geschehenen Bewegung zu gedenken, redet', have 
is used 'wie bei den anderen Neutris'. 

He then gives the following verbs which he considers 
as typical examples of those belonging to this category: 
'arrive, become, befall, come, (decay), ^ depart, decease, enter, 
escape, fall, fly, go, grow, meet, pass, return, rise, run, stray, 
turn, vanish, (wither) und dergleichen'. — These statements 
of Lediard have merely been copied by Arnold p. 51. 

JGr. despatches in a couple of lines the conjugation 
of the 'Neuter passives'. In his opinion expressions like / 
am risen, I was walked out (exieram) answer nearly to the 
reciprocal verbs in French(!). 

In these statements of Lediard I think we find expressed the 
decided difference in conception between the linguistic usage

of the 1 8th century and PE, especially as regards verbs of 
motion; in the i8th century the element of action falls into 
the background, and the language pays chief regard to the 
state arrived at. In PE the real perfect tense is formed with 
to have only. The participle of verbs of motion preceded 
by to be has now the character of an adjective, and denotes 
the situation in which the subject is placed at the conclusion 
of the action expressed by the verb rather than the action 
itself. — Cf. besides NED; Stoffel VW and Storm pp. 
660, 937. 



2. The periphrasis \vith to do. 

In ME, and especially in Early MnE, the periphrastic forms 
with to do : I did come, I did not come, did I come, etc. occur 
very frequently without any perceptible difference of sense 
side by side with the simple forms of the principal verb: / 
came, I came not, came I. These alternate forms are merely 
employed as caprice, convenience, euphony or clearness of 
construction suggests (Sweet II. 88).^ In PE, however, a 
decided distinction is as a rule drawn between these con- 
structions. — In the language of Defoe and his contempo- 
raries the PE usage was as yet far from settled. 

I. In affirmative sentences, consequently, we very often 
find instances of do used without obviously adding anything 
to the meaning of the verb with which it is connected, e. g: 

Now the' we thought that the Wind did a little abate, 
yet ... we were ... 49; All these Things, which I ought 
to have consider'd well of, and did cast up in my Thoughts 
afterwards, yet took up none of my Apprehensions at first

did melt or run 142.

Note. In some of the above instances — esp. those in the condi- 
tional clauses — the use of tlie periphrastic form may possibly already 
have acquired the same character as it has in PE, viz. to lay greater em- 
phasis on the verb. — For information concerning the PE usage of the 
unemphatic do in affirmative sentences see esp. the works given in note

2. In 7iegatii>e sentences, on the other hand, the language 
of Defoe, etc. often still retains several instances of the simple 
construction without the auxiliary do as, e. g. I came not, etc.^ 

He ansiver'd not one Word, but look'd very grave and 
sad 268; I found a Kind of wild Pidgeons, who built not

For inst. from Sp. see Dietze pp. 29, 33. 

^ In PE this practice still survives in certain stereotyped adverbial 
parenthetic phrases; cf. ESt. 24.71; Kruger III.425; Poutsm.\ p. 85. 

' PY Hay was sold at 4 I. per Load in the Market just beyond

forgot not to contribute to the Relief of the Poor 59; People have it 
when they knoiu it not 221, 225 etc.; they fcneiv not what to do 155, etc., 



io6 

The periphrastic form is, however, by far the com- 
monest: 

I did not care to go 28; iii; 327; we did not design 
to . . . 36; he did not doubt but ... 361; he did not 7?)' 33 ; 
they did not hear 36; which I did not see 55; 144; 1 did fiot 
take nor did I chew iii; Fowls which I did not understafid 
84, etc. etc. 

The verb to know forms the single exception to this usage, 
as with this verb the simple forms are by far the most fre- 
cjuent. This is especially the case when knozu is preceded or 



etc.; it matter d not from whence it come i; I slept tiot that Night 83;

followed by an indirect interrogative sentence (cf. my stati- 
stics page 1 08): 

I saw Fowls, but Ivieiv not their Kinds 61 — what 
kind of one to make I knew not 85 — I knew not how it 
came there qi; I knew not whither I should steer 23; the 
Mouth of a little River, I knew not what 26 (cf the French 
'je ne sais ([uoi').^ 

In sejitnices tvitJi inverted zvoni-onier introduced by 
neither, nor, the periphrasis is practically the rule. (For PE 
use see Poutsma p. 80 ff.). Examples: 

I knew not, neither did I so much as consider whither . . . 
23; 7teither did I know how. . . 85; neither did I see any 
Prospect 53 — nor did I know what to do 144; nor did I 
see any Possibility of . . . 164; nor did Men always square 
their Dealings by . . . 289; nor did\ taJze the Pains 214, etc. etc. 

Only in one single instance have I found the simple 
form in a sentence of this description: 

neit/ier knew I how to weave it, or spin it 144. 



With mcxiliaries, and esp. the verbs dai'e and need^ peri- 
phrasis never occurs (For PE use see Poutsma p. Sj ff.): 

I durst not sleep 80; if he durst not leave 327, etc; 
neither durst I stir from the Posture 59. 

I need not repeat 236; we found that we need not take 
such Pains 2g; I needed not hunt any more 197. 

In the negative imperative of to be, however, the peri- 
phrastic form is the only one occurring: 

do not be frighted 273. 



^ For further particulars, esp. as to / kiwir not, etc. see ESt. 9.235; 
Storm p. 490; Sweet II.91. 



io8 

In order to establish the relation between simple and 
periphrastic forms in negative sentences, I have perused the 
first I lo pages of RC, where I found no less than ttventy 
instances of the negative know used without do (pp. 15, 16, 
21, 23, 26, 26, 27, 29, 32, 50, 58, 60, 61, 61, 84, 85, 91, lOI, 
106, 109), while the periphrastic form only occurs three times 
(pp. 5, 12, 29). As the corresponding figures for other verbs 
(auxiliaries and sentences with inverted word-order not included) 
2ire four (pp. 50, 61, 89, 98) and ^z^/^/^^;^ respectively (pp. 5, 6, 
17, 19, 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 36, 52, 54, 55, 6d>, 70, 84, 102, 
103) it is obvious that Dietze's statements p. 46, that Defoe 
in his 'Robinson out of 46 instances employs the simple form 
no less than 20 times (43,5 ^/o) are quite wrong. 



3. As regards interrogative sentences, the language of RC 
and other contemporary works of the same character does 
not seem to deviate essentially from PE: 

Dost thou ask, What I have done 109; how did \ come 
here 169; ^"ye see what charming Weather 'tis now g; how 
do I know what ... 202 — - Did not you come Eleven of 
you... i2\ do not you wish 266, etc. etc. 

The following are the only instances found in RC: 

How came you to be taken 253.27, 30; what matters 
it if. .. 133.1 



* PY How came it to stop so long 235; Sayest thou so, said I 126. 

CG But harke ye, Sir, said I (Defoe) how come you to understand 
Latin 188; how comes a fool to convey strong capascities 108; Say you 
so nephew, said I (Defoe) 196. 

PC How came you upon that Scratch 384; how came your ladyship 
to go to that puppet-show 397; 456; How does your lady unknown 434; 
how does your neighbour 441; Tom, what say you to that 445. 

Ev. Pray, how goes time III. 17; What say y on to a strole in the 
garden III.18; What signifies asking them girls I.190. (c); Lord, what 
signifies that (Br. J II. no. 



log 

Similar constructions, which seem to have been very- 
common in the spoken language of the time — see the 
examples given in the note p. io8 — occasionally survive in 
present colloquial English, but are either felt as archaic or 
as influenced by the dialects. Cf. notes pp. 103, 105. 



As I suggested above, it may often be very difficult to 
determine whether in affirmative sentences do was used to 
intensify the sense of the verb, or not. — The first gram- 
marian to explicitly mention the emphatic use of do is Wallis 
who says on p. 106: 'Do et did indicant emphatice tempus 
praesens et imperfectum, / burn, vel (emphatice) / do burn 
etc'. This statement we afterwards find either only trans- 
lated or more or less remodelled and explained by all the 
grammarians of the i8th cent. On the other hand we also 
very often find merely such alternative examples as / burn 

— / do burn, etc. (Greenwood, Jones p. 41) given without 
any information whatever, as to whether there is any difference 
in emphasis intended, or not. — Besides mentioning the 'em- 
phatic' use of do, S. Johnson calls attention to this 'super- 
fluous' use of do which, he says, 'is considered as a vicious 
mode of speech'. 

The periphrasis with do in negative sentences is first 
mentioned by MiEGE (p. 89) who declares it to be the rule. 

— Brightland (p. 112), dealing with the word-order in a 
question, merely gives a couple of alternative examples 'Does 
Stephen zvriter, burn I? burnst thou? or dost thou bum?' — 
Greenwood does the same in a note 'on the placing of 
nof (merely copied from Wallis): It burned not, it did not 
burn, it burned me not. In another connection, however, he 
tells us more decidedly 'that we make use of the Helping 
verb do, especially with the Adverb not, as / do not burn, I 
did not do if. — About its use in interrogative sentences 
he does not give us any views of his own. 

In Arnold (p. 86) we certainly find the following 
examples: '/ luiite — / write not. Read you? or do you read?' 



but on pp. (41 and) 88 he declares that 'Wenn man im Pre- 
sent! oder Imperfecto fraget oder verneinet so wird solches 
durch ... do ausgedruckt: Do 7iot I say it?, he doth not mind 
it; Did I know that? — hoiu d'ye do (p. 41). 

While Johnson establishes that the periphrastic form 
is the rule in interrogative sentences, and in the 'imperative 
prohibitory', he is a little more cautious in his utterances as 
to its use in negative sentences: 'by custom at least', he says, 
'this appears more easy than the other (simple) form'. — 
Ward's statements in all respects agree with those of PE 
grammarians. 

Concerning the use of do with auxiliaries the i8th cen- 
tury grammars I have examined give no information. 



VII. The adjectival adverb. 

The distinctions drawn between the adjectival adverb and 
the adverbs in ly in present day English both by the best 
authors and the grammarians are in many respects much 
finer than a couple of centuries ago.^ 

Though in some cases the flat adverb is still the only 
one used in standard English, a great many of the instances, 
esp. as regards the intensives, found in the best authors 
of the lyth^ and i8th cent, are no longer used in the 



^ For information as to the origin and development of these forms 
see Koch II. 297; Matzner II. 290; Sweet 428; Earle: Engl. Prose 263, 
Engl. Phil. 408; Kruger II. 60 ff., III.125 flf.; Abbott 17; Franz 74 and Fr. 
Synt. ioi, and in the special treatises by Beckman, Borst and Stoffel. 
— Besides in these works the usage of the flat adverb in modern collo- 
quial, vulgar, and dialectal English is more fully treated in Storm 722, 
727 ff., where references to a great number of additional grammars are 
to be found; 872, 900—902 (Anier. Engl); Fr. Dial. 231; Wright 298; 
Anglia 7.258 (Negro-Engl). 

' For this see especially Abbott 17; Frakz 74; Vodoz 97. 



higher strata of the language, having, as is often the case 
with many of the hnguistic phenomena adduced in this trea- 
tise, degenerated into the lower phases: the colloquial, vulgar 
and dialectical language. They still survive, especially in the 
two last mentioned cases, with at the very least the same 
vitality as in the days of Shakespeare, and Defoe, the flat 
intensive being there almost the only one occurring even in 
connection with a verb-form (Borst p. 24). 



The statements of the grammarians on this point are 
very scanty, being no doubt due to their considering them 
as quite good and correct English. 

From the early part of the century LediaRD (p. 498) is 
the only one who mentions the existence of the flat adverb, on 
the whole. He divides the adverbs into three classes: 
'l. Radices: here — 2. Derivata mit Zusetzung der Endung -ly: 
wisely — 3. Adverbia per Accidens, die nur zufalliger Weise 
Adverbia werden; diese sind eigentlich adjektiva, die in ihren 
wesentlichen Buchstaben bisweilen adverbaliter gebraucht 
werden (e. g. I am mighty hungry, I have shewn you clear 
the contrary)'. 

Even by the latter part of the i8th century the use of 
the flat intensive seems to have already been in a fair way 
to loose its former popularity in standard English. This may 
also be gathered from the following statement of PeggE: 'The 
best of us generally use the adjective for the adverb, where 
there is any degree of comparison to be expressed: How 
extreme cold the weather is'. (In the edition 1843 — 44 this 
note is added: 'Quite out of use now'). 



A. Used as an intensive. 
1. Qualifying an adjective. 

In the works of the classical authors at the beginning of 
the 1 8th cent, and especially in Defoe, the use of the flat 



112 

adverb as intensifying a following adjectival word or an ad- 
verb was in my opinion far commoner than the corresponding 
inflectional form, which, concerning RC at least, will be evi- 
dent from the comparative occurrences of the two different 
forms: 

with a great deal of Pains, and aivkward tedious 
stitching I made .... 270.28; a chai-niing fine Evening follow'd 
8.23; when I saw them clear red I let them stand in that 
Heat about 5 or 6 Hours 142.31; The Bear comes after 
him taking Devilish long Strides 350.10; the Sea went dreadful 
high 49.35; it rain'd exceeding hard 83.1; the Weather being 
exceeding hot 130.27; my Partner was grown exceeding Rich 
333-9; 40-25; 85.18; 88.11, etc., 10 ex. 

Exceeding — the fashionable intensive for excellence at 
the beginning of the i8th century — enjoyed then the same 
amount of popularity as vastly in the middle of the century 
and ai^fiuUy in PE. (See Borst pp. 36, 124, 158; cf. Storm p. 
730). — Side by side with exceeding, but far less in favour, stand 
extreme^ excelloU and excessive: 

The Grapes were excelle7it good 120.5; The Botdes held 
two Pound of excellent good Tohdicco 325.15; Negroes were 
bought, and those excessive dear 44.17; the Weather being 
excessive hot 83.28; 92.33; the Weather being extreme hot 
216.4; I saw a most frightful old Yit-Goa.\. 191. 8. 

Used as an intensive to an adjective (adverb), etc. mighty 
is, as far as I can see, the only occurring form throughout 
the 18th century.^ 

I began to be mighty impatient 215.26; Well, says he, 
mighty affectionately 259.24; he was mighty well pleas'd 246.30, 
etc., 7 ex. 

a monstrous great one 31.36; growing so monstrous 
thick 191. 8; I %dc^ perfect green Barley 90.35; it was a /f;77(^/(? 



^ The following passage is interesting to show how strictly the distinc- 
tion was maintained even in the 17th cent.; 'I am mightily pleased with it 
and think it )nighty ivitty' < Pepys's Diary (see Storm p. 731).

With the exception of a couple of forms [tnonstrously, 
vastly, see below) the above quoted flat forms dreadful, ex- 
cessive, mighty, etc. are the only ones occurring as intensives 
before adjectives and adverbs in RC. — 

BoRST's statement (p. 58) 'Im 18. Jahrh. finden sich dann 
auch in dieser Stellung beide Formen neben einander (so bei 
Defoe und noch bei Miss Burney 1778)' is based as far as 
Defoe is concerned, on the example 'it rained exceedingly 
hard' found on p. 28 in the edition (Routledge) he has used. 
Unfortunately this form does not occur in RC, the form being 
exceeding as usual (see above ex. 83.1). Another similar 
error, due to his using a modern reprint, which are in no re- 
spect trustworthy from a linguistic point of view (cf. p, XXXVI) 
is found on p. 60: 'excessively hot (83.28) instead o( excessive hot. 
His 'quotation' from Defoe (p. 133 'wonderfully') is also 
wrong (see below ex. 319.18). His other 'quotations' I have 
not found it necessary to verify. 

* 

The following are the only passages I have come across 
where the inflectional adverb occurs in RC the same as in PE: 

admirably well 143.19; I was most inexpressibly sick 
7.17; inexpressibly dreadful 102.17; I was w^^r/j' thoughtless 



As will be seen from these examples the flat intensive is only used 
by very careless or vulgarly speaking persons. 

* 

In the speech of the educated personages, on the other hand, only 
the inflectional form occurs, e. g: 

he was so exceedingly officious 1. 183; your Lordship is extremely 
good II. 1 47; your constitution is iftfi?iifely deticate III.28; U'onderfutty inge- 
nious 1. 192. 

Only twice have I come across instances of the flat adv.: 'an exceeding 
good concert 1. 182. [Cf. exceedingly officious only next page]. It is some- 
thing mighty tet'rific in becoming a countess' III. 206. 

For further ex. chiefly out of the classical authors ol the iStli cent, 
see Beckm.\n, Borst, Franz (ESt. 18) and Stor.m in works and places 
referred to above, and last but not least NED. 



of a God, acted like a meer Brute, and by the Dictates of 
common Sense only, and indeed hardly that 103.34; mon- 
strously heavy 350.35; severely cold 344. 24; a severely cold 
(B severe cold) Season 360.11; I was sincerely thankful 
233.10; strangely hard 142.8; vastly big 160.37; wonderfully 
well 319.18.^ 



2. Qualifjing a past participle. 

In this connection the inflectional adverb is practically 
the only one occurring: 

I was dreadfully frighted 168.21; I was exceedingly 
diverted with this journey 128.25; ^ excessively fafigu'd c^g. 2^; 
I was heartily scar'd 93.19; I ^a.s perfectly astonish' d go. ■^2; 
my Thoughts were sadly disturbed 109.9; I was terribly 
surpriz'd 215.4; a Knife, which he yiKS ivonderfully delighted 
with 263.15, etc, etc." 

Only in the subsequent few cases have I found examples 
of the flat adverb, used as a verb intensive, completely 
differing from PE usage: 

. . . look back upon a dreadful misspent Life 108.32; 
I made a. formal f ram' d Door-Case 247.10; I was sore put 
to it for Neccesaries 284.34.' 



^ CG I have been exceedingly ill (in Defoe's letter) X. — This is 
the only instance of exceedingly , used as an adjective intensive, found by 
me in Defoe. 

' CS he was mightily pleas' d 44. 

PY the Plague was exceedtftgly advanced 144; the Gentlemen were 
exceedingly pleas' d 191; 

TT a Person exceedingly disposed to run away 182; the Bulls were 
extremely vitiated <fi\ the Opinions were extremely misrepresented 158. 

Sp. excessively ill-bred 145.5; extremely pleas' d 202.2\ he is tnightily 
concerned 140.2. 

^ CG he was never satisfved with knowing and never exceeding 
delighted z\so in the success 208; — RC II. I v^iiS most sensible touch' d ib

B. Used as a purely adverbial adjunct. 

In the early MnE period, the i6th and also, although to 
a far smaller extent, e. g. in Shakespeare, in the 17th cent.^ 
the flat adverb, of whatever origin, could also be used as a 
purely adverbial adjunct. In the beginning of the 1 8th cent., 
however, such expressions as: give bountiful, ample beloved, 
gejitle tell me (see Franz p. 75) were probably considered 
as no longer correct. Amongst other things this will be seen 
from the fact that Rowe (cf. p. 46) in his edition of Shake- 
speare alters them into the corresponding inflectional form. 
Examples : 

rapid Currents which ran constantly on both Sides 
224.27; I was earnestly begging 112.35; The Ship \\a.s taken 
effectually 323.7; this refresh' d me exceedingly 84.21: I liv'd 
happily 169.36; the Wind rose hastily 66.27; It wou'd have 
crusht it involuntarily, if . . . 222.37; my Cloaths began to 
decay too mightily 15 8.1; Vessels, which I wanted sorely 
141. 3, etc. 

In a great number of other cases, however, the usage was 
not quite settled, especially when the adverb originally had 
been an adjective, used in the neutral singular, or in cases 
where the adverb is only a descendant of an OE adverb in 
-e which in a later state of development of the language lost 
its original adverbial suffix and became identical in form with 
the adjective. — In many cases it is often very difficult to 
decide if the form in question is to be conceived as an ad- 
junct to the subject (object), or to the verb of the sentence. 

While according is still used in conjunction with a follov*'- 
ing to or as, e. g: — according as the ivi7id blew this current 
came nearer 178. 1 8 — according alone is now obsolete:

117 

I would kill that Bird; according I fir'd 250.30; if 1 
arrived I should make some Acquaintance; and according 
I prepair'd to go for England 341.17. 

In the last example B has accordingly, which is far and 
away the most usual form (11 ex.): 

I accordingly set them at Liberty 328.4; I learn'd to 
divide them so, as to provide for them accordingly 122.19. 

Preceded by a comparative -I- thoji, conivwn, ordinary, 
usual are the only forms occurring in RC: 

the Hawk had no Talons more than conunon 61.22; I 
thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary 5.29; 17.20; 
122.5; ^ ^^^ ^o Pain more than ordinary 231.34, 309.31 
lying longer than usual 21.18. — But 'he does not usually 
attempt them' 348.24. 

I finish'd them very compkat making a small Stay, and 
a Sail to it 271.3; I saw how plainly . . . how easy, how com- 
fortably he had liv'd 8.9; the Ship might ride as easy as possible 
10.23; they were easily perswaded 314.34; I might very easily 
bring my Boat about the Island 178.31 ; my Head run niig/ifily 
upon the Thought of getting... 147.9; I ^^.s nothing near 
so anxious 70.13; I run out near a League 24.34; many 
Things were either quite gone or near spent 156.36; 
he talk'd so articulately and plain 213.14 (cf. laughing 
loud 352.30); we could see them plainly 312.7; having 
stow'd my Boat very safe I went on Shore 167.30; there 
was scarce any Condition 77.19; I could scarce ha' fail'd 
45.14; scarce credible 89. i, etc. 

The forms nearly, scarcely commonly used in present 
standard English were evidently very scarce in i8th century 
literature. In all the works examined by me there is, as 
fas as I can see, not a single example of them; cf. Beckman. 

he was easily perswaded to joyn very sincere with us 314.34 
(B has sincerely); I slept very sound 323.17; I slept soundly

189.10, 81.20; (cf. I slept very (^z/zV/Zy 64.1); (we) living very 
sparing on our Provisions 32.12; I did it then very sparingly 
95.18; I contented my self to use it moiG sparing/j 122.13;

96, 266, etc.; the Plague was sca^re begun 281, etc.; 

CG the steward writes vzxy fine and spells well too 130; he danc d
