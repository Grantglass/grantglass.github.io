KAY &. BROTHER, PRINTERS.PREFACE.

THIS instructive and entertaining history was
written about one hundred and fifty years ago, by a
very ingenious and celebrated person, Daniel De
Foe. Before he became an author, he was a hosier,
and then a pantile maker; but in business he did
not succeed, and he sunk into great distress. He
published many works, of which Robinson Crusoe is
the chief. It is said that he derived the idea of this
story from the narrative of Alexander Selkirk, a
sailor, who was left ashore on the island of Juan
Fernandez, and was brought away by Captain
Rogers, after he had lived there by himself for
many years. Let us hope that this tale of wonder-
ful adventures, bitter sufferings, and perilous es.
capes, will teach our young friends the advantages
of a safe and quiet home, and cure them of that sad
disorder of the mind, a discontented and restless
disposition.

(3)THE ADVENTURES

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I . ROBINSON CRU-
son was, accord--
ing to his own ac-
count of himself,
at the age of
._ eighteen, a very

parents, a comfortable home, and all the ad-
vantages commonly arising from. prosperous
circumstances; and yet he was dissatisfied.
He appeared to be weary of good things,
and to desire evil things for the sake of the

change. You will see that he had more

than enough of amazing troubles and disas-
ters, in the course of his life, to teach him
the value of common comforts at home. Our
first print represents him sullen and dejected
by the fireside, with all things convenient
about him; his sister has hold of his hand,
and is endeavouring by kindness to persuade
him into a good humour, whilst his parents
are representing the advantages be there
possessed, and are pointing to the case of a
poor beggar at the door, towhom a servant
has been sent with relief; but who, in the
mean time, endures the pitiless wintry storm,
and hunger at the same time. Robinson,
however, disregards all that can be said and
done to attach him to his home; he becomes
ill-temperedand reserved; and--would you
believe it ?---he forms the sad resolution of
leaving his parents' house, without their
leave or knowledge. I quite expect to find
him in some dreadful situation of distress the
next time we hear of him~let us see.

he is on board a

)} They are get-
ting a boat ready

 

. lliiill for him and the

l ' :R l rest of the crew.
"' I fear it is too
small to take
them every one. I hope poor Robinson will
escape somehow--that is the lad I mean;
the wind has just blown his hat off, do not
you see? Before I tell you what became
of him this time, I must explain how he came
on board that ship, and where it was to have
sailed. The case was this. Robinson had
stated his discontents to some of his young
acquaintances, amongst whom was a sailor
lad, whose fathe1 owned a vessel trading

lrom Hull, in Ymkshiie, to London. This
lad told Crusoe that he would be happy di-
rectly if he would but go to sea--a very
great mistake, indeed, which many a boy
finds out too late. However, Robinson dis-
liked home and regular habits so much, that
he took this bad advice--ran away from his
dear parents and brothers and sisters, with-
out even saying good-bye, and got on board
this vessel one fine autumn evening, in com-
pany with his sailor friend, I am afraid that
neither of these lads told the captain of the
vessel the truth, or he would not have taken
them; but soil: was: they sailed out of the
river Humber, and very delightful it seemed
at first ; but, in a few hours, the wind rose,
and blew most boisterously; the waves flew
over the ship, and tossed it up and down.
Robinson was dreadfully sick, and could not
keep his legs. At last the ship was thrown
upon some rocks, which knocked a great hole
in it; so that they began to sink, and were
obliged to take to their boat, as I said before.
THE SHIP SINKS.

% WELL, and so
' -. soon as poor Ro-

" 5. binson and all the
m- [people had got
0/, ' into the little
_. boat, the great
k7 ship went down !
5'3" Yes,it sunk down
---down -- down
--~into the sea,
till at last even the top of the mast was co-
vered by the waves. All the corn and mer--
chandise, which were to have been sold in
London for thousands of pounds, and all the
ship, that had cost thousands too, with their
boxes of clothes, and every thing, were all
lost at once, and never heard of more. But
Robinson and the rest of them had no time

to think of those things, for they were afraid
every moment that their little boat, with
themselves in it, would also go down, the
weather was so tempestuous, the sea was so
rough, and their boat was so overloaded.
But it pleased Providence to spare all their
lives that time. They arrived, at length, at
a place called Yarmouth, in Norfolk, weak,
and hungry, and frightened, and miserable,
I assure you; but the people of the town
were very good to them, and gave them
food, lodging, and clothes; was not that
very kind?

Robinson tells us that he had at this time
some money in his pocket, with which he
might have returned home, if he had pleased.
He had some thoughts of doing so; but un-
happily, he felt more ashamed of seeing his
friends again, and confessing his fault, than
of continuing to be a disobedient runaway
lad. So he proceeded to London, where it

appears some relations of his were then
hvmg.
DEALS WITH A BLACK PRINCE.

ROBINSON CRU
son does not tell
us much of his
visit to London,
' but that he was
- z'f 9'? still bent on going
g" ' abroad,and in fact
' " ~ Obtained money of
' some Of his rela-
A tions for that pur-
pose. P rhaps they thought it better that
he should go, unsettled and contrary as his
disposition was, than he forced back again,
to make his parents miserable by his ill-hu-
mour. SO, after spending some time in Lon-
don, young Crusoe embarked in a trading
vessel, bound for Guinea, on the coast of
Africa, taking with him a few toys and tri-
fles, to deal with the natives for their gold-
dust. The engraving represents him offer-
ing some strings of beads and a hatchet for
some gold-dust, brought to him by a black
prince--mot the Black Prince of England,
please to remember.

Robinson says that this was the only suc-
cessful voyage he ever made. He gained
about 3001. in money, and some'knowledge
of navigation into the bargain. He again
returned to London '; but, strange to tell, did
not visit his parents at York, nor take any
notice of his other relations.
ESCAPES FROM SLAVERY.

ROBINSON had
now made mo-
ney enough to
. become--the mas-
_'_--i' ter of a Guinea

trading vessel,
= and soon set out
again to try his
. , n fortunes. They
" '\\9, were misfortunes
indeed this time; for his vessel was taken
by Moorish pirates--that is, sea-robbers
from Morocco--and he and all the crew were
made prisoners--that is, slaves. See now
Robinson Crusoe reduced from prosperity to
slavery--from the condition of a gentleman's
son, or a merchant on his own account, to
that of a toiling drudge in the house and
garden of an African robber!
Crusoe's master sometimes employed him
in fishing excursions; and on one of these
occasions, when there was nobody but him-
self, one man and a boy on board, Robinson
began to entertain the thought of making
his escape; so, knowing that this man could
swim'perfectly well, and that they were no
great distance from shore, Robinson shoved
him suddenly overboard, and putting out to .
sea with a fair wind, soon got out of sight
of land. He easily persuaded the boy, named
Xury, to become his servant, and help him
all he could. And so they remained a long
time beating about in the Mediterranean, and
not knowing whereabouts they were, nor in-
deed to which place it would be best to go.
SHOOTS A LION.

As our friend
Robinson Crusoe
had not fixed in
' his own mind on'
' '1 any particular
. ' place to steer to,
if being chiefly de-

,_~ sirous to keerz'clilut
4';- 4' ,,,l " "\ ofthewa o is
iii/KW." ~. \"' ' African irnaster,
he was not sorry to keep out at sea, till he
thought there was no fear of his being pur-
sued. Nor was he sorry at length to come
in sight of land, for he and the boy were
dreadfully distressed with thirst, having no
more water on board. The shore they came
to he never knew the name of. They heard
the voices of many strange wild beasts at a
distance in the woods, which alarmed them
exceedingly; however, they filled their jars
with water, and killed a hare, which they
had for their dinner. How they cooked it,
I cannot say; I should think that it was
served up without seasoning, sauce, or our--
rant--jelly!

Whilst they were prowling about on this
wild shore, they came unexpectedly on a
most terrific sight indeedfi--it was a very
great lion, fast asleep! Happily, Robinson
had his gun with him, with which he shot
the lion. They then went up to him, took
off his skin, and with this returned again to
their boat.
DISCOVERS A SAIL AHEAD.

I SUPPOSE that
our two wander-
ers must have sail-
ed through the
Straits of Gibral-
7. tar, not knowing
\ it, for the next we

 
 
 
 
  
 
   

that they were
steering southward in the Atlantic Ocean,
hoping to meet with some European ship.
If Robinson could have found a conveyance,
then, safely to his father's house at York,
how glad he would have been!

They continued out at sea some time
longer, and being much in want of food,
they approached a shore, and saw some wild
black people, of whom they obtained some
supplies, but who seemed very much aston-
ished, and not a little frightened at their un--
expected guests, who did not wish to trou-
ble them long with their company, and
therefore soon sought and regained their
little vessel. Whilst they were driving be-
fore the wind, in much anxiety as to their
fate, Xury suddenly cried out, " 0! master,
a ship--a ship '." They were both over-
joyed at the sight, which was evidently a
Eur0pean vessel; and now their chief effort
was to make themselves perceived; for the
vessel, though in sight, was not sailing to-
wards them. So they hoisted a white flag
as high as they could, and at length had the
joy of seeing that they were observed, as
the vessel now altered her course, and came
towards them.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

TREATS WITH A PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN.

WHEN the ship
came up to our ad-
venturers, the cap-
tain inquired of
Robinson, in three

different tongues,

who and what he
{is was ; but unhappi-
._ ly, this young man,
'3??? not, having made
good use of his time at'school, understood
not a word he said in French, in Spanish, or
in Portuguese. At last, a Scotch sailor,
who chanced to be on board, found that Ro-
binson was an Englishman, and so got the
needful information out of him ; which,
when the captain understood, induced him
to take the two young men on board, with
all their goods.
The Portuguese captain behaved very
well indeed to his new guests, and offered
to take them where he was going, that was
to the Brazils, in South America, and to buy
his boat, at a fair price, of him when he got
there. He also offered to take the boy
Xury, and employ him in his ship, which
was a great benefit to both; '

They had a prosperous voyage to the
Brazils. The captain, who was generous as
well as just, refused to take anything of R0-
binson for his passage; and, at the same
time, bought all he had to sell at a very
good price--the boat, and all that was in it,
with the lion's skin, produced him thus a
very useful sum of money--the thing above
all things needful in arriving on a foreign
shore.
BECOMES A PLANTER.

AND now we find
Robinson Crusoe in
quite a new situa-
tion and condition
.. in life. Being re-

commended by the
captain to an honest
V resident, who was
H . ' .. master of a sugar

\'\"...'>>;_:;\1\'3 \ as.' 1; ~\ plantation, he made

himself acquainted with the manner of culti-
vating that plant, and of making the sugar
itself. At length he purchased some land,
and set up planter.

But Robinson began now to reflect that
he could have done better than this at home,
had he liked to have settled on a farm, or to
follow any other p10fess10n or business. In
fact, though he was succeeding as well as he
could expect, he began to be unhappy and
discontented again. At length, when he
had been about four years in the Brazils,
and had considerably increased his property,
Robinson determined to sell all ofl', and go _
to sea again as a merchant; and what trade
do you think he fixed upon now to carry for-
ward on the seas ?-----the slave trade! I am
sorry to say that he resolved to sail to the
coast of Africa, to purchase poor negroes to
work in the plantations of Brazil.l

22 ROBINSON CRUSOE.

IS AGAIN SHIPWRECKED.

BUT our restless
adventurous friend
' was soon punished
a? for his incurable
_ r ; wg/j/ discontent, and for
' 5'? his unjust purpose

' /<. of enslaving his l'el--

' \ low-men. He sail-

' . J ed in agood 'vessel,
' *"'"\'SSSS=:-" with a crew of four-

teen persons, and such articles of traffic as
would enable him to purchase slaves of the
African chiefs. But they had; not been many
days out at sea, when a :viqlent tempest
arose, such as in the tropical seas is called a
tornado; this drove them far away from
their intended course, and, indeed, quite out
of their knowledge; so that, for twelve days
they knew not where they Were, nor whither
they were going. Whilst they were in this
perplexity and terror, one of the sailors sud-
denly called out, " Land 1" That meant
that he could see land; but Robinson had
no sooner run out of the cabin to look out,
than the vessel struck upon a sand--bank;
and the motion being thus stopped, the sea
broke over with tremendous violence, threat-
ening every instant to wash them all over-
board, and to break the ship in pieces. At
last, they did as before, and as is usual in
such-cases; they got the boat down and em-
barked in her, although they had little hope
that they could thereby escape. At length,
their worst fears were realized; the fatal
wave came whichoverset their boat, and
threw them all into the stormy sea!
ESCAPES FROM BROWNING.

YOU would now
expect an end of
the story, but that
you know if they
' had all been lost,
no one could have
. told about the
' f storm. Yes, one
was saved, and he
got to the shore
without any bOat
at all. It was Robinson himself, who was
thrown out like the rest of them ; but so it
happened 'that the wave which upset the
boat bore him on its foaming edge, and at
length hurled him with Violence 'on the shore.
He had just time to get opl'his legs, and r1113
higher up, before the next'wave came,3which
would have carried him"bae_k- again to the
whelming ocean. Poor Crusoe had scarcely
escaped this danger, when he dropped nearly
insensible from the violence, exertion, and
fright, he had undergone. When he came
to himself, he looked up p, meat-banked God
for his wonderful deliveranc He was the
only one saved out of the whole company ,

he never saw them afterwards, nor any sign '

of them, but thiee of- their hats, one cap,
and two shoes that were not fellows.
Robinson cast his eyes to the stranded
vessel, which lay at some distance, buffeted
by the yet rolling sea. It seemed to him a
miracle that he could have got on shore.

CLIMBS A TREE.

So our friend
Robinson Crusoe is
at length landed all
alone on an entirely
":3; unknown shore L--
What was to be-
come of him now----
what should he do?
v~ Can you tell me
' "zfi; what you would do
/ in such a case----
hunger coming on, night approaching, and
no food or lodging provided! I rather
think you would wish yourself at home
again, as there is no doubt Robinson did on
that occasionu In fact, he soon began to
think that he had but a dreadful deliverance)
from a sudden to a lingering death. His
condition was indeed pitiable. He was wet,

- In
and had no other clothes, nor anything to
eat and drink, nor any prosPect but that of
perishing with famine, or being devoured by
wild beasts. He had no weapon to defend
him, or to enable him to procure any animal
for his sustenance; he had nothing about
him but a knife, and a tobacco--box and
pipe, with a little tobacco. He walked
about in very great distress and agony of
mind, and as night came on, he had nothing
for it but to climb up into a thick bushy
tree, out of the way of wild beasts, and here
he fell fast asleep.
GETS ON BOARD THE WRECK.

THE next morn-
ing, early, Robin-
son awoke in his
leafy chamber, and
rubbing his eyes,
(ll wondered nota lit-
>> ---_L. tle where he was.
":7 Hunger soon re-
; "/1 ""3 minded him that he
' " /' 7E":f//// --= .} had had no supper,
and when he had mil/sh] himself completely,
he could not tell whe're his breakfast was to
come from. This was rather a serious pre-
dicament--worse than sitting by his father's
fireside at York, taking rolls and coffee on
a rainy morning. _

Before Crusoe descended from the tree,
he looked out on the ocean. The storm had
abated, and he was surprised to obserVe that
the wreck of the ship had been thrown
higher up, and much nearer the shore. This
gave him some comfort, and he walked as
far as he could towards her, but still found
half a mile of water between the vessel and
the land. In a few hours, however, the
tide had ebbed out so far that he could ap-
proach the ship by swimming , and, after
having paddled round it fOr some time, he at
length found a bit of r0p e hanging from her
side, by which he swung phimself up, and got
on board Now, he perceived that if they
had all kept the ship, that they would all
have been safe, and he Would have had com-
panions in his exile. '
THE SHIP'S PROVISION-ROOM.

WHEN Robinson
got on board the.
vessel, it was a sad
sight indeed. She
was wedged fast,
so that the fore
..' v, , part was secured

' , and Whole, but the
hind part was con-
siderably damaged
and broken, and
she was more than half filled with water.
All the masts, sails, and ropes--which are
called the rigging--were gone. Happily,
however, for Robinson, he found the provi--
sion-room but little injured, and the chief of
the stores remaining good. 0 with what a
relish did he devour biscuits and bacon,
cheese, and salt fish, and how refreshed he
was by a dr0p of good wine from the neck
of a broken bottle, though in his eagerness
he sadly cut his mouth with the glass! He
found, indeed, that he was in danger of in-
dulging to excess after his long fast, and

therefore presently set about another kind -

of employment. _He knew that his very
existence depended -on his being able to
transport these provisions to the shore, for
his future subsistence; but how was this to
be done? there was no boat, and the re-
mains of the vessel would not hold together
long, strained as it still was by the force of
the sea and wind. He could, to be sure,
swim away as he had done, and he could
put a biscuit or two in his mouth; but it
was needful to hit on some better contri-
vance than that--what do ' you think it
could be?

w-'Lm; _ui -
MAKES A RAFT.

Do you know
what a raft is? It
is a platform of
pieces of timber,
J fastened together,
and which will
be sure to float,
' because any sin-
" Ogle piece would
float by itself. Now it is plain, that if a
raft thus made he put on the water, and not
overloaded, it will answer, in some degree,
the purpose of a boat; and if a man can but
keep his place and position upon it, he may
proceed with it in safety. So Robinson set
to work; and, finding plenty of broken tim-
ber and scattered rigging about, he corded
a quantity together as flat as a floor; and,
having tied to it a rope of sufficient length
to prevent its sailing away, he contrived, by
the help of lines, and with great exertion, to
heave it over the ship's side. There was a
splash! So--now the raft has adjusted
itself, and lies pretty flat on the water, but
bobbing up and down with the waves. But
Crusoe soon steadied it a little with some of
the seamen's heavy chests, and with casks
of provisions, and other things. Whilst he
was doing'this, the tidewas rising, and he
had the unhappiness to see his coat and
waistcoat, Which he had left on shore, wash-
ed away by the sea. However, he found
others on board the ship; and, having got

' as much on his raft, of provisions, utensils,
tools, arms, and ammunition, as it could well
sustain, he pushed off ; and the sea being
tolerably quiet, he managed to row himself
to land. Look at him in the print; there
he is, full of business, is he not?

3
ASCENDS A HILL.

ROBINSON - did
not get to land
without hazard
and difficulty; for
when his raft
touched ground,
the Opposite part

     

  

g ,>> Nbegan to sink in
7:593? \\ the water, so that
77, 'i he and his wares
"'iI' .H werenearly sloped

 

Off into the sea. He just succeeded in pre-
venting this, and at length got all his goods
up high and dry on the shore. Oh, how
thankful he was l~there was food enough,
and other comfortable things for a long time
to come--no thoughts of starving now.
His next care was tO find a place of lodg-
ing for himself, and of security for his goods.
So, having piled them together as well as he
could, he took a gun and some powder, and
ascended a high hill at no great distance.
Then it was that he discovered this strange
spot to be an island, for he could see the
ocean with its waves Sparkling all round it.
The island itself was of course not very
large, nor was it barren; there were woods
and grassy vales, and various animals skip-
ping about, but he couldnot discover the
least sign of a human being. You see him
there, on the top of the hill, in the engrav-
ing, and there are his casks and chests in a
heap below. What has he done With his
raft? Oh ! there it is, tied to a stump driven
into the sand!
HIS RAFT orsn'rs.

ROBINSON CRU-
SOE came down
from the hill, and
walked about to

'1 explore the island
further, but was
; greatly afraid of
losing sight of his
_ stores. So he did
not 'go a great way that day; but when
evening arrived, he felt very much fatigued
with his exertions, and began to wish much
for some quiet lodging, in which he might
lie secure for the night. However, he could
find none then, and therefore he barricaded
himself round as well as he could with the
tubs, chests, and boards; and having taken
his supper, passed the night pretty comforta-
bly. In the morning, he again looked to-
wards the ship, and finding she still remain-
ed, he determined to try and raft over as
many more things as he thought would be
useful to him; and, in fact, went and came
on this errand several times, and greatly in--
creased his stores on the island. It was not ,
to be expected that he should do this every
time Without an accident; on one occasion,
the raft, and all that was on it, was upset
and washed away, and himself narrowly es-

acped drowning. These expeditions were
at length put an end to as he had expected
One morning, when he awoke, after a Windy
night, and looked towards the sea, the ship
had entirely disappeared, not a plank was
visible; all had been borne away by the
curling green waves. '
CUTS NOTCHES ON HIS STICK.

ROBINSON CRUSOE,
though solitary, was
no longer destitute
on his little island.
Provisions, drink, -
clothing, tools, ma-
terials, arms, gun-
powder, and shot,

with innumerable
. other articles, not
excepting MONEY! he had supplied himself
with in more or less abundance. You will
ask, of what use money could be to him in
an uninhabited island? None whatever,
, certainly; but he' prudently thought that if

ever a ship came that way, gold would be
of use again.

Still Robinson was without a habitation.
He had goods, but no lodging, and that was
rather awkward ; he was also in constant
terror of wild beasts issuing from the woods,
which might eat his provisions, and perhaps
himself at last. So he considered what he
should do, and resolved to erect himself a
tent, with the sails and cordage of the ship,
until he could provide himself some more se-
cure habitation. _

He found that he should soon. lose all
knowledge of the days, months, or years of
his present life, unless he kept some account
of their progress ; so he got some long
sticks, and cutting a notch every day, could
at any time count them up, and find where
he was in the year.

"'25? he enclosed it in a
ring fence, made with stakes driven firmly
into the ground, and so high as not to be
mounted by men or animals. He would not
even make a door for himself to enter, lest
he should chance to leave it open, but used
a ladder, which he always drew up after
him. So he was secure, and at the same
time solitary indeed. Within this enclo-

fi
sure, or within his tent, he brought all his
various stores and useful articles. This spot
was close under the side of a hill, in which
he scooped out a cave, which he made his
cellar.

N ow, though this young man was for the
present in much less distress than might
have been expected, he was by no means
happy. The thoughts of his native land,
and the social comforts he had forsaken
without cause, often brought tears into his
eyes; and his utter loneliness made him, for
the most part, melancholy and wretched.
If he had not been obliged to employ him-
self so much in laborious occupations re-
quired by his situation, he might have lost
his reason altogether. I trust, therefore,
that none of my young readers will envy
him, however snug was his tent and cave,

and although he was a sort of monarch over
the island he inhabited.
WRITES HIS ADVENTURES.

IT was, accord--
ing to Robinson's
reckoning, the 30th
of September,165,9,
when he first set
3 ., '35,... foot on this island.
~ '\ At'that period, ma-

l"riners had traver-

 
    

" sed the seas but lit-
tle, and there were
_-_ _ - countless lands and
seas which had never apparently been visit-
ed by men. It would now be rather diffi-
cult to find a solitary island, or even the
rocky summit of a mountain above the sea,
which has not been seen, named, and laid
down in some chart or another.
Our adventurer did not neglect to provide
himself with pen, ink, and paper, books, and
nautical instruments, out of the ship's stores;
and these relieved his dulness very much,
and enabled him to write his history at full
length. What he says in his narrative
about this island as an unknown country to
all the world, might have been true almost
two hundred years ago ; but this would not
quite do to write as existing to the present
day. The print shows Robinson in his tent,
writing his history by the light of a. lamp.
ATTENDS HIS GOATS.

As this is but a
little book, and Ro~
binson's story is
a very long one,
we cannot give an
,: - account of every
"Q thing he mentions

' in his own history,
but must content
ourselves with noticing the most interesting
circumstances

It happened very fortunately for Robin-
son that the island had no savage or venom-
011s beasts upon it, which was rather surpri-
sing for a spot in the torrid zone. He found
indeed wild cats and wild goats, both of -
which he tamed, and made of them a sort
of companions. Besides these, there were
birds, some of them good for food, and par--
rots, one of which he caught, and taught it
to call him by his name.

His provisions brought from the ship
would not have subsisted him more than a
few months, so that he was very glad to
find supplies on the island of some sort. He
had- the flesh and milk of the goats, of
whose skins he made himself clothes; and
he found grapes and wild fruits in- abun--
dance. There were, besides, hares and rab-
bits, and fish to be obtained occasionally
from the sea. Still he would have wanted
corn Victuals, if he had not chanced to shake
out one of the ship's bags in which a few
grains had remained. These sprang up,
and in time produced him all that he re-
quired for himself and his goats. In the
print you see him attending those animals.

cated himself, and then had all his work to
do over again, taking care now to prop up
the ceiling of his cave as he proceeded. After
this happened an earthquake, which made
poor Robinson qua/ca, accompanied by a
storm which almost tore his tent from the
ground.

But a worse misfortune than these, and
one that alarmed him much more, was a dan-
gerous illness, an ague that attacked him,
and confined him to his habitation many
days, and which he thought at one time
would have ended fatally. See how de-
plorable he looks, with no attendants near
but his cats and his Poll-parrot!
O

RETURNS HOME LADEN WITH FRUIT.

IT was some time
before poor Robin-
son recovered his
}' (fl, usual health and

, strength; he could
. ' do little but wan-
der slowly about,
trusting to Nature
as his only physi-
cian. When, how-
ever, he became quite well, he determined
to make a more extensive survey of the
island than he had done before; so he set
out one fine morning with such provisions
as he could conveniently carry. '

Wandering up by the banks of a brook,
he found many pleasant meadows, rich and
verdant ; and in places were growing many
splendid plants and flowers peculiar to the
warm climates. The chief of these were
aloes, sugar-canes, tobacco-plants, and me-
lons. Proceeding further, he came to woods
of mahogany and cedar, with vines and
grap pes 1n abundance. When night came
on, he climbed into a tree as before: and
this seems to be the safest lodging in those
countries for travellers on such occasions
The next morning he proceeded, and found
the country still more luxuriant and delight-
ful, so that he could not help feeling satis-
faction at the thought that it seemed to be
all his own, and that Without dispute. Ro-
binson travelled thus some miles, and at
length returned home laden with delicious
fruits.

TURNS BASKET-MAKER.

BUT notwith-
standing the fruits
, and the animals
f Robinson obtain--
. . ed, he found that

' he must turn far-
mer or husband-
man in earnest, if

.. , - - he would be sure
of a cert in store of food for the future. So
he enclosed a piece of ground, dug it up
with much labour, and sowed the grain in
the proper season. Do you know that the
climate in the torrid zone has only two kinds
of weather to mark the year, the rainy sea:
son and the dry: thus, it is rainy in our
spring and autumn, and dry during our
summer and winter. The first time he
sowed his corn, he lost his crop for want of
knowing this: the dry season came, and it
was all parched up, and so perished. I
think Robinson Crusoe must have been very
well qualified to write a book of trades, he
had to undertake. so many himself. We
find him a sailor, fisherman, ship-builder,
carpenter, farmer, grazier, butcher, basket-
maker, pot and pan maker, miller, tailor, and
twenty other things, and king of the coun--
try at the same time. All this was very
curious, and it is Certainly entertaining
enough to read' about; but Robinson would
rather have been engaged in any one of
those trades in England, and no king at all,
than shut up in his lone island, with nobody

, but his cats 'and his parrot to speak to.--
What do you think of the matter?
TURNS POT'I'E R. p

WE must now
inquire more par--
ticularly how our
friend Robinson
proceeded in some
of the employ-
ments just men-
tioned. Poor fel-
low !. he tells us
that he had no
~ pots or pans to
put and carry any liquid in, nor a basket to
take provisions with him on a journey.
Luckily he found some willow trees, whose
long boughs and tough twigs enabled him to
provide himself with baskets both light and
strong, though'not perhaps very neat or or-
namental. He was more troubled to make
pots and pans, and would have given seve-
ral pieces of his useless gold for a good
pitcher and a brown dish, such as in Eng--
land we can get for a few pence. However,
he set to work; but he says we should both
pity and laugh were we to see .the awkward
mis--shapen things he made at first; Why,
his pots fell in and his pots fell out with
their own weight; and as for liquors, they
all preferred making the best of their way
out, to remaining confined in such ugly
apartments. But at length he found out the
method of forming these vessels better, and
of hardening them too; for, finding a piece
of one of them which had been in the fire
accidentally, baked as hard as a stone, he
took the hint, and building up lighted em-
bers round his pots, made them as solid as
he wished.
GRINDS HIS CORN.

ROBINSON'S next
concern was to pro-
cure the means of
grinding or rather
\\ bruising his corn,
' \ for it was neither
"'1'." convenient nor was
a>> it wholesome to eat
\SST it whole. To con-
_ struct a mill to
" grind it, was out of
the question; though I dare say the island
had both wind and water. It was needful
to devise some more simple machine, and he
could think of nothing better than a pestle
and mortar. He spent many a day endea--
vouring to find a great stone big enough to
hollow out for the purpose, but was unsuc~

cessful; and, probably, if he had obtained

   
              

Va- '
one, he could not have cut into it. At last
he procured a block of wood hard enough,
which he scooped out with fire and labour.
It was not very difficult to form a pestle, or
beater, with a heavy knob at the end, of the
same material. There he is, pounding away,
and quite busy. I am afraid, with all his
labour, his flour was very coarse and husky,
so that his bread and puddings must have
set him coughing sometimes.
CRUSOE A CARPENTER.

' P0011 Robinson
had a laborious
time of it when
he turned carpen-
ter; for though
he had as many
trees as he want-
ed, it cost him
weeks of toil to
cut one down;
and then to make
them into boards, without a saw, was sad
fatiguing work indeed. He says he was
forty~two whole days making one long shelf
for his cave; for he had to chop each side
flat with his axe, so that you see one tree
made but one board; but a sawyer would
in half a day have cut out twenty or more.
But he had a more important project in his
head than making a shelf, or even a house.
What could it be ?----did he wish to build a
church, or a castle, or a tower? Try and
think for him, and imagine what it was he
desired most of all, and at all times--yes,
more than all the comforts which a house
replete with every convenience could have
supplied him in his lenely island. '
FINDS A BOAT ON THE SHORE

\\ I SUPPOSE you
' ' ' must have gues~
sed by this time
that the thing
Crusoe most de-
._ sired was a ship,
'5' or even a boat,
':\ to hear him, if
_ 'fw not to England,
. - " \' at least to some
"' land where he
could find human beings to converse with !
Yes, that was what he longed for--society. '
How thankful we ought all to be for kind
friends and relatives, always at hand to aid
or cheer us! Solitude is the greatest pun-
ishment almost that can be inflicted on us in
this life, and so Robinson found it.

As he walked one day by the sea-side,
full of these thoughts, he saw the lar e boat
belonging to the shipwrecked vesse lying
high up on the beach, where it had been
cast, bottom upwards. N ow, if half--a-dozen
men could but have lent him a hand for a
few minutes, they would have turned it over,
and brought it to the sea, so as to have
floated oli" at high tide. But there was only
poor Robinson, who, although he got levers
and rollers from thewood, found that he
could not move the boat a foot! Then he
set himself to dig away the sand beneath it;
and thus, indeed, he did alter the position
of the boat, but still he was quite unable to
move it forward; so he was obliged to give
the old boat up after he had spent many
days about it.

. ,-";' \\ to attempt to
.. 7', ' . venture out to
__ C/O=\ sea in a boat by
himself, if he had one ready for his use.
But he thought differently; and finding
that there were no hopes of managing the
ship's boat, he resolved to try and make one
--he that had been seven weeks making one
single board! But so intent was he on this
scheme, that he did not even reflect on the
possibility of conveying the new boat to the
sea, from the wood where the tree was to
be felled. He owns that he acted very
much like a simpleton in all this business.
However, to work he went, and cut down a
cedar tree, almost six feet in diameter--that
is, in width straight across at the bottom.
It is most surprising that he could'ever fell
such a tree I He says her'was twenty days
hewing and hacking at it to cut it down;
fourteen more getting the top and branches
off. Then it took him a month to shape
the outside of the log into something like
the fashion of a boat, and three months more
to hollow it out with fire and labour.

So at last his boat was so far finished,
and it was big enough, he says, to have car-
ried six--and-twenty men! In fact, he was
quite delighted with it; but does it not look
odd to see him admiring it so much, lying,
as it does, in the midst of a wood, not a bit
of rippling ocean to be seen!
TRIES TO LAUNCH HIS BOAT.

ROBINSON tells
us that he was
, highly delighted
' with his boat: but

' soon came the sad

    
  
 
 

was not in, nor
near the water;
and it happened,
unluckily, that be-
a there was a hill!
Now he had no more power to move this
boat than the other, and the distance was
greater. It seems that he never thought of
that. At first, he tried to cut the hill
away; but that was rather too much for
him, and there was no railway company to
undertake it. Then he thought to dig a
canal or dock to let the water up to the
spot; and he calculated that this would oc-
cupy him ten or twelve years at least, there
being only two excavators, his right hand
and his left, to perform the work. This he
thought was too much to attempt, and so
he gave up all thoughts of launching this
boat, which had pleased him so highly at
first. When he had finished this boat, he
had been four years on that lonely, unknown
island!
CRUSOE IN HIS DRESS OF SKINS.

AND now Robin-
son tells us a little
of' his condition. His
clothes were nearly
worn to rags; his
beard had grown so
long that it resem-

   

' f goats around him;
his shoes and stock-
ings were long. ago
worn out, nor had he a hat to his head. As
to provisions, those obtained from the ship
of course were all gone; and what was
worse, his powder and shot, with which he
procured game, were nearly expended also.
His ink, too, with which he wrote a daily
account of his affairs, was almost gone; and
this want grieved him as much as the others,
some of which he could in a sort of way
supply. As for clothes, he managed pretty
well with his goat-skins and threads of the
same to botch himself up a suit; nay, more,
he made an umbrella of the same material to
defend him from the heat of the sun: and
thus equipped, our engraving represents him
walking about his island.

His chief employments were, cultivating
his fields and garden; gathering, curing,
and packing his fruits ; attending his tamed
animals; procuring and dressing his food;
with various other operations and labours
needful in his situation. Finding, however,
that he had still time on his hands, his mind
strangely reverted to his former design of
escaping if possible from the island.

BUILDS A SECOND BOAT.

HE therefore set
about making a
much smaller and
more manageable

_ . boat or canoe than
the former one, and
.; _ this task he com~
.'- ', , - H. ' ' .. _' pleted successfully
" Q _ deg "3'? ' in about two years.
" 7-451 ' He made a mast
and a sail out of the old ship's stores; and
having launched his little vessel, was de-
lighted to find that she sailed very well.

In this curious canoe, Robinson made
several short voyages of discovery about
the island, and at length resolved to go com-
pletely round it. So he victualled his ship
for the voyage, putting in two dozen loaves
of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parch-

ed rice, a little bottle of rum, half a goat,
and some powder and shot, with mats and
skins to shelter him from the weather. He
says that it was on the 8th of November, in
the 6th year of his reign, or his captivity,
that he embarked on this voyage, not with-
out some apprehensions of the dangers to
which he might be exposed. He took a
sort of leave of his various dumb acquain-
tances at his departure from them. See, he
is now pushing off from the shore! Take
care, Robinsonwyour bark is but a frail

SAILS ABOUT THE ISLAND.

ROBINSON, it
seems, would
sooner encoun-
ter adventures,
and even dan-
gers, than have
dull ease and
safety. He
soon found that
. _ _ though the is-

w - '4"? ' land was not
large, the ledges of rocks about it forced
him a good way out to sea, and he narrowly
escaped being thrown upon them. When he
had passed these, he came to a furious cur--
rent, that is, a driving rush of water in the
sea, such as you observe at the sluice of a
water-mill. He was now between the rocks
and this current, which he feared would carry
away his boat and overwhelm it. .He con-
tinued beating about here for two days, un-
able to return, the wind being contrary, and.
having only a choice of dangers during that
time. Then he thought of his quiet but and
cave on the island, and the provision and
other comforts there stored up, and bitterly
reproached himself for his restless desire of
change. He stretched forth his hands to-
wards the island, and said, " 0 happy, hap-
py spot, I shall never see thee more!
miserable creature, whither am I going?"
Now was he being driven into the wide
ocean, in despair-of ever reaching the land
again. But just as he had given himself up
for lost, a breeze arose towards the island.
So on he spread his little sail and plied his
oars; and so in the course of two or three
hours he regained the island, and falling on
his knees when he had stepped ashore, he
devoutly thanked Almighty God for this
great deliverance. He laid himself down
in his cave to refresh his weary limbs, and
was not a little startled by a voice which
said, " Robinson! where have you been?"
SURROUNDED BY HIS HOUSEHOLD.

ROBINSON an-
swered his parrot
very kindly, and,
perhaps for want.
of other ears, ac-
knowledged to the
bird how very
. w 'i ' foolish he had

V ,, been. He now
' made himself more

'35.;_._..-_ ' ' contented at home,
and set about improving his condition. He
made much better chairs and tables, pots
and pans, baskets, and other useful articles,
than he had at first. Then he determined
to increase his stock of goats, as his powder
and shot got low, with which he had pro-
cured game. So he made pitfalls for the
wild goats, in which at last he caught as
many as he required. He enclosed for them
a spacious meadow, and thus could manage
them without inconvenience. His stock in-
creased so', that in about two years he had
nearly fifty goats, young and old. So he
had goat's flesh, and milk, too, when he
pleased. - .

See him now in his cave, sitting down to
dinner. There is his poll-parrot 'on_ one
side, looking very knowing, his two cats on
the other looking very loving, and an old
dog at his feet. I wonder what he has got
for dinner? I should think goat-mutton,
roast or boiled, and perhaps some of his ba r-
ley bread boiled in milk for a pudding.
Should you not like to dine with him?
ROBINSON IN HIS WALKING-DRESS.

ROBINSON wish-
ed very much that

have taken .a
sketch of him, in

--W_%' _ _. __ _.._.

' =------=----:,---------___.=~v= ' tist has, I see, ac-
complished the task. We will explain it in
his own words. " I had a great, high,
shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a
flat hanging down behind, as well to keep
the sun from me as to keep out the rain. I
had a short jacket of goat's skin, with long
skirts; pantaloons of the same shaggy ma-
terial; of which also I had socks or buskins.
that supplied the place of shoes and stock-
ings. I had a broad belt, in loops of which
hung a saw and a hatchet; another belt,
having a pouch, swung over my shoulder,
in which I kept my powder and shot; at
my back I carried a basket, on my shoulder
a gun, and over my head a great clumsy
thing made of goat's skin, like an umbrella,
to keep off the sun." So much for the ap-
pearance and condition of our friend Robin-
son Crusoe; we must now attend to other
things, as new events soon opened upon him.
"It happened," says he, "one day, about
noon, as I was walking On the shore, that I
discerned, to my unspeakable surprise, the
plain impression of a man's foot on the
sand I"

clares that he
stood like one

,1': . . , At length he sped

;. .mf'mgcss ' ' home as fast as
his legs would carry him, fearing an enemy
at every turn. He skipped over the wall
of his enclosure, and drew the ladder quietly
after him, and passed a sleepless night. N ow
again he wished for that undisturbed solitude
of which he had complained before. He
wearied his brain with conjectures, as to
who the persons could be, Whose footmarkshe had seen, and whence they could have
come. He continued in this alarm some
days, during which time he scarcely dared
to peep abroad. When he did so, he saw
nothing of any human beings; but deter-
mined to render his dwelling mbre secure,
by strengthening the fences .round his dwell-
ing, and thus making them answer the pur-
pose of fortifications to his little castle! He,
however, passed two years more without
disturbance of any kind, and the fear of
enemies began to subside, till again his soli-

tude was hlS chief affliction.
DISCOVERS HUMAN SKULLS.

AND now poor
Robinson thought
he might venture
abroad again with-
out apprehension,

 
     
  

2.Y=<\' and was walking
; '_ .._'_ _' t near the sea--shore

"2222 sight presented it-
.>>A " self which made his
gwhfhair stand on end
with surprise and horror. The shore was
spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies; and there was a
hole dug in which had been a fire, and these
human bones, he perceived, had evidently
been roasted at it! Cannibals had been
there! What are cannibals? I must tell
you-they are savage and wicked men, who
kill and devour one another! Oh, how
dreadful is the thought! Now I suppose
you no longer wish to dwell on Robinson
Crusoe' s island? Barbarous nations there
we7e in great numbers, who made a constant
practice of eating their enemies whenever
they could catch them. Oh, let us be thank--
ful that our lot is cast in a happier country,
where no such horrid doings were ever
known. I am afraid we must not say that
the dreadful custom of feasting on human
flesh 1s even now quite disused 111 all parts
of the world.
ARRIVAL OF THE CANNIBALS.

ROBINSON near-
ly fainted at the
dreadful sight of
. these human re-

-_-:--= mains, and was in
mm; fact made ill by'
N. the excess of his
gm," ~ <<finc- feelin s and dis--
""'\""""'~R\\' gustg When he
regained his home, he endeavoured to com--
pose himself, and thanked God that he had
been brought up, not with such monsters,
but in civilized society. He was, however,
not quite so much alarmed on account of his
own safety as before; for, as he had lived
on the island eighteen years, he knew that
it was inhabited by no human being but him-
self, and believed that the savages only used

the spot as an occasional retreat, for the
purpose of enjoying their inhuman repas't in
greater security. He therefore contented
himself with avoiding generally that part of
the island Where the savages had landed,
and made himself as snug and safe as he
could in his own dwelling; he loaded his
guns and pistols, and kept much at home:
but one day, mounting the hill above his
cave, he plainly perceived a smoke at no
great distance, and thus it was evident that
danger was approaching him. He peeped
through the bushes a little further on, and
saw nine savages dancing round a fire, at
which, he doubted not, the flesh of human
beings was then roasting! In a few hours,
the savages took to their canoes, and then
Robinson carefully approached the spot they
had left. The remains of their feast were
too horrid to describe.
KINDLES A SIGNAL FIRE.

ROBINSON was
now indeed fear-
ful that he should
one day fall into
the hands of the
y dreadful barba-

' * _ rians who visited
, . _ the island. He,

' however, passed
a year or two
J, x . without seeing
any more of them. But "now a surprise of
quite a different kind startled him one day
as he was musing in his cave. It was the
distinct sound of a ship's gun! He started
up instantly, and mounting the hill, looked
out to sea, and saw a flash of fire, soon fol-
lowed by the report of a second gun. Now
he felt convinced that there was some ship
in distress out at sea--for, do you know,
that when they are in very great difficulty
and danger out at sea, and are afraid of
being-wrecked, they fire guns every minute,
to inform any persons who may be within
hearing that help is wanted. Robinson
made a fire as a signal, which was soon an-
swered by another gun: he looked out, and
could just see an object out at sea ; but the
weather was too hazy to discern it distinctly.
The next morning he looked out again, and
then saw plainly enough the wreck of a
ship, cast away on the same racks as those
on which himself had been thrown many

years before.

RESCUES A VICTIM FROM THE CANNIBALS.

' \ VSQHEN the sea
~.1) , was calm, Ro--
"f l' l./ binson rowed
" ' ' himself to the
-' wreck, and found
,1 _ " that not a soul
on board was
' {1% left alive. He
- obtained from
the vessel many
articles of which
he was much 1n want, and made many voy--
ages for that purpose, as he had done be-
fore.

Another year or two passed away, and
Robinson continued as solitary as ever; but
at length it seemed as if he was to have com-
pany more than enough, fo1 he saw five ca-
noes full of savages approaching the island. '
He fetched the telescope which he had ob-
tained from the ship, and, climbing his hill
of observation, he plainly discerned about
thirty persons sitting round a fire, and two
apparently bound, ready to be killed! One
of these he presently saw, releasing himself
from his bonds, dart away from his enemies
like lightning towards the woods. With
' such amazing swiftness did heprun, urged-by
hapes and fears for his life, that he left his
pursuers far behind, and rapidly approached
the spot where Robinson was standing, who
now thought it time to interfere. He sprang
in between the pursuers and the pursued,
and firing off, first a pistol, and then a mus-
ket, so desperately alarmed the savages,
who had never heard fire-arms before, and
who saw one of their companions drop dead,
that they immediately took to their canoes,
and went away as fast as they could ply
their cars.
FRIDAY'S GRATITUDE.

age who had esca--

mies was not less
alarmed than the
rest, and fell flat on

. . .. him, and to persuade

. , - LS. '\ him to rise.

You see this young savage would have
been killed and eaten in a very short time,
if he had not slipped his cords and run away.
He seemed to be very thankful to Robinson,
though of course he could not make himself
understood by words; and, to make short
of it, Robinson found him a very excellent
companion and assistant, when he had
taught him a few things and a few words
of English. As it was on a Friday that
Robinson first saw him, he gave him that
name, and you will hear of him now as his
man Friday .' He was very clever, expert,
obedient, and attached to his master; he
soon learned the use of European imple-
ments, and could shoot game with a gun ex-
ceedingly well. Robinson taught him the
principles of religion, made him abhor the
savage practices of his own nation, and, in
fact, educated him and civilized him com-
pletely in the course of time.

frightened, thinking they were come to seek
for him and eat him up; but Robinson com-
forted him, and promised to defend him.
When the savages had sat down on the
shore, it was soon evident that they wereROBINSON 011115015. 87

come on their old errand, and meditated
another horrid feast. So Robinson and Fri-
day each took as many guns as they could
carry, and determined to put a stop to such
dreadful pioceedings. They approached
as near as they could without being disco-
ve1ed, and could see plainly about tu enty
savages feasting away, and two wretched
ones bound,1eady to be killed. Then Ro-
binson determined to fire their guns at the
savage men. This they repeated until two
or th1ee of the savages weie killed, many
wounded, and the rest most cheadfully
frightened, not knowing whence this attack
p1oceeded. In great constemation, they
jumped up, and took to their boats, leaving
their prisoners still bound on the shore.
One of these, it appeared, was a white man,
a Spaniard, who jumped for Joy at his deli-
verance, so happy and so unexpected. Who
do you think the other was? I uill tell
you presently.
FRlDAY DISCOVERS HIS FATHER.

THE other in-
tended victim,
thus surprisingly
released, was an
old man, at whom
Friday gazed at
first with intense
,.'.:: . earnestness, and
..... I at len th, rush-
" (5% ing togards him,
clasped in his
arms his own father! It is impossible to
describe the mutual joy of parent and child
on this occasion. Friday danced about him,
and showed the utmost degree of filial duty
and affection. He rubbed his benumbed
hands, brought him drink and food, and had
the satisfaction of seeing his father's activity
at length restored. Robinson was scarcely
less surprised and pleased at this strange
event; and now questioned the Spaniard,
and found that he too had been cast away,
but not on an uninhabited land. He had
lived some time with the natives, when they
were attacked and overpowered by a neigh-
bouring tribe, who took himself and many
others prisoners, who would all have been
devoured had they not been delivered by
' Robinson and his man Friday. Very thank-
ful they were for theirescape, and for the
food and shelter Robinson gave them. He
might now indeed call himself a king, hav-
ing subjects, three in number, who acknow-
ledged his authority: but we have more
events presently to relate.
RELEASES THE ENGLISH SAILORS.

MORE visiters
now poured in on
Robinson. One
morning, his man
Friday ran and
told him that a
gcanoe, such as he

. # PS3; :had never seen
"mfg?" before, was in
sight, and rowing towards them. Robinson
soon perceived that they were Europeans---
,yes--and how great was his joy to find that
they were English, tool Yet he had his
fears that these peeple could be after no
good, and there had been no storm to injure
any vessel. So Robinson kept on his guard,
and now saw plainly an English ship at an-
chor at no great distance. The boat drew

to shore, the men landed, and bore on their
shoulders three persons, bound as prisoners.
Robinson soon found out what was the na-
ture of the case, and being a man of cou--
rage, determined, if possible, to release these
prisoners, as he had done the others. Whilst,
therefore, the sailors were absent, ranging
in the woods, he and Friday approached,
and unbinding the men, who were utterly
astonished at their deliver'ers, bade them de-
fend themselves, and put arms into their
hands. These three, with Robinson and his
companions, made seven in all, who, finding
the sailors in the woods drunk or asleep,
came on them unawares, bound them all
with cords, and so made them prisoners in
turn ! Was not that well done?
ATTACKS THE MUTINEERS.

I CANNOT de
scribe the sur-
prise and alarm
of these men at
finding them-

. $97 selves bound fast,
' $4?" and their prison-

  
  
 
 

33 ers released; but
y' they were obli-
ed to submit.
. he fact is, these
sailors were mutineers,----that is, they had
rebelled against the captain and officers of
their ship, and had brought them to this
island for the purpose of leaving them to
perish; but you see their violent doings
were overruled against them. They now
implored mercy, for they knew they were in
the power of their officers again, and had
deserved to die. Their captain referred all
to Robinson, whom they made judge in this
business. He said he could not promise
them what he would do. for two or three
days--then they would find out his inten-
tions. This was very cleverly managed;
for the people in the ship, wondering that
their companions did not return, sent another
boatful to the island, leaving only two or
three in the vessel. When Robinson and
his men saw them coming, they hid them-
selves; and as soon as the men stepped
ashore, they rushed upon them so suddenly,
and with such resolution, that they master-
ed them every one, and took possession of

both their boats.
SAILS FOR ENGLAND.

ROBINSON and the
captain managed
matters so well that
they got possession
of the ship, and
granted the men
their lives on con-
dition that the
worst of them
should remain on
the island, and the
others return to their duty, and work the
ship back to England. And so you see Ro-
binson had an Opportunity of returning to
his native land at last. He and his man
Friday took leave of the island, and brought
the Spaniard away with them. Friday's
father went back to his own country, and
the rest of the English sailors took posses-
sion of Robinson's island with his permission.
He arrived in England after thirty years'
absence, and found very few of his relatives
alive. Robinson was so fortunate as to dis-
pose of his plantations in the Brazils for a
great deal of money, with which he bought
a farm in England, Friday still continuing
his most faithful servant. I find that Ro-
binson, some years after, paid his island a
visit, regulated matters there, and again re-
turned to England, where he died, at a good
old age.
