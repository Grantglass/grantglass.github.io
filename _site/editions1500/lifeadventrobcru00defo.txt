i)ANIEL DEFOE* 




lEFOE, the antlior of Robinson Crnsoe, TrwJd b« «•• 
titled to a prominent place in the history of our lit«n* 
[tiire even had he never given to the world that irnlj 
> admirable prodaotion ; and yet we may reasonably 
question whether the name of Defoe would not long 
ago have sunk into oblivion, or at least have been known, 
I ke those of most of his contemporarien, only to th« 
citriouB student, were it not attached to a work whose popularly 
has been rarely equalled — never, perhaps, excelled. Even as it is, 
the reputation due to the writer has been nearly altogether absorbed 
in that of his hero, and in the all-engrossing interest of his advea- 
tures. Thousands who have read Robmsou Crusoe with delight, 
and derived from it a satistaction in no wis-} diminishi d by repeated 
perusal, have never bestowed a thought on its author, or, indeed, 
regarded it in the light of a literary performance. While its fascination 
has been universally felt, the genius that conceived it, the talent that per- 
fected it, have been generally civerlooked, merely because ir, is so full of 
nature and reaUty as to exhibit no invention or exertion on the part ol 
the author, inasmuch a3 he appears simply to have recorded what actually 
happened and consequently only to have committed to paper plain matter 
of fact, without study or ombcLiishment. We wonder at and are struck 
with admiration by tlie powers of Slmkespeare or CervaMtes ; with regard 
t© Defoe we expenerea no similar feelings ; it is not the skill of the artist 
tliat enchants us, but the perfect naturalness of the picture, which is such 
that we mistake it for a mirror ; so that every r^aiier persuades himself 
that ha couid write as well, perhaps better, were he but fumisbed with the 
materials for an equally inteiesting narrarive. 

Tlure are many circumstances in Deibe's own bisu/fj that would reo- 
omm-'ud it to the notice of the bio"raphi=^r, independeiitly of his claims as 
the author of Robinson ; nmong which are the rariefy and eTctraordinary 
number of his literary performances, amounting to no fewijr than two hun- 
dred and nine diflFerent publications ; and the no less singuJar feet that the 
masterpiece of his penius was not only his first essay in tiiftt species of 
composition, but was not produced till hs was far advanced in years, ho 
having then arrived at a period of life when the generality of authors close 
their btevary earecj, aud when the powers of imagination cither lose much 
of their vigcrr, or become altogether torpid. Nor will our surprise at De- 
foe's iodnstry, and th« almoat unprQCedeHied (Brtiltfry of kis pea, be at ali

{doaTnuIidi by «&fisi<l«nDg tluit tie was not a recluae Btude&t bt profesee J 
Mhokr, but wae engaged in trade and rarlona other epeculaiiona. In on« 
rasp««t, hoTrevor, bis mercantile oocupations contributed to lay tha foun- 
dattoa to his excellenoe oa a noTel writer, einoe there can be little donbt 
that it is to his actual experience of the sea, and his ac<^uaintaiice vith 
other oonntries, yre are indebted for that tinith and spirit ^rhich animate the 
more intereating parts of Robinson Crusoe ; while the manly good sense, 
onaffected earoestness, and fund of native intelligence, have placed him far 
abova those who presume to \indervalue his literary acquirements. 

According to the latest and most copious of all nis bioffraphew, Dankl 
Defoe was born in 1661, two years earlier than the generally assigned data 
of his birth. His father was a butcher in the parish of St. Giles, Cripple- 

f8t«, and appears to have been a citi2en in easy circumstances, although 
is trade was one that confers no particular lustre on a pedigree. It is usual 
to effeot some degree of astonishment when we read of men whose after 
fame presents a striking contrast to the humility of their origin ; yel we 
must recollect that it is not ancestry and splendid descent, but education 
aad circumstances which form the man ; and in this respect the middling 
classes possess a decided advantage over those either below or above them ; 
for if the former are precluded from cultivating their talenta and abilitiea, 
the latter generally consider themselves exempt from the nooessity of doing 
BO, and accordingly content themselves with cultivating mere external a«- 
complishment', m preference to exercising their mental energies. Thosa, 
on the c^iurary, who are placed in the middle station, while they ara not 
debarred from the means of application, feel that stimulus to exertion 
which arises from the desire of acquiring fortune or fame. Tlie bistoir of 
such men as Ximenes, Wolsey, Alberoni, and Napoleon, may, indead, just- 
ly excite our wonder ; when, too, we behold unlettered genius emerging, 
in spite of evory obstacle, from the obscurity to which it seemed condemned, 
as in a Fergusson, a Duval, a Burns, and an Opie, we may be permitted to 
express our astonishment ; but as regards hia origin, the history of Defoe is 
that of thousands who have afterward raised themselves into comparative 
elevation by the display of their powers. The solicitude, therefore, eo 
generally displayed by biographers, on similar occasions, to trace soma 
consanguinity wit a more dignified branch of their families, for those whose 
native obscurity seems to demand some apology, betrays a rather mistaken 

Eolicy. However this may be, it is certain that it is quite as honorable for 
'efoe to have ascended from a butcher as it would have been to have de- 
tcended frbm the Conqueror himself. 

One undoubted and very great advantage, for which Defoe was indebtad 
to liis parents, who were Nonconformists, was an education superior to 
what it wa« then usual for persons in their station to bestow upon their 
chidren ; and they were careful also to implant in his youthftU mind that 
regard for religion, and that strict moral integrity, which afterward dia- 
playod themselves not only in his writings, but his conduct throngh life. 
And this rectitude of principle he most unequivocally evinctd when hi* 
misfortunes put it so severely to the proof At about the age of foostaen, 
lie was placed under the tuition of the Rev. Charles Morton, of Newington 
Green, who was afterward vice-president of Harvard College, New England ; 
and from various incidental remarks in his own works, it appears that 
yoons Defoe now entered upon an extensive course of studiee, and mada 
oonsidorable proficiency in language*, matbematica. phQosophy, history, 
Rod theology ; although the naturafliveliness of his disposition unfitted him 
for that Bererf applitnition whioh i« noceBrary to form a profbnnd aoholar in 
yv OM of fchoen parwrft*.

ptc^tgion, which their religious feelings, and probably a very pardonable 
ambition, Indti'Jed them to select for him ; yet, notwithfitandiag his regard 
for the saored ofSce, he -was unwilling to embraoe it himself ; or events, at 
least, diverted his talent* into another channel. The political and rehgioua 
axcitementa of that period were contagious for ono of Defoe's temper ; ha 
assumed the character of the patriot aa soon as he caat off that of the boy, 
and espoused the side of the popular party with all the ardor of youth ; 
nor waa it long before he had opportunities of distinguishing himself. He 
was a warm advocate for the Bill of Exclusion, passed by the Commons to 
prevent the succession of the Duke of York to the throne ; and regaj'ded 
with abhorrence that spirit of despotiam which sentenced Sydney and so 
many others to the scaffold. At the age of twenty-one he commenced 
author, which employment he continued for nearly half a century, and 
that, too, almost unmterruptedly, notwithstanding his various Rpeculatione of 
a different nature. It oannot be expected that in a sketch of this nature wa 
riiould attempt to give anything like a connected account of Defoe's various 
literary performances, they being too numerous and multifarious for us to 
advert to them separately, even if we conceived that by so doing we shculd 
greatly interest the readers of this — the most distinguiBhcd of them all. 
But the truth is, the majority of them ere of that class which it is rather 
the province of the bibliographer than the critic to describe. "We may, 
however, here mention the first production of his pen, which, under the 
singular title of " Speculum Crape-gownorura," waa a reply to a publica- 
tion of Roger L'Estrange's, a noted party writer of that day. In this work 
Defoe indulged in rather intemperate language, and while vindicating the 
dissenters, reflected in too hostile and indiscriminate a manner upon the 
establiahed clergy. This was succeeded by a " Treatise against the Turks," 
occasioned by tne war between them and the imperialists ; and was penned 
by Defoe for the purpose of showing his countrymen that, if it was the in- 
terest of Protestantism not to increase the influence of a Oatholio power, i* 
was infinitely more bo to oppose a Mohammedan one ; which, however da- 
bateable it might appear to politicians, was almost too obvious a truism to 
be entitled to any merit for its sagacity. It is the fate of political pubhca- 
tions quickly to fall into obUvion after the events which call them forth have 
passed away ; the reputation derived from them is as transitory as the 
tventa themselves, or u the feme of the writer occasionally descends to pos- 
terity, it is more than can be aflSrmed of his writings. 

Shortly after this, Defoe proved that he was as ready to support the doc- 
trines he advocated by the sword as by the pen. He accor^ugly joined 
(ha standard of the Duke of Monmouth, when the latter landed in England 
with a view of expelling a Catholic prince from the throne, and seating 
himself upon it as the defender of Protestantism. The issue of that aJ 
venture, and the subsequent fate of the unfortimate, if not perfectly inno- 
cent, Monmouth are well known. Happier than the leader of the enter- 
{irise, it was Defoe's better luck to escape. He returned to the metropo- 
is in safety ; and, abandoning politics and warfare, was content for a 
while to turn bis attention to the more humble but less stormy pursuits of 
ti'ftde. 

He now became a hosier, or rather a hose-fector, that is, a kind of agent 
between the manufacturer and retailer ; and, according to Mr. Chalmera, 
he continued to carry on this concern from 16S6 to 1696. It was about 
two yean after be oad thua established himself, that be was admitted •

boSu lixt alarm an.i m. n„n,.ii cf the Protcs--^. ^hi^-b were by no meaa 
ellayad by the teittporizing servHitr oX their own clergy, who exerted their 
doqueaoe in favor of the king's prerogative. Among those trho attacked 
the doctrln« at the dispensing power was Defoe ; nor, as may well be im- 
ft^in«d, was ho atterwy^i ah tmconcemecl spectator of the Revolution, 
vnose progress ^a had minutely watclied, and whose anniversary he con- 
iinued yearly to celebrate as a day marked by the delivei-ance of his coun- 
try from poUticai and religious tyranny. His attachment to the new sot* 
ereiga -was confirmed by tne personal notice shown him both by that 
priuce and his consort ; for the " butcher's son" hf J the honor of an early 
Sitroduction to the royal presence. 

At this period Defoe resided at Tooting in Surrey, and bs had now 
feunatied out into more extensive commercial speculations, having em- 
Itarked in the Spnniah and Portuguese trade, so that he might fairly claim 
the title of merchant. The precise time of his going to Spain, whethep 
before or after the Revolution, cannot be ascertained ; but he not onljl 
made a royage thither but stayed some time in the country, and acquired 
a knowledge of the language. Sincere as was his attachment to the puret 
tenets of Protestantism, it did not degenerate into blind prejudice, nor pre- 
Teat him from doing justice to Catholics : he has accordingly, in his Rob- 
inson Crusoe, represented the Spanish character under its most amiable 
traits, and in a tone that may almost pass for panegyric This voyage, as 
we have already remarked, ctoubtlessly contributed to store his observant 
mind with many materials for those descriptions of the pevils and adven- 
tures oommon to a sea-fanng life, that so strongly excite the sympathy of 
those who follow his hero acroM the trackless deep. Is'or was he without 
some experience of shipwreck, if not actually in his own person, by the iOS3 
of a vessel in which he was a shareholder, and which was wrecked la a 
violent storm off the coast of Biscay. It was about this period also thafe 
he traded with Holland ; probably for civet, as one of his enemies has 
eneeringly styled him a " civet-cat merohart.' Besides this he visited 
some other parts of the continent, paaticularly Germany ; he did not, how- 
ever, relinquish his hose-agency business in consequence of his other en- 
gagements. But commercial enterprise did not prove for him the roa^ 
to wealth ; on the contrary, his speculations involved him in such embar^ 
rassmente, that, in 1692, he was ooliged to abscond from his creditors. A 
oommission of bankruptcy was taken out against him, yet it was afterward 
•"perseded, those to whom he was most in debt agreeing to accept a oojai- 
position on his own bond ; and he not only punctually discharj^ed thes« 
claims, but, after he had somewhat retrieved his circumstances, vohiutarily 
repaid the remainder. This is so im..ch the more to his honor, since so far 
from having met with many precedents of similar probity in others, hi? 
misfortunes nal been in some degree occasioned by the knavery of ui^rin- 
•ipled m«n, who, avaihng themselves of the impunity held out to them by 
the supinenoss or the hnpotency of the law, were then accustomed to set 
their creditors at defiance in themost barefaced manner. 

Ifwnt Dofoe himself who tiret called the attantion of the legislature te 
the intolerable abuses which arose from thoB« aanctuariea, aa they were 
temed, for criminals aad debtors, which tb^i existed in the metropolis ; 
end to him, consequently, may we be said to be indebted for the abatement

tsme fertrar^ ati 4 offsted k> eetfcle him as a factor X ObdU .- yet, adran- 
tageoqs aft the proposal was, he d^^'clined it, preferring to eudeavor to re- 
trieve his fiaaucos by his pen. The eouatry being thm e.'V^iigcd in an 
expensive war with France, Defoe proposed a soheuie to os^ist the govern- 
ment in r!\ising " the ways and means ;" and some time af'tenvard h-,- re- 
ceived the appointment of accountant to the eommissionors of the glasi 
"iuty ; but it proved only a temporary one, as tbe duty was repealed in 
August, 1699. Probably it was also about the same period that he became 
secretary to tlie tile-works at Tilbury, in which concern he embarked some 
money, and was again a sufiferer. His " Essay on Proj^-ots," published in 
January, 1696-7, shows him to have been, if not a rery successful spcculutor 
himself, at least a very ingenious and fertile deviser of theoretical plans, 
moat of which mnst bo allowed to have the welfare of society in view ; nor 
Jiave they been without influence in leading to many improvements of later 
times ; among those which have been practiaaily adopted, we may men- 
tion his scheme for Friendly Societies and Saving Banks. Were any testi- 
mony requu-ed in favor of this work, it would be sufficient to quote that of 
the celebrated Franklin, who confesses that the impressions he reaeivttd 
from it gave a strong bias to his own pursuit*. 

If not invariably employed in the active defence of public morals, DellM's 
pen was too honest to betray their interests on any oecj.sion : it was not 
alwpys that his topics called for, or even admitted, any direct inouloatioM 
of vu"tue, but whenever they did, he displayed his earnestness in its behalf. 
His publication entitled " The Poor Man's Plea" is a very keen piece ef 
satire, with a considerable touch of humor, leveled against the vices of the 
upper classes of society, in which he urges them to discountenance by their 
own conduct the immorality they deem so reprehensible in the Tulgar. 
The stage too did not escape his eastigation ; and really its transgressions 
were at that period so barefaced and audacious, so offensive even to com- 
mon decency, that, whatever infamy there may have been in either toler- 
ating or in attempting to defend such a system of lewdne-ss, there could be 
no great triumph in exposing that which did not. oTea »**'^mpt to «oucmI 
itself. 

"We have now to notice our author in a somewbat; different chai<tcter— 
namely, as a candidate for poetical fame. His satire, entitled the '* True- 
bom Englishman," which was written for the purpose of averting from the 
king the abusive reflections cast upon him as a foreigner, had indeed a 
very great run at the time — more, however, on account of the matter than 
of the manner — since both that and all Defoe's other attempts of the kind 
convince us, that, like the great Roman orator, he wan an intolerably bad 

Soet, and not even a decent versifier. Yet could gratitude and enthasiasti* 
evotion to his prince have supplied the inspiration which the muses de- 
nied him, Defoe's poetry would have been of nrst-rate exeellenee, so sineerd 
was lus admiration of, so zealous was his devotion to, William HI. The 
various effusions in rhyme, and the numerous political pamphlets and 
tracts which he published at this interval, we must pass by, and eonw 
directly to an event that obtained for our author a rather unenviable species 
of distinction. The reign of Anne commenced with mueh violenee aui 
with cabals between the respective church parties, leading to controversies 
that rather fanned than allayed the public ferment. On onch an oeeaaion, 
it was not to be expected that Defoe would remain passive ; auoming the 
furious tone of the high-ehurchmen of the day against tbe disaAatert, ha 
published a small pamphlet, which was in reality a satire upon the writings 
•which that party had issued from the press ; but the irony was so fine, ood 
tbe imitation so exact, that while it was supposed by them to utter ft0 
real sentiments of the writer. ** '**««WQr8ta4 \^ tiioM whom m

was intended to eerve ae oomiag from a riolent enemy. Tbe " 8hort«ii 
way with the Dissenters''' — such was it« title — created an amazing 6«n»ation ; 
and on its real object being exposed, the high-church party beoame ai 
fierce in their indignation, as they had before been warm in their applause. 
The author was detected, a reward offered for his apprehension, and h« 
himself sentenced to be imprisoned in Newgate, and to stand in the pillory; 
but the attendance of his friends, and the enthusiasm of the populace \jx 
favor of the champion of religious liberty, converted an ignominious pu»- 
ishment into a triumph, eo that his enemies had as Mttle reason to exult in 
their victory, as to be proud of the sagacity they had displayed. If, how- 
ever, this event rather increased than diminished Defoe's reputation, it bad 
a different effect upon his pecuniary affairs ; his confinement in Newgat* 
prevented his attending any longer to his concern at Tilbury, the conB«- 
quence of wliich was that it was obliged to be given up ; aud thus Defoe 
8a7 himself deprived at once of what had been the source of a handsome 
ineome, for before this affair he was in such thriving circumstances as to 
bo able to keep his ooach. According to his own statement, he lost three 
thousand five hundred pounds, a far more considerable sum at that period 
Dhan it 'wtjuld be now. There was indeed one way of both speedily aa4 
safely repairing his finances, namely, by accepting the overtvu-es made 
him by the ministry, who would gladly nave enUsted in their own cause 
that pen which had proved so powerful against them ; but Defoe was too 
independent of soul, and too high principled, to purchase his release upon 
terms that would inflict upon him the disgrace the pillory Imd fiailed to 
effect. 

Although a prison is not the most congenial place for literary ptimuite, 
our author availed himself of the time -which the loss of his liberty afforded 
him, of occupying his unwelcome leisure £i>om all other business m writing 
both in verse and prose. It was here that he pubhshed his poem on the 
*' Reformation of Manners," a sufficiently copious theme in every age, and 
afterward continued the subject in another, entitled " More Reformation ;" 
in which he alludes to his own situation in the following nervous lice^ 
desoribioj himself as 

' " A modern tool, 

To wit, to parties and himself a fool ; 
BmbroiUd with states to do himself no good, 
And by his friends themaelvei misuudernood,* 
Migeonetrued first in every word he said — 
By these unpltled, and by those unpaid." 

Bere we may truly b&j facit indignatio versus for the caustic tone and c-io 
Atheeis are not unworthy of Pope himself. The political controversial 
pieees which he sent forth to the world from his "place of durance vile" 
were too numerous for us to specify them ; we therefore prefer speaking of 
a work of more permanent interest, one in which he may be regarded a* 
Ibo immediate predeeeesor of two of the most popular and admired of our 
oJaMle writers' in the days of Anne — namely, Steele and Addison. DefoeV 
" Review," which commenced Fob. 19, 1704, deserves to be considered a* 
the prototype of our Tatlers and Spectators ; and may earn for its author 
the appellation of the Father of English Essayists ; since notwithstanding 
that political intelligence and diBou»aion constituted a great portion of ne 
oonteate, it touched upon a variety of other topics bearing upon literatui*, 
moWMrs, and morals ; while it was itself hardly in any decree Indebted for

vsti serious remonstrance ; afc another, substituting ssrcturai, nuinor, fnt, 
and pleaaantry, for monitory reproof. To a modern reader, indeed, many 
of the topics might seem to lack invention, and to be rather common-place, 
merely because they have been so repeatedly handled by later writers, that 
both the wit aad argument di6pla;^d in them have lost their freahneee. 
This circumstance, however, does not detract from Defoe's intrinsic merits 
or from the praise due to him as an originator ; on the contrary, he, in this 
respect, only shares the fate common to all those vrho open a new path in 
literature or art, inviting imitators whose number oppress, if they do not 
overwhelm them ; that Defoe has not tince been surpassed in this species 
of writing is far more than we can venture to assert ; yet it should ba 
recollected that it is the first navigator of the Atlantic, not those who oro«» 
k in a modern steamboat, who claims the homage of our admiration. 

Those who are unacquainted with Defoe the essayist, as well as Defo4 
the novelist, will not be able to appreciate the extent of our author's 
powers, and the variety of his information. But we have already dwelj 
upon the " Review" at greater length than is consistent with the brevitj 
we must perforce observe ; it is time, therefore, to proceed with our nar* 
rative, Mr. Harley, afterward earl of Oxford, happened, by a change in 
the ministry, to come into power, after Defoe had been about two yeara 
in confinement, and being able to appreciate his abilities — perhaps anxious 
to secure them in his own support, he represented his case to the queen, 
who genewusly sent a sum of money to hia wife and family, and another t* 
discharge his fine and prison expenses. Immediately upon his hberation, 
Defoe retired to Bury St. Edmunds. It was there that he wrote his mas- 
terly treatise, entitled " Giving Alms no Charity," in which he displaye 
great practical knowledge, with enlarged and sound views on the causes oi 
poverty, and on the employment of the poor. In the intervals of these 
and other occupations, for it should be observed that he had been sent in 
1705 by Harley on a secret mission to the continent, the express object of 
•which has not transpired — he found leisure to employ his pen on other 
subjects, and anticipating his future character of a romance writer, he 
intended the " true narrative" of Mrs. Veal's apparition, which was pre- 
fixed to a translation of Drelineourt on Death. The supposed stranger from 
the other world is made to recommend that performance ; and, as •uch 
8uj>ernatural testimony was irresistible, the whole impression, which had 
before lain on the bookseller's shelves, was quickly sold, and was succeeded 
by many others, the work having since passed through forty difi"erent edi- 
tions. This stratagem certainly does honor to Defoe's ingenuity and pene^ 
tration ; yet whether it be entirely justifiable, considering the tendency of 
ttie deception, may be doubted. 

Leaving for a while the account of his literary career, we mu*t now 
briefly notice a very important national subject, namety, the Union with 
Scotland, in whi?h, besides warmly advocating the measure with his pen, 
Defoe was personally employed. At the recommendation of Harley and 
Lord Godolphin, by whom he had been recommended to the queen, he 
was sent on a mission to Edinburgh, in which city he arrived in October, 
1706. Here, it should seem, he was chiefly employed in making calcula- 
tions relating to trade and taxes, for the information of the committees of 
parliament; he also occupied himself in collecting those documents relative 
to the Union which he afterward pubhshed. Besides this, he proposed 
several plans for encouraging the manufactures, and for promoting the 
trade, wealth, and maritime resources of Scotland. After an absence of 
about sixteen months, he returned to England in 1708, when his serviees 
obtained fo? hinj, from the ministry, an appoigtipent. vrxph a fijfjsd ealary ;

Ward, his patro'i tiarley was dismissed from office, through the pi-rseveviiig 
itiU'iguts or the duchess of Maiborough, whom ho h^d Siiipiauted iu tho 
queou's favor, ao event that suddenly ovei'cloudt^d Defoe'a jioatical jirus- 
pect. Without compromising his principles, however, he' espouetd f lie in- 
t*re.sfc of the sncceeding ministry; but although Godolpii.n tna'cd hiui 
wiili e(in!?idjratioa, lie surtcred his pension to fall into a :ca:-3, porhnps ip 
conaequenco of Defoe's long absence iu Seotlaud, whitht-r lie was again 
dt^patcued a few months attorward, upon some secret busimss. In the 
foll.iwibg year, 170'), Defoe published a work which, to use the wurrls of an 
emiii«iit living critic, " plact-8 him among the soundest historians of the 
•day ;" and which, according to the testimony of another, wuuld have 
han led down his name to posterity, even had he not immortalized himstlf 
by llobinson Crusoe. This was his " History of the Union," which is as 
interest. ng for the minute descriptions it gives of the actors and incidents 
'a tiiat importiint event, as for the documents it furnishes. 

Slill engaged in politics, Defoe's continued and severe attacks against 
fbe Tories and high-churcli part}' so exasperated them, that tliey attempted 
to suppress his Avritiugs, and even thr^ atened hiui with prosecutions ; their 
animosity, however, did not procure for him, from those whose cause h© 
defended, a c" -gree of favor and support at nil commensurate with hia long 
and able services. He had also to contend with fresh pecuniary losses iu 
some concern in which he was engaged (1712) with Mr. Wood, a mercer of 
Coleshiil in Wurwickshire, and with the personal abuse with which his 
charactor was assailed by writers who reflected upon him as being a knav- 
ii^h bankrupt. But his political career was now drawing to its close ; 
having carried on his '• Review" for more than nine years, be finally relin- 
quished itiu May, 1713, when be veas again a prisoner in Newgate upon 
an indictment jjreferred against him bj^his friends the Whigs, as the author 
of three treasonable Jacobitical pamphlets whereas the publications iu 
question were of a directly opposite tendency. The queen once more be- 
stowed a free pprdon on him, and the malice of bis numerous enemies wft') 
defeited. From this time he employed his pen only occasionally on politi- 
cal subjects. By the accession of George 1. to tiie throne, Defoe gained 
nothing, ali.hough his writings had strenuously pleaded the cause of the 
House of Hanover during the late reign; and although he had superior 
claims upon public gratitude for the zeal with which, during nearly thirty 
years, he had not only advocated religious and political independence, bui 
endeavored to call attention to subjects of paramount importance to th»- 
iiationa). prosperity. That this neglect should, in spite of all his p'niloso' 
phy, have occasioned him coii6idoraV)le mortitication, is not much to be 
wondeivd at ; and to the effect it had upon his health was attribiitcd au 
apopk'ctic attaok in the year 1715, from which he continued to sufler for 
8i.\ luontns. 

After so serious a blow to his constitution, and at his advanced period Oi 
life, it migiit have been expected that he would now lay aside his pen — at 
Last rem:t his exertions. Yet it was subsecpiently to this apparently 
coudy <'poch of his career that the brighte'st and most durable of his lite- 
rar}- wreaths wis won. (Jreat versatility of talent is not often acconijmnied 
by !m equal degree of vigoj" and raciness of intellect ; when, however, such

works of evtn splendid ceJebritj. It is the series of uoveis wkicb now 
appear iu quick succeteiou from his pen, that liave won f >r li la an imper- 
ishable reputation among the wnrchies of English lit rature ; normal hiri 
claims ujioii our adiuiration be diminished by considering the ext:'aTa^aut, 
unnatural system of romance-writing which had tiJl then prevailed, where 
CA-erythiiig was either so artificial or so shadowy, that not a glimj se nt real 
life was to be discerned. In Defoe's narratives, on the cuntrary, there u. 
such an air of downright matter-of-fact and unadorned trith, as *t > amonnt 
to actual deception; thereby preventing us from crediting the aiuhor with 
any merit on the score of imagination, contrivance, or invention. Oi this 
the reader will be amply convinced by the perusal of the present woik, ou 
which >t is not necessary that "we shovdd expatiate, and we pliall theri'fore 
merely advei't to the circumstances connected with its origin and publica- 
tion. The history of Robinson Crusoe was first publi.~hed in th^- year 
1719, and its popularity may be said to have been established imiucdiatelj^, 
flince four editions were called for in about as many months, a cir. umetance 
at that time almost unprecedented in the annals of litei aturo. It rarelj 
happens t!iat an author's expectations are surpassed by the success of hit 
work, however astonishing it may seem to others ; yet p< rhaps even Defoe 
himself did not venture to look forward to such a welcome on the ]iirt o. 
the public, after the repulses he had experienced on that of th^' books* Here ; 
for incredible as it now appears, the manuscript of the work had been 
offered to, and rejected by, every one in the trade, in whieh respect ils des- 
tiny was not only similar to that of Paradise Lo.=t, but two of the most cele- 
brated Uterary productions of the present day, namely, 'Waverleyand Childe 
Harold ; the former of which remained in manuscript ten years, wi'hout 
any probability of ever seeing the light, although its fatne has since eX' 
tended itself wherever the English language is known — nay more, has even 
penetrated the wilds of Siberia. 

Astonishing as was the success of Defoe's romance, it did not deter th« 
envious from attempting to dispai'age it. The materials, it wis said, were 
, either furnished hy, or surreptitiously obtained from, Alexander Selk.rk, a 
mariner who had resided for four years in the desert island of Juan Fi rnaa- 
dez, and returned to England in 1711. Veiy probably, his stury, which 
then excited considerable interest and attention, did suggest to Defoe the 
idea of writing his romance ; but all the details and incidents are euiirely 
his own. Most certainly Defoe had obtained no papers or \n'ittcn noca 
ments from Selkirk, as the latter had none to communicate. So far. now- 
ever, ha^'e others been from taxing our author with plai^iarisin, that they 
have, ou the contrary, charged him with putting on paper a heap of onime- 
ras, to impose upon putdic credulity. Thus these two cuntrad»<-t<ry 
charijes reciprocally destroy each other. An attem; t h.-is also b^ en made 
to rob him entirely of the brightest jewel in his literary crown, by denying 
him to have been the auth(.r of Robinson Crusoe, which has b.en aseribed, 
by some, to Arbuthnot; by others, to Defoe's patron, the fir t eurl ».■*' Ox- 
ford. Those who have wished to gain credit fur the latter opinion, nssert 
that it wcvs composed by that nobleman during his imi>risoi)m< nfc i'l the 
Tower, in 1715, on a charge of high treason ; and they have urgetl tl-^t Iho 
whole tone of the work, especially of that part toward the conci'tsion 
•where an account is given of the exiled nobles of Muscovy, ij what "'ould 
naturajl''- be suggested by the solitude of a prison. Yet a"3 fer as int.. mal 
evidence is concerned, that is, indisputably, much etronger in favor of Dc' 
foe ; for he had not only been familiar with imprisonment, but was also by

mneli piaotiftal Imowledge of things, as well as of man. Indeed, notWal 
Bhprt of the most conolusive and undeniable testimony of feots to Uie ooa> 
trary can Bt all invalidate the claims to be considered as the r«al author. 
Had Robinson Crusoe been the only produotion of the kind that proceeded 
from his pen, there might be better reason for doubting whether he wrota 
tt; but the various othernovels, or rather pieces of fictitious biography, 
which he produced, form an additional reason for attributing it to him. 

Of these latter we mnst here speak far more briefly than they deterre ,• 
tbe " History of ^oll Flanders," which was published in 1721, is an ad- 
Bairably drawn picture of life, and contains an excellent moral lesson, 
•Ithough many of the scenes it necessarily discloses are coarse and rovoit- 
fag. The " Life of Colonel Jaque" contains almost as much able delineatioa 
of real life ; and in that part of the narrative which gives account of the 
hero's residence in Virginia, Defoe has humanely advocated the cause of the 
negro slaves. His " Memoirs of a Cavalier/' which work is supposed t» 
have been written about the same time, is rather history attired in the form 
«f an imaginaiy piece of biography, than a romance. Indeed, all the de- 
tails are so circumstantial and accurate, that it has been mistaken for a 
genuine narrative of the events of the civil wars in England and Germany ; 
and it was actually recommended as the very beet account of them by tn« 
great Lord Chatham, with whom it was a favorite book. In like manner 
our author's " History of the Plague" imposed upon Dr. Mead, and since 
upon others, who have referred to it as an authentic document, and a true 
recital of that great national calamity. Here he is the rival of Thucydidea 
and Boccacia ^and depicts the horrors of pestilence as vividly and as mas- 
terly as Poussm. It may, however, be imagined by some that this is rather 
suspicious praise, and that the work of fiction which can pass as true his- 
tory must be cold, matter-of-fact, and tame — I'epulsive and dry. It is not, 
however, in the formal gravity of style that these works resemble history ; 
but they imitate and reflect the features of the past in their most interesting, 
if not their most engaging aspect. 

Besides the preceding, ane" one or two other productions of a similar oast, 
Defoe produced that very excellent and popular work entitled " Religious 
Courtship," which was first published in 17122, and afterward went through 
numerous editions. This and his " Family Instructor" are replete with 
lessons of the soundest practical wisdom, and place theiv author among the 
most extensively useful of our English moralists. ' 

Here, however, we must terminate our sketch, having barely left our-" 
wives room to mention a few particulars relative to the close of his life. 
Although the profits accruing from his publications had of late been oon- 
Bide?RbTe, and he had been able to give a portion to his daughter Sophia, 
who married Mr. Baker, the celebrated natural philosopher, in 1729, yet 
he was still doomed to cQntend with misfortune. In addition to the araio- 
kion of bodily infirmity and severe pain, he again fell into great pecuniary 
difficulties, and was even arrested. He »>ppear8, however, to have recovered 
his liberty within a short time ; but th(t unnatural conduct of his son, who 
refused to give up the property that had been intrusted to him, with a view 
of securing a provision to his mother and two unmarried sisters, was a 
heavier blow than any he had before experienced ; and the mental anguish 
it occasioned doubtless acc^erated his death, which occurred on the 24th 
of April, 1781. Since that period more than a century has elapsed ; and 
in that interval many names of considerable eminence in their day hax's 
sunk into irretrievable obhvion ; Defoe, also, has lost some portion of th« 
celebrity he enjoyed with his contemporaries ; yet, after deduction, enough 
remains to entitle him to i plaoe among the worthies of Enghsh lifeeri*ni*» 
fcr should all his other pro^nctions be lorgrpt^eRi Un Vsi^haon. Cm»oo nw^

and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. lie told me it w»t 
men of desperate fortunes, on one hand, or of superior fortunes, on 
the other, who went abroad upon adventures, aspiring to rise by en- 
terprise, and make themselves famous in uudertaklngH of a nature o«t 
of the common road ; that tl«jse things wore all either too far abovt 
me, or too far below me ; that mine was the middle state, or what 
might bo called the upper station of low life, which he had founds by 
long experience, waa the best state in the world, the most suited to 
human happiness ; not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the 
labor and sufferings, of the mechanic part of mankind, and not em- 
barrasHcd with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part 
of mankind ; he told me, I might judge of the happiness of this state 
by one thing, viz., that this was the stale of life which all othei people 
envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable cons''.- 
quences of being bom to groat things, and wished they had been 
placed in the middle of two extremea, between the moan and the great 
that the wise man gave his testimony to thin as the juNt standard ol 
true felicity, when he prayed to have " neither poverty nor riches." 

lie bade me observe it, and I should always find, that the calamitise 
of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind ; hvt 
tk&i the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed 
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of maukiad * nay 
ksioy were not subjected to so many distempers and uneaNinesses, lithoi

p«r8 upon themselves by the natural consequouoes of their way of

hsiidmaida of a middle fortune ; thai temperance, moderation, qoiet-

3e?ough the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, witboct 
i£M bilt«r ; feeling that they are happy, and learning, by every day'i 
axpenenoe^ to know it more sensibly. 

After this he pressed me earnestly^ and in the most affectioiiat« 
Bi&Qnor, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate mys«lf iate 
Eds«>Tie4 which nature and the station of life I was born in, seemed to 
\are provided against ; that 1 was mider no necessity of seeking my 
%read ; that he would do well for me,, and endeavor to enter me fairly 
urto the statioD of life which he had been jnst recommending to bm , 
and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be 
my mere fatd or fault that mu^it hinder it ; and that he should have 
nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning 
me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt ; in a word, 
that, as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle 
1^ home, ac he directed^- so he would not have so much hand in my 
taisfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away ; and to close 
all, he told me 1 had my elder brother for an example, to whom he 
had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into 
*he Low Country wars ; but could not prevail, his young demrefl 
prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed , and though, 
he said, he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to 
say to me, that if I did take thisfooUsh step, God would not bless me. 
and I wonld have leisure, hereafter, to reflect upon having ncg>eot6d 
^ oomisel, wh^ there migh^ be none to assist in my recovery. 

I observed in the last part of bis di8cour«»», which was truly oro- 
j^e^ though, I suppose, my father did not know it to be so himself; 
I i»y I obeerred the tears run down hia fe.ce very plentifully, esf^ecially 
when he spoke of my brother woo was killed , and that, when b« 
Ipoke of my naving leisure to repent, and none to assist mo, he was 
•0 moved that hp broke off the diwourse, and told me his heart wa« 
W ftaJi, he (Vjuld say no mere to me. 

1 was sijB«Hireiy affected with this disoourse, aa, indeed, who oovli 
bt otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any EjcrSj 
bat to settle at home, aooordiug to my fnihert leecre. Bai, &!&« I ■ 
few days wore it ail off; and, m short, to prevent aaf of my btiiw'f 



farther tsapoitaolties, in a few weok« after, I rsiolyed lo roa qvilo 
away f^om him. Howevor, I did not act so havtily noither, aa mj 
first heat of resolution prompted, bat I took my mother, at a liiM 
when I thought her a little pleasanter than ordinary, imd told her thaf 
ny thoagbtB were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I ihoold 
aaver settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it| 
•ad my father had better give me his consent than foroe me to g« 
without it ■ that I was now eighteen years old, which was too lat6 te 
go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure, c? I 
^d, I should never serve out my time, and I should certainly run 
away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea ; and if 
■he would speak to my father to let me make but one yoyage abroad, 
if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more, and I 
would promise by a double diligence, to recover the time I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion ; she told me she knew it 
would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such a suN 
ject ; that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent

for me ; but I might depend I should never have their consent to it ;

•&B* AAwiteawatBea, andExpiriwM of aMaritlnie Uto-Voyaf» loOoiank 

N the 1st of September, 1651, 1 went on board a ship oooad 
for London. Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I 
believe, began younger, or continued longer than mine 
The ship had no sooner got out of the Humber than th« 
wind began to blow, and the waves to riae in a most frightful man. 
aer ; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly 
Bick "^ ^^^ ^^ terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect 
upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg- 
ment of Heaven, for wickedly leaving my father's house. All the 
good oounsels of my parents, my fathef*s tears, and my mother's en- 
treaties, oame now fVesh into my mind, and my oonsoienco, which 
was not yet come to the pitch of hardtcess to which it has been sinoa, 
roproaohed me with the contempt of advice and the abandonment of 
duty. 

All this while the storm increased, and the eea, which I had never 
been upon before, went very high, though nothing like what I have 
wem many times since ; no, nor what I saw a few days after ; bat 
such as it was, enough to afifeot me then, who was but a young sailox 
and had never known anything of the matter. I expected every war* 
would have swallowed us up, and at every time the ship fell dow% 
u I thought, into the trough or hollow of the sea, we should nevai 
riee more ; and, in this agony of mind^ I made many vows and re>K> 
lotions, that if it would please God to spare my life this voyage, if 
aver I got my foot once on dry land, I would. go directly home to my 
fikther, and never set it into a ship again while I lived ; that I woold 
take his advice, and never run myself into suoh miseries as these any 
more. Now I saw plainly the goodnoBS of his observations aboai the 
eiddle station of life ; how easy, how comfortable he had lived eii 
hifl days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or trcabl€S 
«D ^re, and I resolved thi^ I would, lik« a tmo rep^^*^ prodigal 
fgfi btOBM to mj £itk«7. 



TliSM irise aai aober tliougbts eontiaaed <htrfBg the cbom, aa^ 
iadeed. some time after; bu*^ the next day, ag the wind wae abated 
tcid the sea ciilmur, I bega& to be a little inured to it. liowever, 1 
waa very grave that day, being also a littlo iseasick still — but toward 
sught the weather cleared up, the wind wmn quite over, and a cbana 
sag fine evening followed ; the sun went down perfectly clear, and 
rose 90 the next morning, and having little or no wind and a imcotk 
sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight waa, as I thought, the most d* 
lightftil that I ever saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and wae now no more seatick bai 
very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that wa« bo rougb 
and teri-ible the day before, and coiUd be so oalm and pleasant in • 
Iktle time after. 

And now, lest my good resolution should oontinae, my oompanica, 
who had indeed enticed mo away, came to me and said, " Well, Bob," 
clapping me on the shoulder, " how do you do after it f I warrant 
you wore frightened, wa'n't you, last night, when it blew but a cap 
fall of wind ?" " A cap full, do you call it T" eoid I ; ** 'twas a ter. 
rible storm." " A storm, you fool !-' replies be, " do you call that a 
ttorm T Why, it was notliing at all ; give us but a ffood ship and sea 
room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that Too 
are but a fresh water sailor, Bob ; come, let us make a bowl of punch, 
and we'll forget all that. D'ye see what charming weather 'tis now f 

To make short this sad part of my story, we wont the way of all sail 
•rs ; the punch was made, and I was made drunk with it ; and is that 
9De night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflection* 
3pon my past conduct, and all my resolutions for the future. In a word 
t» the sea was returned] t<i i^e smoothue/w of surface and eottled calno' 
&e88 by the abarement of *ae storm, so the hurry of my thoughts b«in| 
97er, my fears and appr tbousions of being swallowed up by the sea 
forgotten, and the curreh * of my former desires returned, f mitiraly 
fc?75Ct the vows and promises I had made in my distres*. I found, 
iodoed, some intervals of reflection, and serious thoughts did, aa H 
were, endeavor to return again sometimes; but I shook them oS, and 
reused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying 
myself tc drink and company, soon mastered the return of those fits, 
&>r so I called them, and had, in live or six days, got as oomplete a 
fiotory over oonsoienoe as any young sinner that resolved not to b« 
fcroQbled with it wuld desire. Hut, as I was to have another trial foi

iMrwttu^:^ the next wm to b« saoh a one u Ih* wwra^ And most 
hardened wretch among ns would confras both the danger and tN 
Bieroy of. 

The sixth day of onr being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads 
ll^ wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, we had mad<i 
sot little way tdnoe the storm. Here we were obliged to come to a« 
aebor, and here wo lay, the wind eontinaing contrary, ris., at south 
west, for seven or eight days, during which time a great many shipk 
from Newcastle came into the same roads as the common harbot 
where the ships might wait for a wind for the river Thames. We 
had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided up the 
fiver, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four 
or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned aa 
good as a harbor, the anchorage good, and our ground tackle very 
strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive 
of danger, but spent the time in re»t and mirth, after the manner of 
the sea. But the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and 
We had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make every- 
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible 
By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode foreoastJf 
in, shipped several seas, and we thought, once or twice, our anohofl 
had cnme home, upon which our master o/dered out the sheet-anohor, 
ao that we rode vi*h. two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to 
the better end. 

By this time it blew a terrible storm, indeed ; and now I }s.^asi to 
gee terror and amazement in the faces of even the seamen tMmselvos. 
The master wsm vigilant in the business of preserving the aM^ ; but, as 
^ went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly say to 
iuaielf several times, " Lord, be merciful to us ! we shall be all lost 
s» shall be all undone V and the like. During these first hurries I wai 
jtaj'id, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot 
iMK'ribe my tamper. I could ill reaseume the first penitence, which I 
bad so trampled upon, and hardened myself against ; I thought that 
tii& bitterness of death had been past, and that this would have been 
nothing too, like the first ; but when the master himself came by me, 
aa I said just now, and said we should all be lost, I was uroadfitlly 
frightened. I gtjt up out of my cabin, and lookod out ; but such a dis- 
mal si^ht I never saw ; the sea went mountains high, and broke npoi 
w every three or fonr minutes. When I could look about, I could se( 
■oibiDg but distress around as ; two ships, that nd near us, we found 
had out their raa^ta by the board, being dee];^ laden ; and o^vr tam 



Si ADYSHTUBBi QW

^rh4 Two more ships bebg driven from thoir aochon, W6ve m OMI 
:.f tho roads to sea, at all adventures, and thitt with not a mast Btait&^. 
i'be light ahips &red the best, as not so muoh laboring in the sea ; tmt 
>j70 or three of them drove, and oame close to as, miming away, ' 
cslj their spritsails out, before the wind. Towturd evenini^ the 
Asd boatswun of our ship begged the master to let them oat away tht 
foremast, whioh he was very loath to do ; but the boatswain protMtuig 
to him that if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; a&j 
when they had cut away the foremast, the zoainmast stood so loose, aad 
shook the ship so much, that they were obliged to cot it away also, aad 
make a dear deck. 

Any one may judge what a conditi(Ht I wsast be in at all this, who 
was but a young sailor, and who hud been in such a fright before at 
but a little. But if I can express, at this distanoe, the thoughts I bad 
about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon ao- 
ooont of my ibrmer convictions, and the having returned from them to 
the resolutions I had vrickedly taken at first, thou I was at death itself- 
and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me bte such a ooniS- 
tioD, that I can by no words describe it ; but the worst was not oo&m 
yet; the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen themselvM 
acknowledged they had never known a w:>r8e. Wo had a good ship, 
but she was deep laden, and so swallowed in the sea, that the seamea 
every now and then cried out she would fbonder. It was my adrao 
tage, in one respeet, that I did not know what they meant hjfoundtr 
till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that I saw what it 
•ot often seen, the master, the boatawain, and some others more sensibl* 
(han the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment the ship 
would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under »U the 
net of our distresses, one of the men, that had been down an purpoM 
*9 see, cried oat, we had sprung a Idak ; another said there was four 
i^t water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At 
that very word my heart, as I thought, died within me, and I fell back- 
ffvd upon the side of my bed, where I sat m the cabin. However, the 
men roused me, and told me that I, who was able to do nothing before, 
was as well able to ptmip as another : at which I stirred op and went 
to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was daistg, tke 
■aaeter seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the itorn^ 
were obliged to slip and nm away to sea, and would not come near oi^ 
erdered us to flro a gxm, as a Agaal of distress. L, who knew nothinf 
Vll»t HbM ueeut, was so Murorised, that I thouj^t the ship hjt4 broko^

•i tone dreadfbil thing had happened. In • woro, f wm so eorpAco^ 
tt«i I &U dowQ in a s^oon. A» this waa ft time when everybody had 
h» own life to think o^ no one minded me, or what was become of me 
but another man stepped up to the pomp, and throat me a^de with hit 
ftyet, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; and it was a great wMle 
tMfbre I oame to myself. 

We worked on ; but the water inoreamng in the hold, it waa appa 
nmt that the ship would founder ; and ihough the storm began to abats 
a little^ yet it waa not possible she could swim till we might run into a 
port, so the master oontiaued firing guns for help ; aai a light ship, 
who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It 
was with the utmost hazard that the boat oame near us, bat it was im" 
possible for OS to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's 
side ; till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their 
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stem, with a buoy 
to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after great labcr 
and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, 
and got all into their boat It waa to no purpose for them or us, afU« 
we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship ; so aU agreed 
to let her drive, and only to pull her toward shoro as much as y^' 
tcvld : and our master promised them, that if the boat was stavea npca 
ibore, he would make it good to their master ; so partly rowing and 
partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towaid 
Hoe shore almost as far as Winterton-Neas. 

VTo were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our sh^p 
when we saw her dnk, and then I understood, for the first time, what 
was meant by a ship's foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge, i 
had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinkini^ 
&>r from that moment they rather put me into the boat than that I might 
S»« Bsad to go in. My heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with 
fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yel 
feefore me. 

While we were in this condition, the men yet laboring at the oar t» 
bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when, our boat momi&ig 
ftfl waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running 
along the strand, to asost us when we should come near ; but we madi 
dow way toward the shore, nor were we able to reach it, till, bei&g 
past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westwurfl, 
toward Cromer, and so the laud broke off a little tho violoace of th« 
ytikA. Here we got In, and though not without much difficulty, got aJb

QafortoBfttA men, we wen used with great komaaity, m wd by &r. 
magistrat^e of the town, who assigned ub good quarters, as br the j w 
lictdar merchants and owners of ships ; and had money given as su0^ 
wtjt to oarry us either to London or back to Uull, as we saw fit. 

Had I now had the senwe to have gone back to Hull, and have gr>s>.t 
home. I had been happy; and my father, an emblem of our blesped 
Saviour's parable, had even killed thd fatted calf for me ; for, hearing 
til* »'hip I went in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great 
while before he had any assurance that I was not drowned. 

But my ill fate pushed me on with an obstinacy that nothing oould 
resist ; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason 
•nd my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to 
do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a 
secret, overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of 
our owt> destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush 
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some suoh decreed 
unavoidable misery attending, and which it was impossible for me 
to escar»f, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasoningt 
and persuasions of my 'nost retired thoughts, and against two suoh 
visiMo instructions as I bad met with in my first attempt. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, uad who wna 
the magter's son, was now loss forward than I. The first time ho spoka 
to me after we were at Yarmouth, which waa not till two or thre* 
days, for we were separated in the town to several quarters ; I say 
the first tinie he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered, and, looking 
▼ery melancholy and shaking his head, he asked c* how I did; tell- 
ing hi? father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for 9 
ferial, in order to go farther abroad. His father, turning to me, with 
A grava and concerned tone : " Young man," says he, " you had nevsr 
>gLa;ht to go to sea any more ; you ought to take this for a plain and 
Tinlle token, that you are not to be a seafaring man." •' Why, sj,* 
>»ftid I, " win you go to sea no more T" ** That is another case," said 
he; ''it IB my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made 
this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given yon of 
what yon are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all befallea 
H o« your aooonnt, like Jonah in the ship of Tarehish. Pray," oon-

fravaiy to m« ; exhorted me to 30 back to my father, and not temp* 
Providence to my ruin ; told me, I might see a visible hand of Ileaveg 
against mo ; " and, young man," said he, *' depend upon it, if you do 
not go back, wherever you go, you wQl meet with nothing but djs 
asters and disappointments, till your father's words are fulfilled apott 
you." 

We partdd soon after, for I made him little answer, and I MW him 
no nore : which way he went, J know net : as for me, having some 
money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land ; and there, as well 
as on the road, had many struggles with myself what coorfie of life J 
should take, and whether I should go home or go to sea. As to going 
home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughfaB 
and it immediately oc4urred to me, how I should be laughed at among 
the neighbors, and should be ashamed to see, not try father and 
mother only, but even everybody else. From whence I have often 
since observed how incongruous and irrational the common temper of 
mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide 
them in such cases, viz., that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are 
ashamed to repent ; not ashamed of the action, for which they ought 
justly to be esteemed fools ; but are ashamed of the retamii>% which 
only can make them be esteemed wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some ihaSf caeertalo 
what measures to take, and what course of lifs to leed. Axi. irrenat' 
ible reluctance continued to going home j and as I stayed awhile, tht 
rmnombranoe of the distress I had been in wore 0IL, and aa that 
•bated, the little motion I had in my desires to a return wore oif witib 
it. till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for 
f> TOya^e. That eT41 influence which carried me first away from aj 
S^er'a house, that hurried me into the wild and indigested notion oi 
r&king my fortune, and that impressed those conceits so forcibly npoa 
%9, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties, and 
/V u. the commands of my father ; I say, the same influence, whatera 
a J? ikt presented the most unfortunate of all enterprises tc my view j

tato to choose for the "worse, bo I did here ; for having money in my 
l^ocket, and good clothes upon my back, I would always go on board 
In the habit of a gentleman ; and so I neither had any business in tho 
ship, nor learned to do any. It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty 
good company in Xjondon ; which does not always happen to such 
loose and misguided young fellows as I then was; the devil, generally' 
not omitting to lay some snare for them very early. But it was net 
go with me ; I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship, who bad 
been on the coast of Guinea, and who, having had very good 6uco«M 
there, was resolved to go again. He, taking a fancy to my converia* 
tiOB. which was not at all disagreeable at that time, and hearing bm 
■aj I had a mind to see the world, told me, that if I would go th« T*y« 
age with him, I ahould be at no expense ; I should be his mcBsmAte and 
his companion ; and if I could carry anythiag with me, I should have 
all the advantage of it tliat the trade would admit ; and, perhaps, « ' 
Boigbt meet with some encouragement. I embraced the ofer, aad 
•Btering into a strict friendship with this captain, who was an honert 
and plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and carried a 
BEaaJl adventure with me ; which, by the disinterested honesty of my 
Iriond the captain, I increased very considerably ; for I carried aboul 
forty pounds of such toys and trifles as the captain directed me te 
ftuy. This forty pounds I had mastered together by the assistance 
of vome of my relations whom I corresponded with ; and who, I 
believe, got my father, or, at least my mother, to contribute so moeb 
u that to my first adventure. This was the only voyage which I may 
nay was successful in all my adventures, and which I owe to Mm i>> 
tof riky and honesty of my friend the captain ; under whom I also got

ftad, in short, to understand some things that were needful to be m* 
ierstood by a sailor : for, as he took delight to instruct me, I took 
Aelif ht to learn ; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a tailor 
tiaA a merchant. For I brought home five pounds tone oonoea of 
gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my 
return, almost three hundred pounds, and this filled me with fboee 
■epiriag thoughts which have since so completed my ruin. Tet evea

BOBINSON CRUSOK. "" 87 

Bobiuson's Captivity at Sallee— £acap9 witb Xurjr— Arrival at tbe Brasilai* 

WAS now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my friend, to my 
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go 
the eamo voyage again ; and I embarked in the eame vessel 
^^l?x with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now 
got tiie command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage that 
ever man made ; for though I did not carry quite a hundred pounds 
of my new-gain 3d wealth, so that I had two hundi-ed pounds left, and 
which I lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet 
I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage : and the first was this, 
viz. ; our ship, making her course toward the Canary Islands, or 
rather between those islands and the African shore, was surprised, in 
(he gray of the morning, by a Turkish rover, of Sallee, who gave chasa 
to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much 
canvas as our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to get olear; 
but finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come \xt^ 
with u8 in a few hours, we prepared to fight, our ship having twelve 
guns and the rover eighteen. Abor.t three in the afternoon ho cam* 
up with us ; and bringing to, by mistake, juet athwart our quarter, in. 
stead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of cup 
guns to bear on tliat side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which 
made him sheer ofi" again, after returning oar f5re, and pouring in also 
his small shot from near two hundred men which he had on board. 
However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He 
prepared to attack us again, and we to defend oi^sselves ; but laying 
OS on board the next time upon our quarter, he ec ^3red sixty men upoa 
our decks, who immediately fell to cutting and slacking the sails and 
rigging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder-cheats, 
and such like, and cleared our dock of them twice. However, to cut 
short this melancholy part of our story, our ship being disabled, and 
ttiree of our men killed and eight woimded, we were obliged to yield, 
and were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the 
Moore. 

The usage I had there "was not so dreadful as at first i spprehen^iii 
nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the r«»S 
«!f our men were, but was kept by the captain of the rors? as his proper

SS ADVEJrtOBES OF 

neas. At thia surprising change of my circmnetancea, irom a merchant 
to a miserable ulave, I wiis portectly overwhehneJ ; and now looked 
back upon uiy tiither'a prophetic discourBC to luc, that I should be 
toiserablo, and have none to relieve mo ; -which I thought was now so 
effeotualJv brought to pass, that it could not be Avorse ; that now the 
hand of Ileavon had overtaken me, and I was undone, without redemp- 
tion. But, alas ! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, 
u wij appear in the sequel of this story. - - .^ 

As my new patron, or master, had taken me homo to his house, bo I 
tras in hopes he would take me with him when he went to tea again, 
believing that it would, some time or other, be his fate to be taken by 
a Spanish or Portuguese man-of-war, and that then I should be set at 
liberty. But this hope of mine was soon taken away, for when h« 
■went to sea, ho left me on shore to look after his little garden, and do 
the eommon drudgery of slaves about his house ; and when he came 
home again from his cruise, he ordered me to he in the cabin, to look 
after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might 
take to effect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it. 
Nothing presented to make the supposition of it rational ; for 1 had 
nobody to coumiunicato it to that would embark with me ; no fellow- 
slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman, there but myself; so 
that for two years, though I often pleased myself vrith the imagina- 
tion, yet I never had the least encouraging prospect of putting it in 
practice. 

After about two years, an odd circmnatance presented itself, whidi 
put the old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in 
my head. My patron lying ut home longer than usual, without fitting 
out his ship, which, as I heard, was for want of money, he used con- 
stantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather wa« 
feir, to take the ship's pinnacle, and go out into the road a fishing:^ 
and as he always took m» and a young Moresco with him to row the 
boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catch- 
ing fish, insomuch that sometmies ho would send me with a Moor, ene 
of his kinsmen, and the youth, the Moresco, as they called him, to oatch 
a dirth of fish for him. 

It happened one time, t^iat going a fishing in a stark calm morning, 
a fog rose so thick, that though wo Avero not half a league from the 
shore, we lost sight cf it ; and rowing, we knew not whither, or which 
way, we labored all day, and all the next night, and when the mom- 
iftg oame, we found we had oulled 00* to sea, instead of pulling in for 



J 



fh« BKeure, aod that we vrere at leaet two leagues frem tne Bh&r« : how« 
ever, we got well in again, though with a great deal of labor, and 
some danger, fbr the wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; 
but particularly we were all very hungry. 

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care 
of himself for the future ; and having lying by him the longboat of our 
English ship he had taken, ho resolved he would not go a fishing any 
more without a compass and some provision ; so he ordered the car- 
penter of the ship, who was an English slave, to build a little etato- 
room or cabin in the middle of the longboat, like that of a barge, witf 
a place to stand behind it, to steer and haul home the main sheet, anc 
room before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails. She sailed 
with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail, and the boom jibbed over 
the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room 
for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some 
small lookers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to 
drink, and particularly his bread, rice, and cofFee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a fishing, and as I was most 
dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It hap- 
pened that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure 
or for fish, with two or three Moors of some distinction in that place, 
and for whom he had provided extraordinarily, and had therefore sent 
on board the boat, ovei'night, a larger store of provisions than ordinaiy, 
and had ordered me to get ready three fusees, with powder and shot, 
which were on board his shit), for that they designed some sport of 
Cowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready as ho direct^^d, and waited the next morning 
with the boat washed clean, her ensign and pendants out, and every- 
thing to accommodate his guests : when, by-and-by, my patron eame 
on board alone, and told me his guests had put ofi" going, upon soma 
business that fell out, and ordered me with a man and boy, as usual, 
to go out with the boat, and catch them some fish, for that his frienda 
were to sup at his house ; and commanded, that as soon as I had got 
some fish, I should bring it home to his Louse : all which I prepared 
to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my 
thoughts, for now I foimd I was like to have a little ship at my com- 
mand ; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not 
for a fishing business, but for a voyage ; though I knew not, neither did 
I so mock as consider, whither I should steer ; fbr ai^jwhere, to get 
int of that place, was my wa^ 



i 

My flnt eoQtrfviSM «rM to make a pretenoe to apetic to Uiis Moos 
to f «t something for our subsistence on board ; for I told mm we mnfr 
act presume to eat of our patron's broad : he said that was true ; so I 
brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit, of their kind, and throe ja;i 
with fresh water, into the boat. I knew where my patron's case o< 
bottles stood, whioh it was evident, b^ tlie make, were taken out A 
BOaao English prize, and I conveyed thorn into the boat while the Moot 
VM OQ shore, as if they had been there bofore for our master. I cob" 
Teyed also a great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed aboul 
half a hundi-ed weight, with a parcel of twino or thread, a hatchet, • 
•aw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us afterward, eg. 
pecially the wax, to make candles. Another trick I tried upon hin, 
fhioh he innocently came into also ; his name was Ishmael, whom 
they call Muley, or Moley : so I called to him ; " Moley," said I, " oui 
patron's guns are on board the boat, can you get a little powder and 
shot ! it may be we may kill some alcamies (fowls like our curlew^ 
for ourselves, for I know ho keeps the gunner's stores in the ship " 
" Tes," says he, " I will bring some ;" and accordingly he brought a 
great leather pouch, which hold about a pound and a half of powder 
or rather more, and another of snot, that had five or six pounds, with 
tome bullets, and put all into the boat : at the same time I found soma 
powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of 
the large bottles in the case, whioh was almost empty, pouring wha* 
was in it into wiothor ; and thus furnished with everything needful, wf 
sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of 
the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us ; and we wew 
not above a mile out of the port, before we hauled in our sail, and sef 
OS down to fish. The wind blew from N. N. E., which was contrary to 
Biy desire ; for had it blown southerly, I had been sure to have mad< 
the ooast of Spain, and at last reached the bay of Oadiz : but my reso 
lotions were, blow which way it would, I would be goi* from the hoi^ 
rid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate. 

After we had fished some time and catchod nothing, for when I had 
idi on my hook I would not pull thorn up^ that ho might not see them, 
I said to the Moor, "This will not do, our master will not be thtu 
aerred — we must stand farther off." He, thinking no harm, agreed 
and being at the hec-^ of the boat, set the sails ; and as I hod the 
helm, I ran the boat near a league farther, and then brought to as if I 
would fish. Then jn^^ng the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where 
the Moor was, and ook him by aur^irise, with my arm under hk 
waiat, and toaaed hi^i <^ear ov<3rboard into the aaa He rose bnmeA

Atoly, for m tvnn like a oork, and called to me. b«sg«4 k> b« telw 
la, aitd told me be woiild go al! the world o?er 'vrich me. He iwui 
io etrong after the boat, that he would have reached me yer^ 
q«iokIj, there bomg but little wind ; upon which I stepped mto the 
cabin and fetched one of the fowling pieces ; I presented it at him, and 
told him I bad done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet, I woolfl 
do him none. " But," said I, " you swim well enough to reaoh th« 
■bore, and the sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore, and ) 
will do you no harm ; but if you come near the boat, I will shoot yo« 
trough the head ; for I am reaolved to have my liberty." So he 
^brned himself about, and swam for the shore ; and I make no doab* 
lut be reached it with ease, for he was an excellent swimmer. 

I oould have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and 
have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. Wb« 
he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom thoy called Xury, and said to 
him, " Xury, if you vnll be faithful to me I will make you a great 
man ^ but if you will not stroke your face to be true to me" (that i«i 
swear by Mahomet and his father^a beard),"! must throw you into the 
sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I 
could not mistrust him ; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all 
over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out di< 
rectly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to wind wad*d, that they might 
think me gone toward the strait's mouth (as, indeed, any one, that bad 
Been in their wits, must have been supposed to do) ; for who would have 
iupposed we were sailing on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian 
coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure tc surround u.j with 
their canoes, and destroy us ; where we oould never once go on shore 
bat we should be devoured ^y savage beafita, or more merciless sava- 
ges of human kind 7 

Bat as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my ooniM^ 
Mftd steered directly south and by east, bending my course a little to« 
WKcd the east, that I might keep in with the shore ; and having a fail 
freeh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made such sail that, I 
believe by the next day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, whea I 
made the land, J oould not be less than one hundred and fifty milei 
Bouth of Sal'>, quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, et 
indeed, of any other king thereabout, for we saw no people. 

Yet such was the fright I bad taken at the Moors, and the dreadftti 
•fprebeosions I bad of falliog into their hands, tha^ I would vai rtep,

had sailed n I^Ht manner five days ; and t}i«ii the wkd shifmg to t^ 
wuthward, I concluded also that if any af our vessels were in ohaM 
of mo, thoy uIhu would now ^ye over ; bo I veotrired to make the 
eoaxt luul came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river ; 1 kneit 
Slot wliat or ivhero, neither what latitude, what oouatrj, what natioa, 
9r wh-<t river. I neither saw nor desired to see any people; the pria 
sipal thing I wtuited was fresh water. We came into this oroek ia 
iio evciiiii<{, revolving to twim on shore ajs soon as it was dark, and 
iiscuver tlie country ; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard saofa 
IrMidlul noises of the barking, roaring and howling of wild creaturea, 
}f we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with 
fear, and l>og>!;ed of rae not to go on shore till day. " Well, Xury," 
3ai<l I, " ibeu 1 will not ; but it may be, we may see men by day, wh« 
will he as had to uh as thoise lions." " Then we may give them the 
*hooi-gun." says Xury, laughing; "make them run away." Such 
EughKlj Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. However, I waa 
glad u> see the boy so cheerOil, and 1 gave him a dram out of our 
matron's case of bottles to cheer him up After all Xary's advice was 
jTood and I took it. We dropped our little anunor, and lay still all 
aig*>t. 1 Hay *iiill, for we slept noRa, for in two or three hours we 
saw vast creatures (we knew not what to oall them), of many sorts, 
Dome aown to the sea-shore, and run into the water, wallowing ^d 
washing tliemsclves, for the pleasure of eooling themselves ; and they 
oaado such hideous bowlings and yelliugs, that I never, indeed, heard 
'he like. 

Xury was draadfully frightened, and, iv '.eed, so was I too; but w« 
were both more frightened when we heard one of these mighty orea- 
^ires ^wiauuing toward our boat; we could not see him, but we 
night hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous, huge, and furious 
)eabt. Xury sjiid it was a lion, and it might be so for aught I know, 
i)ut poor Xury cried to rae to weigh the anchor and row away. "No," 
»y8 1, " Xury, we can slip our cable with a buoy to it, and go oflFi* 
tea ; they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner said so but I per 
srived the creature, whatever it was, within two oars' length, which 
soraothing surprised me ; however, I immediately ste} ped to the oabia 
4oor, and taking up my gun, fired at him ; upon which he immedi- 
at«ly turned about, and swam to the shore again. 

But it was impossible to deaoribe the horrible noise* and hi4e<MM 
ories and howlmgn ihat were raiMMl, a^ well upon the edge of th« 
Ihore as hif^^her within the coimtry, upon the noise or report of th« 
ffim; a tiling, 1 believe, those creatures had never heard b^fbr*. TMff

Mnnnoed me mere was no going on shore for us in the night upoa 
that coast; and how to venture on s'lore in the day, was auother 
question too; for to have fallen into tlie hauda of any <jf the savages, 
had been as bad as to have fallen into the paws of lions and tigers ; 
at least we were equally apprehensivn of the danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go ou shore somewhere or 
other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat ; when and 
where to get it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on 
shore with one of the jars, he would find if there was any water, and 
bring some to me. I asked him why he would go: why I should not 
go, and he stay in the boat ? The boy answered with so much affec- 
tion that he made me love him ever after. Says be, "If wild mans 
come they cat me, you go away." " Well, Xury," said I, " we will 
both go, and if the wild mans come we will kill them ; they shall eat 
neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a 
dram out of our patron's case of bottles, which I mentioned before, 
and we hauled in tae boat as near the shore as we thought proper, 
and so waded to shore, carrying nothing but Hir arms and two jars 
for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the Doat, fearing the coming of 
oanoes with savages down the river, but Jie boy, seeing a low place 
about a mile up the country, rambled to it, and by-and-l>y I saw him 
come running toward me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, 
or frightened by some wild beast, and I therefore ran forward to belp 
him, but when I came nearer to him I eaw something banging over 
his shoulders, which was a creature that he had sbot, like a hare, but 
different in color, and longer legs ; however, we were very glad of it, 
and it was very good meat. But the great joy that poor Xury came 
with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no v\ild nians. 
But we found, afterward, that we need not take such pains for water, 
for a little higher up the creek where we were, wo found the water 
fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up ; so we 
filled our jars, and having a fire, feasted on the hare we had killed, 
and prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any hu- 
man creature in that part of the country. 

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, 1 know very well 
that the islands of the Canaries, and t!ie Capo do Verd islands also, 
lay not far from the coast ; but as T had no iustrnments to take an 
observation, to find what latitude we Avere in, and did not exactly 
know, or at least remember what latitude they were in, I knew not 
wher« to look for them, or when to stand off to sea toward them, 



44 AI)^^ENTUKES OF 

©tberwis* I might now hare easily found eome of theee islands ; but 
tixy hope was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to the part 
vrhere the English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon ' 
their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, the place where I now was, must be 
that country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's domin- 
ions and the Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild 
beasts, the Negroes having abandoned it and gone fixrther south, for 
fear of the Moors, and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by 
reason of its barrenness ; and, indeed, both forsaking it because of th* 
prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious crea- 
tures which harbor there, so that the Moors use it for their hunting 
only — where they go like an army, two or three thousand men at a 
time — and, indeed, for near a hundred miles together upon this coast, 
we saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited country, by day, and beard 
nothing but bowlings and roaring of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice, in the daytime, I thought I saw the Pico of Tene- 
riffe, being the top of the mountain Teneriffe, in the Canaries, and 
bad a great mind to venture out, in hope of reaching thither, but hav- 
ing tried twice, I was forced in agam by contrary winds, the sea also 
going too high for my little vessel, so I resolvwi to pursue my first 
design, and keep along the shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had 
left this place, and once in particular, being early in the morning, we 
came to an anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty hijiih, 
and the tide beginning to flow we lay still, to go farther in. Xury, 
whose eyes were moi'e about him than it seema mine were, calls softly 
lo me, and tells me that we had best go further ofiF the shore ; '^ for, 
says he, " look ! yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that 
hillock, fast asleep." I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful 
Bionster, indeed, for it was a terrible great liou, that lay on the side 
&f the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill, that hung, as it 
were, over him. 

" Xury," says I, " you shall go on shore and kill him."' Xury looked 
frightened, and said, "Me kill ! he eat me at one meuth ;" one mouth- 
dul, he meant. However, I said no more to the noy, but bade him be 
still, and I took our biggest gun, which was almost musket bore, and 
ioaded it with a good charge of powder and with two slugs, and laid 
it down ; then I loaded another gun with two bullets, and a third, for 
•9f h4d thres pidoss, I loaded with five smaller bullets, I took the 
Usi e&m I could with the first plsa^ to have skoir htm hi the head,

hit lie Ifty IH>, ^th his leg raised a little above his noes, that ilia 
slugs hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone ; he started x\]\ 
growling at first, but finding his leg broke fell down again, and the .< 
got up on three legs and gave the most hideous roar that ever I hco-r.^ 
I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the head ; however, 
I took up the second piece immediately, and though he began to mov« 
tft, fired again and shot him in the head, and had the pleasure to 8e« 
him drop and make but little noise, but lie struggling for life. Thea 
Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore. " Well, 
go," said I. So the boy jumped inte the water, and taking a littU 
gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming 
close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot 
him in the head again, which despatched him quite. 

This was game, indeed, to us, but it was no food, and I was very 
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature thak 
was good for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have Bom« 
of him, so he comes on board and asked me to give him the hatchet. 
« For what, Xury ?" said I. " Me cut ofi" his head," said he. How. 
?ver, Xury could not cut ofi" his head, but he cut off a foot and brought 
Jt with him, and it was a monstrous great one. I bethought myself 
however, that perhaps the skin of him might, one way or other, be of 
eome value to us, and I resolved to take off his skin, if I could. So 
Xury and I went to work with him, but Xury was much the better 
worknmn at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us 
both up the whole day ; but at last we got off the hide of him, and 
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it i» 
two days' time, and it afterward served me to lie upon. 

After this stop we made on to the southward continually, for ten Of 
twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to 
abate very much, and going no oftener in to the shore than we war* 
obliged to for fresh water. My design in this was to make the riv» 
Gambia, or Senegal ; that is to say, any where about the Cape da 
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; an j 
if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for the 
islands or perish among the Negroes. I knew that all the ships from 
Europe, which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazi\ or to 
the East Indies, mad© this cape or those islands ; and, in a word, I 
put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, eithw that I UMBrt 
meet with eem© ship of must perish,

throe piactMj, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore U 
look at us ; we could also perceive they were quite black, and stark 
iiakoiJ. I was once iacliued to have gone on shore to them, but 
Xury was luy better counsellor, and said to me, " No go, no go." 

However, I hauled iu nearer the shore, that I might talk to thera, 
and I found they ran along the shore by me a good way. I observed 
they liad no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a long 
slemler stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they would 
Vhrow them a great way with good aim ; so I kept at a distance, but 
talke<l to them by signs, as well as I could, and particularly made 
signs for something to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my boat^ 
and they would fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top 
of my sail and lay by, and two of them ran up into the country, and 
in less than half an hor.t came back, and brought with them twa 
pieces of dry flesh and some corn, such as the produce of their coun 
try, but we neither knew what the one or the other was; however, 
we were willing to accept it. But how to come at it wat our next 
dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and they were 
as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for they 
brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great 
way ofl" till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make then* 
amends ; but an opportunity offered that very instant to otligo them 
wonderfully ; for while Ave were lying by the shore, came two nughty 
creatures, one pursuhig the other (as wo took it) with g,re'j,c fury, from 
the mountains toward the sea ; whether it was tho msile pursuing thf 
female, or whether they were in sport or in ra.g&, wo could not tell 
any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange; but f 
believe it was the latter, because, in tho first place, those ravenou* 
creatures seldmn appear but in the night, and ia the second place, wti 
fonnd the people terribly frightened, especially the women. The ma» 
that had tho lance, or dart, did not fly from them, but the rest did ,' 
however, as the two creamrcs ran directly into the water, they dij 
not seem to offer to fall upon any of the Negrops, Tiut plunged them- 
•olves into the sea, and swain about, a« if they had come for their di- 
version. At last, one (f them 1 ep\n to come nenrrr our boat than I at 
first exported : Imt I lay ready for him, for I loaded my gun with all 
possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon ait 
ho came fairly within my rench. I fired, and shot him directly in th« 
head ; immediatply he sunk down into the water, but rose instantly 
uad pluu;!:«4 up and down, a» if b* was struggUnji; for li&, and ■« iadMd

be wu. He immediately made to the shore -, but between the wound, 
whioh was his mortal hurt, and the gtraugling of the water, lie dio'j 
just before he reached the eboro. 

It is impossible to expresa the AstOQiebment of these poor creatures, 
at the noise and fire of my gun ; some of them were even ready to die 
tor' fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when they 
«aw the creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made sigub to 
them to come to the shore, they took heart and camo to iho elioi c, imd 
tegan to search for the creature. I found him by his blood staiuiug 
ihe water; and by the help of a rope, which I slung round him aud 
gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that 
it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an admirable de- 
gree ; and the Negroes held up their hands with admiration, to thmk 
what it was I had killed him with. 

The other creature, frightened with the flash of fire and the noise of 
the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from 
whence they came ; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. 
I found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, 
so I was willing to have them take it as a favor from me ; which, when 
I made signs to them that they might take bim, they were very thank- 
ful for. Immediately they fell to work with him; and though tlicy 
had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they took ofi" his skin 
as readily, and much more readily, than we could have done with a 
knife. They offered me some of the fleeh, which I declined, making as 
if I would give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they gave 
me very freely, and brought mo a great deal more of their provisions, 
which, though I did not understand, yet I accepted. I then made t-igns 
to them for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning 
it bottom upward, to show that it was empty and that I AA-anted to 
have it filled. They called immediately to some of their friends, and 
there came two women and brought a great vessel made of earth, and 
burnt, as I suppose, in the sun ; this they set down to me, us before, and 
I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The avo- 
men were as stark naked as the men. 

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water ; 
and leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days 
more, without offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out 
a great lenp:th into the sea, at the distance of four or five leagues before 
me ; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large oflBng, to make this 
point. At length, doubling the point, at about two league^ from the 
land, I saw plaisly Igad on the other side, to seatrard ; then I coixcludt

thorn the islands called from thence, Cape de Verd Islands.- However, 
they were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best 
to do ; for if I should be taken with a gale of vnnA, I might neither 
reach one nor the other. 

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin and 
sat me down, Xury having the helm ; when on a sudden the boy cried 
out, " Master ! master ! a ship with a sail ! " and the foolish boy wa« 
frightened out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his mas- 
ter's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far enougli 
out of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, 
not only the ship, but what she was, viz., that it was a Portuguese ship, 
and, as I thought, was bound for the coast of Guinea, for Negroes. But 
when I observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced they were 
boimd some other "way, and did not design to come any nearer to the 
•hore ; upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving 
to speak with them, if possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be al)le to coi le 
hi their way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any 
■ignal to them ; but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began t« 
despair, they, it seems, saw me, by the help of their perspective glaflsen^ 
and that it was some European boat, which, they supposed, must belong 
to some ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up 
I was encouraged with this, and as I had my patron's ensign on board, 
I made a waft of it to them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, 
both which they saw ; for they told me they saw the smoke, though 
they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals, they very kindly brought 
to, and lay by for me; and in about three hours' time I came up with 
them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in 
French, bxit I undei-stood none of them; but at last, a Scotch sailor who 
was on board called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was an 
Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors 
at Bailee. They then bade me come on board, and very kindly took m« 
in, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that 
I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and al- 
most hopeless condition as I was in ; and I immediately offered all I 
b»4 to ttifi <»ptarn oF the ship, as a return for my deliverance ; but he

S he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in thf 
performance, to a tittle : for he ordered the seamen, that 
none should offer to touch anything I had : then he took 
everything into his own possession, and gave me back an 
ezact inventory of them, that I might have them, evea so much m 
■my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one ; and that he saw, and told 
me he would buy it of me for the ship's use ; and aaked me what I 
would have for it ? I told him, he had been so generous to me in 
everything, that I could not offer to make any price of the boat, but 
left it entirely to him : upon which, he told me he would give me a 
note of hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil ; and 
*irhen it came there, if aay one offered to give more, he would 
naake it up. He offered me also sixty pieces of eight more for my 
boy Xury, which I was loath to take ; not that I was not willing to 
let the captain have him, but I was very loath to sell the poor boy'a 
Liberty, who had assisted me eo faithfully in procuring my own. 
However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to bo just, 
and offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obliga- 
tion to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian ; upon this, 
and Xury saying he was willing to go with him, I let the oaptaia 
have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in the Bay 
de Todos los Santos, or All Saint's Bay, in about twenty-two day« 
after. And now I was <race more ielivered from the most mis^abl* 
of all conditions of IW^ 5 and whe^t to do aest witU jg^gfilfc I wai now

The gaietons treatment the oaptain gave m9, 1 ean nerex enoiigli 
remember: ho would take nothing of me for mj passage, gave m4 
twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's akin, which 

1 had in my boat, and caused exerything I had in the ship to bepancta« 
ally delivered to me; and what I was willing to sell h« bought of mej 
suoh as the case of bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump o< 
beeswax — for I had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made about 
two hundred and twenty pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with thifl 
stock I went on shore in the Brazils. 

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the house ol 
a good honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio, as they call it 
(that is, a plantation and a sugar^house). I lived with him some time, 
and acquainted myself, by that means, with the manner of planting 
and of making sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how 
they got rich suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a license to settla 
there, I would turn planter among them; endeavoring in the mean* 
time, to find out some way to get my money, which I had left in Lon* 
don, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind of letter of natn* 
ralization, I purchased as much land that was uncured as my money 
would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement; such 
a one as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to 
receive from England. 

I had a neighbor, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but born of English 
parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as 
1 was. I call him my neighbor, because his plantation lay next to 
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock was but 
low, as well as his; and we rather planted for food than anything 
else, for about two years. However, we began to increase, and our 
land began to come in order; so that the third year we planted some 
tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for 
planting canes in the year to come; but we both wanted help; and 
DOW I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my 
boy Xury. 

But, alas ! for mo to do wrong, that never did right, was no great 
wonder. I had no remedy, but to go on; I had got into an employ- 
ment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I 
delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's house, and broke 
through all his good advice. Nay, I was coming into the very mid- 
dle station or upper degree of low life, which my father advised ma 
to before' and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might as well 
hare stajed at hom^ amd never have fatigued myself in the world, a« 



1 tad done: and I often used to say %o myself, 1 cotud hsiv^ <3i&e tbia 
M well in England among my friends, as to have gone Ave thoiisand 
miles off to do it am* ng strangers and savages in a -wilderness, and &! 
Buch a diBtanc3 as never to hoar from any part of the world that ha^ 
the least knowledge of me. 

In this manner I used to look npon my condition with the ntmost 
regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neigh- 
bor; no work to be done but by the labor of my hands; and I used 
to Bay, I lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, 
that had nobody there but himself. But how just has it been ! and 
how should all men reflect, that when they compare their present 
eoaditions witi others that are worse, Hearen may oblige them to 
Baaka the exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity by their 
experience. I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary life 
I reflected on, in an island of mere desolation, should be my lot, who 
bad BO often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in 
which, had I continued, I had, in all probability, been exceedingly 
prosperous and rich ! 

Ivas, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the 
plantation, before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took 
me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained there, in providing 
his lading, and preparing for his voyage, near three months; when 
telling him what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave 
me this friendly and sincer*) advice: **Senhor Ingles," says he (.for 
BO he always called me), "if you will give me letters, and a procura- 
tion here in form to me, with orders to the person who has your 
^ money in London, to send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as 
I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper for this country, I 
will bring you the produce of them, God wilUng, at my return; but 
since human affairs are all subject to changes and disasters, I would 
have you give orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which yon 
say is balf your etock, and. let the hazard be run for the first, so that 
if it come safe, you may order tbe rest the same way; and, if it mis- 
carry, you may have the other half to h- ve recourse to for your sup- 
ply." This was bo wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that 
I could not but be convinced that it was the best course I could take; 
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I 
left my money, ani a procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he de* 
sired me. 

I wrote the English captain s widow • full account of all my ad' 
Tenturesr my slaverj escape, and how I hAd met with the FortOK 



^ose esptain at seu, ths httmaxiity of his behavior, and what coadi* i 
Soa I was no-w in, with all other neocssary directions for my supply; 
*ad whoa this honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by/ 
some of the English merchants there, to send over, not the order only 
but a full account of my etory to a merchant at London, who represented 
it effectually to her; whereupon she not only delivered the money, bull 
out of her own pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a very handsome 
present for his humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in English 
goods, such as the captain had wrote for, sent thasa directly to him ai 
Lisbon, and he brought them all safely to me a-: the Brazils; among 
which, without my direction (for I was too young in tc}' business to 
think of them), he had taken care to have aH sorts of tools, iron 
work and utensils necessary for my plantation, and which were of 
great use to me. When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune was 
made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my good steward, tb.o 
oaptain, had laid out the five pounds which my friend had sent him 
as a present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servimt, 
undez bond for six years' service, and wotild not accept of any con- 
sideration except a little tobacco, which I would have him accept, 
being of my own produce. Neither was this all; but my goods being 
all English manufactures — such as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things par« 
ticularly valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell 
them to a very great advantage; so that I might say I had more than 
four times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely beyond 
my poor neighbor, I mean in the advancement of my plantation; for 
the first thing I did I bought me a negro slave, and a European ser- 
vant also; I mean another besides that which the captain brought m© 
from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity i£ oftentimes made the very means of our 
adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with great 
success in my plajitation; I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on my 
own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among 
my neighbors, and these fifty rolls, being each of above one hun^ 
dred p ounds weight, were well cured and laid by against the retura 
at the fleet from Lisbon; and now, increasing in business and in 
wealth, my head began to be full of projects and undertakings be- 
yond my reach, such as are, indeed, often the ruin of the best heads 
in busin ese. Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room 
fox all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my father 
00 ««mostly rooommended a ^uiet, retired life« and whidi he kad m

Mnstbly deseribed the middle station of lifo to b» fall of ; but othtf 
thiagg attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent of all my 
wa miseries ; and, partionlarly, to increase my fault, and double tho 
r^ections upon myself, vrhich in my future sorrows I should bar© 
leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent 
obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering about, and 
pursuing that inclination in contradiction to the clearest Tiews «f 
doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and 
those measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to pre- 
sent me with, and to make my duty. 

As I had once done thus in breaking atray from my parents, so I 
could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had 
of being a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue 
a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the 
thing admitted ; and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest 
gulf of human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be con- 
sistent with life, and a state of health in the world. 

To come then, by just degrees, io the particulars of this part of my 
sstory. You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in 
viae Braizils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my 
plantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted ai^ 
acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planterB, as well as 
among the merchants of 8t. Salvador, which was our port ; and that, ia 
my discourses among them, I had frequently given them an aooount of 
my twc* voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the 
negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase on the coast for trifles— - 
such as beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the 
like— not only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephant's teeth, eto., but 
negroes, for the service of the Braails, in great numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these 
heads, but especially to that part which related to the buying negroes 
which was a trade at that time not only not far entered into, but, as fer 
&s it was, had been carried on by the assientos, or permission of the 
, kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed from the public ; so that 
few negroes were bought, and those excessively dear. 

It happened, being in company with some merchants and plaatess 
of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, thre« 
of them came to me the next morning, and told me they had been 
aansing very much upon what I had discoursed with them of the last 
night and they came to make a socrot proposal to me ; and, after 
«BJoinlpg sie to secrecy, they, told me that they had a mind to fit out 



M MwmrrunEs oif 

a kliip to go to Guinea ; that they bad all planiatlcms a^ wdl as I, 6&4 
■were straiten od for nothing so mucli as Benrants ; that it ■vras a traca 
that could not be carried on, because they could not publicly sell tl:e 
negroes -when they came home, so they desired to make but one 
voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them 
among their own plantations ; and, in a word, the question \rn<i 
whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trad- 
ing part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should 
have an equal share of the negroes, without providing any part of the 
stock. 

This vras a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to 
any one that had not a settlement and plantation of his own to look 
after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and 
with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was thuA entered and 
established, and had nothing to do but to go on as I begun for throe or 
four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from 
England ; and who, in that time and with that little addition, coulJ 
Bcaroe have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds ster* 
ling, and that increasing too ; for me to think of such a vayags was the 
most preposterous thing that ever man, in such oircamstances, could 
ba guilty of. 

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist 
the offer, than I could restrain my first rambling designs, when my 
father's good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told theia I 
would go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look after my 
plantation in my absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should 
direct if I miscarried. This they all e gaged to do, and entered 
^ into writings or covenants to do so ; and I made a formal will, dispose 
ing of my plantations and effects in case of my death; making the cap- 
tain of the ship that saved my life, as before, m / universal heir, bu^ 
obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had direct^id in my will ; one 
half of the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to 
England. In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects 
and to keep up my plantation ; had I used half as much prudence to 
have looked into my own interest, and have made a judgment of what 
I ought to have done, ai d not to have done, I had certainly never gene 
away from so prosperous an undertaking, leaving all the probable 
tIswb of a thriving circumstance, and gone a voyage to sea, attended 
with all its common hazards, to cay nothing of the reasons I had to ex« 
pc«t particular misfortunes to myself.

father than my reason; and, acoordingly, the ship being fitted out, and 
the eargo furnished, and all things done as by agreement by my part- 
Tiers in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour again, the first of 
September, 1659, being the stime day eight years that I vrent from my 
parents at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority and the fool 
to my own interest. 

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried 
six guns and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy and myself ; 
we had on board no large cargo of goods except of such toys as were 
fit for our trade with the negroes, such as bead*, bits of glass, shcUs, 
and odd trifles, especially looking glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, 
and the like. 

The very same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to 
the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for 
the African coast. When they came about ten or twelve degrees ©f 
northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of their course la 
those days, we had very good weather, only eicessively hot all the way 
upon our own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino; 
from whence, keeping farther off ^t sea, we lost sight of land, and 
steejed as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha, holding 
our coast N. E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. In thii 
course we passed the Line in about twelve days' time, and were, by our 
last observation, in seven degrees twenty two minutes northern lati- 
tude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us qnite out of our 
knowledge ; it began from the southeast, came about to the northwest, 
and then settled in the northeast ; from whence it blew in such a ter- 
rible manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing but 
drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whithersoever fate 
and the fury of the winds directed ; and during these twelve days, I 
need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed up, nor, indeed, 
did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our 
men died of the calenture, and one man and a boy washed overboard. 
About the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made an 
observation as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven 
degrees north latitude, but that he was twenty -two degrees of longitude 
difference west from Cape St. Augustino ; so that he found he was got 
upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river 
Amazon, toward that of the river Oronoco, commonly called the Great 
liiver ; and began to consult with me what course he should take, toi 
the ship was leaky and very much disabled, and hd was for going di« 
Tsctlj back to the coast of Brazil.

I WM pLOdltiTi'^y against itat^ taxSt lookmg over 
aeacoasts of Amexica with him, we concluded there ■wm ■•Mbliblled 
oountrj for tis to have recourse to, till we came wiihia tb* eb«}« of 
the Caxribee i8.Uvnds, and therefore resolved to stand aw»y for Barba- 
does ; which, by keeping oflf to sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay or 
gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen 
days' sail, whereas we oould not possibly make our voyage to the 
<aoast of Mticq, without some assistance, both to our ship aad our* 
Selves, 

With ttds design, we changed our course, and steered away N. W. 
fey W. in order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped 
for relief ; but our voyage was otherwise determined ; for being in the 
.atitude of twelve degrees, eighteen minutes, a second storm came 
upon us, which carried us away with the same impetuosity westward, 
iiuxd drove ns so out of the very way of all human commerce, that 
had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather in danfjej 
of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our own ooun' 
t»y. 

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men, 
early in the morning, cried out, "Land ! " and we had no sooner run 
out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the 
world we were, than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, 
he* motion being so stoppeC, the sea broke over her in such a mannei; 
that we expected we should all have perished immediately ; and we 
were immediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us from the 
very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for anyone who has not been in the like condition to 
describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances ; 
we knew nothing where we were, or upon what laud it was we were 
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not in- 
habited ; and as the rage of the wind was still great, chough rather less 
than at first, we oould not so much as hope to have the ship hold many 
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind, by a kind of 
miracle, should immediately turn about. In a word, wo sat looking 
upon one another, and expecting death every moment, and every man 
acting accordingly, as preparing for another world ; for there was little 
or nothing more for us to do in this ; that which was our present 
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that, contrary to our ei« 
jpeetation, the ship did not break yet, and that the master said th« 
Wi&d began to abate. 

Now. fhoush we tliotteht (h«t ^^ ifvl&d ffid a little f^Me^ 7^ ^f

cspect her getting oS, tre were in a dTsadfol eondltlon indeefl, ns-d. t>a& 
motMng to do but to think of ga-ving our lives as well aa w© could. Wa 
had a boat at our stem just before the etorza, but she waa first staved 
by dashing against the ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke 
away, axid either sunk, or was driven off to sea ; so there waa no hopo 
from her. We had another boat on board, but how to get her off intc 
the sea waa a doubtful thing; however, there waa no room to debate, 
for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some 
told us she was actually broken already. 

In this distress, the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and 
with the help of the rest of the men, they got her flung over the ship's 
side ; and getting all into her, we let her go, and committed ourselves, 
being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild sea ; for though 
the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea went dreadfully higli 
epon the shore, and might well be called dm wild zee, as the Dutch call 
ate sea in a storm. 

And now our case was very dismal, indeed ; for we sdl saw plainly 
that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live, and that wp 
should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none ; nor, 
if we had, eould we have done anything with it ; so we worked at tha 
oar toward the land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to exe* 
cution ; for we air knew that when the boat came nearsr to the shores 
Bhe would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the breach of the sea, 
However, we committed our souls to God in the most earnest mani 
Her} and the wind driving us toward tho shore, we hastened ou» 
destruction with our own hands, pulling as well aa we could toward 
land. 

What the shore was— whether rock or sand, «jh ether steep or 
shoal — we knew not ; the only hope that could rationally give ua tha 
, lesst shadow of expectation, was, if we could happen into some bay or 
gulf, or the mcuth of some river, where by great ohance we might have 
tun oui boat in, or got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made 
smooth water. But nothing of this appeared ; and as we made nearer 
and nearer the shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea. 

After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as 
we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountainJike, came rolling astern of ua 
and plainly bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it took us with 
Buoh fury, that it overset tho boat at once, and separating us, as well 
from the l^afc as from on© another gave us not time hardly to m^

^ AYsinv&Bs or 

Nothing e»a dascribe the confusion of tbonght wUcSi I felt, -whtm 
I Bunk into the water ; for though I swam Tery well, yet I could not 
deliver myself from t'.:e waves bo us to draw my breath, till that wave 
having driven me, or rather carried mc a vast way on toward the shore, 
end having spent it-^elf, went back, and left me upon the land almost 
dry, but half dead with the water x took in. I had so much presence 
of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the main land 
than I expected, I got upon my feet, and endeavored to make on to- 
ward the land as fast as I could, before another wave should return 
uid take me up again ; but I soon found it was impossible to avoid it, 
for I saw the sea coma after m© as high as a great hill, and as furious 
B3 an enemy which I had no means or strength to contend with; 
xay business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, 
if I could, and so, by swimming, to preserve my breathing, a d pilot 
myself toward the shore, if possible — my greatest concern now being 
that the wave, as it would carry me a great way toward the shore when 
it came on, might not carry me back tigain with it when it gave back 
toward the sea. 

The wave that came upon mo again buried me at once twenty «* 
thirty feet deep iu its own body -, and I could feel myself carried with 
mighty force and swiftness toward the shore, a very great way ; but 
I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still foi-ward with all 
my might. I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as 1 
felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, 1 found my head and 
hands shoot out above the surface of the water ; and though it was not 
two seconds of time that I coTild keep myself so, yet it relieved me 
greatly — gave me breath and new courage. I was covered again with 
water a good while, tut not so \ong but I held it out ; and finding the 
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward against 
<he return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet I stood 
•till a few moments to recover breath, and till the water went from 
me, and then took to my heels, and ran with what strength I had 
farther toward the shore. But neither would this deliver me from the 
fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again, end twice more 
I was lifted up by the waves and carried forward as before, the shore 
being very flat. 

The last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me, for the 
sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed 
me against a piece of a rock, and that with such force that it left me 
Benseless, and indeed helplesss, as to my own deliverance, for the blow 
taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as it were, quite out of mt

bodj, orA. had it retnmed again immediately, I must kave beea stran- 
gled ir ^he water ; but I recovered a little before the return of the 
wav?s .>jid seeing I should again be covered with the water, I resolved 
to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and bo to hold my breath, if pos- 
Bible, till the wave we t back. Now, as the waves were not so high 
as the first, being nearer land, I held my hoi I till the wave abated and 
then fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore that 
the next wave, tLough it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up 
as to carry me away, and the next run I took I got to the mainland, 
■where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore and 
sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and qtiite out of tb« 
feach of the water. 

T was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and 
foank God that my life was saved, in a case wher jin there was, some 
aainntes before, scarcely any room to hope. I believe it la impossible 
io expr«83, to the life, what the ecstacies and transports of the soul are 
when it is so saved, as I may_ say, out of the grave ; and I did not now 
wonder at the custom, viz., that when a malefactor, who has the halter 
about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a 
reprieve brought to him, I say I do not wonder that they bring a sur- 
geon with it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, 
that the surprise my not drive the animal spirits from the heart an^ 
overwhelm him. 

" For sudden Joys, Ilka grieft, confound at first.'* 

I walked about on the shore, lifti::g up my hands, and my whole 
being, as I may say, wrapped up in the contemplation of my deliver- 
jEce, and making a thousand gestures and motions which I cannot d«»- 
scribe ; reflecting upon my comrades that were drowned, and that 
there shoald not be one soul saved but myself— for, as for them, I never 
saw them afterward, or anv sign of them, except three of their hats, on< 
-t5ap, and two shoes that were not fellows. 

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and froth ol 
&e sea being so big I could hardly see it, it lay so far ofi^ and coa- 
gidered— Lord ! how was it possible I could get on shore ? 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my con- 
dition, I began to look around me to see what kind of a place I waa 
ix, and what was next to be done, and I soon found my oomforta 
>bate, and that, in a woid, I had e dreadful deliverance ; for I waa 
wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink 
le eomfort me ; neither did I see aur prospect before ue bat that e^

wsdked about a furlong from the shore to see if I could find any fresh 
watdV to diink, which I did to my great joy ; and having drank, and 
put a little tobacco into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the

should fall asleep I might not fall, and having cut me a short stick, 
like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodgiag ; and, having

Wreck— Oonstinets his Habitation. \ 

HEN I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, aad 'i^ 
storm abated, so that the eea did not rage and swell as before; 
but that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lift- 
ed off in the night fl'om the sand where she lay, by the swel- 
bag of the tide, and wo« driven almost as far as the rock which I at 
tost mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the wave dashing me 
against it. This being within about a mile from the shore where I wa«, 
and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on boards 
tfiat at least I might save some necessary things for my use. 



$U again, aad (he first thing I foxmd wad the hasAt \firldck lay, as ih« 
irind and sea had tossed her up npon the island, about two milee oa 
flay right hand. I walked as far as I cotild upon the shore to have got 
to her, but found a neck or inlet of water feetwoen me and the boat, 
vhioh was about half a mile broad, so I came Ijack for the present, being 
laore intent upon getting at th« ship, w^«^fe I lioped to find something 
lor my present subsistence. f' 

A little after noon I found th« sea tw^ jalm, and the tide ebbed bo ' 
fitr out, that I ootdd come within a quaiter of a mile of the ship ; and 
here I found a fresh renewing of my grief, for 1 saw, evidently, that 
if we had kept on board we had been all safe ; that is to say, we had 
all got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left 
•ntirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I now was. This 
loroed tears from my eyes again, but as there waG little relief in this, 
I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so I pulled off my clothes, 
for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the water ; but whea 
I oame to the ship, my difficulty was still greatei: to know how to get 
on board, for as she lay aground and high out of *h.e water, there was 
tiothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swp>m round her twice, 
and the second time I spied a small piece of yojae, which I wondered 
I did not 660 at first, hang down by the forechains, so low as that with 
great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got into 
the forecastle of the ship. Here I found th& ship was bulged, and had 
a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a 
Wnk of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stem lay lifted up upon 
the bank, and her head low, almost to the water ; by this means all 
ker quarter was free, and all that waa in that part was dry ; for, you 
may be sure, my first work was to seajrch &m\ to see what waa spoiled 
and what was free ; and first, I found tha^ all the ship's proTisions 
were'dry and untouched by the water, ani being very well disposed 
to eat, I went to the bread-jroom and fiUed my pockets with bl-?uit, 
and ate it as I went about other tnings, for I had no time to lose, I 
also found some ru n in the great oatin, of which I took a large dram. 
Mid which I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for what was be- 
fore me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself wlt3i 
ttiany things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and "Vish for what was not to ba baa, and 
(ihla (Bxferemity roused my amplication ; we had several spare yards, 
ttd two or three large epaj"* of wood, and a spare topmast or two in 
11m «hlp ^ ^ MsolteA t<» £<*U to work with tbese, and fiung as mmf

rope, tli;it they might not drive away. When this wsr} done I vrent 
down to the ship's side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of ihem 
fest together at both ends, as -well as I conld, in the form of a raft, 
end la- ing two or three short pieces of plank upon them, crosswise, I 
found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear 
a y great weight, the j ieces being too light ; so I went to work and 
with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into three lengths, 
•ad added them to my raft, with a great deal of labor and pains. But 
the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries cncourged me to go 
beyond what I should hare been able to do on another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. 
My next oare was what to load it with and how to preserve what I 
laid upon it from the surf of the sea ; but I was not long considering 
this. I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, 
uid having considered well what I most wanted, I got three of the 
seamen's chests, which I had broken open and emptied, and lowered 
them down upon my raft ; these I filled with provisions, viz : bread, 
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh (which we 
lived much upon), and a little remainder of European com, which 
kad been laid by for some fowls which we had brought to sea with 
OB, but the fowls were killed. There had been some barley and 
wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, I found afterward 
diat the rats had eaten or spoiled it alL As for liquors, I found sev* 
•ral cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some 
5«rdial waters ; and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack. These 
J stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into the 
ftheets, nor any room for them. While I was doing this, I found the 
Mde began to flow, though very eahn ; and I had the mortification to 
i^*e my coat, shirt «md waistcoat, which I had left on shore, upon tho 
aaad, swim away ; as for my breeches, which were only linen, and 
•^en-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings. However, 
fius put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, 
Vut took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other things 
vrhich my eye was more upon ; as, first, tools to work with on shore ; 
and it was after long searching that I found the carpenter's ches^ 
which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable 
than a ship-lading of gold would have been at that time. I got it 
dewn to my raft, even whole as it was, without losing Qok* to look 
fftto It, for I knew, in general, what it contained.

t»ry g«sd fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and twFpistols } these I 

seoured first, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, an 1 t^o 
old msty swords. I knew there w- re three barrels of powder in the 
ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them ; but witu 
much search I found them, two of them dry and good, the third had 
taken water. Those two i got to my raft, with the arms. And now I 
thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should 
get to shore with them, having neither Bail, oar, nor rudder ; and^s 
least capful of wind would hare oyerset all my navigation. 

Ihad three encourAgaiQenta : 1st, A smooth calm sea; 2dly, The 
tide rising ai^d setting in to the shore ; 3dly, What little wind ther^ 
was blew me toward the land. And thus, having found two or tnree 
broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools which were 
in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer ; and with this 
cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very 
well, o^ly that I found it drive a little distant from the place where 
I had landed before ; by which I perceived that there was some in- 
draft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find some creek or 
river there, which I might make use of as a port to get to land with 
my cargo. 

As I imagined so it was ; there appeared before me a little opening 
of the land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it ; so I 
guided my raft, as well as I could, to get into the middle of the stream. 
But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I 
had. I think it would verily have broken my heart ; for, knowing noth- 
ing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and 
not being aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my 
cargo had slipped off toward that end that was afloat, and so fallen into 
the water. I did my utmost by setting my back against the chests, co 
keep them in their places, but cotild not thrust off the raft with all my 
strength ; neither durst I stir from the posture I was in, but holding 
Tip the chests with all my might, I stood in that manner near half an 
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little mora 
upon a level ; and a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated 
again, and I thrust her off, with the oar I had, into the channel, and 
then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a 
little river, with land on both sides, and a strong current or tide run- 
ning up. I looked on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for 
I was not willing to be driven too high up the river ; hoping, in time^ 
V> see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as B«ai 
Ike coast as I eould. 



'4s iStSSSfTtJlBSIS €t9 

At lengih i epied a little core on th« rJglit shore of tha oydslc, ta 
trtiieh, with great pain and diffiouJty, I guided my raft, and at kst 
got 60 near, as that reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her 
' directly in ; but here I had like to have dipped all my cargo Into the 
SM agtun ; lor that shore lying pretty steep, that is to eay, sloping, 
there was no place to land but where one end of my float, if it ran on 
shore, would lie so high, and the other sink lower, as before, that it 
Would endanger my cargo again. All that I could do was to wait till 
tiie tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an an- 
chor to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of 
ground which I expected the water would flow orer , and so it did. A.B 
soon as X found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, 
I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or 
moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into the ground, one on 
one Bide, near one end, and one on the other side, near the other end | 
thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo 
safe on shore. 

My next work was to view vlte country, and seek a proper place foj 
toy habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure them from what* 
ever might happen. Where I was I yet knew not — whether on the con* 
tinent or on an island — whether inhabited, or not inhabited— whethet 
in danger of wild beasts, or not. There was a hill, not above a mil» 
from me, which rose up very steep and high, and which seemed to over 
lop some other hills, which lay as in a lidge from it, northward. I 
took out one of the fowling pieces and one of the pistols, and a horn of 
powder, and, thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of 
that hill ; where, after I had, with great labor and difBoulty, got up to 
the top, I saw my fate, to my great affliction, viz. : that I was on an 
island, environed every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except 
Bome rocks, which lay a great way off, and two small islands, less thi 
this, which lay about three leagues to the west. 

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good] 
teason to believe, uninhabited, except Ijy wild beasts, of whom, how-, 
ever, I saw none ; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their' 
linds ; neither, when I killed them, could I tell what was fit for food, 
Mtd what not. At my coming back, I shot at a g'-'^^t bird which I eaw 
Bitting upon a tree, on the side of a great wood I believe it was the 
flrst gun that had been fired there since the creation of the world. 
I had no sooner fired, but from all parts of the wood there arose on 
isinumerabl* number of fowls, of many sorts, making a confused 
Bcixamlng, and crying, every one according to his usual note but not 



one or tnsai of aay kincl that I knew." As for ila& creatuM I kiUad, 1 
*<»ok it to b« a kind of a hawk, its color and baek resembling it| but it 
had no talons or claws more than common. Its flesh was carrion, and 
fit far nothing. 

(Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to 
■work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of the 
dfty ; what to do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to 
re^\ for I was afraid to lie down on the ground, not knowing but some 
will beast might devour me — though, as I afterward found, there 
was really no need for those fears. However, as well as I could,' t, 
barric&doed myself round with chests and boards that I had brought oa 
shore, and made a kind of hut for that night's lodging. As for food, I 
yet saw not which way to supply myself, except th^ I had seen two or 
itrm creatures, like hares run out of the wood where I shot the fowl. 

I now began to CCnsider that I might yet get a great many things out 
of the ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the 
rigging and sails, and such other things as might come to land, asid 
I resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible. 
And as I knew that the first storm that blew must necessarily break 
her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things apart, till I 
got everything out of the ship that I could get. Then I called a coim- 
eel, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft, 
but this appeared impracticable, so I resolved to go as before, when the 
tide was down ; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went into 
my hut, having nothing on but a che;j'jzered shirt, a pair of linen 
drawers, and e pair of pumps on my feet 

1 got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft ; and 
having bad experienos of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, 
nor loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several things very use- 
ful to me — as, first, in the carpenter's stores, I found two or three bags 
of nailB and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatciiets, 
and, above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. All these 
I secured, together with several things belonging to the gunner, par- 
ticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket bullets, 
seven jsauskets, and another fowling-piece, with some small quantity of 
powder more, a large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet 
lead ; but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over 
the ship's side. Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that 
I eould find, and a spare fore-topsail, a hammock and some bedding, 
and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe oa 
Bhore, to my very great comfort. 



I vna 'Qc.dey soma approheiKion lest, during my a1cniou%<« ttom ttk 

^nd, my provisions mi"?ht be devoured on elioro ; but when I oain? 
'jack, I found no signs of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a 
willcat upon one of the chests, which, when I came toward it, r n 
a w^ay a little distance, and then stood still. She sat vory compose "< 
and unconcerned, and looked full in my faoe, as if she had a mind t'^ 
bo acquainted with me, I presented my gun to her, but she di«i 
not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did sliA 
offer to stir away, upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by 
the way, I was not very free of it, for my store was not great ; how- 
ever, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it, and 
ute it, and looked (as pleased) for more ; but I thanked her, and eould 
spare no more, bo she marched off. 

Having got my second cargo on shore — though I wa« fain to opeft 
the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, for they were to« 
heavy, being large casks — I went to work to make me a little teni^ 
with the sail and some poles, which I cut for that purpose, and int» 
this tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil either with raia 
or sun ; and I piled ail the empty chests and casks up in a circle round 
the tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt either from man ox 
beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with Bom« 
boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without, and, spread- 
ing one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at 
my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for the first 
time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was very weary and 
lieavy ; for the night before I had slept little and had labored very 
bard all day, as well to fetch all those things from the ship as to get 
them on shore. 

1 had the biggest magazine of all kinds now th»t ever was laid up, 
I believe, for one man ; but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship 
sat upright m that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out 
of her that I could — so every day, at low water, I went on b»arvl, and 
brought away something or other : but particularly the third time 1 
went, I brought away as much of the rigging as 1 could, as also all 
the small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare 
canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of 
wet gunpowder. In a word, I brought away all the sails first and last, 
only that J was f in to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time 
as I ootild, for they were no more useful to be eails, but as mere eaava* 
•nly. 



Bnt 4bi»« irhieh comforted me still more was, that, last of all, aftet 
tbad made five or six Ruch Toyages as these, aud though I had nothing 
more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with, 
1 say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, and three largt 
ranlets of rum or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine fiour; 
this was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting; any 
more provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. X aoon 
smptied the the hogshead o^that bread, and wrapped it up, i-aroel by 
parcel, in pieces of the aaili, •srbieh I cut ont — and, in a word. I got all 
ibis safe on shore also. 

The next day I made /mother voyage, and now having plundered 
the ship of what was portcbla and fit to hand out, I began with th« 
cables, and cutting the great cable into pieces sueh as I could move, I 
got two cables and a hawsei on shore, with all the iron work I could 
get, and having cut down the spritsail yard, and the mizen-yard, and 
OMerything that I could, to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those 
heavy goods, and came away ; but my good luck began now to leavo 
me, for this raft was so unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was 
entered the little cove, where I had landed itie rest of my goods, not 
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and 
throw me and all my cargo into the water ; as for myself it was no 
great harm, for I was near the shore ; but as to my cargo, it was a 
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would hav« 
been of great use to me ; however, when the tide was out, I got most 
of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infi- 
nite labor, for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a wo* . whicli 
fatigu' d me very much. After this I went every day on boar:3, and 
broug'-.t away what I could get. 

I lad now been thirteen days ashore, and had been eleven times 
on board the ship ; in which tima I had brought away all that one pair 
of bands could well be supposed capable to bring : though I verily 
believe had the calm weather held, I should have brought away the 
whole ship, piece by piece, but preparing the twelfth time to go on 
board, I found the wind began to rise. However, at low water, I went 
on board ; and though I thnught I had rummaged the cabin so 
eftectually as that nothing could be found, yet I discovered a locker 
with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three razors, and 
one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a dozen of good knives and 
forks ; in another I found about thirty-six pounds in uioney, soma 
European coin, '•""ua Brazil, some pieces of eight, som9 gold, tind eoiuft 
wlver.

not th« taking oif the groimd ; one of those knives is -worth all thia 
heap. I have no manner of use for thee ; e'en remain where thoa arti 
and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life is not -worth saving." 
Eowever, upon second thoughts, I tooli it away ; and wrapping all tki« 
in a piece of canvas, I began to think of makingTmothor raft ; but 
while I was preparing this, I found the sky overcast, and the wind be- 
gan to rise, amd in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gala from the 
shore. It presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to 
make a raft with the wind off shore ; and that it was my business to be 
gone before the tide or flood began, c* otherwise I might not be 
able to reach the shore at all Accordingly I let myself dowa intf» 
the water, and swam across the channel which lay between the ship 
and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the 
weight of the things I had about me, and partly the roughness of tho 
water ; for the wind rose very hastily and before it was quite high 
water it blew a storm. 

But I was got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my 
wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that night, and 
in tho morning, when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be 
aaeo. 1 I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this satis- 
factory reflection, viz., that I had lost no time, or abated no dil« 
igence, to get everything out of her, that would be useful to me, and 
that, indeed, there was little left in her that I was able to bring awa> 
if I had more time. 

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out 
of ker, except what might drive on shoye from her wreck ; as indeed, 
divers pieces of her afterward did ; but those things were of small use 
to me. 

My thoughts were now wholly eaxiployeA about securing myself 
against either savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any 
were in the island ; and I'had many thoughts of the method how to do 
this, and what kind of dwelling to make ; whether I should make a 
cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and, in short, I resolved 
©B both ; the manner and description of which, it may not be im« 
proper to give an account of. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, particu. 
larly because it was upon a low, moorish grouad, near the sea, and I be- 
lirved it would not Lo wholesome ; and more particularly because there 
was no fresh water near It ; so I resolved lo find a move haalthy and 
more convenient spot of groimd.

MA, that if God Bent any ship in sight, I might not lose any ad« 
-vantage for my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all 
Bay expectations yet. 

la search of a place propwr for this, I found a little plain on t^Q 
riA« of a rising hill, whose front toward til&R little plain was as steep 
u a house-side, so ^hat nothing could •ome down \ipon me from tha 
top. On the side of this rook, there waa a hollow place, worn a littlt 
ruij in, like the entrance or doo>- of a oare ; but there was not really 
axkj care, or way into the rook at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place I resolved to 
^tch my tent. This plain was not above a hundred yards broad, 
and about twice as long, and lay like a green before my door ; and, 
&t the end of it, dsBcended irregularly every way down Into the lo^* 
ground by the sea-sida It was oa the N. N. W. side of the hill ; so 
that It was sheltered frona the he£bt every day, till jit came to a W, 
tad by S. bub, or thereabouts, which, la those countries, is near the 
tetting. 

Before I Bet up my tent, I drew |b half-circle before l6e hoUov 
plaee, whioh took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from tha 
reck, and twenty yards in its diameter from its beginning a&A 
ending. 

In Biis half-cirole I pitched *wo rows of strong stakes, drivtfig 
&em into the ground till they stood vary* firm like pileai, the bigg.esft 
oftd being out of the ground, aboi^ ive feet and a half, and sharpened 
Ml the top. Tlks ft^re rows 4&d aot stand above sis inches from oaa 
w&other. 

Then I took the pieces t f cable #hich I cut in the ship, and laid 
(ham in rows, one upon an another, within the circle, between thesa 
two rows of stakes, np t» the to^ placing other stakes in the inside, 
leaning against them, <vbout two feet and a half high, like a spur to a 
post ; and this fence *»as so strong that neither man nor beast could 
get inio it or over it. This ooet me a great deal of time and laboi^ 
espeo^ly to cut t^e piles in the woods, bring them to the place, and 
drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door but by a 
riauort ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, when I was in, I lift,ed 
' after me ; and so I was aompletely f eaoed in and fortifiedc as 5

NTO this fence, or fortress, with infinite ia'bor, I carried a]9 
my riebes, all my proTlsions, ammonition, and Btores oi 
which you have the account above ; and I made a larga ten^ 
which, to preserre me from the rains, that in one part of tht 
year are very violent there, I made double, viz : one Bmaller tent 
within, and one larger tent aoove it, and covered the uppermost with 
• large tarpaulin, which I hud saved among tha iMils. 

And now I lay no more for awhile in the beoi which I had bronghl 
•o ehore, but in a hammock, which waa indeed a very good one, and 
fc«longed to the mate of the ship. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions M«d everything that would 
•poll by the wot, and having thus enclosed alii my goods I made up the 
entrance, which till now I had left open, and bo passed and repuKsed, 
fw I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into th* rrvjk, and 
Vringing all ttie earth and atones that I dug down o«i tbtough my 
im-U 1 laid them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace, 89 
that it raised the ground «nthLn about a foot and a half, and thus 1 
made me a eeve just lK>nind my tent, which served m<» like a cellar to 
say house. It cost 'm9 much labor and many dayfi before all these 
.things were brought to perfection, and therefr>re I must go back to 
■oxaie oi::di- things which took up some of my thoughts. At the same 
time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my 
Itent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling from a thick, 
oark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after that a 
groat clap of thunder, as is naturally the effeitt of it. I was not so 
much surprised with the lightning as I was with a thought, which 
darted into my mind as swift aa the lightning Uself— 0, my powder! 
My very heart sank within me when I thought that, at one blast, alj 
•aj powder might be dasboyed t On whioh, aet my def anot wUj, hvt

> Ibe pr6yid!iBg m« food, as I thoaght, entirely dep«nded. I wai aotking 
near so anxious about my own danger, though, had the powder taken 
fire, I should never have known what had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm wa* 
over I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and appU> 
ed myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep 
it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope that whatever might oome it 
might not all take fire at onoe, and to keep it so apart that it should 
not be posi'ible to make one part fire another. I finished this work is 
about a fortnight, and I think my powder, which in all was about two 
hundred and forty pounds weight, waa divided into not lesa than » 
hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not appre- 
hend any danger from that, so I placed it in my new cave, which in my 
fancy I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and down in holoi 
among the rocks, so that no wet micrht oome to it, marking very ear** 
fully where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while ti^iB waa doing, I went out at leas6 
onoe every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see if I 
Gould kill anything fit for food, and as near as I could, to acquaint 
mjisclf with what the island produced. The first time I went out, I 
presently discovered that there were goats upon the island, which 
was a great satisfaction to me ; but then it was attended with this 
misfortune to me, viz., that they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift 
of foot, that it was the most difficult thing in the world to oome at 
them ; but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might 
now and then shoot one, as it soon happened, for after I had found 
their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them : I ebservedf 
if they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon the rocks they 
would run away as in a terrible fright ; but if they were feeding in 
the valleys, and I was upon the rooks, they took no notice of me, from 
whence I concluded that, by the position of their optics, their sight 
▼as 60 directed downward that they did not readily see objects that 
were above them, so afterward I took this method I always climbed 
the rocks first, 4o get above them, and then had frequently a fair 
mark. The first shot I made among these creatures I killed a aha 
goat, which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which 
grieved me heartily ; but when the old one fell the kid stood stock 
still by her till I oame and took her up ; and not only so, but when X 
carried the old one with me, upon my shoulders, the kid follvwed me 
quite to my enclosure ; upon which I laid doirn the dam and took the 
Jdd in mj arms and carried it over my pale, in hopes to hare bred U 



up tafi^e, btti it would not eat, so I was fotced to kill it •nd «at it is&i^ 
self. These two supplied me Tdth flesh a great vhile, for I eat sporo 
iagly, and preserved my provisions (my bread especially) as mtieh as I 
possibly could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely neo«(Bsary 
to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to bum ; and what I did 
for that, as also how I enlarged my cave and what conveniences I made, 
I shall give account of in its proper place, but I must first give som-J 
little account of myself, and of my thoughts about living, which it DMiy 
well be supposed were not few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition, for as I was not cast 
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a yiole&t 
storm, quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a great wt^y, 
viz., some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary course of the trade 
of mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a determination of 
Heaven that in this desolate place, and in this desolate manner, I 
fihould end my life. The tears would run plentifully down my face 
when I made these reflections ; and sometimes I would expostulate 
■orith myself why Providence should thus completely ruin its creatures, 
and render them so absolutely miserable, so abandoned without help, 
BO entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful 
for such a life. 

But something always returned swift upon me to eheek these 
thoughts and to reprove me ; and particularly one day, walking with 
my gun in my hand by the sea side, I was very pensive upon the sub- 
ject of my present condition, when reason, as it were, expostulated 
with me the other way, thus : "Well, you are in a deaolatd condition, 
U is true, but pray remember, where are the rest of you? Did not you 
come, eleven of you, into the boat? Where are the ten ? Why wer« 
thoy not saved and you lost ? Why were you singled out? Is it bet- 
ter. to be here or there? " And then I pointed to the sea. All evilf axe 
to be considered with the good that is in them, and with what wena 
attends them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for nay snb- 
nstence, and what would have been my case if it had not happened 
(which was a hundred thousand to one) that the ship floated fn>a the 
place where she first struck, and was driven so near to the shore that 
I had time to get all these things out of her ? What would bare been 
xty case if I had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first 
eame on shore, without necessftiies of life, or neoeaaaries to supply and 
procure them? Particularly, said I aloud (thou^^ to n^s«lf>» what 



jaoBmsoN CRUSOE. 78 

Bbould I hav* 4on« without a gun, without ammuiiition, wlthons aay 
tools to mak« anything, or to work \nth, without elothee, bedding, a 
tent, or any manner of, covering ? and that now I had all tb(»o to a 
Bufflcient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in suoh a 
manner as to live without nay gun when my ammunition was spent, so 
tJaat I had a tolerable view of subsisting without any want, as long aa 
I lived ; for I oonsidered, from the beginning, how I would pi^jvide 
for the aooidents that might happen, and for the time that was to 
come, not only after my ammunition should be spent, but even after 
my health or strength should decay. 

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition being 
destroyed at one blast — I mean my powder being blown up by Ii|[hi- 
ning — and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it 
lightened and thundered, as I observed just now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of 
silent life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the world before, I 
shall take it from its beginning and continue it in its order. It was 
by my account, the 30th of September, when, in the manner as above 
said, I first set foot upon this horrid island ; when the sun, being to us 
in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head ; fov I reckoned 
myself, by observation, to be in the latitude of nine degrees twenty^ 
two minutes north ot the line.

FTBE I had been there about ten or twelve days. It eaoaa 
into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning of 
time for want of books and pen and ink, and should even 
forget the Sabbath days from the working days ; but to pre- 
vent this I mxi it with my knife upon a large post in capital letters 
and making it into a great cross, I set it upon the shore where I first 
landed, via : " I oame on shore here on the 30th of September, 1669. " 
Upon the sides of this square post I cut every day a notch Yrith my 
knife, and every seventh notch was as long again as the rest; and 
e/7«rj first day of the month as long again as that long one ; and thus 
I kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning cf 
time.

Bnt it bnpi>«D«4, tbfti anong the many things -which I toought out 
©f the ship, in tha Beveral voyages which, as above mentioced, I 
mftde to ii, I got »ev«ral things of less value, but uot all less usefnl 
to me, which I found some time after, in rummiiging the chests ; aa 
in particulflx, pens, ink, and paper ; several pai-cels in the captain's 
mate's, gunner's and oarpanter's keeping ; three or four compasste, 
some mathematical instruments, dials, perspective charts, and bookfl 
of navigation : all of which I huddled together, whether I might 
want them or no ; also I found three very good Bibles, which came 
to me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among 
my things ; some Portuguese books also, and among them, two or 
three popish ~rayer books, and several other books, all which I caro- 
jfnlly secured. And I must not forget that we had in the ship a doj 
and two oats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say 
something in its place ; for I carried both of the oats with me ; and as 
for the dog he jumped out of the ship himself, and swam on shore to 
zne the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty 
servant to me for many years ; I wanted nothing that he could fetch 
me, nor any company that he could make up to me, I only wanted to 
have him talk to me, but that would not do. As I observed before 
1 found pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; 
and I shall show that while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact, 
but after all that was gone, I could not ; fo* I conid not make any ink 
by any means that I could devise. 

And this put me in mind that I wasted many things notwithstand- 
ifig all that I had amassed together ; and of these, this of ink was one ; 
M also a spade, pickaxe, and shovel to dig or or remove the earth ; 
needles, pins, and thread ; as for linen, I soon learned to want that 
without much difficulty. 

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily ; and it was 
feaar a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or 
furrounded my habitation. The piles or stakes, which were as heavy 
M I oould well lift, were a long time in cutting and preparing in tha 
woods, and more, by far in bringing home ; so that I spent sometimes 
two days in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a third 
day in driving it into the ground ; for which purpose, I got a heavy 
pieoe of wood, at fijst, but at last bethought myself of one of the 
iron erowB, which, however, though I found it answer, made driving 
thaa* posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what need 
I have b0«n oonoemed at the tediousness of ooything I had to d* ;

H that bad bd«a over, at least that I could foresee, MCMpt th^ 
tuBging the island to seek for food ; \rhioh I did, more er less, every 
day. 

I now began to consider, serioosly, my condition, and the oironm^ 
stances I \vag reduced to ; and I drew up the state of my af&irs in 
rriting, not bo much to leave them to any that were to oome after m« 
ifor I was like to have but few heirs'), as to deliver my thoughts from 
4aily poring upon them and afflicting my mind ; and as my reaaoa 
fcagan to master my desponaency, I began to comfort myself as well 
as I could, and to set the good against the evil, that I might hav« 
■omething to distinguish my case from worse ; and I stated very im< 
partially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against tht 
saiaeries I suffered, thus : 



I am oast upon a horrible deso- 
late island, void of all hope of re- 
covery. 

I am singled out and separated, 
as it were, from all the world, to 
be miserable.

were. 

But I am singled out too fron» 
&11 the ship's crew, to be spared 
from death ; and He, that miracu^ 
lously saved me from death, cai| 
deliver me from this condition. 



I am divided from mankind, a But I am not starved and per-

W ADVENTUBES OF 

^an tise YfhOi^ here was da unbounded testamoay, that thet^ wsa 
iO^tTvO atiy ooaaitioa in the world so miserable, but tliara was soms* 
Qdag negative, or something positive, to be thankful for in it ; and let 
♦ihis stand as a direction, from the experience of the most miserable of 
all ooaditions in this world, that we may always find in it something ta 
aesafort eursolv^ from, and to set, in the deaoription of good and evil, 
«a the credit side of the account. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and 
given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship ; I say given 
over those things, I began to apply myself to accommodate my way of 
llTing, and to make things as easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent und« 
the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables j 
but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall against 
it of tnrfs, about two feet thick on the outside ; and after some time (I 
think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the 
took, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things 
m I oould get, to keep out the rain ; which I found, at some times of 
the year, very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, 
and into the cave which I had made behind me. But I must observo, 
too, that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay 
in no order, so they took up all my place ; I had no room to turn my* 
self ; so I set myself to enlarge my cave and work further into the 
earth, for it was a loose sandy rock which yielded easily to the labor I 
bestowed upon it ; and when I found I was pretty safe as to the beastg 
of prey, I worked sidewise, to the right hand, into the rock, and the* 
turning to the right again, worked out, and made me a door to come 
out in the outside of my pale or fortification. , 

'xliis gave me not only egress and regress, as it were, a back way. 
to my tent, and to my storehouse, but gave m« room to stow my 
goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things 
as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a tsikle, for without 
these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world ; I 
oould not write, or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure, 
without a table, so I went to work. And here I must needs observo, 
that as reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so by 
•tating and squarinot everything by reason, and by making the most 
rational Judgment of things, every man may be, in time, master of 
tevery mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my life ; and yet 



" ROBINSON CliUSOB. tt 

In time, by labor, application and ocntriTance, I ftranfl at last that 1 
wanted nothing but I could have Baade, especially if I had had took. 
Ho\7ever, I made abundance of things, even withont tools ; and soma 
with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps wer© 
nerer made that wey before, and that with infinite labor. For ex- 
ample, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to eat down a 
tree, set it on an edge before mo, and hew it flat on either aids with 
my SEse, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dab it 
Bmooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I could saais but 
one board of a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but patience, 
any more than I bad for a prodigious deal of time and labor which it 
took me up to make a plank or board ; but my time or labor was littla 
worth, and so it was aa well employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in 
the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I 
brought on my raft from the ship. But when I wrought out some 
boards, as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a 
half, one over another, all along one side of my cave to lay all my 
tools, nails, and iron work on — and in a word, to separate everything 
at large in their places, that I might easily come at them. I knocked 
pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns, and all things that 
▼ould haiig up, so that had my cave been seen, it looked like a 
general magazine of all necessary things ; and I had everything so 
ready at roj hand, that it was a great pl'jasure to me to see all my goods 
in such order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries bo 
great. 

And no-r it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's em- 
^ ployment ; for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, &nd not only 
as to labor, but in much discompoanre of mind — an«l my journal 
would, too, have been full of many dull things ; for example, I must 
iiav« said thus — "Sept 30th. After I had got to shore, and had es- 
caped drowning, instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance, 
having first vomited, with a great quantity of salt water which was 
gotten into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I ran about 
the shora. wxinging my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaim- 
ing at nay misery, and crying out I was undone, undone ! till, tired and 
faint, I was forced to lie down on the gyound to repose, but durst not 
sleep, for fear of being devoured." 

Some days after this, and after I bad been oh board the ship, and 
got all tUat I eould out of her, I could not forbear getting up to the 
top of » ^ttle mooBtain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of Beeia|[ a

with the hopoa of it, and t^ter looking steadily, till I vras almost 
blind, lose it qnite, and sit down and weep like a child, and thna in- 
erease my misery by my foUy. 

Bnt, haring gotten over these things in some measure, and having 
vetUed my honsenold stuff and habitation, made me a table and a 
chair, and all as handsome stnfif about me as I could. I began to keep 
my journal, of which I shall here give you the copy [though in it will 
bs told all these particulars over again) as long as it lasted ; for hav- 
ing &o more ink, I was forced to leave it ofL

SEPTEMBER, 8d^ 1659, I, poor miserable Robinson Crusoe 
being shipwrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing, 
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island, which I 
ealled the Isiakd or Dbsfaib; all the rest of the ship's 
company being drowned, and myself about dead. 

All the rest of that day I spent in aff.ictiDg myself at the dismal 
circumstances I was brought io, viz.: I had neither food, house, 
clothes, weapon, nor place to fly to ; and, in despair of any relief, 
saw nothing but death before me — that I shoiild either be devoured 
by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to death for want of 
food. At the approach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild 
creatures, but slept soundly, though it rained all night,

■eeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, 
and then swam on board. This day also it continued raining, though 
with no wind at all. 

I^om the 1st of October to the 24/A. All these days entirely spent in 
many several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I brought 
»n shore every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain also in these days, 
though with some intervals of fair weather, but it seems this was the 
irainy season. 

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but 
being ia shoal watei^ and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered 
many of them when the tide was out, 

Oct. 25. It rainod all night and all day, with some gusts of wind, 
during which time the ship broke in pieces (the wind blowing a little 
harder than before), and was no more to be seen, eicept the wreck of 
her, and that only at low water. I spent this day in covering and se- 
euring the goods whicn I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them. 

Od. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place 
to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any 
attaek in the night, either from wild beasts or men. Toward night I 
fixed upon a proper place, under a rock, and marked out a semidrole 
for my encampment, which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, 
or fortification, made of double piles lined within with cables, and 
without with turf. 

Prom the 26th to the 80th I worked very hard in carryi»g all my 
goods to my new habitation, though fome part of the time it rained 
exceedingly hard. 

The 31st, in the morning, I went oife into the Island with my gun to 
seek for some food, and discover the country, when I killed a she-goat, 
and her kid followed me home, which I t^terward killed also, because 
it would not feed. 

N&uembe/r 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the 
first night, making it as large as I could, with stakes drivm in to swinK 
my hammock upon. 

Xov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber 
which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little 
within the place Z had marked out for my fortifioafcion. 

2hu, 3. I went out with my gun and killed two fewk like ducki. 
which wer« very good food. Ia ^e aftexaeoft I went to worl» to make 
lEie a te^le.

Kov. 4. Thif mo}^>kig 1 began to order my tictes of work, oi going 
Cmt with mj gun, time of sleep, and time of dirersion, yiz.: every 
morning I walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did 
not rain; then am ployed myself to -work till about eleven o'clock; then 
ate what I had to live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, 
the weather being excessive hot; and then, in the evening, to work 
again. The working part of this day and the next was wholly employed 
ha making my table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though 
time and necessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, 
as I believe they would any one else, 

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and dog and killed a 
wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing. Of every 
creature that I killed I took off the skins and preserved them. CJoming 
back by the seashore I saw many sorts of sea fowl, which I did not un- 
derstand, but was surprised and almost frightened with two or thred 
Heels, which, while I was gazing at them (not well knowing what they 
were), got into the sea and escaped me for that time, 

Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my tabl« again 
and finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I 
learned to mend it. 

Nov. 1. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 
10th, and part of the 12th (for the 11th was Sunday, aecording to my 
reckoning), I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado 
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me, and even in the 
making I pulled it to pieces several times. 

Note. I soon neglected my keeping Sundays, fOK, omitting my mark 
for them on my post, I forgot which was which. 

Nov. 13. This day it rained, which re&«ehed me exceedingly — cooled 
the earth — but it was eiccompanied with terrible thunder and light- 
ning, which frightened me dreadfully, for fear of my powder. As soon.' 
BO it was over I resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many, 
little parcels as possible, that it might not be in danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little square oheets 
o» boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most, of 
powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed ii in places as secure 
and as remote from one another as possible. On one of these days I 
killed a large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not what to call it. 

Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent, into the rock, to 
make room for my further convenience. 

Note. Three things I wanted exceedingly for this work, viz., a 
pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarmw or basket, bo I desisted from my 



fiOBZKSON 0BU80B* 81 

Q^csls, Mid V3gfia to oomiAit how to supply theid ^iraats, and make ms 
Bem« tools. A« ibr a pickaxe I made use of tho iron crows, -which 
WsM proper enougi, thotigh heary, but the next thing was a ehovel 
er spada ; this w&s so absolutely neoeesary that, indeed, I conld do 
nothing effectually without it, but what kind of one to make I knew 
ftot. 

Jfov. 18. The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree oj 
that wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils they call the iron tree, irom 
ils exceeding hardness ; of this, /0th great labor, and almost spoiling 
Bay axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home too, with difficulty enough, 
fox it was exceeding heavy. The excesBire hardness of the wood, and 
my having no other way, made me a long while upon this machine, for 
I worked it ©ffeotnally, by little and little, into the form of a shovel oz 
spade, the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that tlio 
broad part, having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not last 
sae BO long ; however,, it served well enough for the uses which I had 
occasion to put it to, but never was a ghovel, I believe, made after thai 
fashion, or so long in making. 

I was still deficient, for I wantsd a basket or a wheelbarrow. A 
)a8ket I could not make by any means, having no such things aa twiga 
.^hat would bend to make wicker ware— at least none yet found out— 
and aa the wheelbarrow, I fancied I oould make all but the wheal, but 
4hat I had no notion of, neither did I know how to get about it ; be* 
Bides I had no possible way to make iron gudgeons for the spindle or 
ilxis of tha vrheel to run in, so I gave it over ; and for oarrying away 
^e earth whi(^ I dug out of the oave, I made ma a thing l^e a hod, 
whioh the laborers carry mortar in for tha brloklayers. This was not 
■o difficult for mo as the making the shovel ; and yet this and th« 
■hovel, and the attempt whioh I made in vain to make a wheelbanow, 
look me up no leas than four days ; I mean always excepting my mom« 
lag walk with my gun, which I seldom omitted, and very seldom failedt 
also, bringing home something fit to eat. 

Xov. 23. My other work having now stood still because of my 
making these tools, when they were fibnished I went on, and working 
•rery day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days en* 
tirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it might hold my 
goods oommodiously, 

KoTB. During all this time I worked to make this room or <»7« 
^adous enough to accommodats me as a warehouse or magazine, m 
kitcheEQ, a dining.room and a cellar. As fox lodgings, I k&pt thd

bard that I eontd not keep myself dry, wMcli caused ste aftarword ta 
eerer kll my places 'nitbin my pale with long poles, and in the form ot 
nlien, leaning against the rocks, and load them with flags and large 
leaves of treee, like a thatoh. 

December 10. I now began to think my care or yault finished, when 
on a sadden (It seems I had made it too large ^ a great quantity of earth 
fell down from the top and on one side, so much that in short it fright- 
«ned me, and not without reason, too, for if I had been under it I 
should neTer haTe wanted a grave-digger. Upon this disaster I had a 
great deal of work to do orer again, for I had the loose earth to carry 
out, and, whioh was of more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, 
80 that I might be sure no more would come down. 

Ike. 11, This day I went to work with it accordingly, and got two 
shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of board 
across over 6Ao\x post ; this I finished the next day, and setting moro 
posts up with boards, in about a week more I had the roof secured ; 
and the posts standing in rows served me for partitions to part off mj 
be«s«. 

Ihc, 17. From this day to the 30th I placed shelves, and knocked up 
Bails on the posts, to hang everything up that could be hung up, and 
Oow I began to be in some order within doors. 

Dee. 20. I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish 
oy house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my 
Tietu&ls upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me ; also 1 
made me another table. 

D«o. 24. Much rain all night and all day ; no stirring out.

K. B. 1 took such care of it that it lived ; and the leg grew well, 
•nd as strong as ever : but by nursing it so long, it grew tame, and 
fed upon the little green at my door, and would not go away. This 
was the first time that I entertained a thought of breeding up Bom9 
tame creatures, that I might have food when my powder and shot was

January 1. Very hot still ; bnt I went abroad early and l»t« with 
my gun, and lay still in the middla of the day. This evening 
going farther into the valleys »yhich lay toward th« centre of th« 
island, I found there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy, and 
hard to come at ; however, I resolved to try if I could not bring my 
dog to hunt them down. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with 
nay dog, and set him upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they aQ 
faced abomt on the dog ; and he knew his danger too well, for h« woq14 
not come near them. J 

Jan. 3. I began my fence or wall ; which being still jealous af 
my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and 
strong.. 

N. B. This wall being described before, I pnrpoaely omit whftk 
was said in the journal ; it is sufficient to observe that I was no laaa 
time than from the 3d of January to the 14th of April, working, finish- 
ing, and perfecting this wall ; though it was no mora than aboat 
twenty -five yards in length, being a half circle, from one place in thfi 
rock to another place, about twelve yards from it, the door of the e«TO 
being in the centre, behind it. 

All this time I worked very hard ; the rains hindering me many 
days, nay, sometimes weeks together ; but I thought I should never bo 
perfectly secure till this wall was finished ; and it is scarce credible 
what inexpressible labor everything was done with, especially the 
bringing of piles out of the woods, and driving them into the ground ; 
for I made them much bigger than I needed to have done. 

When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced, wi^ 
a turf wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people 
were to come on shore there they would not perceive anything like % 
habitation ; and it was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, 
«pon a very remarkable occasion. 

During this time, I made my rounds in the woodg for game every 
day, when the rain permitted me, and make frequent discoveries, in 
these walks, of something or other to my advantage ; particularly, I 
found a kind of wild pigeons, who buUd, not as wood-pigeong, in a 
tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the holes of the rooks ; and tak- 
ing some young ones, I endeavored to bring them up tame, and did 
so ; but when they grew older, they flew all away ; which, perhaps, 
was, at first, for wjit of feeding them, for I had notbing to give them; 
however, I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones 
which were very good meat. And now, in the management of my 
household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, whioh I 



84 "^ ADVENTUSffle O^ / ■ 

thought at first it was impossible for me to mak« } as fe)lfe«4, as t? 
some of them, it was ; for Instance, I oould never make a ^ask td b« 
hooped. I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before ; bat I 
eould never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, tboogk I 
spent many weeks about it. I coiild neither put in the heads, nor 
join the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water, so I 
gave that also over. In the next place, I was at a greab loss for a 
eandle ; so that as soon as it was dark, which was generally by seven 
o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees- 
wax with which I made candles in my African adventure, but I had 
none of that now ; the only remedy I had was that when I killed a 
goat, I saved the tallow : and with a little dish made of clay, which I 
baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some oakum, I made me 
a lamp ; and this gave me light, though not a clear steady light bk» 
a candle. In the middle of all my labors, it happened that in rum- 
maging my things, I found a little bag ; which, as I hinted before, 
kad been filled with corn, for the feeding of poultry ; not for this 
voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon. 
What little remainder of corn had been in the bag was all de- 
voured by the rats, and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust, 
and being willing to have the bag for some other us© (I think it was 
to put powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some 
«uch use), I shook the husks of the corn out of it, on one side of my 
fortification, under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rain just now mentioned, that I 
threw this stuff away ; taking no notice of anything, and not so much 
as remembering that I had thrown anything there ; when, about a 
month after, I saw some few stalks of something green, shooting out 
of the ground, which I fancied might be some plant I had not seen ; 
but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, after a little 
longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which wer» 
perfect green barley, of the same kind as our European, nay, as our 
English barley. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my 
ifihoughts on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no jreligioas 
^foundation at all ; indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my 
head, nor had entertained any sense of any things that had befallen 
me, otheiwiso than as chance, or, as we lightly say what pleases God • 
without so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these 
things, or his order in governing events in the world. But after I 
saw barley crow there, in a climate which I knew wae not proper for 



torn, fcftd espeoi^By aa I knew not hov it oame thew, it afiortlad me 

strangely ; and I began to Bnggest, that God had miraculonsly maoed 
this grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was e« 
directed purely for my sustenance, on that wild miserable plao«. 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my eyi , 
and I began to blesa myself that such a prodigy of nature ahouui 
happen upon my account ; and this was the more strange to me, be 
cause I gaw near it still, all alo«g by the eide of the rock, some other 
•tiaggliug stalks, which proved to be etalks of rice, and which I 
knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was ashc*e 
there. 

X not only thought these the pare pr*ductions of Providence for my 
support, but not doubting that there was more in the place, I went 
orer all that part of the island where I had been before, searching 
in every comer, and under every rock, for more of it ; but I could 
B.ot find any. At last it occurred to my thoughts that I had shook out 
a bag of chicken' s-meat in that place, and then the wonder began to 
•ease ; and I must confess, my religious thankfulness to God'« 
providence began to abate too, upon the discovering of all this was 
nothing but what was common ; though I ought to have been as 
thankful for so strange and unforseen a providence, as if it had been 
aairaoulous ; for it was really the work of Providence, as to me, that 
Bhould order or appoint that ten or twelve grains of com should re- 
main unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had 
h^een dropped from heaven ; as also, that I should throw it out in that 
f articular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang 
up immediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it anywber* else at that 
time, it would have been burned up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may be stud, in their 
season, which was about the end of June ; and, laying up every com, 
f resolved to sow them all again, hoping, in time, to have some 
quantity su£Bicient to supply me with bread. But it was not till the 
fOfUrth year that I could allow myself the leapt grain of corn to eat, 
and even then but sparingly, as I shall show afterward in its order, 
for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not observing the 
proper time ; as I sowed just before the dry season, so that it never 
eame up atnall, at least not as it would have done ; of which in its 
place. 

Besides this barley, there were, sus above, twenty or thirty stalks of 
sise, which I preserved with the same care, and whose use wae of the 
eaiae kind or to the same purpose, viz : to make me bread, or rather 



food ; for I fotmd Traya to cook it without baMnjjj tliongli I dii feliaS 
also for some time. But to return to my journal. 

iTTorked excessively hard these three or four month?, to get my wall 
dofie ; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriring to get into it, 
not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might b* no 
sign on the outside of my habitation. 

^iU 16. I finished the ladder ; so I went np with the ladder to tho 
top, and then pulled it after me, and let it down in the inside ; this 
was a complete enclosure to me, for within I had room enough, and 
nothing conld come at me from without, unless it oould first mount 
my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost all my 
labor overthrown at once, and myself killed ; the ease was thus : — As I 
was busy in the inside of it behind my tent, just at the entrance intc 
my cave, I was terribly frightened with the most dreadful surprising 
thing indeed ; for, all on a sudden, I found tho earth come crumbling 
down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill over my 
head, and two of the posts I had set up in the cave cracked in a 
frightful manner. I was heartily scared, but thought nothing of what 
really was the cause, only thinking that the top of my cave was fall- 
ing in, as some of it had done before ; and for fear I should be buried 
In it, I mn forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there 
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which I 
expected might roll down upon me. I had no sooner stepped down 
upon firm ground, than I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake ; 
for the ground I stood on shook three times at about eight minutes' 
distance, with three such shocks as would have overturned the 
Btrongest building that could be supposed to have stood on the earth ; 
and n great piece of the top of a rock, which stood about naif a mile 
from me, next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise as I never 
heard in all my life. I perceived also that the sea was put into a vio- 
lent motion by it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the 
water thnn on the island. 

I w.is 6o much amazed with the thing Itself (having never felt the 
like, nor di8C0T*8ed with anyone that had) that I was like one dead or 
Btupeled ; and the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, likecne 
that was tossed at sea ; but the noise of the falling of the rock awaked 
me, as it were ; and rousing me from the stupefied condition I was in, 
filled m« with horror, and I thought of nothing but the hill falling 
upon my tent and my household goods, and burying all at onoe ; this 
punk my very soul within me a second time. 



10KSI80H OBtJSOB. t? 

After the tilrd shock was over, and I felt no mort for some tlBH^ 
I began to take courage ; yet I had not heart enongh to go orer my 
wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground 
greatly cast down, and disconsolate, not knowing what to do. All this 
while I had not the least eerious religious thought : nothing but the 
eommon Lord, have mercy upon, me I aai when it was over, that went 
•way too. 

"WTiile I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow clou^iy, as If it 
would rain ; and soon after the wind rose by a little and little, so that 
in lees than half an hour, it blew a most dreadful hurricane ; the se^ 
was, all on a sudden, covered with foam and froth ; the shore was oov« 
ered with a breach of the water ; the trees were torn up by the roots, 
and a terrible storm it was. This held about three houi-s, and then 
began to abate ; and ia two hours more it was quite calm, and began 
to rain very hard. All this while I sat upon the ground, very mud? 
terrified and dejected ; when, on a sudden, it came into my thought* 
that these winds and rain being the consequence of the earthquake^ 
the earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into my 
cave again. With this thought my spirits began to revive, and the raia 
also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down in my tent ; but 
the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down with 
it ; and 1 was forced to get into my cave, though very much afraid and 
nneasy, for fear it should fall on my bead. This violent rain forced 
me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole through my new fortification, 
like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have drowned my 
oeve. After I had been in my cave for some time, and found no mora 
shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed. And 
now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went 
to my little store, and took a small cup of rum ; which, however, I did 
then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no mor« 
when that was gone. It continued raining all that night and great 
psETt of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad ; but my mind 
being more composed, I began to think of what I had best do — con- 
eluding, that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would 
be no living for me in a cave; but I must consider of building me some 
little hut in an open place, which I might surround with a wall, as I 
had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men; 
for if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be 
buried alive. 

With thes* thoughts, I Msolved to remove my tMit from the place

hill, emfi whleh, if il should be shaken again, -would certainly fall upoa 
toy tent. I upent the two next days, being the 19th aad 20th of April, 
\bi contriving Asrhere and how to ram ove my habitation. The fear of 
|being swallowed alive affected me bo, that I never slept in quiet ; and' 
iy«t the apprehension of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost 
equal to it ; but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything 
Vas put in order, how pleasantly T was concealed, and how safe from 
danger, it made me very loath to remove. In the meantime it occurrfcd 
to me that it would require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and 
that I must be ooatented to run the risk where I was, till I had formed 
a convenient camp, and secured it so as to remove it. With this con- 
clusion I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go to 
work with all speed to build me a wall with piles and cables, &c., in « 
circle as before, and set up my tent in it wheo it was finished ; but 
that I would venture to stay where I was till it was ready, and fit to re- 
move to. This was the 2l6t. 

April 22. The next morning 1 began lo consider of means to pvit 
this measure into execution, but I was at a great loss about the took. 
I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the 
Ratchets for traffic wiih the Indians) ; but with much chopping and 
cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of notches, and dull ; aud 
though I had a grindstone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too. 
This caused me as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed 
npon a grand point of politics, or a judge u^Don the life and death of a 
man. At length I contrived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my 
foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty. 

Nora. I had never seen any such thing iu England, or at least not 
to take any notiee how it was done, though since I have observed it is 
Vbry common there — besides that, my grindstone was very large and 
heavy. This machine cost me a full week's work to bring it to per- 
fection. 

April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, j 
amy machine for turning my grindstone performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceived that my bread had been low a great! 
vhile, I now took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one bisoxiir 
sake a day, which made my heart very hearjr.

AY 1. In ihr morning, looking toward the seaside, the tida 
being low, I saw eometbing lie on the Bbore bigger than 
^ ordinary, and it looked like a cask ; when I <»me to it, I 
fonnd a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck oj 
t^ ship, which had been driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and 
looking toward the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher 
out of the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel that waa 
driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder ; but ife 
had taken water, and the powder was caked aa hard as a stone ; how« 
OY©r, I rolled it farther on the shore for the present, and went oa 
upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the ship to look tat 
more. 

When I came down to the ship, I fonnd it strangely remOTod. The 
fwecaetle, which lay before buried in the sand, was heaved np al 
lMa«t six feet ; and the stern (which was broke to pieces and parted 
from the reot, by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rummaging 
of her) wa« tossed as it were, up, and cast on one side ; and the sand 
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that I could now walk 
q^uite up to her when the tide was out ; whereas there was a great 
piece of wat«r before, so that I could not eome within a quarter of a 
mile of tJie wreck without swimming, I was surprised with this at 
first, but soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake ; and as 
hy this violence the ship was more broken open than formerly, so many 
tilings came daily on shore, which the sea had loosened, and whieb 
file winds and water rolled by degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design or removing my 
ti&bitatioa ; and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, ia 
seBTching whether I could make any way into the ship ; but I found 
nothing waa to be expected of that kind, for all the inside of the ship 
was choked up with sand. However, as I had learned not to despair 
of anything, I resolved to puU everything to pieces that I could out 
of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from her would bs 
of some use or other to me. 

May 9. I began with my saw, and cut a pieo« of a beam through,

May i. I went a fishing, but oanght not one fish that 1 dit/st eat 
•<,tilllwas weary of my sport, when, just going to leave oB, I 
caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some rop»> 
yam, but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently caught fish enough, as 
much as I oared to eat ; all of which I dried in the sun, and ate thcaa 
dry. 

Map 5. Worked on the wreck; cut another beam osunler, and 
brought three great fir planks oflf from the decks, which I tiea together 
a&d made swim on shore when the tide of flood came on. 

May 6. Worked on the wreck ; got several iron bolts out of her, and 
other pieces of iron work ; worked very hard, and eame home very 
iDttuch tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but not with an intent to work , 
but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself dowa. the beams 
being cut ; that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose ; and 
the inside of the hold lay so open that I could see into it t but almost 
ftdl of water and sand. 

May 8. Went to the wreck and carried an iron crow, to w»ench up 
the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water and sand. I wrenched 
up two planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide. I left 
khe iron crow in the wreck for next day. 

May 9. Went to the wreck, and with my crow made my way into the 
body of the wreck, and felt several casks and loosened them with the 
crow, but oould not break them up. I felt also a roll of English lead, 
a&d could not stir it ; but it was too heavy to remove. 

May 10 to 14. Went every day to the wreck, and got a great many 
pieces of timber, and boards or planks, and two or three hundred 
weight of iron. 

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if 1 could not cut a piece efl 
ttie roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it witk 
the other ; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could uoi 
make any blow to drive the hatchet. 

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared 
more broken by the force of the water ; but I stayed so long in the 
woods, to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going the 
wreck that day. 

May 17. I saw some pieoos of the wreck blown on shore, at a great 
distance, two miles off me, but resolved to see what they werei, aa<] 
found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy foe me to biing awa^.

May di. Erery day, to this day, I worked Ml ta« imok ; and witb 
^ard labor I loosened some things bo much, "trith the crow, that th« 
fix«t blowing tide eereral casks floated out, and two of the seamen's 
«hes^4ft ; but the wind blowing from tha shore, nothing came to land 
tiiat day, but pieces of timber, and a hogshead which had some Brazil 
pork in it ; but the ealt water and the Band had spoiled it. I contin* 
med this work every day to the 15th of June, except the time neoes* 
tery to get food ; which I always appointed, during this part of my 
employment, to be when tha tide is up, that I might be ready when 
it ebbed out ; and by this time I had gotten timber, and plank and 
iron work enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how, and 
I also got, at several times, and in several plaoes, near one hondrefli 
i$«ight of sheet lead« 

June Id. Going down to the seaside, I found a large tortoise <» 
turtle. This was the first I had seen ; which, it seems was only my 
misfortune, not any defect of the place or scarcity ; for had I happen* 
ed to be on the other side of the island I might have had hundreds of 
them every day, as I found afterward ; but perhaps had paid dear 
enough for them. 

June 17. I spent in cooking ttie turtle. I found in her three soore 
eggs ; and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savory aadl 
pleasant that I over tasted in my life ; having had no flesh, but of goats 
Rnd fowls, since I landed in this horrid place. 

June 18. Rained all that day, and I stayed within. I thought, ai 
this time, the rain felt oold, and I was somewhat chilly ; which I 
knew was not unusual in that latitude. 

June 19. Very ill and shivering, as if the weathor had been cold. 
June 20. No rest all night ; violent pains in my head and feverish. 
June 21. "Very ill , frightened almost to death with the apprehen- • 
aena of my sad condition, to be sick and no help ; prayed to God, for 
^e first time since the storm off Hull ; but scaree knew what I said ot 
why, my thoughts being all confused. 

June 22. A little better, but under dreadful apprehension of sick* 
ness. 

June 23. Yery bad again ; cold and shivering and then a viole&i 
^•adache. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An ague very violent ; the fit held me seven hours — odd 
fit, and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. Better, and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but 
found myself very weak ; however, L killed a she-goat, and with muc*

Juna 27, The ague again eo violent that I lay a-bed all day, anJ 
neither ato nor drauli. 1 was ready to perish for thirst ; bat so weak, 
I had not strength to stand up, or t-o get myself any ■water to drink. 
Prayed to God again, but vras light-headed ; and when I was not, 1 
va« BO ignorant I knew not what to say ; only lay and cried, "Lord, 
look upon mel Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon ma!" I 
suppose I did nothing else for two or three hours ; till (he fit weariag 
fiS, 1 fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When 1 
awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding 
thirsty ; however, as I had no water in my whole habitation, I wa< 
forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In this second 
sleep I had this terrible dream : I thought that I wa» sitting on tha 
ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the jtorm blew 
after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black 
oloud, ki a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground ; he was all 
over as bright as a flume, eo that I could bat just bear to look toward 
him. His countenance was inexpressibly dreadful, impossible foi 
words to describe ; when he stepped upon the ground with his feet, 
I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earth« 
quake ; and oil the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had beeo 
filled with flashes of fire. He had no sooner landed upon the earth, 
but he moved forward toward me, with a long spear or weapon in his 
hand, to kill me ; and when he came to a rising ground, at soma 
distance, he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible that it is im« 
possible to express the terror of it. AU that I can say I understood 
I was this : " Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repent- 
ance, now thou shalt die," at which words, I thought ha lifted up th« 
spear that was in his hand, to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account, will expeet that I should 
be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible viaion ; I 
mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors : 
nor is it any more possible to describe the impression that remainaa 
upon my mind when I awaked, and found it was but a dream. 

I had, alas I no divine knowledge ; what I had received by th« 
good instruction of my father was then worn out, by an uniat6rrupte^< 
series, for eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant convet 
sation with none but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane t© 
iha last degree. I do not remember tliat I had, in all that time, ona 
Uxought that r/> much as tended either to lookxag upward towarti CIoq 



BOBINSON CRUSOE* VZ 

OS i&wa«S ^arneaS. a refle«tiou upon my own w&yo : bat a certain sin* 
^idity of saulf 'wilboat desire of good, or oonsciousueas of eyil, had en<> 
tirely ovarwlielrDed me ; and I was all that the most hardened, unthink- 
ing, wicked creature among our common sailors, can be supposed to be ; 
aot having the least sense, either of the fear of God, in the danger, or <rf 
(hankfalness to him, in deliverances. 

In the relating what is already a part of my story, this will be the 
more easily believed, when I shall add, that through all the variety of 
aaiseriea that had to this day befallen me, I never had bo muoh as ona 
thought of its being the hand of God, or that it was a just punishment 
for my sin ; either my rebellious behaviour against my father, or my 
present sins, which were great, or even as punishment for the general 
course of my wicked life. When I was on the desperate expedition on 
the desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what 
would become of me, or one wish to God to direct me, whither I should 
go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently surrounded me, 
as well from voracious ereatures as cruel savages ; but I was quite 
thoughtless of a God or a Providence ; acted like a mere brute, from 
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of common sense only, 
and indeed hardly that. When I was delivered and taken up at sea by 
the Portuguese captain, well used, and dealt with justly and honorably, 
•is well afi charitably, I had not the least thankfulness in my thoughts. 
When, again, I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning, 
on this island, I was far from remorse, qv looking on it as a judgme&t. 
I only said to myself often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to 
be always miserable. 

It is true, when I first got on shore here, and found all my flMp's 
«row drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of e©s- 
teoyt and some transports of soul, whidi, had the grace of God &3» 
sisted, might have come up to true thankfulness ; but it ended where 
it began, in a mere common flight of joy ; or, as I may say, being glatx 
I was alive, without the least reflection upon the distinguished good- 
ness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled me out to 
be preserved when all the rest were destroyed, or any inquiry why 
JE^rovidence had been thus merciful to me ; just th« sume common 
sort of joy which seamen generally have, after they are got safe 
aakore from a shipwreck ; which they drown all in th« next bowl of 
punch, and forget almost as soon as it is over— and all the rest of my 
life was lika it. Even when I was, afterward, on due consideration, 
made sensible of my condition — how I was cast on this dreadful 
jplM«, out of the reach of human kind, out of all hop* of relief, op

that 1 slwnld not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my 
affllotlen wore ofl^ and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the 
werka proper for my preservation and supply, and vrna far enough 
from being afflicted at my oondition, as a judgment from Heaven, or a« 
&• hand of God against me ; these were ^honghts which very seldom 
entered into my head. 

The growing np of the com, as Is l^ted in my Jotimal. haA, at 
Arst, some little influence upon me, and began to affect me with 
iKxiousness, as long as I thought it had something miracnlons in it ; 
^nt as soon as that part of the thong^^t was removed, all the impres- 
aion which was raised from it wore ofT aiso, as I have noted already. 
£vaB the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible in its 
saature, or moie immediately directinj; to the invisible Power, which 
alone directs such things, yet no sooner was the fright over, but the 
impression it made went off also. kad no more sense of God or 

hift judgments, much less of the preswat a£iction of my circumstances 
ftedng from His hand, than if I had been in the most probperous con- 
dition of life. But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisure view 
of the miseries of de-ath came to place itself before me ; when my 
spirits b^an to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and na< 
ture was exhausted with the violence of the fever ; conscience, thai 
had slept so long, began to awake ; and I reproached myself with my 
past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon wickedness, pro. 
Toked the justice of God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to 
deal with me in so vindictive a manner. These reflections oppresse4 
me for the second or third day of my distemper ; and, in the violencf 
as well of the fever aa of the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, 
extorted from me some words like praying to God ; though I cannot 
gay it was a prayer attended either with desires or with hopes ; it 
xras rather the voice of mere fright and distress. My thoughts wire 
confused; the convictions great upon my mind ; and the horror of 
lying in such a miserable condition, raised vapors in my head with 
the mere apprehension ; and, in these hurries of my soul, I knew nol 
what my tongue might express ; but it was rather exclamation, such 
as. ** Lord, what a miserable sinner am I • If I should be sick, I shall 
certainly die for want of help; and what will become of me?" 
Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say no more for a 
good while. In this interval, the good advice of my father came to 
my mind, tmd presently his prediction, which I mentioned at the be< 
ginning of this storj, viz.f that if I did take thi« foolish step, GK>d

vpon ha-rlng neglected his ootineel, when there might be none to assist 
in my recovery." "Now," said I, alond, •' my dear father's words are 
oome to pass : Gk>d's justice has OTertaksn me, and I have none to 
help or hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mer> 
cifnlly pnt me in a station of life wherein I might have been happy 
and easy ; but I would neither see it myself, nor learn from my pa« 
rents to know the blessing of it. I left them to mourn over my folly; 
askd now I am left to mourn under the consequences of it ; I refused 
their help and assistance, who would have pushed me In the world, 
and wculd have made everything easy to me ; and now I have HA- 
culties to struggle with, too great for even nature itself to support ; 
and no assistance, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried out, "Lord, 
be my help, for I am in graat distress." This was the first prayer, if 
I may so call it, that I had made for many years. But I retxma to mj 
jonmal.

fUKE 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I 
had had, and the fit being entirely off, I get up, and though 
the fright and terror of my dream was vary great, yet I oom- 
sidered that the fit of the ague would return again the next 
day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and support 
myself when I should be ill. The first thing I did was to fill a large 
square case bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of 
my bread, and to take off the chill or agueish disposition of the water 
I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them to- 
gether. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh and broiled it on 
the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about but was very 
•weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in the sense of my miser* 
able condition, dreading the return of my distemper the next day. 
At njght I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which 1 
roasted in the ashes and ale, as we call it, In the shell ; and this was 
the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, as I could re- 
member, in my whole life. After I had eaten I tried to walk, but 
found myself so weak that I eould hardly carry the gun (for I ner^

went out witLout that), so I went but a little way and sat uown Mf^ 
the ground, looking out upon the sea which was just before m^ and 
very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as thoo* 
occurred to me : What is this eaxth and sea, of which I have seen se 
much ? Whence is it produced : And what am I, and all the otbcr 
creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal ? Whence are we? 
Surely we are all made by some secret power, who formed the earth 
and sea, the air and sky ; and who is that ? Then it followed most 
naturally, it is Giod that has made all. Well, but then, it came on, if 
God has made all these things, he guides and governs them all and all 
things that concern them ; for the power that could make all things 
must certainly have power to guide and direct them ; if so, nothicj- 
can happen in the great circuit of his works, either without his know^ 
ledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without his kfiowledge, he knows that I &m 
here, and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens with- 
out his appointment, he has appointed all this to befall me. Nothing 
occurred to my thought to contradict any of these conclusions, and 
therefore it rested uDon me with the greatest force that it must needs 
be that God had appointed all this to befall me ; that I was brought 
to this miserable circumstance by His direction, He having the sola 
power, not of me only, but of everything that happens in the world. 
Immediately it followed : "Why has God done this to me ? What have 
I done to be thus used ?" My conscience presently checked me in thai 
inquiry, as if I had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me like a 
voice : " Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou hast done ? Look back upon 
a dreadful, misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done ? 
Ask why it ia thou wert not long ago destroyed? Why wert thou not 
drowned in Yarmouth Eoads ; killed in the fight when the ship 
was taken by the Sallee man-of-war ; devoured by the wild beasts oiv 
the coast of Africa ; or drowned here, when all the crew perished but 
thyself? Dost <Aou ask what thou hast done?" I was struck dumb 
with these reflections, &s o\.e astonished, and had not a word to say-i. 
no, not to answer to myself — and rising up, pensive and sad, walked 
back to my retreat, and went over my wall as if I had been going to 
bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclinatio» 
to sleep, so I sat down in the chair and lighted my lamp, for it began 
to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my distemp^ 
terrified me very much, it occiirred to my thought that the Srazlliana 
take no physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers, and I had 
a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of tho chests, which was quite cored, 
ftnd some, also, that was green, and not quite cturei. 



f «r<At, direoted by Heaven, no doubt, fbr !n thia dheal I to^&i a 
eare for both soul and bodj. I opened the chest and found whaft I 
tookad for, via., the tobaooo; and aa the few books I had saved l&y 
there too, I took out one of the bibles which I mentioned before, and 
vhioh, to this timo,I had not found leisure or so much as lnolinatix)a 
to look into. I say I took it out, and brought both that and the tobaooo 
with me to the table. What use to make of the tobacco I knew not 
m to my distemper, nor whether it was good for it or not, but I tried 
jw»veral experiments with it, as if I was resolved it should hit one way 
)r other. I first took a piece of the leaf and chewed it In my mout^ 
which indeed, at fii'st, almost stnpified my brain, the tobacco beLug 
green and strong, and such as I had not been much used to. Then I 
took some and steeped it em hour or two in some rum, and resolved to 
take a dose of it when I lay down ; and lastly, I burnt some upon a 
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke of it as long as I 
eoold bear it, as well for the heat as almost for sufTocation ^a th« 
interval of this operation I took up the bible and began to read, but 
my head was too much disturbed by the tobacco to bear reading, at 
least at that time ; only, having opened the book casually, the first 
words that occurred to me were these : " Gall on me in the day oi 
trouble and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify mo." These 
words were very ape to my case, and made some impression upon my 
thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much as ^ey <£d 
afterward; for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as I m*y 
say, to me ; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehen- 
eion of things, that, aa the children of Israel said, when they were 
promised flesh to eat, " Can God spread a table in the wilderness V 
BO I began to say, '-Can even God himse!J deliver me from this 
place T" And as it was not for many years that any hopes appeared 
fehifl prevailed very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words 
made a great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very often 
It now grew late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my hoad bo 
much that I inclined to sleep, so I lofl my lamp burning in the cave, 
leet I should want anything in the night, and went to bed ; but, be- 
fore I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my Ufa, I kne«!«d 
dowu and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me. After my bro 
ken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had 
steeped the tobaooo, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco thai 
indeed I ooold scarce get it down ; immediately upon this I went 6« 
bed. I found, presontly, the rum flew up into my head Tiolently, haA

MOMMril; b« near three o'olook in the aflernooc the nest iaj , daj 
le this boar, I am partly of opinion that I slept all the next day and 
Bight, and till almost three the day after ; for, otherwise, I know no^ 
how I should lose a day out of njy reckoning in the days of the weelE, 
M it appeared, some years after, I had done ; for, if 1 had lest it hj 
eroedng and re-oroasing the line, I should have lost more than ous 
day ^ but certainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which 
way. Be that, however, one way or toe other, when I awaked I foand 
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful. 
When I go« up I was stronger than I was the day before, and 
By stomach better, for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit 
the next day, but continued much altered for the better. This wae 
the 39th. 

The 30th was my wall day, of course ; and I went abroad with 
my gun, but did not care to travel too far. I kiliea a se* fowl or 
two, something like a brand goose, and brought them hoikte but 
wafl not very forward to eat them ; so I ate some more of the 
turtle'e eggs, which were very good. This evening I renewed the 
medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day before, vix., the 
tobacco steeped in rum ; only I did not take so much as before, no^ 
did I chew any of the leafj or hold my head over the smoke ; how- 
ever, I was not BO well the next day, which was the Ist of July, as 
I hoped I should have been ; for I had a little of the cold fit, bat 
It was not much. 

July S I renewed the medicine all the three ways ; and dosed 
myself vith it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank. 

July %. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recovei 
my fuLl strength for some weeks after. "VVTiile 1 was thus gathering 
strength, my thoughts ran exceedingly upon this Scripture, " I will 
deliver thoe ;" and the impossibility of my dolivenmce lay much upon 
luy mind, in bar of my ever expecting it : but as I was discouragiag 
liyself with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind that I pored so 
much npou my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded 
the deliverance I had received; and I wa^, as it wore, made to ask 
raysolf 6uch questions as these, viz., Uave I not been delivered, ard

Jidy 4. In tho morning I took the Bible : Ana beginning at tha 
Vew Testament, I began serionsly to read it ; and imposed npot* my 
self to read awhile every morning and every night; aot binding myscli 
to the number of chapters, bnt as long as my thoughts should engage 
me. It was not long after I set seriously to this work, that I found 
my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness of 
my past life. The impression of ray dream revived : and the words, 
" All these things have not brought thee to repentance," ran seriously 
in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of Gk)d to give me repent- 
ance, when it happened providentially, the very same day, that, read- 
ing the Scripture, I came to these words, " He is exalted a Prinoe 
and a Saviour, to give repentance and to give remission." I threw 
down the book ; and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to 
heftven, in a kind of ecstacy of joy, I cried out aloud, "Jesus, thou Son 
of David I Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour 1 give me repent- 
ance ! " This was the first time in all my life I could say, in the true 
sense of the words, that I prayed ; for now I prayed with a sense of 
my condition, and with a true scripture view of hope, founded on the 
enoouragement of the word of Qod ; and from this time I may say, ] 
r«gau to have hope that Grod would hear me. 

Kow I began to construe the words mentioned a^ove, "Call on 
me, and I will deliver thee," is a different sense from what I hod 
ever done before ; for then I had no notion of anything being called 
deliverance, but my being delivered from the captivity I was in ; for 
though I was at lai^e in the place, yet the island was certainly a 
prison to me, and that in the worst sense in the world. Biit now I 
learned to take it in another sense ; now I looked back upon my past 
life with Buoh horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that my 
soul sought nothing of God bat deliverance f^om the load of gnilt 
that bore down all my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was 
ncihing ; I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or thins 
of it ; it was all of no consideration, in comparison with this. And 1 
add this part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever 
they come to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance from 
sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from afliction. 

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as to my 
^-ay of living, yet much easier to my mind ; and my thoughts being 
directed, by constantly reading the Scripture and prayfng to God, to 
things of a higher nstnra. I had a gr««t d««l ol oomfort mthi^

■which, till now, I kno-w nothing of ; also as my health and strength 
returned, I bestirred me to furnish myself Mith everything that I 
wanted, and make my way of living as regular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in M'alk- 
ing about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as 
a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness ; for 
it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I 
was reduced. The applicat on which I made use of was perfectly 
new, and perhaps what had never cured an ague before ; neither can 
I recommend it to anyone to practise, by this experiment ; and 
though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken 
me ; for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for some 
time. I learned from it also this, in particular ; that being abroad in 
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that 
could be, especially in those rains which came attended with storms 
and hurricanes of wind ; for as the rain which came in the dry season 
was almost always accompanied with such storms,\so I found that this 
rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell in September 
and October. 

I had now been in this unhappy island above ten months. All 
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely 
taken from me ; and I firmly believed that no human shape had ever 
set foot upon that place. Having secured my habitation, as I thought, 
fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect dis- 
covery of the island, and to see what other productions I might find 
which I yet knew nothing of. 

It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular 
survey of the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I 
hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found after I came about two 
miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher; and that it was no more 
than a little brook of running water, very fresh and good; but this 
being the dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it, 
at least, not any stream. On the banks of this brook"! found many 
pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with 
grass; and on the rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds 
(where the water, as it might be sirpposed, never overflowed), I found a 
great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a very great and strong 
stalk; and there ware divers other plants, which I had no knowledge 
of, or understanding about, and that might, perhaps, have virtues of 
their own, which I could not find out. I searched for the cassava 
root, which the Indians, in all that climate, made their bread of; but 



soBirraoM cuusoa. 

S adeld &bl ndne. I saw largo plants of aloes^ bat did aot nBdew^aai 

&eB. I aaw eevoral sugar-canes, but wild ; and, for want of coltiTB* 
Soa, iisperfect. I contented myself with these discovsries for Ihii 
ttB^ ; and camo back, musing with myself what course I naight tak» 
to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which 
I should dificovor; bat could bring it to no coaolusion; for, in ahor^ 
I made bo Utile obeorvation while I was in the Brazils, that I ksi^if 
ittle of tha plants iu the field j at least, very litik that might Ber7» 
a.e to any purpose now in my distreas- 

The nezt day, the 16th, I went up me same way agaiii; and after 
goiog something farther than I had gone the day befbrSj I foiuid th« 
brook and the savannahs bsgin to cease, and the country became mor« 
woody than before. In this part I found different fruits; and partic- 
ularly I found melons upon the ground in gr^at abundance, and grap©« 
upon the trees ; the vinos, indeed, had spread over the trees, and tba 
olus:«ra of grapes were now just in their prime, very ripe and rich. 
This was a surpriaiug discovery, and I was exceedingly glad of them ; 
t^t I was warned by my esperionce to eat sparingly of them j rcmem- 
bering, that whae I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed 
••Teral of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing theia 
into fluxes and fevers. I found, however, an excellent use for those 
grapes ; and that was to cure or dry thorn in the run, and keep them 
M dried grapes or raisins are ke^t ; which I thouglkt would be (as in- 
deed they were) as wholesome jsi^^m agreeable to eat, irhen^no grapei

I spent all that evening tbore, and went not back to my habitation ; 
which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain ftom 
home. At night, I took my first contrivance, and got uv into a tree, 
where I sle^ well ; and the next morning proceeded on ciy discovery 
travelling aeai four miles jel might judge by the length of the vai.

iLOrih sides of me. At the end of ^s march I came to an opmiin|^ 
where the country seemed to desoead to the west ; and a little spring 
©f firesh water, which issued out ei the side of the hill by me, ran 
ibo other way, that is due east ; and the country appeared bo &eeb 
30 green, so ficurishing, everything being in a constant rerdure, o» 
d^uriah of spring, that it looked like a planted garden. I descended

BA least not then. However, the green liaieg ♦hat I gathered were no* 
soLly pleasant to eat, but very wholesome ; and I mixed their jnic9 
siiarward with water, which made it very wholeaome, and very eool 
snd refreshing. I found now I had bosiness enough, to gather and 
sarry borne ; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as 
limes and lemons, to furnien myself for the wet season, whiob I knew 
vraa approaching. In order to this, I gathered a great hsap of grapes 
in one plaoe, a lesser heap in another place ; and a great parcel of 
limes and lemons in another place ; and taking a few of each with 
Biej I travelled homeward ; and resolved to come again, ard bring a 
bfcg or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home. Accor- 
dingly, having spent three days in this Journey, I came home (bo I 
must now call my tent and my cave>; bet before I got thither, tha 
grapes were spoiled ; the richness of the /Vuits, and the weight of the 
juice, having broken and braised thdE£, they were good for little or 
Dothing : as to the limes, they were good., but I could bring only a 
few.

small bags to bring home my harvest ; bnt I was suprised, when 
aoming to my heap of grapna. which were eo rich and fine when I

dragged about, some here, xnme there, and abundance eaten and da- 
roured. B^ th.is I conolnded there were some wild creatures thor« 
abouts wli^ch had done this, but what they were I knew not. How- 
eTer, as I found there was no laying them np in heaps, and no caiTy* 
iiig tJiem away in a sack ; but that one way they would be destroyed 
aild the other way they would be crushed with their own weight ; I 
fcuok another course : I then gathered a large quantity of the prapss 
. Kid Vung them upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might 
i-\iro and dry in the sun ; and as for the hmee and lemons, 1 carri«<? . 
at! many back as I could well stand under. 

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great 
pP.easure the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the 
Bituution ; the seciiri^ from storms on that side ; the water and the 
wood , and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode 
in, which was by far the worst part of «he country. Upon the whole,

lids ^aght ran long b my head ;, and I was exoeediag fend of fl 
fi» scffio time, the pleasantneBS of the place temptang me ; but ithtn 
I oaaie to a nearer view of it, I conmdcred that I was now by the eesr 
aide, where it was at least poeeible that something might happ«& te 
^7 advantage, and bj the same ill-&te th»t brought mo hither, might 
bri&g some other OBhappj wretebee to the same place ; and though it 
was Bcaroe probable that anj such thing should ever happen^ yet tc 
aaelose myself amoag the hilLs a&d woods in the centre of the isla&d, 
was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an aJBfair not onlj 
ksprobable but impoaeible ; and that therefbro I ought not by any 
means to remove. However, I was so enamored of this place, that I 
■pent much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the 
moBth of July ; and though, upon second thoughts, 1 resolved, as 
above stated, not to remove, yet I built me a Utile kind of a bower, 
and surroui.d)d it at a distance with a strong fence, being a doable 
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled between with 
brushwood. Ilere I Ifiy very secure sometimes two or three nights 
together; always going over it with a ladder, as before; so that . 
fancied now I had my country anu my seaooast house. This work 
took me up till the beginning ot Angusi. 

I had but newly finished mj ^en^, and began to enjoy my labor, 
when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habifca- 
Kon ; for though I had made a tent like the other, wich a piece of sal? 
and sproad it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep atw 
&om storms, nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the nuai 
were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bowex, 
>&d began to enjoy myself. The 3d of August, I fuund the grapes I 
iaA hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were escellent good 
i%isiiui of the sun ; so I began to take them down from the trees , aad 
A was very happy that I did so, as the rains which followed wouli 
iaT« spoiled them, and I should have lost the beet part of my ¥rinter 
%d ; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. Nn eooa- 
•r had I taken them all down, and carried most of thorn homo to my 
tare, but it began to rain ; and from hence, which was the 14^ d 
AngTwt, it rained, more or less, every day till the middle of Octobflir , 
and sometimes so violently that I could not stir out of my cava for 
s«T«ral days. 

)a this season I was much eorprised with the inoreaae of my &mily 
I m4 be«a concerned for t&e io« of one of my eate, who ran awcy

ii!i,to taj astonishment, eho oame home with three kittone. Thie t$3» 
ths more etrauge to me, because, about the end of August, though 1 
had killed a wild cat. as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it 
wns quite a different kind from our European oats ; yet the young 
»%is were the same kind of house-brood as the old one, and both of 
gny oats being feraales, I thought it very strange. Bat from those thres 
f afterward came to be so pestered with cats that I was forced to 
kill them like vermin, or wild beastfl, and to driv« them from mj 
houso as much as possible. 

From the 14th of A »igU8t to the 26th, incessant rain, so th>it I coa«.t 
Dot stir, and was now very careful not to be much wot. In this con- 
finement I began to be straitened for food, but ventui'Isor out twioo. • 
3ne day killed a g'^'^t, and the last day, which was tho ii4th, found a 
vary large tortoise which was a treat to me. My food wiis now x-egn- 
tatod thug : I ate "^ bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the 
goafs flesh or of the turtle, broiled, for my dinner (for, to my great 
misfortune, I ha4 no vessel to boil or stew anything), and two or three 
of the turtle's eggs for my supper. 

During this wnlinement in my cover from the rain, I worked daily 
two or three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it 
»ix toward one side, till I oame to the outside of the hill, and made a 
door, or way out, which came beyond my fence, or wall, and so 
oame in and out this way. But I was not perfectly easy at lying so 
open, for, as I had managed myself before, I was in a perfoot onolo* 
Bure, whereas now I thought I lay exposed ; and yet I could not per. 
oeive that there was any living thing to fear, th<9 biggest oreatur« 
Ihat I bad as yet seen upon the island being a goat. 

September 30. I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of mj 
landing ; I cast up the notches of my post, and found I bad been oi 
bore three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemB 
foat, setting it apart for religious exercise^ prostrating mjself on th« 
groand with the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, 
acknowledging his righteous judgments upon me, and praying to hira 
to have mercy on me, through Jesus Christ ; and, having not taatod 
the loa«t refreshment for twelve hours, even till tho going down o£ 
the sun, I then ate a biscuit and a bunch of grapes and wont to bod

▼ents of my life, without continoing a daily memorandum of otiMI 
hinga 

The runy season and the dry season began now to appear regokf 
ib me, and I learned to divrie them, so as to provide for them aoooid* 
tegly ; but I bought all uy experience before I had it, and what I MB 
ii;oing to relate was one of the most discouraging experimeatB thftt I 
bad made at all. ^< 

I have mentioned that I had saved a few ears of barley and riM, 
which I had so surprisingly found sprung up, as I thought, of thesis 
■elves. I believe there w&re about thirty stalks of rise, and aboal 
twenty of barley, and now I thought it a proper time to sow it afUv 
the rains, the sun being in its southern positios, going from me ; ao- 
oordingly, I dug a piece of ground as well as I ^uld with my wooden 
ipade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain ; but as I wa« 
BDwing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not bow it 
all at first, because I did iiot know whdn was the proper time for it 
BO I sowed about two thirds of tho seed, leaving about a handful of : 
each ; and it was a great ccmfott for me, afterward, that I did 00, fiur; 
not one grain of what I sowed thia time came to anything, for the iry 
month following, and the earth having thus had no rain after the ie«i 
was sown, it had no moisture to assist its growth, and never came Uf 
at all till the wet seaaon had come again, and then it grew as if it hadl 
been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not grow, whioh 1 
easily imagined was from the drought, I sought for a moister pieoe of 
ground to tuako another trial in ; and I dug up a piece of grouai 
tear my new bower, and sowed tho rest of my seed in February, a 
little before the vernal equinox. This, having the rainy month* of 
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yiel4e4 
R very good crop ; but, having only a part of the Med left, aod not 
laring to bow all tiiat I had, I got but a small quantity at last) taj. 
ebole orop not amounting to above half a peck of each kind. Bal 
by this esperiment I was made master of my buflinesa, and knew 
esaetly when was the proper time to sow, and that I mi^t expod 
two seed times and two harvests every year. j

» rimt up the country to mj hewer, where, though I had not been fM 
aome oconths, yet I found all things just as I had left them. The 
«ire)e or double hedge that I had made was not only firm and entire, 
boi the stakes whiuli I had out out of eome trees that grew thereabottt 
were all shot out and grown with long branohea, as maoh as a willow 
^e usually shoots the first year after lopping its head, bat I ooold 
u>t tell what tree to call it that these stakes were out from. I was 
curprised, and yet very well pleased to see the young trees grow, and 
i pruned thorn, and led them to grow as much alike as I could ; and 
it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three 
fears ; so that, thouj^h the bodge made a circle of about twenty-fiTe 
yards in diameter, yet t\ie trees, for such I might now call them, soon 
covered it, and it tcis a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all 
the dry season. This n!.ade me resolve to out some more stakes, and 
make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle, round my wall (I meas 
that of my iir»t dwelling), whioh I did, and placing the trees or stake* 
m a double row, at about ei^ht yards' distance ft'om my first fanoe, 
they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitado*i, 
and afterward served for a defence also, as 1 shall ob««rve in iis 
order.

FOUND now that the seasons of the yew might generally b« 
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but inte 
the r;uny seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally 
thus: From the middle of February to the middle of AprU,

I tried many ways to make myself a baxket : but all the twigs I

WM a b^y, I used to take great delight in standing at a baakat 
■Baker's in the town where my fatlier lived, to see them make theii 
wioker-ware; and being, as boys visually arc, very oflBcious to help 
and a great observer of the manner how they worked those things, 
•nd sometimes lending a hand, I had by these U)eans full knowledge 
of U>e methods of it, to that 1 wanted nothin>^ but the materials , 
when it oame into my mind, that the twigs of tliat tree ti-om whenc« 
I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the sallows 
willows, and osiers, in England; and I resolved to try. Accord inglj 
tiie next day I went to my couutry-house, as I called it, and cutting 
some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I 
.""Owld desire ; whereupon I oame the next time prepared with 
hatohet to cat down a quantity, wbioL I soon Couud, for there wu 
plenty of them. These I set up to dry within my circle nr hedge , 
and when they ware fit for use, I curried them to my cav» and here, 
daring the next season, I employed myself in making, a» well as I 
•otild, several baskets ; both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any- 
thing as I had occaaon for. Though I did cot tiiiittb them very haud-

Having mastered this diflBculty, and employei a world of timg 
•Ittout it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two jthei 
vwoti. I had no vessel to hold anything that was liquid, except twe 
rutleta, which were almost full of rum ; and some glusn buttles, some 
of the common slm, and others (wnioo ^ere ease buttles) square, f^s^i

I ibnnd a oontriTmnoe for that too at last. I employed myeelf !i 
planting mj second row of stakes or piles, and also in tbis wicker 
working all the summer or dry geason ; when anothar bosiafios took 
■M up more time than it could be imagined I could spare. 

I mentioned before that I had a great innd to S03 the whole island i 
•nd that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to whrrj 1 had buiil 
■ly bower, and where I had an opening quite to the aea, on the otbe? 
«de of the island. I now resolved to travel quite pcross to the 8€ft» 
■here, on that side ; so taking my gun, a hatohct and my dog, and a 
burger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two bisouit-caken, 
•ltd a great bunch of raisins in my pooch, for n-j store, * began my 
journey. When I had paasod the vale where my bower stood, m 
•boTO, I came within view of the sea, to tho west; and it being a 
▼ery clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or continent 
1 oould "jot tell ; but it lay very high, extending from W. to W. S. W 
ftt a very great distance ; by my gv^c it could not be leas than fifteen 
or twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the vforld this might be, otherwise 
than that I knew it must be part of America ; and, as I ooncluded, by 
all my observations, must be near the Spanish dominions ; and per- 
hapa was all inhabited by savages, where, if I should have landed, 1 
had been in a worse condition than I was now. I therefore acqui* 
esced in the dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own 
and to believe ordered everything for the best; I say, I quieted my 
mind with this, and left off afflicting myself with fruitless wishes oi 
being there. Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I consider^ 
Ibatifthis land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time 
•r other, »ee some vessel pass or repass one way or otnor ; but if not 
'iMn it waa the savage coast between the Spanish country and th^ 
' Sraalls, whose inhabitants are indeed the worst of sar^iges. !br &aj 
are oannibals, or man-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour all 
haman beings that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations, walking very leisurely forward, I ibuo4 
IhSfl mde of the island, where I now was, much pleasanter than mlns ' 
the open or savannah fields sweetly adorned with fioworj and graam, 
and foil of very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots ; and falo

tiame very familiarly. But the accident that followed, though it be 
a trifle, will be very diverting in ita place. 

I was exceedingly amused with this journey. I found in the low 
grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes ; but they differed 
greatly from all the other kinds I had met with ; nor could I satiufy 
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had no need to ba 
venturous, for I had no want of food, and of that which was very 
good too, especially with three sorts, viz. : goats, pigeons, and turtle, 
or tortoise. With these, added to my grapes, Leadenhall-market 
eould not have furnished a table better tlmn I, in proportion to the 
company ; and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had 
groat cause for thankfulness ; as I was not driven to any extremities 
for food, but had rather plenty, even to dainties. 

I never travelled on this journey above two miles outright in a daj 
or thereabout ; but I took so many turns and returns to see what di*. 
ooveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place whsre 
I resolved to sit down for the night ; and then I either reposed mjB«li 
in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes, set upright iB 
the ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creatur© 
could come at me without waking me. 

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see that I had 
taken up my lot on the worst side of the island ; for here indeed tb4 
shore was covered with innumerable turtles ; whereas, on the oth«v 
side, I had found but three in a year and a half. Here was also tn 
infinite number of fowls of many kinds ; some of which I had seen, 
and some of which I had not seen before, and many of them very 
good meat j but such as I knew not the names of, ttoept thoae callod 
penguins. 

I eould have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my 
powder and shot ; and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I 
eould, which I could better feed on. But, though there wer« many 
goats here, more than on my side of the island, yet it was with muok 
more difficulty that I eould come near them ; the country being fia* 
and even, and they saw me much sooner than when I was upon ft 
hill. 

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine ; 
yet I had not the least inclination to remove ; for as I was flied ia 
my habitation, it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I 
was here to be as it ware upon a journey, and from home. How- 
ever, I travelled along the seashore toward the east, I suppose about 
twelve miles ; and then setting up a gre^ pole upon the shore for a

mark, I eoncladed I would go home again; and that the nazt journ^ 

I took should be on the other side of the island, eofit from my dwell- 
iug, auJ 80 round till I came to my post again: of which in its place. 
I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I eoald 
e;\sily keep iso much of the inland in my view, that I could not vuat 
uiy lirst dwelling by viewing the country : but I found ra]rself mi»- 
(aken; fur being oome about two or three miles, I found mjeelf 
descended into a very large valley, but eo eurroimded with hills, and 
those hills covered with wood, that I could not Bee which waa my 
way by any direction but that of the sun, nor even then, unless I 
knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the day. And 
it happened to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved haey 
for three or fou4* days while I waa in this valley ; and not being able 
to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortable, and at last was 
obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post, and come back the 
same way I went; and then by easy journeys I turned homeward, th« 
weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition* hateiiet, and 
'^ther things, very heavy. 




jv iL«Mms to his Cave— Hie Agricaltural Labon and SnooMb 

N this journey, my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upOB 
it : and running to take hold of it, I caught it, and saved 
it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home 
if I could ; f r I had often been muring whether it might not 
be possible to gel a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats 
which might supply me when my powder and shot would be all spent. 
I made a collar for tliis little creature, with a string which I had 
made of some rope-yarn, which I iilways carried about me ; I led him 
along, though with some diflSculty, till I came to my bower, and there 
I enclosed him and loft him ; for I was very impatient to bo at home^ 
from whence I had been ahsent above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfacti(m it was to me to eome into my 
old hu'ch, and lio dow;i in my hammock bed. This little wandering 
journey, williout a settled place of abode, had been so unpleaoant to 
me, tliat my own hou^o, as I callo-' it to myself, was a perfect settle- 
loent to me, compared to that; iu>a it rendered everything about ue 



B0BIN80N CRUeOR. Ill 

86 oomiortablo, that I resolved I would never go a great way from it 
ogaiu, while it should be luy lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale njysrlf after my 
long journey; during wliich, most of the time wiia takeu up in the 
weighty affiair of making a eage for my Poll, wlio now began to bo 
more domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted wilh nie. '1 bcu I 
began to think of the poor kid which I had penned witliin my litllo 
circle, and resolved to fetch it home, or give it some food ; accoidiu<;]y 
1 went, and found it where I left it (for indeed it could not get out), 
but was almost starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of 
trees, and branches of such shrubs aa I could find, and threw it over, 
and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away ; but it 
was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have lied it. for 
it followed me like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the creature 
became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that if was from that lime 
one of my domestics also, and would never leave me afterward. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox waa now come, and I 
kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, 
being the anniversary of my landing on the island ; having now been 
there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the 
first day I came thera I spent the whole day in humble and thank- 
ful acknowledgments for the many wonderful mercies which my 
solitary condition was attended with, and without which it might 
have been infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty 
thanks to God for having been jdeased to discover to me, than it was 
possible I might be more happy even in this solitary condition, than 
I should have been in the enjoyment of society, and in all the 
pleasures of the world; that be could fully make up to me the de- 
ficiencies of my solitary state, and the want of human society, by hie 
presence, and the communications of his grace to my ^oul: siipjiort- 
ing, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his providence 
here, and to hope for his eternal presence hereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy 
the life I now led was, with all its miserable ciroumstance*, than the 
wicked, cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days. 
And now I changed both my pnrrnws and my jnyp : my very desires 
altered, my afieetions changed their gusts, and my delights were 
perfectly new from what they were at my first coming, or indeed for 
the two years past. Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, 
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition 
would brea'k out upon me on a Baddenj aT-d rpy very heart ^^puld 



jlS ADTBMT0BB8 (W 

ik within bm, to thiiik of tho woods, the mcuntunt, th) deserts I wm 
bi; uid how I was a prisonor, looked up with the oternal bars and 
bolti of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without redemptioQ 
la the midst of the greatest composures of my mind, this wouW 
break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands and 
weep like a child. Sometimes it would take me in tho middle of my 
work, and I would immediately set down and eigh, and look upoa 
the ground for an hour or two together : this was still woras to me 
but if I could burst into tears, or give vent to my feelings by worda 
U would go off; and my grief being exhausted, would abate. 

Bui now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts ; I oaih^ 
r«ad the word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my 
present state One morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon 
these words, •! will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Ii». 
mediately it occurred that these words were to me • why else should 
they be directed in suich a manner, just at the momont when I was 
mourning over my condition, as one forsaken by God and man! 
* Well, then," said I, " if God does not forsake me, of what ill cou- 
seqaenoe can it be, or what matters it, though the world should for. 
sake me j seeing on the other hand, if I had all the world, and should 
lose the favor and blessing of God, there would be no comparison in 
the loss 7" 

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was 
posdble for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition, 
Huok it was probable I should ever have been in any otlier particular 
■late of the world ; and with this thought I was going to give thanks 
to Q*A for bringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but 
■omethinf hocked my nund at that thought, and I durst not speak 
Ike wordk ** How oa»8t thou be such a hypocrite," said I, OTen 
mdibly, ** to pre^nd to be thankful for a condition, which, however 
Ikou mayest endeavor to be contented with, thou wouldst rather praj 
hMrtily to be delivered from 7" Here I stopped ; but though I 
tonld not say I thanked God for being here, yet I sincerely gav9 
tkanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting provs- 
ienoes, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my 
wiokedBosfl, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my 
Tery sool within me blessed God for directing my friend in England 
wMiout any order of mine, to pack it up among my good* ; and fij* 
afl&rtlng me afterward to save it out of tho wreck of the ship. 

Tbtia, and in this disposition of mbd, I began my third ytsw ; ttnit 
llMnigh I hmj9 net ^ven the reader the troubU of mo |pMtic«^<>r m 



teeoaat of taj irorks tUs year as the first, yet in general it coay b< 
eboerred that I was Tory soldom idle ; but ha\'ing regularly divided 
«y time, according to the several daily employments that were before 
aae, such as, fhst, my duty to God, and the reading of the Scriptore^ 
^bdoh I coostantly set apart some time for thrice every day ; 6eooB4> 
f. going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took n-a ug 
.ii?«9 hours every morning, when it did not rain ; thirdly, orderiug^ 
ssriEg, preaerriag, and cooking what I had killed or catohed for stf 
supply. These took up great part of the day ; also, it is to be ooa?» 
sidorod that in the middle of the day, when the sun was iu the zenlthi 
tlie violence of the hciU was too great to stir out, so that about four 
tkours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in, 
with this exception, that sometimes I^fehangod my hours of bunting 
md working, and went to work iu the morning and abroad with mj 
gun in the atterncon. 

To this short time allowed for labor I desire may be added tho ex- 
ceeding laboriousnees Df my work, the many hours which, for want of 
tsools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of 
my time ; for example, I was full two-and-forty days making me & 
board for a long shelf, which I wanted in my cave, whereas two B»w- 
y^ers, with their tools and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out 
of the same tree in half a day. 

My case was this : it was a large tree that was to be cut down, be- 
cause my board was to be a broad one. This tree I was three days 
catting down, and two more in cutting off the boughs and reducing ii 
to a log, or piece of timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewin|[ 
( reduced both the sides of it into chips till it was light erough to 
Biore ; then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a 
board, from end to end ; then, turning that side downward, cut th« 
'rfther side till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, tuad 
smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labor of my hands ia 
SQcb a pioce of work, but labor and patience carried me through that 
Rsd maaj other thingq ; I only observe this, in particular, to show the 
reaeob why so much of my time went away with so little work, vix., 
that what might be a little to be done with help and tools, was a vasi 
iftbor, and required a prodigious time to do alone, and by haad. Noi- 
i^ithatandiag this, with patience and labor I went through many 
tidagfl, and. Indeed, eTerything .hat my ciroumstatioea mad« Beoes* 
aary for me to do, as will appear by what follows. 

I vaa now in the monthfl of Norember and Docomber, expeetisf

Hi As>imrfVKm m , 

for tiiem waa ncft great, fbr, as I obmrred, my M«d of aaoli WM M# 
aboTO the quantity of half a peck, having lost odb whole crop by sow 
ing In the dry eeason ; but now my crop promised very weU, when oa 
a Budden I foand I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of 
several sort), which it was scarce possible to keep from it ; as, firtti 
the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares, who, tastiag the 
svreetness of the blade, lay in it night and day as soon as it eame up 
and ate it so close that it could got no time to shoot up into stalk. 

I saw no remedy for this but by making an enclosure about it witt 
a hed^, which I did, with a great deal of toil, and the more beoanc* 
it required speed. However, as my arable land was bat smalls suited 
to my orop, I got it tolerably well fenced La about three weeks' time ; 
and, shooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to 
(uard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where Dt 
would stand and bark all night Ionic, 'o in * littlo time the enemifll 
forsook the place, and the com grew very strong and well, and begaa 
to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my oom was in the blad% 
•e the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the eai^ 
for going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little cronf 
tarrounded with fowls, I know not of how many sorts, who stood, M 
It were, watching till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among 
^hem (for I always had my gun with me) ; I had no soonor shet bat 
there rose np a little cloud of fowls, which I htA not seen at all, froM 
among the com itself 

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days ih»j 
would devour all my hopes, that I should be starved, and never be 
able to raise a crop at all, and what to do I could not tell ; howevefi 
I resolved not to lose my com, if possible, though I should watoh il 
'light and day. In the first place, 1 went among it to see what daiB> 
:^e was already done, and found they had spoiled a good deal of i^ 
l«t that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not so greal 
but that the remainder was likely to be a good orop, if It ooold b« 
Bared. 

I stayed by it to load my gun, and than eoming away, I could easily 
M9 the thievse sitting cf on Al the trees about me, as if they oaly 
wfcled till I was gone away, and the event proved it to be so, for ai I 
^ alked off, as if gone, I was no sooner out of their sight than they 
dropped down, one by one, into ^e «om again. 1 wae so provoked 
Hutu I eould not have patienoe to Nay fail m«re eame on, knowki 
ttet trery grtit tiMrf aU mow WM, «« It «i^ be said, a peek loaf «« 



£16 In the coB»equea;e, so coming op to Qi« bedge I fired ag«ia e.:- i 
kUhd throe of them. Iliis was what I wished foi', so 1 took thena up 
knd Bervad them as wo serve notorious thieves in England, viz., hangod 
;Lea) m chains, for terror to others. It is impossible to imagine tha* 
Uii« should have such an effect as it had, for the fowls not only neTor 
i^uuo to the com, but, m short, they forsook all that part of the iahuui^ 
ind 1 could never seo a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows 
htiag there. This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about ib* 
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the year, t 
reaped my com. 

I was sadly put tc it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I 
couli do was to make ce as well as I could out of ond tf the broad< 
swords or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship. 
However, as my fii-st crop was but small, 1 had no great difl5«nlty to 
out it down ; in short I reaped it my way, for I cut off nothing but 
the ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and 
BO rubbed it out with my hands ; and at the end of all my harvesting, 
I found that out of my half peck of seed I had near two bushels of 
rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley ; that is to say, by 
my guess, for I had no measure. 

However, this was groat encouragement to me, and I foresaw Ihat, 
In time, it would please God to supply me with bread ; and yet, here 
( was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind nor make mea* 
of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it j nor, if made into 
neal, how to make bread of it; and if ho* to make it, yet I knew not 
iv'w to bake it. These things being addea to my desire of having a 
jcod quantity for store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved 
act to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all for seed agAinst tha 
iest season, and, in the meantime, to employ all my study and boun 
f working to accomplish ihis great work of providing myself with 
40m and bread. 

It might be truly said, now I workad for my bread. It is a little 
ironderful, and what I believe few people have thought aauch upon, 
ifi«., the strange multitnd3 of little things necessary in the providing, 
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing this one article ol 
bread. 1, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found thi» te 
tLj daily disoouragement, and wa« made more sensible of it every 
hoar, even oiler I had got the first handful of seed-ooni, which, as I 
bare said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise. 

Tint, I had no plough to turn up the ear^ ; do spade or sboTel te

a great many days to make it, yet, for want of Iron, 
li DOt oaly wore out sooner, but made my work the harder, and per- 
formed it much worse. Ilowever, thia I bore with, and waa conteal 
to work it out with patiouce, and bear with the badness of the per- 
formance. When the com was sown, I had no harrow, but w&^ 
forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bow of a tree cvsc 
% to scratoh it, as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow ii 
^hsn it was growing and grown, I have observed already how many 
things I wanted to fence it^ secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry 
it homo, thrash, part it from the cha£^ and save it ; then I wanted a 
mill to grind it, sieves to dresa it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, 
and aa oven to bake it — and yet all these things I did without, as 
shall be observed ; and the corn was an inestimable comfort and ad- 
vantage to me ; all this, as I said, made everything laborious and 
tedious to me, but that there was no help for ; neither was my time 
BO much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it 
tR-as every day appointed to these works j and as I resolved to use 
one of the com for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I bad 
the nest six months to apply myself wholly, by labor and inventioa.

c-peratiJ>ns necessary for making corn fit for my us*.

UT now I was to prepare more land, for I had seed eD'.^a 
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did thia f ha^ 
a week's work at least, to make me a spade ; which who 
it was done, was but a sorry one, indeed, and very heavy 
and required double labor to work with it ; however, I went thrcn^ 
that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as nea? 
my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in witk 
a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which J 
had set before, and knew it would grow ; so that, in one year's tim«, 1 
knew I should have quick or living hedge, that would watt bal

abroad VVithm doors, that ia. when ik ndnso, and i ootiid ook go cut, 

I found employment on the followuig occasiona : always obeenrlag 
that while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my par- 
rot, !iud teaching hira lo ipeak ; and i quickly taught him to know 
his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud, Poll; whlob 
waa khe first word I ever heard spoken in the island by any moaih 
♦)at mj own. This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistan* to 
asy work ; for now, as I said, 1 had a great employment upon my 
hauds, as follows : I had long studied, by some means or other, te 
make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I vrauted much, bul 
knew not whore to come at them ; however, considering the heat o! 
the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any clay, I might 
botch up some such pot as might, being dried in the sim, be hard and 
strong enough to bear handling, and to hold anything that was dry 
and required to be kept so ; and as this was necessary in the prepa. 
ring com, meal, &c., which was tho thing I was upon, I resolved to 
biake some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jara, to hold 
what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tefl 
LiOw awkward ways 1 took to raise this pastil ; what odd, misshapeo^ 
ugly thinga I made ; how many of them fell in, and how manj fell 
out, tie clay not being stiff enough to bear its own weight; tow 
many cracked by the over violent heat of the sun, being set out too 
hastily; and how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well b*} 
W>re as aftor they were dried ; and, in a word, how, after haying U' 
b'^fed hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring H horn?, 
*ad work it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly things 
(X cannot call them jars) in atout two months' labor. 

However, as the sun bsiked these two very dry and hard, I lifted 
tiiem very gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker 
tttsketfl, which I had made on purpose for them, that they ncsg^ht not 
Ibsoftk ; and as between the pot and the basket there was a littla rooaa 
to spare, I stuffed it ftill of the rico and barley straw ; and these two 
pote being to stand always dry, I thought would hold my dry oora, 
ftnd perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised. 

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pot*, yet 1 
oa&de several smaller things with bettor success ; such as little roo&l 
pottf, fiat dishes, and pipkins, and anything my hand turned to ; tad 
the hfeat of the sun baked them very hard. 

Ba^ »11 this wculd not answer my end, which was to get an eartitei 
a«t «o hold liquids, and bear the fire, which &on« of ^eM «o«ld 48 



(k happened sobie aoM after, making a pretty targe fin. fbr oookicjj 
my meat when 1 weut to put it oat after I had dotte with it, I foea^ 
4 broken piece of one I'f my earthea^are vessels in the fco, burnt at 
:iard as a stone, and red as a tile. I ir%8 &gr usably surprised to tt»( 
t\ and said to myself, that certainly thej znij^ht be made to h'Uh 
«rkole, if they would burn broken. 

^b wt me to study how to order my fire, so as to mace it brrK 
Il9« poti. I had no notion of a kiln, suoh as the potters born in, o? 
9i glaaing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with : bat 
i placed throe large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon 
another, and placed my fire-wood all around it, with a great heap ot 
embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh fiiel round the out- 
ride, and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside ret hot quite 
tJiruugh, and observed that they did not orack at all , when I saw 
them clear red, I let them stand ir that heat about five or six hoora, 
till I found one of them (though it did not orack) did melt or run ; foit 
vbe sand which was mixed with the clay melted by the violenoe of the 
^eat, and would have run into glass, IT I had gone on ; so I slaked 
tny fire gradually, till the pots began to abate of the red color ; and 
matching them all night, that I might not let the fixe abate too fast, 
in the morning T had three very good, I will not say handsome, pip- 
kins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired ; 
amd one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand. 

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of earth 
enware for my use ; but I must needs say, as to the shapm of thezn, 
thoy were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, as I had no way 
ef making them but as the children make dirt pigs, or as a womai 
would make pies that never learned to raise paste. No joy at a thiaf 
of 91^ mean a nature was ever equal to mine, wha." t found I had madt 
M earthen pot that would bear the fire ; and I had hardly patienet 
to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the fire again, with 
oome water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well ; 
And with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth ; khongh I 
wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it es 
good as I would have had it been. 

My next concern was to get a stone mortar to stomp or beat soin(< 
com in it ; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving to thai 
|>erfection of art with one pair of hands. To supply this want I was 
M a great Ion ; for, of all trades in the world, I wan perfectly uaqiiai< 
UM for a stone cutter as for any whatever ; neither had I any tooli 
|« go about it with. I spent many a dftj to find oQt a great stone bif

tto^h to ont hoHow, and make it fit for a mortar , bat scold fiad 
BOBO at all, except what was in the solid rook, and wbtoh I had e« 
way to dig or cut ont ; nor indeed, were the rocka in the iHiand of saf 
fioient hardnefls, as they were all of a iandj orumbling stone, whiob 
would neither bear the weight of a heavy peatle, nor woold break the 
3<WTi without filling it with sand ; so, after a great deal of time lost ir 
searching for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a great 
block of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier ; and getting 
nne as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on 
tb« outside with my axe and hatohet ; and then, with the help of tlM 
fire, and influite labor, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians ic 
Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy peetle, or 
beater, of the wood, called iron-wood ; and this I prepared and laid 
by against I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself t« 
friiod. or rather pound, my com into meal, to make my bre»d. 

My next diiEculty was to make a sieve, or search, to dress mj nwa^ 
and to part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did ad 
see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most diflScult 
dung, even but to think on ; for I had nothing like the necessary thing 
to make it ; I mean fine thin canvas or stuff', to search the meal 
through. Here I was at a full stop for many months ; nor did I really 
know what to do ; linea I had none left, but what was mere rags ; I 
nad goat's hair, but neither knew how to weave it nor spin it ; an<} 
had I known how, here were no tools to work with ; all the remedy I 
found for this was, at last recollecting I had, among the seameir'e 
clothes, which were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico oi 
muslin ; with some pieces of these I made three small sievsa, propes 
enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for some years ; how ] 
did aftorward, I shall show in its place 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, anl bow I 
should make bread when I came to have cora ; for, first, I *d n- ^ 
yaast ; as to that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did no 
3oncem myself much about it ; but for an oven I was indeed puzzled 
At length I found out an expedient for that also ; whi :h was this ; 1 
made some earthen vessels, very broad, but not deep, that is to say, 
about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep ; these I 
burned in the fiire, as I had done the other, and laid them by ; aa3 
when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, which I 
hod paved with some square tiles of my own making and burning 
•bo ; but I should not call them square. When the firewood wa£ 
b«r«ed into embersi, or live coals, I drew tfcem finrward ap«>« the

liMkrtb, eo &s to corer it all over, ana there let them lie till the he&rtli 
wasteryhot; thea sweeping away ail the embers, I set dowQ m.f 
lo&^ or loaves, and ooveriug thorn with the earthen pot, drew th« 
embers all around the outside of the pot, to keep in and add ti tha 
heat j and thus, as well as in the best ovon iu the world, I baked my 
barley loaves, and became, in a little time, a good pastry-cook iato th« 
bargoia ; for I made myself several cakes and puddinge of the rise 
^at made no pies, as I had nothmg to put into them ez«ept the fiecii 
Gf fowls or goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up most par* 
of the third year of my abode here ; for, it is to be observed, in the 
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to 
manage ; I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well 
as I oould, and laid it up in the ear, in my lai'go baskets, till 1 had 
time to rub it out ; for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to 
thrash it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to 
build my barns bigger ; 1 waaited a place to lay it up in ; for the in- 
crease of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley 
about twenty bushels, and of rice as much or more, insomuch that 
now I resolved to begin K use it freely j for my bread had been quite 
gone a great while ; I resolved, also to see what quantity would bo 
saSoioDt for me a whole year and to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley utd rio« 
were much more than I could consume in a year ; so I resolved to 
low just the same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hcpet 
&at saeh a quantity would fully provide me with bread, &o.

ROBINSON GRU80E. ' 121 

But all thk while I made no allowance for the dangers of euct a 
condition, and that I might fall into the hands of savages, and per- 
haps such as I might have reason to think far worse than tho lion*' 
and tigers of Africa; that if I once came into their power, I should 
run a hazard of more than a thousand to one of being killed, and per- 
haps of being eaten ; for I had heard that the people of the Carribe- 
an coast were cannibals, or man-eaters ; and I knew, by the latitude, 
that I could not be far off from that shore ; then supposing they were 
not cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as they had many Europe- 
ans who had fallen into their hands, even when they have been ton or 
twenty together; much more I, Avho waabut one, and could make little 
or no defence : all these things, I say, which I ought to have consid- 
ered well of^ and did cast up in my thoughts afterward, took up none 
of my apprehensions at first; yet my head ran mightily upon the 
thought of getting over to the shore. 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoul- 
der-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the 
coast of Africa ; but this was in vain ; then I thought I would go and 
look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the 
shore a great way, in the storm, when we were first cast away. She 
lay nearly where she did at first, but not quite ; having turned, by the 
force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom upward, against a 
high ridge of beachy rough sand ; but no water about her, as before. 
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched her into 
the water, the boat would have done very well, and I might bavi- 
gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough ; but I might havt 
foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her 
bottom, than I could remove the island ; however, I went to the woods 
and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving t* 
tiy what I could do ; suggesting to myself, that if I could but tnra. 
her down, and repair the damag« she had received, she would be a 
very good boat, and I might venbjre to sea in her. 

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, 
I think, three or four weeks about It : at last, finding it imposeiblo to 
heave her up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, 
to undermine her, and so as to rmke her fall down, setting pieces of 
wood to thrust and guide her right in the fall. But when I had 
^ae this, I was unable to stir l»r op again, or to get under hot, 
ntonsk less to mevb hev forwat^ toward the water ; so I was foyc«d 
to give ft over : and yet, though I gave over the hope of the boat, my 
desire to venture over the main increased, ratiher than ^ispiishsd, as 
the m«fl»v« ^^"^ it seemed imposfi&Wft» 



Itt ADVENTURES 0? 

At leagth I began to think whether it ^as not poedble to fnak9 
aajeelf a eaooe, or periagua, such as the natives of these climatea 
make, eveu •without tools, or, as I might Bay, without bands, of the 
*uqk of a great tree. This I not only thought possible, but eaay, and 
pleased myvelf extremely with the idea of making xt, and with my 
having much more convenience for it than any of the Negroes or 
Indians ; bu* not at all considering the particular inconveniencea 
which I lay under more than the Indians did, viz., the want of hands 
tv move it into the water when it was made, a difficulty much harder 
for me to Bunnount than all the consequences of want of tools could 
be to them : for what could it all avail me, i^ after I had chosen my 
tree, and with much trouble cut it down, and might be able with mj 
tools to hew and dub the outside into the proper shape of a boat, and 
burn or cut the inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it— 
if^ after all this, I must leave it just where I found it, and was not 
able to launch it into the water ? 

One would imagine, if I had the least reflection upon my mind of 
my circumstances while I was making this boat, I should have im- 
mediately thought how I was to get it into the sea ; but my thoughts 
were bo intent upon my voyage in it, that I never once considered 
how I should got it off the land ; and it was really, in its own nature, 
more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than tha 
forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man 
did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with tha 
design, without determining whether I was able to undertake it; not 
but that the difficulty of launching my boat came often in my head j 
but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it, by this foolish answer-. 
" Let us first make it ; I warsant I will find some way or other to ge^ 
it along when it is done." 

This was a most preposterous method ; but the eagerness of try 
fancy prevailed, and to work I went. I felled a cedar tre", <>;u(5 f 
question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for thb building 
of the Temple at Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inche* diameter at 
the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven incnes diameter 
at the end of twenty-two feet, where it lessened and then parted into 
branches. It was iiot without infinite labor that I felled this tree : I 
was twenty days backing and hewing at the bottom, and fourteen 
more getting the branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head of 
it, cot off*, after this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a 
proportion, an4 to something like the bottom of a boat, that It mighl

8Tnm upright as it ought to do. It cost mo near tlirea months more 
to clear tho inside, and -work it out 60 as to make au exact boat uf it . 
this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet Bud chisel, and by 
tlio dint of hard labor, till I had brought it to be a very handsome 
pc-riagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and 
couaequently big enough to have carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted 
with it. The boat waa really much bigger than over I saw a canoe 
or a periagua that was made of one tree, iu my life. Many a weary 
stroke it had cost, you may be sure ; and there remained nothing but 
to get it into tlie water; which, had I accomplished, I make no 
question but 1 should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most 
Txnlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me ; though they 
eost me inexpressible labor too. It lay about one hundred yards 
from the water, and not more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was 
up hill toward the creek. Well, to take away tliis discouragement, 
I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so make a do» 
clivity ; this I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but 
who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view ?) When this 
was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was still much 
the same, for I cculd no more Ftir the canoe than I could the other 
boat. Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut 
a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I -could 
not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this workj 
and when I began to enter upon, and calculate how deep it was to be 
c'.ug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I found by 
the number of hands I had, having none but my own, that it must 
have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone through 
with it ; for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have 
been at least twenty feet deep ; this attempt, though with great re- 
luctancy, I was at length obliged to give over also. 

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late, the 
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we 
judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this work. I finished my fourth year in this place, 
and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much 
eomfoi-t as })efore ; tor, by a constant study and serious application 
to the word of God, and by the assistance of his grace. I gained a 
different knowledge fi-om what I had before ; I entertained different 
botions of thiu£;s ; I looked upon the world as a thiqg remote, wiai«lt 



Hi ADVEKTURES 0^ 

I had uothiug to do with, no expectation from, and, ii\dcad, no (Jeslrcs 
about ; in a word, I had nothing to do with it, nor was ever likely to 
have ; I thought it looked as we may perhaps look upon it heit:ali(ji-, 
viz., as a pl&ce I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well 
might I say, ae Father Abraham to Dives, " Between inQ and 'JhoQ ia 
a great galf fixed." 

In tho first place, I was here removed from all the wickedness of 
the vforld ; I had neither the lust of the flesh, tho lust of the eye, nor 
the pride of life. I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was 
now capable of enjoying ; I was lord of the Avhole manor ; or if I 
pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the whole country 
which I had possession of; there were no rivals ; I had no competitor, 
none to dispute sovereignty or command with me : I might have 
raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had no use for it : so I let as littU 
grow as I thought enough for my occasion. I hiid tortoiso or turtle 
enough, but now and then one was as much as I could put tD any 
use. I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; and I had 
grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to 
have loaded that fleet when it had been built. 

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable ; 1 had ©nougk 
to ©at And supply my wants, and what was the rest to me J If I killed 
more flesh than I could eat the dog must eat it, or vermin ; if I sowed 
more corn than 1 could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I out 
down were lying to rot on the ground ; I could make no use of them 
than for fuel, and that I had no other occasion for but to dress my 
food. 

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upoa 
just reflection, that all the good things of this woi-ld are of no further 
good to us than for our use, and that whatever we may heap up ta 
give others, we enjoy only as much as we can use, and no more. Th^ 
most covetous griping miser in the world would have been cured of 
the vice of covstousness, if he had been in my case, for I possessed in. 
finitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no room for dc 
sire, except it was for things which I had not, and they were compar. 
fttively bat trifles, though iudeod of great use to me. I had, as i 
fciated before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty. 
iia pounds sterling. Ala.s ! there the nasty, sorry, useless stuff lay ; T 
had no manner of business for it, and I often thought within myself 
tliat I would have given a handflil of it for a gross of tobacco plpe^ 
or foi- a hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay, I would have given it all 
fer (I sixpenny worth pf tufuip aad carrot seed from Epglaad, or for 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125" 

a handful of peas and beans and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had 
not the leasfc advantage by it, or benefit from it, but there it lay in a 
drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet sea- 
sons ; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the 
same case; they would have been of no maaner of value to me, bo- 
«aase of no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much more comfortable iri 
Hself than it was at first, and muah easier to my mind as well as feo 
Biy body. I frequently sat do^m to meat with thankfulness, and ad- 
mired the hand of God's provideno«, which had thus spread my cable 
in iho wilderness, I learned to look more upon the bright side of my 
coadition, aad lo^ upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed 
father than what I wanted ; and tiiis gave me, sometimes, such s^r^ 
eojnfbrts that I cannot oxpre&a theaa, and which I take notice of here, 
to put these discontented people in mind of it who cannot enjoy com« 
fortably what God has given them, because they see and covet some- 
thing that he has not given them. All our discontents about what we 
want appeared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness for what 
we have. 

Another reflection was of great us© to me, and doubtless would be 
so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this 
was, to compare my present condition with what I at first expected it 
would be, nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good 
providence of God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to bo cast up 
near the shore, where I not only oouid come at her, but oould bring 
what I got out of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort ; without 
wMoh, I wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpow- 
der and shot for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to my- 
selfi in the most lively colors, how I must have acted if I had got 
nothing out of the ship. I could not have go much as got any food, 
except fish and turtles, and that, as it was long before I found aqj- of 
thfiBQ, I must have perished ; that I shoiAl have lived, if I had not 
perished, like a mere savage ; that if I hajftjilled a goat or a fowl, by 
any contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh from 
the dun and the bowels, or to cut it up, but must gnaw it with my 
teeth and pull it with my claws, like a beast. 

These refleotions made me very sensible of the goodness of Provi- 
d€nce to me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all ita 
hardships and misfortunes. And this part, also, I cannot but recom- 
mend to the reflection of those who ai-o apt, in their misery, to say, 



125 ACTENtURM <» " ^ t 

* Is any affliction like mine V Let thwn consider bow mudi won* 
the cases of some people are, and their case might have been, if Provi- 
dence had thought fit, 

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind 
Irith hopes, and this was, comparing my present condition with what 
I had deserved, and had, therefore, reason to expect from the hand of 
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the 
knowledge and fear of God. I had been well instructed bj my father 
and mother; neither had they been wanting to me in their endeavors 
to infuse an early religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my 
duty, and what the nature and end of my being required of me. But, 
alas! falling early into the seafaring life, which of all lives is the most 
destitute of the fear of God, though his terrors are always before 
them ; I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring 
company, all that little sense of religion which I had entertained was 
laughed out of me by xny messmates, by a hardened despising of dan- 
gers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me ; by my long 
absence from all manner of opportunities to converse with anything 
but what was like myself, or to hear anything that was good, or tend- 
ing toward it. 

So void was I of everything that was good, or of the least sense of 
what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed 
(such as my escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the Portuguese 
master of a ship, my being planted so well in the Brazils, my receiv- 
ing the cargo from England, and the like), I never had once the words 
"thank God!" so much as on my mind or in my mouth; nor in the 
greatest distress had I so much as a thought to pray to him, or so 
mach as to say " Lord, have mercy upon me !" No, nor to mention 
the name of God, unless it was to swear by and blaspheme it. 

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I hav» 
already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life pas^ 
and when I looked about me and considered what particular provi- 
dences had attended me since my coming into this place, and how 
God had dealt bountifully with me — had not only punished me less 
than my iniquity had deserved, but had so plentifully provided for 
me; this gave me groat hopes that my repentance was accepted, and 
that God had yet mercies in store for me. 

"With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a resigna, 
tioB to the will of God in the present disposition of my cireumstances, 
bat even to a sincere thankfulness for my condition, and that I, wb» 
ITM j«t a living man, ought not to complain, eesing I bad not the da#

I might feed on to my hurt ; no eavagca to murder and devour me. lo 
* word, as my life waf a life of sorrow one way, so it was a life ol 
mercy another, and I wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort bat 
to mak« myself sensible of God's goodness to mo. and oare over me in 
this condition ; and after I did make a just improvement of theia 
things I weLi away, and was no more sad. 

/ had now he'.T h^rfo so long that many things which I brooght oo 
shore for my help were either quite gone or very much wasted, and 
bear spent. 

My ink, as I obberved, hnd been gone for some tiaoe, all bat a very 
little, which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so 
pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper. As long 
as it lasted I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on 
which any remarkable tinng happened to me ; and, firet, by casting 
ap times past, I remember that there was a strange ooncurrenoe of 
'lays in the various providences which befell me, and which, if I had 
b'jen snpei vtitiously inclined to observe days as fata] or fortunate, 1 
eight hav(. had reascw to have looked upon with a great deiU of ««•

JaNNOT my that after this, for fi>« years, any extrat>r<£a 
ary thing happened to me, but I lired on in the samf 
ouarse, in the aame posture and place, just as before ; tbtf 
chief things I was employed in, besides mj yearly lab^r oi 
l^nting ^y barley and rice, and caring my raisins, of both whidi .1 
alwa^ kept up just enough to hare sufficient stock of one year's pro 
Ti«os beforehand ; I say, besides this yearly labor, and my daily par 
suit of going out with my gun, I had one labor, to make me a canoe, 
which at last I finished ; bo that by digging a oanal to it of six feci 
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a 
mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I made it withot>l 
considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to 
launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water, or bring the 
Water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as a menioraDdoia 
Id teach mo to be wiser the next time ; indeed, the next time, though 
I oould not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I ooold 
Bot get the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, neai 
half a mile, yet ae I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it 
•)7er ; and though I was near two years about it, yet I nerer grudged 
ny labor, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last. 

However, though my little periagua was finisbod, yet the size of A 
nsts not at all answerable to the design which I had in view whes I 
jaade the first; I mean of venturing over to the terra firma, wher« U 
was above forty miles broad ; accordingly, the smallness of my b; al 
sunisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought no more ol 
h. As I had a boat, my next design was to make a cruise round the 
bUkod ; for as I had been on the other side in one place, crossing, m 
i have already described it, over the land, so the discoveries I mitii« 
B that little journey made me very eager to see other parts of th* 
eoast ; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing touM 
Uw iriand. 

For this purpose, &at I might do everything with diseretioo and 
eooaideratioii, I fitted op a little inast in my boat, and made a sail to 
it ottt of some of the pieces of the ship's sails which \%j in stOEe, and

si Mrhicl. I had a great stock by me. Haring fitted my mast aad (nil 
vad tried the boat, I found she weald sail very well ; then I tnadi 
Utile lockers, or boxes, at each end of my boat, to put proTisioas d» 
de«tiarief), amniunitioQ, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from raia o» 
Vhe spray of the sea ; and a little long hollow place I out in the inaii« 
of the boat, whore I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang do^ii 
Pver it, to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a must, to stand 
5Ter my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning 
Kud thus CTcry now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, bat 
iMTSr went far out, nor far from the little oroek. At last, being eagei 
te view the cireumf^rence of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my 
eruise ; and accordingly, I victualed my ship for the voyage, putting 
in two dosen of loaves (oakos I should rather call them) of barley 
bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice (a food I ate a great deal 
of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for kilt 
isg more, and two large watch coats, of those which, as I mentiened 
before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I took, one to 
lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night 

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign, or ray 
eaptivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, and I found 
it much longer than I expected ; for though the island itself was not 
?ery large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great 
ledge of rocks lie about two leagues into the sea, some above wateri 
iome under it ; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry. half i 
league more, so that I was obliged to go a great way out tc aea to 
doable the point. 

When first I discovered them, 1 was going to give over my enterprioi^ 
ftnd 9ome back again, not knowing how for it might oblige me te) poi 
QBt tu sea, and above all, doubting how I should get back ag^in ; ■> 
( came to an anchor ; for I had made me a kind of anchor with fe 
^aee of a broken grappling which I got out of the ship. 

Haying secured my boat, I took my gun and went on etaorr^ oltSBft* 
b^ up on a hill, which seemed to overlook that point where I kw &» 
fall extent of it, and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I peroeired a 
•troag, and, indeed, a most furious current, which ran to the east, and 
eroi oame close to the point ; and I took the more notice of it, bo- 
oaase I saw there might be some danger that, when I same into it, I 
aiight be carried ou4 to sea by the strength of it, and not be able tt 
3us^e tbe ieiaod again ; and- indeed, had I not got first ^poa thli bUi,

I lay here, hoTrover, two day?, because the wind blowing pretty 
Vi^x at E. S. E., and that being just contrary to the nid current, oaada 

great breach of the sea upon the point; bo that it waa not safe fot 
saa to keep too cIobo to the shore, for the bKeocl^; nor to g o too &r cS 
because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated OTer ni|^, 
Lka sea was calm, and I ventured ; but I am a warciBg-pieco agun t» 
ell T&sh and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner waa 1 oodm to t&e poi&t. 
when I was not even my boaVs length from the shore, but I found ay- 
wlf in a great depth of water, and a current like the aliiic© of aoull; 
it carried my boat along with it with such violence, that all I coald 
do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it; but I foaad it 
hurried me further and furtlier out from the eddy, which was oa ray 
left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do 
with my paddies signified nothing ; and now I began to give myself 
over for lost ; for as the curi^ent was on both sides of the island, I 
knew in a few leagues' distance they must join again, and then I waa 
irrecoverably gone ; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; se 
that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by tho sea, for 
that waa calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I had, indeed, 
foond a tortoise on the shore, as big, almost, as I could lifl, and had toai' 
ed it into the boat ; and I had a great jar of frosh water, that is to say 
oa«$ of my earthen pots ; but what was all this to being driven into 
%» vast ocean, where, tc be sure, there wa« no shore, no main land or 
^Aod, for a thousand leagues at least T 

Add now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to mak« 
9ren the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked 
back apon my desolate, solitary island es the most pleasant place in 
^0 world ; and all tho happiness my heart could wish for was to be 
there again. I stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes : * 
happy dcaert!" said 1, " I ehall never see thee mora. miaorable 
ereatur*! whither am I going!" Then I rcp:oached myself with my 
Qctbankful temper, and how I had repined at my solitary oondition , 
a£.Ct Qow what Mould 1 give to be on shore there again! Thus wc

SOBINSOM 0KU80K. tSI 

■f ft. Ik is scarce possible to imagine the oom^mfttioa I «/w now istj 
Iwfatg driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared te me now ts 
be) into the wide ooean, almost two leagues, and in the oiuiost despak 
of ever recovering it a^gain. However, I worked hard, all icdesdmy 
•length was almost exhausted, and kept my boat tta much to tLa 
Borthward, that is, toward the side of the curreni which the eddy 
lay on, as possibly I oould ; when about noon, as the sun passea toe 
meridian, I thought I f«U a little breeze of vrind in my face, springi^ 
op from S. S. E. This ohfsred my heart a little, Knd especially whea 
in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this 
time I got a frightful distance &om the island, and had the Isast 
eloiidy or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way 
too ; for I had no compass on board, and should never have ttnowa 
how to have steered toward the island, H I had but once lost saght 
of it ; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to gel tip 
my mast again, and spread my sail, stending away to the north M 
much as possible, to get out of the current 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to streldi 
away, I saw, even by the clearnese of the water some alteratisa of 
the current was near ; for where the current was so strong, the w&tn 
was foul; but perceiving the water dear, I foimd the oarreat abate , 
and presently I found to the eact, ask about half a mile, a breaeh of 
the sea upon* some rooks; these rocks, I found, caused the ourrent to 
part again, and as the main stress of it ran away more sontharly, 
leaving A0 y^As to th^ northeast, so the other returned by the repnim 
•f 4fe« Toeks, and rnnde M Strong eddy, which ran bacik again to tb« 
Borthwcst, with a v&ry sharp stream. 

lliey who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upcsa 
^e ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them 
or who have been in such-like extremities, may guess what my pres 
ont surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my boat into the etreassa 
s£ this eddy ; and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread mj 
sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide 
V eddy under foot 

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back agaia & 
reotly toward the island, but about two leagues more to the oortii 
«ard thao the current which carried me away at first; so that wb«a 
I same near the island, I focnd myself open to the northern shore ot 
H^ tfaak is to say, the other end of the island, opposato to that wMob 
I vsnt ont flrom. 

Vhm I bad ixiad« mmi^Htrng aotte than a leagoo of vaf, hg itm 



Mp of thii oarreQt or eddy, I found it waa speut, &d4 *ai,fra«. mm t^o 
fturth«r. However, I found that being betvv bcg two ^qhX curreate 
rix., tbjit (.D the Bouth side, which had hurried me away, and that or 
the north, which lay about a league on the other &i«e ; I Bay, letweea 
these two, in the wake of the island, I found the water at le&st etiU 
and running no way ; and having Btill a breeze ol: wind fair to me, I 
kept Ob steering directly for the island, though ao\ making scch free& 
way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of 
the islaod, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disae- 
t9r stretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and cast* 
icg off the current more southerly, had, cf course, made another eddy 
%o the north ; and this I found very stroir^;, but not directly setting 
the way my course lay, which was due vest, but almost full n')rtlL 
However, having a fresh gale, I stretchv;d across this eddy, slanting 
northwest ; and, in about an hour, came within about a mile of thf 
shore, where, it being smooth, I soon gOb to land. 

When I was on shore, 1 fall on my k«?es, and gave God thanka for 
my deliverance, resolving to lay aside arJ thoughts of my dehverance 
Dy my boat; and refreshing myself *ith such things as I had, I 
brought My boat close to the thoro, ^« a little cove that I had spied 
under some trees, and laid ma doww ^ sleep, being quite spent with 
the labor and fatigue of the voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which </A,y to get home with my boat : I 
had run so much hazard, and knew too much of Oki case, to thia oi 
attempting it by the way I went out ; and whut ^ i'.ght bo at th# oth^7 
aide (I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had \ any mind to ru.^ any 
more ventures; so I only resolved in the mov/Jig to make my y'sy 
westward along the shore, and see if there A^as no creek wherv \ 
Eaight lay up my fHgate in safety, so as to ha'«e her again, if I wantt, \ 
her. In about three miles, or thereabout, ccisting the shore, I camt 
bo a very good inlet or bay, about a mile ovi r, which narrowed till $1 
Mme to a very little rivulet or brook, wLore I found a very oon- 
veolent harbor for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a 
little dock made on purpose for her. H>re I put in, and having 
•towed my boat very safe. . went on shoi x to lock about me. and M^

royage &» I had been upon, and I reached my old bi^WM in th« eTflS' 
log, where I found everything standing as I had left it ; for I alwftji 
kept it in good order, being, as I said before, my country honte. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my 
[insbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge you, if you oaa 
fcibftt read my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I was awaked 
9nt of my sleep by a voice, calling me by my name several timet 
** Robin, Robin, Pobin Crusoe — poor Robin Crusoe ! Where are yon, 
Robin Crusoe ? — where are you ? Whei-e have you been V 

I was so dead asleep at fir^t, being fatigued with rowing, or ptd< 
iUing, 06 it is called, the first part of the day, and with walking the 
latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly ; but dozing between 
■ileeping and waking, thought I di'eamed that somebody spoke to me; 
but 8B the voice continued to repeat "Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe," 
at last I began to awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully 
frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation ; but no sooner 
were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge^ 
and immediately knew that it was he that spoke to me ; for just in 
such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and teach him 
and he had learned it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger 
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe, 
where are you 7 — where have you been T How oame you here t" and 
such things as I had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was a parrot, and that indeed it 
oould be nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose my- 
self First, I was amazed how the creature got thither ; and then how 
ae should just keep about the place, and nowhere else ; but as I was 
well satisfied it could bo nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and, 
kolding out my hand, and calling him by his name, Poll, the sociable 
Sreature came to me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and 
«r tinued talking to me " Poor Robin Crusoe !" and how did I oome 
her« 7 aiiU \;here had I been 7 just as if he had boon overjoyed to ■•• 
me again ; and so I carried him home along with me. 

1 now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enovgk 
to do for many days to sit still, and to reflect upon the danger I had 
been in. I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on 
My side of the island ; but I knew not how it was practicable to get 
it about. As to the east side of the island, whiob I had gone roand, 
I knew woU tjnough there was no venturing that way ; my rwy 
heart wnuld shrink, and my very blood run chill, bat to think of it; 
and ae to <^he o^er side of the island, I did not know how it might b«

fc«r» i but BUpponng the eurront ran with the same foree afainsk dM 
Bbore at the eaet as it passed by it on the other, I might rna the BsaoM 
risk of being driven down the Htream, and carried bj the idaud, aa 1 
had been before of being carried away from it; so, with thaet 
thoughts, I contented myeelf to be without any boat, though it h»A 
been the product of eo many moaths' labor to make it, and of bo many 
Bore to get it into the sea. 

In this government of my temper I remained near a year, lived t 
wry sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose ; and my thoughta 
}:Ang very much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted 
in resigning myeelf to the dispositions of Providence, I thought 1 
lived really happily in all things except that of society. 

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which 
my necessities put me upon applying myself to ; and I beli«ve I 
eoold upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, espeoially 
oonaidering how few tools I had. 

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthen 
ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, whick 
I found infinitely easier and better ; bejause I made things round and 
shapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to look upon. Bui 
I think I was never more vain of my own performance, or more joyful 
for anything I found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco- 
pipe ; and though it was a very ugl^ slumsy thing when it was done, 
and only burned red, like other earthenware, yet ae it was hard and 
Arm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with 
it, for I had been always ut«d to smoke ; and there were pipes in th« 
ship, but I forgot them at firs^ not thinking that there was tobacco ia 
the island ; and afterward, when I searched the ship again, I could 
not come at any pipes at all. 

In my wicker ware also I imprrved much, and made abundance <d 
neoecsary baskets, as well as my invention showed me ; though not 
very handsome, yet they were such as were very han4y and etw- 
TCnient for my laying things up in, ol feHhiiig things homo. For ez< 
ample, if I killed a goat abroad, I could bang it up in a tree, flay Hf 
dross it, and out it in pieces, and bring it home In a basket; and like 
by a turtle ; I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a pieoo cr two 
of tbe flesh, which was enough for me, and bring i^em hoiae in a 
basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also large de^ip baskets for 
the reaeivers of my C6rn, which I always rubbed out m aoc\ as H WM 
dry, and cured, and kept it in great baskets.

ft 'Wmat which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began 9sri 
eofiiy to coaeider what I must do when I should have no more pow 
der— that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I had. a& h 
observed, in the third year of my being here, kept a yaung kid, an^ 
itrotl her up tame, and I was in hopes of getting a he-goat ; but \ 
co'jld not by any means bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goa*, 
Bud as I oould never find it in my heart to kill her, she died at la^ 
if mere Kse. 




'^ i^&n a Flock of Goats— His Dairy— HiB Domestic Habits and Stjl^ ef 
Living— Increasing Prosperity. 

EING now in the eleventh year of my residence, and ak. « 
have said, my ammmiition growing low, I set myself to 
stndy some art to trap .and snare the goats, to see whether 
I could not catoh some of them alive ; and particularly, 1 
wanted a she-goat great with young. For this purpose, I made snares 
to hamper them ; and I do believe they were more than onoo taken in 
Ihem : but my tackle was not good, for I had no ■\vire, and I always 
found them broken, and my bait devoured. At length I rasolved to 
try a pitfall : so I dag several large pifei in the earth, in places where 
I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pita I placed 
hurdles, of my own making;, too, with a greet weight upon them ; and 
several times I put ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the 
trap ; and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eati^n 
rap the oorn, for I oould see the marks of their feet. At length I set 
^iree ^aps in one night, and going the next morning, I foand them 
ftll standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very dis- 
ooaraging : however, I altered my traps ; and, not to trouble yo* 
with particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in ozm 
of them a large old he-goat, and in one of the others three kids, a 
male and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he wes m 
fierce, I durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to say, to gp abocct 
to bring him away alive^ which was what I wanted. I oould hare 
killed him, but that was not my business, nor would it answer my 
end ; 80 I even let him oat, and he ruh. away, as it he had beea 
Wghtoned 3ut of his wits. But I had fyg;(.t tfc«n, what I lad leanet

R.f)«rward, diat hunger will tame a lion. If I had let Um ttej tksrt 
three or four days without food, and then have carried him lome v^atei 
to drink; &od then a little corn, he would have been as tamo ae one 
of the kids ; for they are a mighty sagacious, tractable creattire 
where they are well used, llowever, for the present I let him go, 
knowing no better at that time : then I went to the three kids, aa4 
nking them one by one, I tied them with strings together, and witt 
(tome difficulty brouglit them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed • but throwing then 
•omi sw.'^et corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame. An« 
•ow I found that if 1 expected to supply myself with goat's flc/sh. 
when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up lamo was mj 
lOnly way ; when, perhaps, I might have them about my huuso like a 
flock of sheep. But then it occurred to rao, that 1 must keep the 
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild wbeu thoy 
grew up ; and the only way for this was, to have some enclosed piece 
of groun<l, well fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep tbem in .so 
effectually, that those within might not break out. or tliose without 
break iu. 

This was a groat undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet as I saw 
there was an absolute necessity for doing it, my firet work was to find 
out a proper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage 
for them to ee t, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them front 
the sun. 

Those who imderstand such enclosures will think I had very littl« 
eontrivonoe, when I pitched upon a place very proper for all thes« 
(being a plain open piece of meadow land or savannah, as our people 
eall it in the western colonies), which had two or three little rilk 
•f fresh water in it, and at one end was very woody ; I say, they will 
imile at my forecast, when 1 shall tell them, I began my enolosinf 
this piece of ground in such a manner, that my hedge or pale muM 
kaye been at least two miles about. Nor was the madness of it ij 
freftt aa to the compass, for if it was ten miles about, I was Hkely Wt 
iMve time enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that my goVm 
woald be as wild in so much composs aa if they had had the whoi« 
UfaoO, and I should have so much roem to chaee tbem in, tMU 1 
■hoald never catch them. 

Mv hedge was begun and carried on. I believe about fifty "^Aiitf, 
when this tbimght o. curred to me : so 1 jtresently stopped short aiid, 
for the first br jjinning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about oat 
bondred a^iJ I'fly yards in length, ni-d oiio hundred yards in breadth

kble time, so, u mj stock inoreused, I oould add mure ground to mj 
MMsloBure. 

This was acting vnth Bome prudoDce, and I went to work witk 
eourage. I was about three mouths hedging in the first pieoa ; and, 
till I had done it 1 tethered the three kidc in the best part of it, and used 
Jiiem to feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar ; and very 
9ft«n I would go and carry them some ears of barloj.. or a handful 
df rise, and feed them out of my hand ; so that aflor crj encloBura 
was finished, and I let them loose, they would folic tr me up and 
down, bleating after me for a handful of corn. 

This answsred my end; and in about a year tnd a half I had ■ 
lock of about twelve goats, kids and all : and in two years more, I 
bud three-and-forty, besides several that 1 took and killed for my 
food. After that I enclosed five several pieces of ground to fee^ 
them m, with little pens to drive them in, to take them as I wanted 
and gates out of one piece of ground into another. 

Bat this was not all ; fur now I not only had goat's flesh to feed on 
when I pleased, but milk too ; a thing which, indeed, in the begin- 
ning, I did not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my 
thoughts, was really an agreeabla surprise ; for now I set up my 
iairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day. And at 
Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature, dictates ever 
naturally how to mcke use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow 
much less a goat, or eeen butter or cheese made, only when I waa i 
boy, after a great many essays and miscarriages, made me both bat- 
ter and cheese at last, and also salt (though I found it partly made to 
my hand by the neat of the sun upon some of the rocks of the sea), 
and never wanted it afterward. IIow mercifully can our Creat(W 
treat his creatures, even in those conditions in which they seemed to 
be overwhelmed in destruction I IIow can he sweeten the bittereil 
providences, and give us cause to praise him for duDgeom and 
prisons ! What a table wa« here spread for mo in a wildernefi^ 
where I saw nothing, at first, but to perish for hunger ! 

It would have made a stcric smile to have seen me and my littla 
Eunily ^t down to dinner. There waa my majesty, the prince aad 
Idrd of the whole island ; I had the lives of all of my 8ubje:;ts at my 
absolute command ; I could hang, draw, give liberty, ftnd take it 
away ; and no rebels among all my subjects. 

Then to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone, attended by mj 
Mrrant9 : Poll, an if he bad been my favorite wae tihe only pvnm 



140 aBtektubbs or 

penuittod to talk to me. My dog, wbo was now gr3wn rtrj old and 
crazy, and had found no spocieB to multiply his kind apon, sat alw.'iys 
Kt my right hand ; and two cats, one on one side of tbe table, and! 
ooe on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, ao a 
Boark of epeoial favor. 

But these wore not tho two cats which I brought on shore at fegft, 
for they were both of them dead, and had been interred noar my 
habitation by my own hand ; but one of them having multiplied by 
I know not what kind of creature, thoao were two which I proserve^ 
tame, whoroaa the rest ran wild in the woode, and became indeed 
troublesome to me at last ; for they would often come into my honsei, 
and plunder me, too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did 
kill a great many ; at length they left me. With this attendance, 
uid in this plentiful manner, I lived. Neither could I be said to 
want anything but society ; and of that, some time after this, I was 
likely to have too much. > 

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have tiie nse of 
my boat, though vor^ loath to run any more hazards ; and, therefore, 
sometimes 1 sat contriving ways to got her about tho island, and at 
other times I sat myself down contented enough without her. But I 
had a strange unoaainess in my mind to go down to the point of the 
island, where, as I have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to 
see how the shore lay, and how the current set, that I might see what 
I had to do ; this inclination inoreased upon me every day, and at 
length I resolved to travel thither by land, following tho edge of the 
ibore. I did so; but had any one in England been to meet such a 
maQ &s I was, it must either have frightened him or raised a greal 
jleal of laughter ; and, as I frequently stood still to look at myself 1 
«oald not but smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire 
vrith euch aa. equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a 
eketok of my figure, as follows : ^ 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goaVs skin, with a fiap 
tanging down behind^ as well to keep the sun from me as to shoo* 
tiie rain off from running into my neck, nothing being so hnrtfol la 
these climates as the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's skin, iho Bkirts coming down to ab«ut 
tbe middle of the thighs, and a pair of opon-kucod breeches of Uu 
same. The breeches were male of tho akin of an old he-goai, whose 
heir hong down such a length on eitht^r side, that, like pantolooss, it 
reached to the middle of my I'^gs. Stockings and shoes I ksd oouo, 
but bad miadQ me a pair of somethings, I scarce know what (o cftP 



iiOBINSON CHU-S015. 1^31 

tkem, like buskins, to flap over my legs and lace on either ai<ie, like 
spatterdashes, but of a most barbarous sliape, as indeed were all tiia 
rest of my olotlics. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin, dried, which I drew togetho*.' 
with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles ; and in a kind of frog 
63 either side of tbie, instead of a Bwordand dagger, hung a little saw 
&5id hatchet, one oa one side and one on the other. 1 had ant/diof 
belt, not so broad, and {listened in the same manner, which hung ovej 
my ehoalder ; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung tw» 
pouoJies, both made of goat's skin, too, in one of which hung my pow- 
der, hi the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, and on my 
(ihoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy goat's skin nm- 
•jrclla, but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about 
m€, next to my guo. As for my face, the color of it was really not e« 
mulatto-like as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, 
and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My beard 1 
had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard lon^ 
but aa I had both scissors and razors sufiicieat, I had cut it pretty 
short, except what grew on my upper lip, which I had trimmed into 
a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by somo 
Turks at Sallee, for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks 
did. Of these mustaches or whiskers, I will not say they wore long 
enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length aad 
shape monstrous enough, and each as in England would have passed 
for frightful. 

^ But all this is by-the-by ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to ob- 
>;?ve me that it was of no manner of oonfletjuence, so I say no morf 
fro that part. In this kind of figure I went my new journey, end wai 
oat five or sis days. I travelled first along the eeaehoro directly te 
the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon tis& 
fOckB, and having no boat now to take care of I went over the la^ 
& nearer way, to the same height that I was upon before, when, look- 
ing forward to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which I wea 
ttfcliged to double with my boat, as is said above, I was surprised to 
sec the sea all smooth and quiet — no rippling, no motion, no curi?ent, 
aay more than in any other places. I was at a etrange loss to und«r- 
eSaad this, and resolved to spend some time in observing it, to eee if 
Eotbmg from the sets of the tide had occasioned it ; but I was prea* 
eatly convinced how it wa^, viz., that the tide of ebb setting from th« 
west, and jcining with the current of^waters f^om some great river ob 
Ike ahorOj must be the oocasion of this curront, and that aceordlng 



i4d ADTEiirru&fts of 

M the wind blew m^re forcibly from the west or from ih^ nor^ thia 
current came nearer or went further from the shore ; for, waiOiig 
thereabout till evening, I went up the rock again, and then the tids 
of ebb being made, I plainly eaw the current again as before, onlj 
that it ran farther off, being near half a league from the sLore ; 
whereafik in my case, it set cloae upon the shore, and hurriod aie and 
aay canoe alous; with it, which at another time it woall s.ct hnve 
done. 

Thii observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to ob- 
serve the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, lud I might very easily 
biicj; my boat about the island again ; but, when I began to think of 
putting it in practice, I had euch a terror upon my spirits a,t the re- 
membrance of the danger I had been in, that I could not think of it 
again with any patience, but, on the contrary, I took up another reso- 
lution, which was more safe though more laborious, and this wac th&t 
I would build or rather make mo another periugua or canoe, and ao 
have one for one side of the island and one for the other. 

You are to understand that now I had, ae I may call it, two planta 
tions in the island ; one, my little fortification, or tent with the wtsll 
about it, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time 
I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another 
One of these, which wa« the driest and largest, and had a door out be 
yond my wall or fortification, that is to say, beyond whore my wall 
•Joined to the rock, was all filled up with large earthen pots, of which 
I have given an account, and with fo .irteeu or fifteen great baskets, 
which would hold five or six bushclp each, whore I laid up my store 
of provision, especially my corii, some in the ear, cut off short from 
the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand. 

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, thoM 
)»ilefl grew rU like trees, and were by this time grown eo big, and 
jpread so very much, that there was not the least appearance, to any 
iSue's view, of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little further within the i&n<l, and 
Bp3n lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly 
ealtivated and sowed, and which duly yielded mo their harvest in ita 
season ; an 1, whenever I had occasion for more oom, I had more land 
adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides thip I hiid my country scat, and I had now a tolerable plan- 
tation there also ; for, first, I had my litUe bower, af I called it, whiok 
I kept in repair — that is to say, I kept the hedge which encircled i( 
IB oonetantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standir^g alwvyi 



Bk the meki«. I kept td8 d'eees, wbicb at fir«)t were no nacre than my 
itakes, but were ninf gr^wn very fii-m a' d tall, always cut, so thai 
they might epread, ead grow thick an^ wild, and m.tke the mora 
agreeable Bhade, ^hich they did effectually, to my mind. In the 
middle of this I had my tent always standing, being u piece of sai] 
spread over polos set up for that purpose, and which never wanted 
any repair or renewing, and under this I had made nie a squab ot 
couch with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other sofi 
things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea bed- 
ding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat, to cover me j and 
here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief seat, 1 took 
up my country habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that Is to ss-j^ 
my goats ; and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of painc t& ftonc^ 
Bad enclose this ground, I was so anxious to see it kept t-ntir'.,, Lst tlMi 
goats should break through, that I never left off, till, witli iufinik't 
labor, I had stuck the outside of ihd hedge so full of small stakes aoA 
so near to one another, that it waa rather a pale than a hedge, ana 
tliere was scarce room to put a han*! through between them ; whioh 
afterward, when those stakes grew, as they all did the next rain? 
(Season, made the enclosure strong like a wall — indeed, stronger than 
any wall. 

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared n« 
pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfort- 
able support ; for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame crea- 
tures thus at my nana would be a living magazine of flosh, milk, but- 
ter, and cheese, for me as long as I lived in the place, if it were to be 
forty years ; and that keeping them in my reach depended entirely 
open my perfecting my enclosuree to such a degree, that I might be 
sure of keeping them together ; which, by this method, indeed, I m 
effectually secured, that when these little stakes began to grow, I ha4 
planted them so very thick, that I was forced to pull some of them ap 
again. 

la this piece also I had my grapes growing, which I principally de- 
pended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never fiuled to 
preserve very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my 
whole diet ; and, indeed, they were not only agreeable, but medicinaL 
wholeeome,, nourishing, and refrc bmg to the last degree. 

As this was also about halfway between my other habitation and Hut 
p}£ce nhero I laid up my boat, 1 generally stayed aid lay h<a«iu

tJatspected Alarm and Caose for Apprehension— He fortifies Ms Abodt, 

T happened one day, about noon, going toward my boat 1 
wa« oxcoedingly surprised with the print of a man's nak«d 
foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the 
sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an 
apparition ; I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear nothing, 
nor see anytting ; I wont up to a rising ground, to look farther ; I 
went «D the shore and down the shore, but it was all one ; I could 
see no other impression but that one. I went to it again to see if 
there were any moro, ani to observe if it might not be my fancy ; but 
there was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot, 
toes, hoeJ, and every part of a foot; how came it thither, I knew not, 
nor coild I in the least imagine; but, after innumerable fluttering 
thougfctc, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came 
home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went oo^ 
but terrified to the last degree — looking behind me at every two ot 
three steps, n&istaking every bush and tree, and fancying every stump 
ai a distance to bo a man. Nor is it possible to describe how many 
vwriODS shapes my affrighted imagination represented things to me in, 
how many wild idci^r wore found every moment in my fancy an4 
vbat Btraoge unaccountable whims came into my thoughts by the way. 
Whet. I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after thatt) 
I fled into it like one pursued ; whither I wont over by the ladder, as 
first contrived, or went in at the hole in the rook, which I had called 
a door, 1 cannot remember — no, nor could I remember the next morn- 
bg ; for never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, widi 
Biore terror of mind than I to this retreat.

fright, the greater my apprebeasions were ; which ia eomething con- 
trary to the nature of such things, and especially to the usual prac 
tice of all creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own 
frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imagin- 
ations to myself, even though I was now a great way off it. Some- 
times I fancied it must be the Devil, and reason joined in with me 
upon this supposition; for how should any other thing in human 
shape come into the place ? Where was the vessel that brought 
them ? What marks were there of any other fqotsteps ? And how 
was it possible a man should come there ? But then to think that, 
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place, where 
there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of 
his foot behind him, and that even for no purpose, too, for he could 
not be sure I should see it — this was an amusement the other way. 
I considered that the Devil might have found out abundance of other 
ways to have terrified me than this of a single print of a foot; that as. 
I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never have 
been so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou- 
sand to one whether I should ever see it or not, and in the sand too, 
which the first surge of the sea, upon a high wind, would have de- 
faced entirely; all this seemed inconsistent with tba thing itself^ and 
with all the notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the Devil. 
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of 
all apprehensions of its being the Devil; and I presently concluded, 
then, that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz. : that it must, 
be some of the savages of the main land over against me, who had 
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either di-iven by the currents 
or by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been on shore, but 
were gone away again to sea ; being as loath, perhaps, to have stayed 
in this desolate island as I would have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very 
thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts 
at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which they would 
have concluded that some inhabitants had been in the place, and per- 
haps have searched farther for me ; then terrible thoughts racked my 
imagination about their having found my boat, and that there were 
people here ; and that if so, I should certainly have them come again 
in greaiter numbers, end devour me ; that if it should happen so that 
they should not find me, yet they would find my enslosure, destroy ali 
rny corn, aiid carry away all mj flock of tame goats, ao4 X eijQ0d 
perish at last for mere want

thought was BO just a reproof^ that I resolved for the future to hart

How strange a checkerwork of Providence is the life of man ! and 
by what secret different springs are the affections hurried about, as 
different oirsumstances present ! To-day we love what to-morrow we 
hate ; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun ; to-day we desirf 
what to-moTOW we fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of 
this was exemplified m me, at this time, in the most lively manner 
imaginable ; for I, whose only affliction was that I seemed banished 
from human society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the boundlesft 
ocean, out off from mankind, and condemned to what I called siloni. 
life i that I was a* one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num* 
bered among the living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures , 
ihat to ha'^e seen one of my own species would have seemed to me a 
raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that Heavec 
ifeielf, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could bestow ; I say 
that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man, 
and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow »r silent ^ 
pearanoe of a maa's having set his foot in the island. 

Such is the uneven state of human life : and it afforded me a greMk 
many curious speculations afterward, when I had a little recover«4 
my first burprise. I considered th^it this was the station of life the 
nfinitoly wise and good providence of God had determined for me , 
that as I oould not foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be 
JB all this, so I was not tc dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was hii 
creature, had an undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose 
of mo absolutely as he thought ht ; and who, as I was a creature tha> 
had offended him, had likewise a judicial right to condemn me to 
what punishment he thought fit ; and that it was my part to submit t 
bear hV indignation, because I had sinned against him. I then re 
A*«ied ^htt ae God, who was not oitly righteous, but omnipotent, ha . 
%|i^t fk*^^ ii&-1>«;ib(li aodafpidt p», so he wfM AhT6i0c|tfliTer vak 



Eiiat, if h^ -i:.! not think fit to do bo, it was my nnt{Qe{tti«ntet)te dnty u 
resign niyseif absolutely and entirely to his will , ai»d on the ulLei 
bnnd; it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to 
attend the diotates and directions of his daily providence. 

These thoughts tnok me up many hours, days, nay, I may say, weekl 
^d months ; and om particular effect of my cogitations on this cofc 
a on I cannot omit. One morning, early, lying in my bed, and tilled 
with thoughts about my danger from appearances of savages, I foond 
it di^jjoniposed me very much ; upon which these words of the ScrilK 
ture lame into my though^fl : " Ca'l upon me in the day of trouble 
(uid I will deliver thee, and thou su&lt glorify me." Upon this, riainf 
. cheerfully out of my bed, ray heart was not only comforted, but I wae 
guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God for delivorance 
when I had ^one praying, I took up my Bible and opening il «o 
read, the first words that presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord, 
and be of good choer, and he shall strengthen thy heart ; wait, I Bay, 
on the Lord." It is imposrible to express the comfort this gave m«. 
In answer^ I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more sad, at 
least on that occasion. 

In the middle of these cogitations, apprchenBions, and reflections, it 
eame into n.y thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera 
of my own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, whea 
I came on shore from my boat ; this cheered 3.e up a little, too, and I 
hegan to persuade myself it was all a delusion ; that it was nothing 
•Ise but my own foot ; and why might I not come that way from the 
boat, as well as I was going that way to the boat 7 Again, I conaid- 
red also, that 1 could by no moans tell, for certain, where I had trod, 
Mid where I had not; and that if, at last, this was only the priot of 
'rgy own foot, I had played the part of those fools, who try to makm 
■Juries of spectres and apparitions, and then are frightened at them 
core than anybody. 

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, feel iMtf 
aot stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began 
to starve for provisions ; for I had little or nothing within doors bat 
some barley cakes and water ; then I knew that my goats wanted to 
be milked too, which usually was my evening diversion; and the poor 
c-^aturea were in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and 
indeed, it almost spoiled some of them, and almost dried np tbwr 
tailk Encouraging myaelf, therefore, with the belief that this WM 
Botniug bu' ^le print <tC one of my own fe-<!)t, and that I might Im 
^oly sfti.! •<> et&i>t at my own shadow, I began lo ko abroad a^pUi^

and went to toy country house to milk my hook ; but to Sfeis- "witti wlaftt 
fear I went forward, tow often I looked behind too, bow I was ready, 
every now and tben, to lay down my basket and run for my life, it would 
bave made any one think I was haunted w^th aai evil conscience, 
or tbftt I bad been lately most terribly frightened ; and so, indeed, I 
bad. However, as I went down thus two or three days, and having 
seen nothing, I began to bo a little bolder, and to think there waa 
really nothing in it but my own imagination ; but I could not porsunda 
myself fully of this till I ehould go down to the shore again and 
see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and see if 
there was any simihtude or fitness, that I might be assured it was my 
own foot ; but when I came to the place, first, it appeared evidently 
to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore 
ar. where thereabout: secondly, when I came to measure 'ibe nsark 
i^»th my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both 
tQ?8e thiagg filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the 
vapors agam to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one 
\a att ague; and I went home again, filled with the belinf tbat some 
nuin or men had been oo shore there ; or in short, that thb island was 
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I H9A aware ; and wh&t 
©ourjie to take for my security I knew not. 

Oh, what ridioulous resolutions uen take when possessed with fear 
ft deprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for 
'ViOir relief. The first thin/; I pioj-osed to myself was, to throw down 
Hjy enclosures, and turn all ^ny tame cattle wild into ih-j woods, lesS 
the easmy should find them, and then frequent the island Ji prospeol 
of the same or the l?Ve booty ; then to the simple thing of digging 
ap my two cornfields, last they r^hould find such a grain there, and 
jstill be prompted to frequent the island; then to demolish sa;; bow^e* 
ixtA tent, that they might not see any vestigee of habitation^ ttfi4

Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than (Iw*

iety greater, by much, than the evil which wo are anxious about; anJ 
wU&h was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this t-rcubl<

now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my dis- 
tress, and resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my 
defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been 
more cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps car- 
ried through it with more resolution. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in 
the morning I fell asleep ; and having, by the amusement of my 
mind, been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very 
soundly, and waked much better composed than I had ever been be- 
fore. And now I began to think sedately ; and upon the utmost de- 
bate with myself, I concluded that this island, which was so exceeding 
pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as I had 
seea, was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine ; that although 
there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the spot," yet that there 
might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who either with de- 
sign, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds, 
might come to this place ; that I had lived here fifteen years now, 
and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet; 
and that if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable 
they went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had 
never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most I could 
suggest any danger from, was from any casual accidental landing of 
straggling people from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were 
driven hither, were here against their wills, so they made no stay 
here, but went ofi" again with all possible speed ; seldom staying (^e 
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tidos and 
daylight back again ; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to 
consider of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land 
upon the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as 
to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came out be- 
yond where my fortifications joined to the rock : upon maturely con- 
sidering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, 
in the same manner of a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just 
where I had planted a double row of trees about twelve years before, 
of which I made mention. These trees having been planted so thick 
before, they wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that 
they might be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be soon 
finished ; so that I had now a double wall : and my outer wall was 
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could 



*in>v> At)VENTUREB Of 

think of, to make it strong, having in it seven little holes, about as 
big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of this, I thickened 
my wall to about ten feet thick, with continually bringing eaith out 
of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon 
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of 
which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship: 
these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held 
them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two 
minutes' time. This wall I was many a weary month in finishing, 
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a 
great length every Avay, us full with stakes, or sticks, of the osier-like 
wood, which I found so apt to grow, as thoy could well stand ; inso- 
much, that I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, 
leaving a pretty large space between them and my wall, that I might 
have room to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the 
young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall. 

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove ; and in five or six 
years' time I had a wood before my dwelliag, growing so monstrous 
thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable ; and no 
men, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there was any- 
thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the way which I 
proposed to myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was by 
sotting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low, and 
then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that; so 
that when the two ladders were taken down, no man living could 
come down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had 
"jome down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall. 

Thus I too all the measures human prudence could suggest for my 
own preserv; cion ; and it will be seen, at length, that they were not 
altogether ■« thout just reason, though I foresaw nothing at that time 
more than n.y mere fear suggested to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other 
affairs : for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of 
goats ; they were not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, 
and began to be sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and 
shot, but also without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones : and 
I was loath to lose the advantages of them, and to havo them all to 
curse up over again. 

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but 
two ways to preserve them: one w'*s,to find another convenient plac« 



Bi^'biHioiii cmosvv. 16. 

to dig a oaTb ander gx-oand, and to drive thera into H every night 
and the otber was, to enclose two or three little bits of land, rrmot. 
from 0)j^ another, and as much concealed as I could, where I might 
keep about half a dozen young goats in each place ; bc that if any 
disaster happened to the flock in general, I might bo able t« raisft 
them again with little trouble and time ; and this, though it would 
require a great deal of time and labor, I thought was tie moet ra- 
aonal design. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts 
of the island ; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indesd, 
ae my heart.could wish for : it was a little damp piece of ground, in the 
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as I observed, I almost 
lost uivself oj» JO before, endeavoring to come back that way from the 
©astern part <^f the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near 
three acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was almost an en 
closure by uatur© ; at least, it did not want neur so much labor t« 
Biftke it so afi the other pieces of ground I had worked so hard at 



fi^pjta €i^\ittn.

/^ IMMEDIATELY went to work with this piece of gmund 

ti and in less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that 
my flock, or herd, call it which you please, who were not %o 
wild now as at first they might be supposed to t3, mi- ere well 
suough secured in it; so, without any further delay, I removed t6P 
youc-ff sh»-goats and two he-goats to this piece ; and whrn they wer« 
there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it as secure ae 
fcLe other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up 
ujore time by a great deal. All this labor I was at the expense of 
pur -ly from my apprehensions on the account of the print of a man's 
foot which I had seen ; for, as yet, J never saw any human creature 
ooiiic usiir the ifsland ; and I had now lived two years under tbjs unaaei- 
nefes, which, inJceJ, made my life much less comfortable than it wae 
before, as may bo wall imagined by any who knows what it is to Iiv« 
b t^e oonata&t snare of the fear of mao. And thi« I n.u«t obsorra

pr«Ml«>n0 also upon the religioas part of mj thoughts ; for Uie drcMS 
■ad terror of falling into the hands of savages and eannibals lay M 
apcn my spirite, that I seldom found myself in a due temper for ap 
plication to mj Maker, at least not with the sedate oalmness aiii 
re»gnation of soul which I was wont to do I rather prayed to Goi 
aa onder great affliction and pressure of mind, surroundel with 
danger and in expectation every night of being murdered and de- 
voureO before morning ; and I must testify from my experience, thi*-^ 
a temper of peace, thankfulness, love and affection, is much the loor^ 
proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure; an<i 
that under the dread of mischief impending, a man is ao more fit for 
a comforting performance of the duty of praying to God, than he is 
for a repentance on a sick bed; for those discomposures affect the 
mind, as &e others do the body ; and the discomposure of the mind 
must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body, and 
much greater : praying to God being properly an act of the mind, 
not of the body. 

But to go on : After I had thus secured one part of my little living 
stock, I went about the whole island searching for another private 
place to make another deposit, when, wandering more to the west 
point of the island than I had ever don£ yet, and looking out to sea, I 
thought 1 saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance. I had found 
a perspective glass or two in one of the seamen's chests, which 1 
saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me, and this was so re* 
mote that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it 
till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer ; whether it wm 
a boat or not I do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could 
Bee no more of it, so I gave it over, only I resolved to go no m-jre out 
without a perspective glass in my pocket. When I was come down 
tiie hill te the end of the island, where, indeed, I had never been be 
fore, I was presently convinced that the seeing the print of a man't 
foot was not such a strange thing in the inland as I imagined , and. 
but that it was a special providence that I was cast upon the side of 
the island where the savages never came, I should easily have known 
that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main, 
when they happened to be a little too far out to sea, to shoot over to 
that side of the island for harbor , likewise, as they often met and 
fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners, wculo 
bring thorn over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful cu» 
koxo, being oannibcds, they would kill and eat thetn-^of which ber^

Wkea I WS0 oome down the hill ^3 the shore, as I anid aboT^d, leiof 
iie southwest point of the ielaud, I was perfectly confounded an4 
amazed, nor is it possible for mo to express ihe horroi of aay muad al 
^eing the shore spread with akulls, hands, f^et, and othsr bones of 
baman bodies; aud, particularly, I observed a place where there had 
been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, wher« 

supposed the sarage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feast- 
^e upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

J was so astonished at the sight of these thuigs that I entertained 
DO notion of any danger ' ; myself from it for a loag while ; all my 

prehensions were buried in the thought of such a pitch of inhuman, 
ellish brutality, and the honor ii the degeneracy of human nature, 
which, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view 
of before ; xl short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle, 
Bay stomach grew sick, and I was jiist at the poiat of fainting, when 
nature discharged the diec rder from my stomach, and having vomited 
with uncommon violerce I was a little relieved, but could not bear to 
stay in the place a moment, so I got me up the hill again with all 
the speed I could, and walked on toward my own habitation. 

When i came a little out of that part of the island I stood still 
Awhilt-, as amazed, and then recovering myself, I looked ut with the 
•tmost action of my soul, &nd, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gav« 
Qtxl thanis, that had cast my fiist lot in a ^art of the world whero 1 
W8a distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these, and thai 
though I had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had jyt 
g'veu me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to give thanks 
f->r than to complain of; and this, above all, that I had, even in thia 
iniserable condition, been comforted with the knowledge of himself 
and the hop© of his blessing, which was a felicity more than auffi- 
cidQtlj equivalent to aU the itisery which I had suffered or eouli 
siffer. [ 

In this frame of thankfiUnesf I went home to my castle, and begas 
to be much easier now, ae to the safety of my circumstances, thso 
ever I was before, foi I observed that these wretches never carae to 
thia island in search of what they could get, perhaps not seeking, noi 
wanting, or net expecting anything here, and having often, no doubt 
been up in the covered woody part oi it without fiuding anything U 
iheir paipose. 1 know I had been here how almost eighteen yearg^ 
and nav£.' saw the least footstep of human creature there before, and 
I rcight be eighteen years more as entirely ;;onoealod as I was now, if 
I <iid Uit discover myself to them^ which 1 had tuq gctftnaer 9f oeoa«ivs

to do, tt being my only bunuMs to keep mjbeif entiro^y eoBO«fti«i 
wlieTe I was, anlcsa I foond a better Bort of creatures than cannibak 
to make myself known to. Yet I entertained such an abhorrenco of 
&t savage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the wretch 
ed, inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one another n^ 
thai I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own oireic 
for almost two years after this. When I say my own circle, I meaa 
by it my three plantations, viz., my castle, my country seat, wbio^i I 
oallsd my bower, and my enolosaro in the woods ; nor did I look bfhev 
thL for any other uss than as an enclosure for my goats ; for ths 
avenaon which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was saoh^ 
thaA I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. I 
did not 80 much as go to look after my boat all thb time, but begaa 
rather to think of making me another, for I could not think oi ever 
"Making any more attempts to bring the other boat round tlao island 
to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea, ii 
whioh, if I bad happened to have fallen into theii hands, I knew wbal 
would have been my jot 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I w«s in no danger 
of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasinesi 
•boot them, and I began to live just in the same cumposed manner aa 
before, only with this difference, that I used mor« caution and kept 
mj eyes more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be 
seen by any of them ; and, particularly, I was more cautious of firing 
Bay gim, lest any of them being on the island should happen to hear 
it. It was, therefore, a very good providence to we that I had fiir- 
Binhed myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need t> 
hunt any more about the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did eaten 
any more of them after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had done 
before, so that for two years after this, I believe, I never fired my gam 
off, though I never went out without it ; and, which was more, as I 
had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them ont with 
tne. or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat's-skin belt. I 
aiso furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, 
and made me a belt to hang it on, also, so that I was now a most for* 
Boidable fellow to look at when 1 went abroad, if you add to the for 
mer description of myself tho particular of two pistols, and a great 
Iroadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a bcubbard. 

Things going on thus, as 1 hav^e said, for some time, I seendd, e^" 
eepting these cautions, to be reduced to my fonrer calm, sedate wa|

fbf tiay condition was from b«ing miserable, 'compared to taaa etlien 
c&y, to tiiAny other particulars of life which it might have pleaeed

peopl-j wouid rather compare their condition with those thai* wei% 
wcra'), in order to be thankful, than to be always comparing then 
irith those which are better, to assist their murmorings and oom^ 
plainiiigs. 

As in my present oondition there were not really many thiitf* 
which I wanted, eo mdeed, I thought that the frights I had been ia 
about these savage wretcnea, and the concern I had been in for my 
own preservation, had taken off the edge of my invention for my ow» 
CoaTeniences ; and 1 had dropped a good design, which I had ono« 
bent my thoughts too much upon, and that was, to try if J could not 
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself some 
beor. This was really a whin-oieal thought, and I reproved myself 
often for the simplicity of it; for J presently saw there would be the 
want of several things necessary to the making my beer, that it 
iroald be impossible for me to supply ; as, first, casks to preserve it 
is, which was a thing that, as 1 had observed already, I could pe'^er 
compass ; no, though I spent not only many days, but week*, nay 
BQonths, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I had 
uo hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or 
kettle to make it boU ; an'' yet with all these things wanting, I verily 
teiieve, had not the frigfars rjid terrors I was in about the savagM 
totervened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pa86 too , 
for 1 «»eldom gave anything over without accomplishing it, when ono« 
I had it in my head to begin it But my isvention ran now quite 
another way; for, night coid day, I could think of nothing but how I 
Qtight destroy some f these monsters in their cruel, bloody ecteiN 
tunment, and, if possible, save the victim they should bring hither lo 
iwtroy. It would take up a larger volume than this whole work ia 
intended tc be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather 
brooded up: n, in Jij" thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or 
ftt least frightening them so as to prevent their coming hither any 
more ; but all this was abortive ; nothing could be possible to take 
b^eot, unless I was to be there to do it mysalf ; and what could one 
Bian i^ among them, when perhaps tLere might bo twenty or thirty 
ef ta<j:ij kgpther, A-ith their darta, or their bows and arrows, with 
vhich they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun t 

Soraeticaeti I thought of digging a hoie under the plaoe where thej 



iQftio tlteh' jb«, a&j ^otttug in five or eiz pounds of gonpowdei, ^Mj^ 
wheB tliey kindlod their fire, would consequently take fire, Jtnd b!?*;! 
rII up that WB8 near it but aa, in the first place, I should b« untslll 
'ng to waste 80 much powder upon them, my store bein|^ nov withi» 
the quantity of one barrel, so neither could I be sure of lis going ofl 
st any certain time, when it might surprise them ; and, at best, that ii 
voold do little more than just blow the fire about their ears and 
fiight them, bat not sufficient to make them forsake the piaoe ; so I 
kud it aside, and then proposed that I would place myself in antbusb 
ia some convenient place, with my three gun« all double-loaded, and, 
in the middle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I »1 ouki 
be Bure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot ; and thca 
falling in upon them with my three pistols, and my sword, I made no 
doubt but that if there were twenty I should kill them all. This 
fiuioy pleased my thoughts for some weeks ; and I waa so full of i% 
that I often dreamed of it, and somotimes that I was just gobg to let 
fly at them in my sleep. I went so far with it in my imagination, 
that I employed myself several days to find out proper places to put 
myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them ; and I went fre- 
quently to the place itself, which was now grown more familirr to 
me ; but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge, 
ftnd a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may 
sail it, the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the barbar- 
ous wretches devouriDg one another, abetted wiy malice. Well, at 
length, I found a place in the side of the hill, where I was satisfied I 
might securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might 
then, even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey my* 
•slf unseen, into some thicket of trees, in one of which there wa« t 
hollow large enough to conceal mo entirely ; and there I might e# 
and observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their 
beada, when they were so close together, that it would he next to im 
poeeible that I should miss my shot, or that I could fail wounding 
three or four of them at the first shot. In this place, then, 1 resolved 
to fix my design ; and, accordmgly, I prepared two muskets and my 
ordin&ry fowling-picco. The two muskets I loaded with a brace <A 
■logs each, and four oi five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol 
bullets; and the fowling pl'^ee I loaded with near a handful of swan 
ikoi, of the largest size ; I ahj loaded my piscols with about tout 
ballets each ; and in this posture, well pro^•ided with ammunit^ 3n fo< 
a aeoond and third charge, 1 prepared myself for mj expedition. 
After I had thtu Itdd the scheme of my dwign, and, m my Imaglt 



•ifiOBy pat it IB practice, I continoally made my tour svery morniiil 
«p to tli« top of thfi hillf which was £rom my castle, as I callf>d K 
aiont Uuroe miles or more, to »ee if I could obserre any boats upon 
Saa aea, coming near the island, or standing over to\Tard it ; but I 
began to tire of this hard duty, after I had, for two or three moaths, 
owjstantly kept my watch, but came always back without any dis- 
covery ; there having not in all that time, been the least appearanos, 
BOt only on and near the shore, but on the whole ocean, so far as my 
•yea or glasses could reach every way. 

As long ?w I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long 
aiso I kept up the vigor of my design, and my spirits scorned to be all 
atxe while 'm ft suitable form for so outrageous an execution as the 
killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not 
ftt all entered into a discussion of in my thoughts, any further than 
my passions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the vm- 
BAttiral custom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been 
siifl^ed by ProvideHoe, in his wise disposition of the world, to havi 
no other guide than that of their own abominable and vitiated pas- 
sions; and, consequently, wore lof^ and perhaps had been so for 
some ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful cus- 
toiDS, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned by Heaven, and ac- 
tuated by some hellish degeneracy, uoald have run them into. Snt 
aow, when, as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excur 
lion, which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain, so 
my opinion of the action itself I began to alter; and begaa, with 
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engag« 
in , what authority or call I had to protond to be judge and execTi 
tioner upon these men as criminals, whom Ileaven had thought fit, fot 
BO many ages, to suffer, unpunished, to go on, and to bo, as it wer^ 
a»e executioners of his judgments one upon another. Ecw far thes8 
people were offenders against me, and what right had I to engage is i 
tixe quarrel of that blood which they ehod promiscuously on© upon 
ftcother^ I debated this very often with myself, thus : " Uovr do I knov 
what God himself judges in this particular case 7 It ia certain these 
persons do not commit this as a crime ; it is not against their own 
eoQBoience« reproving, or their light reproaching them ; they do not 
know it to be an offence, and then commit in defiance of divine jnatiee, 
M we do ia almost all the sins we commit. They think it no more 
ft orime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox ; nor 
lo ftftt human fiesh, than we do to eat mutton.^' 

Wheo X «OD8i<l6red ttiie a httls, it followed necessarily that I we*

iwrUilDly in the wroaf bi It ; that these people were not iaaT4er«H 
in the sense that I had before coDdemned them in my thoaght^. any 
more than those Chrbtians were murderers who ofttin put tc deatti 
the priscners taken in battle ; or more frequently, upon many occa 
■ODS put whole troops oi* men to the sword, without giving quarter, 
though they threw down their arms and submitted. In the nexi 
plaoe, it occurred to me, that although the usage they gave cd« 
another was thus brutish and inhuman yet it waa really nothing to 
Me ; these people had done me no injury ; that tf they attempted m«, 
n I saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation, to Ml opoB 
them, something might be said for it ; but that I wa« yet out of their 
power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and oonsequeutly n* 
design upon me ; and therefore it could not be just for me to fal/ 
upon them ; that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards ir 
all their barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed mill- 
ions of these people ; who, however they were idolaters and barb^ 
rians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their customa. 
such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the 
Spaniards, very innocent people : and that the rooting them out ol 
the country is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detestation 
by even the Spaniards themselves at this time, and by all other 
Chriatian nations in Europe, as a mere butchery^ a bloody and unnat 
oral piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or man, and foi 
which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and 
terrible to all people of humanity or of Christian con^assion — as if 
the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the produce of a 
race of men who were without principles of tenderneus, gs he common 
bowels of pity to the miseraible, wtiich is recko3S«d to ba a mark ot 
generous temper in the mind. 

These considerations really put me to a pausc; uiid to a kind of a fclj 
j(op ; and I began, by little and little, to be off my design, and to ooiw 
•lade I bad taken wrong measures in my resolutions to attack the sar* 
agee; and that it was not my business, to meddle with them, unless 
tkey first attacked me ; and that it was my business, if possible, to pr3> 
yent; but, that if I were discovered and attacked by them, I koew vaj 
laty. On the other hand, I argued with myself, thnt this really was 
the way not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin oi\d destroy myself, 
for unless I was sure to kill every one that, not only, skonld be on 
shore at that time, but that should ever come on shii-j sfterward if 
Vat one of them escaped to tell their country-people what had h*p<

I oonoladed thiat neither in principle nor is policy X ought, one way 
or other, to concern myself in this affair ; that my business was, by 
•H possible means, to conceal myself from them, and not leave th« 
least signal to them to guess by that that there were any living orea 
tnres upon the island, I mean of human shap Religion joined is 
crith this prudential resolution, and I was conyinced now, many ways, 
that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was laying all my bloody 
•ohemes for the destructiou of innocent creatures, I mean innocent ai 
to ma. Aa to the crimes they were guilty of toward one another, I 
had nothing to do with them ; they wore national, and I ought to leave 
th«m to the justice of God, who is the governor of nations, and knows 
how, by national punishments, to make a juet retribution for national 
offences, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a 
public manner, by such ways as best please him. This appeared so 
clear to me now, that nothing was a greater satiefiiction to me than 
that I had been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason 
to believe would have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder, 
If I had committed it ; and I gave most humble thanks, on my knees, 
to God, that had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness ; beseeching 
him to grant me the protection of his providence, that I might not 
fell into the hands of barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands 
apon them, Unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, ia 
defsBoe of my own life.

wliole island, where I ran it into a little cove, whfcti I fouuit UBCfW 
some high rocks, ajid where I knew, by reason of the currente, th« 
savages dui'st not, at least would not, come with their boats, upon any 
account whatever. With my boat I carried away everything that I 
had left there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bar* 
going thither, viz., a mast and sail which I had made for her, and A 
thuig like an anchor, "but which, indeed, could not be called either aa^ 
chor or grapnel ; however, it vras the best I could make of its kind ; 
all these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow of any 
discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation 
upon the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired 
tlinn ever, and seldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant 
employment, viz., to milk my she-goa%, and manage my little flock in 
the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part of the island, was 
quite out of dangev ; for certain it is, that these savage people, who 
sometimes haunted this island, never came with any thoughts of find- 
ing anything here, and consequently never wandered off from the 
coast : and I doubt not but they might have been several times on 
shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as well 
as before. Indeed, i looked back with some horror upon the thoughts 
of what my condition would have been if I had popped upon them 
and been discovered before that, when, naked and unarmed, except with 
one gun, and that loaded often only with small sliot, I walked every- 
where, peeping and peering about the island to see what I could get ; 
what a surprise should I have been in, if, when I discovered the print 
of a man's foot, I had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, 
and found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of fheir running no 
possibility of my escaping them ? The thoughts of this sometimes sunk 
my very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much, that I could 
not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and how I should 
not only have been unable to resist them, but even should not have 
had presence of mind enough to do what I might have done, much 
less what now, after eo much consideration and preparation, I might 
be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking on these things, I would 
be very melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while : but 
I resolved it all, at last, into thankfulness to that Providence which 
had deliveted me from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me 
from those mischiefs which I could have no way been the agent in 
delivering myself from, because I had not the least notion of any such 
thing depending, or the least snpposition of its being possible. This 
reoewed a contemplation which often had come to my thoughts iu 



ifeimeir time, when first I began to see the merciful dispositions of 
HeaYen^ in tho dangers -vre run through in this life ; how wonderfully 
W9 are delirered when we know nothing of it ; how, when we are in 
(a quandary as we call it) doubt or hesitation, whether to go this way 
or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this way, when we intended 
to go that way ; nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps 
business, has called to go the other way, yet a strange impression 
upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by we know not 
what power, shall overrule ua to go this way j and it shall afterward 
appear, that had we gone that way which we should have gone, and 
evdn to our imagination ought to have gone, we should have been ru- 
ined and lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I afterward, 
made it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found those secret 
hints or pressings of mind, to doing or not doing anything that present- 
ed, or going this way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret 
dictate; though I knew no other reason for it than "that such a pres- 
sure, or such a hint hung upon my mind. I could give many exam- 
pies of the success of this conduct in the course of ray life, but more 
especially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island ; 
besddes many occasions which it is very likely I might have taken notice 
of, if I had seen "with the same eyes then that I see with now. But 
it is never too late to be wise ; and I cannot but advise all considering 
men, whose lives are attended with such extraordinary incidents as 
mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight such secret 
intimations of Providence, let them come from what invisible intelli- 
gence they will. That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account 
for ; but certainly they are proof of the converse of spirits, and a 
secret communication between tliose embodied and those unembodied, 
and such a proof as can never be withstood ; of which I shall have 
occasion to give some remarkable instances in the remainder of his 
Bolitary residence in this dismal place. 

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess 
that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the con- 
cern that was upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the con- 
trivance* that I had laid for my future accommodations aud conveni- 
ences. I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than 
that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood 
now, for fear the noise I might make should be heard : much less 
would I fire a gim, for the same reason ; and, above all, I Avas intoh 
erably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a 
gi:4at distance in the day,^ould betray me. For this reason I re- 



16^ AX) VENTURES OF 

moved that part of my business which required fire, such as burning 
of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the woods; where, 
after I had been some time, I found to my unspeakable consolation, a 
mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, 
I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would bo so 
hardy as to venture in ; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one 
who, like mo, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, 
by mere accident (I \vould say, if I did not see abundant reason to 
ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some 
thick branches of trees, to make charcoal — and, before I go on, I 
mast observe the reason of my making this charcoal, which was this '• 
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said be- 
fore, and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, cook- 
ing my meat, &c., so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had 
seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark or dry coal, and 
then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and 
perform the other services for which fire was wanting, without dan- 
ger of smoke. But this is by-the-by. While I was cutting down somo 
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brush- 
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place ; I was curious 
to look in it, and getting with difiiculty into the mouth of it, I found 
it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand upright in 
it, and perhaps another with me; but I must confess to you that I 
made more haste out than I did in, when, looking further into the 
place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of 
B© jie creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled liko 
two stars, the dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly in and 
making the reflection. However, after some pause I recovered my- 
self and began to call myself a thousand fools, and to think that ha 
that was afraid to see tho devil was not fit to live twenty years in an 
island all alone, and that I might well think there was nothing in this 
cave that was more frightful than myself Upon this, plucking up 
my courage, I took up a firebrand and in I rushed again, with stick 
flaming in my hand; I had not gone three steps in but I was almost 
as much frightened as I was before, for I heard a very loud sigh, like 
that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as 
( "words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back. 
Had was indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold 
twoat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it 
that my hair might not hava lifted it off. But still plucking up my 



lyiriifi M well as I coald, and encoaraging myself a little with eon 
■iiepicg tkat th« power and presence of God were everywhere, and 
were able to protect me ; upon this I stepped forward a^ain, and by 
the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw 
lying on the ground a most monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just ma 
king his will, as we say, and gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of 
mere old age. I stirred him a littlo, to see if I could get him ou^, 
and he e6«ayed to get up but was not able to raise himself, and I 
thought M'".th myself he might even lid ihero, for if be had frightened 
me, 80 h«j would certainly fright any of the savages, if any of iheoa 
shoald be so hardy as to come in there while ho had life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round 
me, when I found the cave was but very small, that is to say, it might 
bo about twelve feet over, bat in no manner of shape, neither rounO 
nor square, no hands having eve>" ^jeen employed in making it bm 
those of mere nature. I obe«:vvod. rIso, that there was a place at the 
farther side of it that went ii« furrber, b»t it was so low that it re- 
qoired me to creep upoi. my hands and kLees, to go into it, and 
whither it went I knew not, p*. having no caudle, I gave it over fbr 
that time, but resolved t(. come again the next day, provided with 
candles and e iinder-Lox, whicL I had made of the lo<^ of one of the 
muskets, with some wild-fii'e in the pan 

Acoofdiugly, the uexS day 1 came provided with six largo candles 
of my owe making (for J made very good oandles now of goat's tal- 
low, but was hard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope- 
yarn, and sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles), and going 
inio thin low place I was obhged to creep upon all foars, as I have 
said, almost ten yards, whieh^ by the way, I thought was a venture 
bold enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, nox 
what was beyond it. When 1 goi through the strait I found the roof 
rose higher up, I b«lievo near twenty feet, but never was such a glo. 
rious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round thf 
Bides and roof of this vault or cave; the wall reflected a hundred thou 
i*a^d lights to me from my two candles. What it was in the rock, 
whether diamonds or any other precious stones, or gold, which I 
tdther supp.sod it to be, I knew not. The place I was in was a most 
doh'ghtful cavity ci ^rot-to of its kind as could bo expected, though 
perfaetly dark ; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small 
loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous orea< 
twre to De ^eco, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or 
r(Kf ; tjw QoJ* 4iflBeul*7 v it was the entraDce, which, however, as \i 



|#i ADTXNTtTBIS OT 

WM a place of eecnrity, Utd such a retreat as I wfmted, I tStooghl 
&at was a conveuieuce, bo that I was really rcjoicod at tho dlMovcffj, 
and resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things whicL 
\ wax most anxious about to this place ; particularly, I resolved tb 
iitiag hither my magazine of powder and all my spare arms, viz., tw« 
fewling-pieoes (for 1 had three in all) and three muskets, for of thoa 

bad eight in all ; so I kept at my castle orvly five, which stood ready 
aiounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence, and were ready, 
alio^ to take out upon any expedition. Dpon this occasion of remov- 
ing my ammunition I happened to open tho barrel of powder which 1 
took up out cf the sea, and which had been wet, and I found the 
water had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on 
every side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside 
like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good 
powder in the centre of the cask. This was a very agreeable dis- 
covery to me at that time, so I carried all away thither, nevsr keep' 
Uttg above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for 
fear of a surprise of any kind : I also carried Uiitner all the lead 1 
had left, for bullets. 

I fiELncied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which weie 
said to live in oaves and holes in the rocks, whore none could come at 
them, for I persuaded myseli'i while I was here, that if Ave handr(-« 
savsgas were to hunt me tliey could never find me out, or if they did, 
they wwuld not venture to attack me here. The old goit whom I 
6}und expiring died in the mouth <jf tho cave the next day after I 
made this discovery, and I found it much easier to dig % great hok- 
ther4, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to drag hiic 
oat, 80 I .Interred him there to prevent offence to my nose. 

I yns now in tho twenty-third year of my residence in tbv« iftland,

®9uld I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would ooirv« 
10 tho place to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitv 
latcd for spending the rest of my timo there, even to tho last momeut 
kill I had laid me down and died, like tho old goat iu the cave. I tav 
also arrived to some little diversions and amusements, which ma^e 
the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me th'in it did be- 
fore ; as, first, I had taught my Poll, as noted before, to speak, and he 
did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was 
v»ry pleasant to me, for I believe no bii'd ever spoke plainer, and he 
lived with me do less than eix-and- twenty years; how long he might 
\»r9 lived ftfterward I ksow pot, though I know ^ey have » actio*

gnn^, and afler some tune continually driving them from me, and let-

Meapt two or three favorites, which I kept taoo, and whose young

panots, which talked pretty well, and would all call " Bobin Oru-

Any of them that I had done with him. I had, also, several t&me »«ar 
Cowls, whoso names I knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and 
rat their wings; and the little stakes which I had planted before my 
oastle wall being now gi-own up to a good thick grove, these fowls all 
lived among these low trees and bred there, which was very agree- 
able to me, so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented

T wae now the month of December, as 1 said above, in mj 
twenty third year ; and this being the southern sulstioo (fo? 
winter I cannot call it), was the particular time of my harveeti 

and required my being protty much abroad in the fields ; 
when going out pretty early in the morning, even before it waf 
Ihorongh daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fir^ 
apon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles, toward 
the end of the island where I had observed some savages had been, 
M before ; and not on the other side, but, to my great affliction, it

yet I had no more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that 
if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my corn 
itanding or cut, or any of my works and improvements, they would 
immediately conclude that there were people in tho place, and would 
then never give over till they had found n© oat. Ic tbie extremity 
I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after mo, and 
^tade ail thing^s without look at* wild and natural as I could.

99Qnd a ffuali fire they had made^ not to warm them, fcrthe; had M 
aeed of that, the weather being extremely hoc, but, as I supposed, to 
drew acme of their barbarous diet of human flesh, which they had 
broQjcht with them, whether alive cr dead I could not tell. 

They bad two canoes with them, whioh they had hauled up apoa 
the shore ; and as it was then the tide of ebb, they seemed to ma to 
wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It was not easy to 
anagine what confusion this sight put me into, especially seeing theot 
<ome on my side of the island, and eo near me, too ; but when I coa- 
adered their coming must be always with the surrent of the ebb, I 
began, afterward, to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied thai 
f might go abroad with safety all the time of the tide of floods if 
they were not on shore before ; and having made this observation, ) 
went abroad about my harvest work with the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as the tide made to the 
westward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, as we call 
it) away. I should have observed, that for an hour or more before 
Uiey went off, they went a dancing ; and I could easily discern their 
posture? and gestures by my glass. I could not perceive, by my 
nicest observation, but that they were stark naked, o&d hs^ not the 
least covering upon them ; but whether they were mea o? tr^'mMi I 
eould not distinguish. 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two gwiB apon my 
iiouldors, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my 
aide, without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able tG>«naka, 
went away to the hill where I had discovered tha first appearano* of 
ill ] and as soon as I got thither, which was not in less tnan two 
hours (for I could not go apace, being so laden with arms as I was), 
i perceived there had been three canoes more of savages at thM 
place; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea together, 
making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to me, espo- 
oally aSj going down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror, 
whioh the dismal work they had been about had left behind it, via, 
the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh, of human bodies, eaten 
and devoured by those wretches with merriment and sport. I wae so 
illed with indignation at the sight, that I now began to premeditat* 
tiie destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be whom or how 
many soever. It seemed ev 'lent to me that the visits which they 
made thus to this island were H>t very frequent, foi it was above fif- 
te«i months before any more cf item came on shore there again ; thai

'° , at least not so fer , yet all this while I lived ancoa* 
fortttbly, by reason of tlie coastent apprehoneions of their coajing 
apon me by surprise : from whence I observe, that the expectation of 
wil ifl more bitter than the Buffering, especially if there is no roow 
(o thake off that expectation, or those apprehcntiions. 

During all this time I was in the murdering humor, and took up 
MOet of my hours, which should have been better employed, in ouzb- 
Iriying how to circumvent and fall upon them, the very next tiis9 S 
sboold see them ; especially if they snould be divided, as they were 
the last time, into two parties : nor did I consider at all, that if I 
killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, o* 
week, or month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infinitumj till 
I should be at length no lass a murderer than they were in being 
man-eaterB, and perhaps much more ao. I spent my days now in 
great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting that I should, one 
day or other, fall into tho hands of these merciless creatures ; and If 
I did, at any time venture abroad, it was not without looking around 
me with the greatest care and caution imaginable. And "ow I fcnind 
to my groat comfort, how happy it was that I provided tor a tame 
flock or herd of goats : for I durst not, upon any account, fire my 
gun, especially near that sido of the island, where they usually came, 
lest I should alarm the savages ; and if they had fled from me now, I 
was sure to have them come again, with perhaps two or tliree hun^ 
dred canoes with them, in a few days, and then I knew what to expect 
However, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever saw 
any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon 
obeerre. It is true, they might .have been there onee or twioo, but 
sther they made no stay, or at least I did not see them : but in the 
BQOnth of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my foar-and<

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen months 
tBterral, was vary great ; I slept unquiet, dreamed always fi-igktfal 
dreams, and often started out of my sleep ^n the night : in the day, 
great troubles overwhelmed my mind ; and in the night I dreamed 
oflen of killing the savages, and of the reasons why I might justify 
Uie doing of it But to waive all this for a while. It was in the

gan, T7hioh accordingly, in about half a minute, I heard ; and, by tha 
■9und, knew it was from that part of the sea where I was driyen down 
the onrrent Li my boat. I immediately considered that this must ba 
somo ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some oth«r 
ship V in company, and irad these guns for signals of distress, and 
to obtain help. 1 had the presence of mind, at that minute, tc 
think &at though 1 could not help them, it might be they might help 
me : so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and 
making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The 
wood was dry, and blazed freely ; and though the wind blew very 
hard, yet it burnt fairly out : ao that I was certain, if there was any 
such thing as a ship, they must naeds see it ; and no doubt they did ; 
fbr as soon as ever my fire biased up I heard another gun, and afbet 
that several ethers, all from the same quarter. I plied my ire all 
night long, till daybreak ; and when it was broad day, and the aix 
elaared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east ol 
the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not 
vHh my glass ; the distance was so great, and the weather still soi&a* 
tlsBg hazy also ; at loast it was so out at sea. 

I looked frequentJy at it all that day, and soon perceived that ltdi4 
uot move ; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor ; and 
bmng eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in mj 
hand, and ran toward the south side of the island, to the rocks whera 
I had formerly been carried away with the current; and getting «p 
ttiere, the woatner by this time being perfectly elaar, I could plainly 
see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the ai^^ 
apon &oee concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my bo«k ; 
and which rocke, as they checked the violence of the rtraam, fna. 
Hiade a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my re- 
«»Teiiag f torn the most desperate, hopeless eondition that ever tvvd

beea in. in all my lifSs. Thus, what is one mao't lafet; is jx6ihm 
laan'H destruction ; for it seeme these men, whoever they n^/fc, beinf 
,iBt of their knowledge, and the rocks being •wholly unde' water, had 
boen driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing iiard at E. N 
B. Uad they i«een the i!>land, as I must necessarily suppose they di4 
ftot, they must, as I thought, have endeavored to have saved theiu* 
ealves on shore by the help of their boats; but their firing offgaBa 
for help, especially when they saw, as I imagined my fire, filled nM 
with many ,thoughta. Hrst, I imagined that apon seeing my light^ 
feey might have put themselves into their boar^ end endeavored to 
B&ake the shore ; but that the sea going very high, they might have 
been oast away ; other times I imagined that they might have lost 
(heir boat before, an might be the case many ways — as partitfularly, 
by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times obliges 
men to stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it 
overboard with their own hands , other times 1 imagined they had 
•ome other ship or ships in company, who, upon the signals of distreM 
they had made, had taken them up and curried them off; other times 
I fancied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and being hur- 
ried away by the current that I had been tormerly in, were carried 
oat into the great ocean, where tbere was nothing but misery and 
perishing ; and that perhaps, they might by this time be starvLug, 
and in a condition to think of eating one another. 

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I WM 
in, 1 could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, 
and pity them ; which had still the good effect on my side, that it 
|ave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who bad so 
Izappily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition; 
iwid that of two ship's companies who were now cast away upon thii 
fe^ei of the wcrld, not one life should be spared but mine. I learned 
fep'^ again to observe, that it is very rare that the providence of Odd 
«aats us into any condition of life bo low, or any misery so great, bo* 
we tray see something or other to be thankful for, and may see othera 
in worse circumstances than our own. Such certainly was the our, 
of these men, of whom I could not so much as see room to suppo^a 
any of thorn were saved ; nothing could make it rational bo mach ai 
to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the poBBi 
bilitj only of their being taken up by another ship in company ; txki 
Hit was but mere pOBsibility, indeed, for I saw not the least sign of 
ifpaaranoe of such thing. I oannot explain, by any poaaible energy

HERE are some secret moving sprin^^s in tht affection^

or, though not in view, yet rendered preseut to the mind bj 
the power of imagination, that motioc carries out the hou^ 
by its mipetuosity, to such violent, eager enibraoiu^s of the objecl^ 
thai the absence of it is insupportable. Such were tbet^o earueet 
wishings that but one man had been saved. I believe I repeated the 
words : ** O that it had been but one I" a thousand times ; and my de- 
tires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the \vordi> my hands 
would clinch together, and my fisgers would press the {lahns of mj 
hands so, that if 1 had any %ofl thing in my hand it Wduld have

oould not part them again. Let the naturalists explain thei^e things

deecribe the fact, which was even surprising to me. when i found it 
tiioagh I knew not from whence it proceeded . it was doubtleus the

Christians would have been to me. Bui it was not to be ; either t) eii 
fa,t» or mine, or both, forbade it ; for. till the la.«it year of my being 
OB this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of that Hhi^

3f a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the iNlaud which wai 
nen the shipwreck. He had no clothes on but a seaman's wuiau-Jiat

to direct me so mnch as to guess what nation he was of; he had 
nothing in his pockets but two pieces-of-eight and a tobacco-pipe; 
the last was to me of ten times mere valuu tlian the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat 
to the wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that 
might be useful to me ; but that did not altogether press me so much, 
as the possibility that there might be yet some linng creature OD 
board, whose life I might not only save, but might, by saving that 
Kfe, comfort my own to the last degree. And this thought clung so 
to my heart, that I could not be quiet night or day,.but I must venture 
•ut in my boat on board this wreck; and committing the rest to God's 
|W0vidence, I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind 
tiiat it could not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible 
direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, 
prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great 
pot of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had 
still a great deal of that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus load- 
ing myself with everything necessary, I went down to my boat, got 
the water^ut of her, put her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and 
then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great bag 
of rice, the umbrella to set over my head for a shade, another large 
pot of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or barley- 
cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk and a cheese; 
all which, with great labor and sweat, I carried to my boat ; anrl 
praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out ; and rowing, or pad- 
dling, the canoe along the shore, came at last to the utmost point of 
the island on the northeast side. And now I was to launch out itito- 
the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture. I looned on th© 
rapid currents which ran constantly on both aides of the island at a dis- 
tance, and which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of 
the hasard I had been in before, and my heart began to fail me ; for 
I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those currents, I should 
be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach, or 
Bight of the island again ; and that, then, as my boat was but small, if 
any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

Those thoughts bo oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my 
enterprise ; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the 
shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a rising bit of ground, 
very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage .' 
\tlien^ ftff I was musing, ! could pcrceiTO that the tide was turned/ and 



ROBINSON CfitJSOE.^ 178 

tiiie fiood came on; upon which my going was impracticable for so 
many hours. Upon this, presently, it occurred to me that I should 
go up to the highest piece of ground I could find, and observe, if 1 
eould, how the sots of the tide, or currents, lay whtn the flood cam* 
in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might 
not expect to be driven another way home, with the same rapidnesa 
of the cun-ents. This thought was no sooner in my head than I cast 
my eye upon a little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both 
ways, and from whence I had a clear viev*" of the currents, or Bets of 
the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my return. Here 
I found, tiiat as the current of the ebb set out close by the south point 
of the ifik ud, bo tho current of the flood set in close by the shore of the 
north side ; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north eide 
of the island in my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encom-aged with this observation, I resolved, the next mc^ifaiug, to 
set cut with the fii'st of the tide ; and reposing myself for the night in 
my canoe, under the great watchcoat I mentioned, I launched out. I 
fii'st made a little out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit 
of the current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great 
rate, and yet did not so hurry me aa the current on the south side 
had done before, so as to take from me all g<SI"ernment of the boat; bufc 
having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate di» 
rectly for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. It 
was a dismal sight to look at ; the shi];), which, by its building, was 
Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks ; all the stern and 
quavter of her were beaten to pieces vnth the sea ; and as her fore- 
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great violence, her 
Biainmast and foremast were brought by the board, that is to say, 
broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bovr 
appeared firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, 
who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried ; and as soon as I called 
him, jumped into the sea to come to me. I took him into the boat, 
but found hisn almost dead with hunger and thirst. I gave him . a 
eakc of my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had 
been starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature 
some fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he Avonld hava 
burst himself. After this, I went on board ; but vhe first sight I met 
witji was two men drowned in the cook room, or forecastle of the 
ship, with their arms fast about one another, I cpncluded, as indeed 
probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea 
broke so high, and so continually over her, that the men were not

al)le to bear it, and were strangled with the constant rnehing In of tl/d 
waier. ns much as if they had been under water, hesiues the dog, 
there wiis nothing left in the ship that had life ; nor any goods, that I 
could 600, but what were spoiled by the water. There were some 
casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower 
in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see; but 
thuy were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which I 
believed belonged to some of the seamen j and I got two of them into 
the boat, without examining what was in them. Had the stern of the 
ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, 1 am persuaded I might 
have made a good voyage ; for by what I found in these two chests, I 
had room to suppose the tihip had a great deal of wealth on board; 
and, if I may guess from the couise she steered, she must have been 
bound from Buenos Ayre.s or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part 
of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havana, in the Gulf of Mex- 
ico, and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in 
her, but of no use, at that time, to anybody; and what became of her 
crew, I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about 
twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty. There 
were several muskets in txie cabin, and a great powder-horn, with 
about four pounds of powder in it ; as for the muskets, I had no occa- 
sion for them, so I left them, but took the powder-horn. I took afire- 
^hovcl and tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as also two little brass 
];cttlee, a copper pot to make chocolate and a gridiron ; and with this 
cargo, and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home 
again ; and the same oveairg. about an hour within night, I reached 
the island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I reposed 
that night in the boat; and in the niorning I resolved to harbor what 
I h;id got iu my new cavf , and not carry it home to my castle. After 
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on sh.ore, and began to examine 
the particulars. Tho cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but 
not such as we had at the Brazils, and in a word, not at all good : but 
when I came to open the chests, I found several things of great use to 
me ; for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraor. 
dinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine and very good ; the 
bottles held about throe pints each, and were tipped with silver. I 
found two pots of very good succadcs or sweetmeats, so fastened also 
on the top, that the sjilt water had not hurt them ; and two more of 
tho same which iho water had >;poilod. I found some very good shirts, 
which werg very weIu)Q;c to UiC ; uu4 ubout a dozen aud a half of 



-^5 

irlata Iben handkercliJeft and colored necfeclml •, tbe former were 
•Iso very- welcome, being exceeding refreshing l wipe my face in a 
bot day. Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I fouud 
three great bags of pieces-of-eight, which held about eleven hundred 
pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, nix doub- 
loons of gold and some small bars or wedges of gold : I suppose iliey 
might all weigh near a pound. In the other chests were some clothes, 
but of little value ; but by the circumstances, it must have belonged 
to the gunner's mate ; though there was no powder in it, except two 
pounds of fine glazed powder, in three small flasks, kept, I suppose 
for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, 1 goi 
very little by this voyage that wa« of any u.-e to uie ; for, as to th(* 
money, I had no manner of occasion for it ; h was to me as the diW 
under my feet ; and I wo^ld have given it all for three or four puii 
of English shoes and stockings, which were things 1 greaily wanted, 
but had none on my feet for many years. 1 had, indeed, got two pair» 
of shoes now, which 1 took off the feet of the two drowned uicu whoiu 
I saw in the wreck, and I found two pairs more in one of tiie cliests, 
which were very web-orae to me; but they were not like our Engli>li 
shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what we call puiupa 
than shoes. I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces-of-eight 
in rials, but no gold ; I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than 
the other, which seemed to belong to some officer. Well however, I 
lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up os I had done that 
before which I brought from our own ship ; but it was a great pity, 
as 1 said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my share; 
for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times over 
with money ; and thought I, "'If I ever escape to England, it might 
lie here safe enough till I may come again to fetch it." 

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I 
went back to my boat, and lowed or paddled her along the shore, to 
her old harbor, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to 
my old habitation, where I found everything safe and quiet. I began 
now to repose myself, live after my old feghion, and take care of my 
family affairs ; and for awhile, I lived easy enough, only that I was 
more vigilant than I used to be, looked out oftener, and did not go 
abroad so much ; and if, at any time, I did stir with any freedom, it 
wan always to the east part of the island, where I was pretty well 
satisfied the savages never came, and where I could ga without so 
many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I alway* 
carried with me if | w%ot th« other way. \ \\Y^i ^?\ this cQT»,^.iiiO'.^

near two years more ; but my unlucky head, that was always to let 
mo know it was born to make my body miserable, was all these two 
years filled with projects and designs, how, if it were possible, I might 
get away from this island ; for, sometimes, I was for making another 
voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there was nothiitg 
left there worth the hazard of my voyage ; sometimes, for a ramble 
aoe way, sometimes another ; and I believe verily, if I had had the 
boat that I went to Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound 
Kiywhere, I know not whither. I have been, in all my circumstances, 
* memento to those who are touched with the general plague of man- 
kind, whence, for aught I know, one half of their misex'ies flow ; I 
mean that of not being satisfied with the station wherein God and na- 
ture hath placed them ; for, not to look back upon my primitive con- 
dition, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to which 
was, as I may call it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the 
same kind had been the means of my coming into this miserable con- 
dition ; for had that Providence, which had so happily seated me at 
the Brazils as a planter, blessed me with confined desires, and I could 
have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been, 
by this time, I mean in the time of my being in this island, one of the 
most considerable planters in the Brazils ; nay, I am persuaded, that 
by the improvements I had made in that little time, I lived there, 
and the increase I should probably have made if I remained, I might 
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores. And what business 
had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation, improving 
and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea, to fetch negroes, when 
patience and time would have so increased our stock at home, that we 
oould have bought them at our own door from those whose business 
it was to fetch them ; and though it had cost us something more, yet 
the difFerence of that price was by no means worth saving at so great 
a basard ? But as this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflec- 
tion upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, 
or of the dear-bought experience of time ; so it was with me now- 
and yet so deep had the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could 
not satisfy myself in my station, but was continually poring upon the 
meaQs and possibility of my escape from this place, and that I may» 
with the greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remaining part 
ef my story, it may not be improper to give some account of my fi-rst

to th6 wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, amS 
my condition restored to what it was before ; I had more wealtli, indeed, 
than I had before, but was not at all the richer ; for I had no more uso 
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came thera 

Ife was one of the nights in the rainy season, in March, the four* 
and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of solitude, I 
was lying in my bed, or hammock, awake; very well in health, had 
no pain or distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of mind, 
more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so as 
to sleep ; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows : It ia 
impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirl- 
ed through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this 
night's time; I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, 
or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and 
also that part of my life since I came to this island. In my reflectiona 
upon the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I waa 
comjjaring the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my 
habitation here, compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which 
I had lived in, ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sandj 
not that I did not believe the savages had frequented the island even 
all the while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times 
on shore there ; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any 
apprehensions about it ; my satisfaction was perfect, though my dan- 
ger was the same, and I was as happynn not knowing my danger, aa 
if I had never really been exposed to it. This furnished my thoughts 
with many very profitable reflections, and particularly this one : How 
infinitely good that Providence is, which has provided, in its govern- 
ment of mankind, such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of 
things ; and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand dan. 
gers, the sight of which, if discovered to him would distract his miu<l 
and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm, by having the ewrents 
of things hid fi-om his eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers 
which surround him. 

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to 
reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years 
in this very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest secu- 
rity, and with all possiblo tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing 
but the brow of a hill, a great tre'^, or the casual approach of night, 
had been between me and th*> worst kind of destruction, viz., that of 
falling into the hands of cannibals and savages, who would haTe^ksi

(bought it no more a crime to kill and devour me than I did a pigeon 
ar a curlew. I would unjustly slander myself if I should say I was 
ttOt sincerely thankful to ray Great Preserver, to whose singular pro- 
tection I acknowledged, with great humility, all these unknown de- 
liverances were due, and without which 1 must inevitably have fallen 
into their merciless hands. 

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken 
Up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures (I mean the 
Bftvages), and how it came to pass in the world that the wise Governor 
of all things should give up any of his creatures to such inhumanity, 
hay, to something so much below even brutality itself, as to devour 
its own kind ; but as this ended in some (at that time) fruitless specu- 
lations, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the world these 
wretches lived in; how far off the coast was whence they came; 
what they ventured over so far from home for ; what kind of boats 
they had ; and why I might not order myself and my business so that 
I might be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me ? 

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do 
with myself when I went thither, what would become of me if I fell 
into the hands of the savages, or how I should escape from them if 
they attacked me : no, nor so muth as how it was possible for mc to 
reach the coast, and not be attacked by some or other of them, with- 
out any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should not fall into 
their hands, what I should do for provisions, or whither 1 should bend 
toy course. None of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my 
way, but my mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing 
over in my boat to the main land. I looked upon my present con 
dition as the most miserable that could possibly be; that I was noi 
able to throw myself into anything but death that could be calle'* 
worse ; and if I reached the shore of the main, I might perhaps meet 
with relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the African shore, tiU 
I came to some inhabited country, and where I might find some relief,- 
and after all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship that might 
lake me in ; and, if the worst came to the worst, I could but die, 
which would put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray note, all 
this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made 
desperate, as it were, by the long continuance of my troubles, and the 
disappointments I had met in the wreck I had been on board of, and 
where I had been so near obtaining what I so earnestly longed for,

\n(i6. 1 <vas agitated wholly by these thoughts ; all my calm of miud, 
in my resigiuitioii to Provideuce, aud •waiting the issue iu the dispo- 
Bilious of fleaveu, seemed to be suspended, aud I had, as it were, no 
power to turn my thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage 
to the main, which came upon me with such force, and such an im- 
petuosity of desire, that it was not to be resisted. 

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with 
such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and my pulse 
beat as if I had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervor 
of my mind about it, nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted 
with the very thought of it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would 
have thought I should have di-eamed of it, but I did not, nor of any- 
thing relating to it, but I dreamed that as I was going out in the 
morning, as usual, fr()m my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes, 
and eleven savages coming to land, and that they brought with them 
another savage, whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him, 
when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped 
away and ran for his life ; and I thought, in my sleep, that he came 
running into my little thick grove before my fortification to hide 
himself, and that 1, seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the 
others sought him in that way, showed myself to him, aud smiling 
upon him encouraged him ; that he kneeled down to me, seeming to 
pray me to assist him ; upon which I showed him my ladder, made 
him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became my servant; 
aud that, as soon as I had got this man, I said to myself, '' Now I may 
certainly venture to the main land, for this fellow will servo me as a 
pilot, and will tell me what to do, aud whither to go for provisions, 
and whither not to go, for fear of being devoured — what places to 
venture in, and what to shun." I waked with this thought, and was 
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my 
escape, in my dream, that the disappointment which I felt upon com- 
ing to myself, and finding that it was no more than a dream, were 
equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very great 
dejection of spirits. 

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion : that my only way to 
go about to attempt an escape was, if possible, to get a savage into 
my possession — and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners, 
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should bring hither to 
kill. But these thoughts still were attended with this dIfiBculty, that 
it was impossible to effect this withouj; n.ttao>in2 a whole caravan of

attempt, and might miscarry, but, on the other hand, I had greatly 
BCTOpled the lawfulness of it to myself, and my heart tremble 1 at the 
thought of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. 
I need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this, 
they being the same rcentioned before ; but, though I had other rea- 
sons to offei' now, viz.^ that those men were enemies to my life, and 
would devour me if they could ; that it was self-preservation in the 
highest degree to deliver myself from tliis death of a life, and was 
acting in my own defence as much as if they were actually assaulting 
me, and the like. I say, though these things argued for it, yet the 
thought of shedding human blood for my deliverance was very ter- 
rible to me, and such as I could by no means reconcile myself to for 
a great while. However, at last, after many secret disputes with my- 
self, and after great perplexities about it (for all these argument;?, one 
way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager, pre' 
vailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and 1 re- 
solved, if possible, to get one of those savages into my hands, cost 
what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this, 
mdeed, was very difficult to reeolve on ; but, as I could pitch upon no 
probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to 
see tbem when they came on bore, and leave the rest to the event 
taking such measures as t-he opportunity should present, let what 
would be. 

With these resolutions ha my tkoughts I set myself upon the scout 
as often as possible, and indeed so often that I was heartily tired of it, 
for it was above a year and a half that I waited, and for great part of 
that time went out to the west end, au^ to the southwest co:;ner of 
the island, almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. 
This was very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, though I 
cannot say that it did in this case (as it had done some time before) 
wear off the edge of my desire to the thing, but the longer it soemed 
to be delayed the more eager I was for it. In a word, I was not at 
first so careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being 
seen by them, as I was now eager to be upon them. * Besides, I fan- 
cied myself able to manage one, nay, two or three savages, if I had 
them, so as to make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I 
should direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do 
me any hiu't. It was a great while tliat I pleased myself with this 
affair, but nothing still presented ; all my fancies and schemes c&iac 
to nothing, for no more eavagcs came near me for a great •ffWle. 




ROBINSON OBUSOE. ;l8l 



Adbaimn rescues one of their Captives from the Savages, whoi lie oaaoes 
Friday, and makes Jiis Servant. 

BOUT a year and a half after I entertained these notions 
(and by long nursing had, as it were, resolved them all into 
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them into execu- 
tion), I was surprised one morning early, with eeebg no 
less than iive canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and 
the people who belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight. 
The nun:iber of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and 
knowing that they always came four or sis, or sometime* more, in a 
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take any measures, 
to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed ; so I lay still in my 
castle, perplexed and discomforted ; however, I put myself into all 
the same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, and was 
just ready for action, if anytliing had presented. Having waited a 
good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being 
very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered 
up to the top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual ; standing so, 
however, that my head did not appear above the hill, so that they 
oould not perceive me by any means. Here I observedT by the help 
of my perspective glass, that they were no less than thirty in num- 
ber ; that they had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed. 
How they bad cooked it I knew not, or what it was ; but they were all 
dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and figures 
their own way, round the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my perspective, 
two miserable wretches dragged from the boats, where it seems thtsy 
•were laid by. and were now brought out for the slaughter. I per- 
«edved one of them immediately fall, being knocked down, I suppose, 
with a club or wooden sword, for th»t was their way, and two or three 
©thers were at work immediately, cutting him open for their oookery, 
while the other victim was left standing by himself, till they should 
be ready for him. In that very moujcnt, this poor wretch, seeing 
himself a little at liberty, and unbound, nature inspired him with hopes 
of liR\ and he started avray from them, and ran with incredible swift- 
ness along the sands, directly toward me, I mean toward that part of 
the coast where my habitation was. I Avae dreadfully frightened, Z

must acknowledge, when 1 [.erceived him run my way^ and especially 
•when. H8 I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole body : and now 
I expected that part of my dream was coming to pass, and thut he 
would certainly take shelter in my grove ; but 1 could not depend, 
by cny means, upon my dieam for the rest of it, viz., that the other 
Bavages would not pursue him thither, and find him there. However, 
I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover, when I found that 
there was not above three men that followed him ; and still more 
was I encouraged when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly 
in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he could but hold 
it for half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them 
all. 

There was between them and my castle the creek, which I men- 
tioned often in the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes 
out of the ship ; and this 1 saw plainly he must necessarily swim 
over, or the poor wretch would be taken there ; but when the savages 
escaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide waa 
then up ; but plimging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or 
thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength and swift- 
ness. When the three persons came to the creek, I found that two of 
them could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on the 
other side, he looked at the others, but went no farther, and soon after 
went softly back again ; which, as it happened, was very well for him 
in the end. I observed, that the two who swam were yet more than 
twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow that was fled 
f, from them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed 
irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a servant, and perhaps 
companion or assistant, and that I was called plainly by Pj-ovidence 
to save this poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the laddors 
with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both 
at the foot of the ladders, as I observed above, and getting up again, 
with the same haste, to the top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea, 
and having a very short cut, and all down hill, placed myself in tho 
way between the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him • 
that fled, who, looking back, was at first, perhaps, as much frightened 
at me as at them ; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; 
and, in the meantime, I slowly advanced toward the two that fol- 
lowed : then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked him dowo 
with the stock of my piece. I was loath to fire, because I would not 
have the rest hear ; though, at that distance, it would not have been 
easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not 



RCBIN80N CRUSOE. ISi 

have easily known what to make of it. Having knocked this felldW 
down, the other who pursued him stopped, as if be had been fright* 
ened, and I advanced apace toward bini : but ae I came nearer, I 
perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to 
shoot at me ; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I 
did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who fled but 
had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as hd 
thought, yet was so frightened with the fire and noise of my piece, 
that he stood stock still, and neither went forward nor went back- 
ward, though he seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come on« 
I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come forward, which hd 
easily understood, and came a little way ; then stopped again, and 
then a little farther, and stopped again ; and I could then perceiv© 
that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had jusi 
been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned to him again 
to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I 
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every 
ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving his life. 
I bmiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to coma 
Still nearer ; at length he came close to me ; and then he kneeled 
down again, kissed the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, 
and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head : this, it seems, 
was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, 
and made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there 
was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the savage whom I knocked 
down was not killed but stunned with the blow, and began to come 
to himself; so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage, that he 
was not dead : upon this he spoke some words ,*o me, and though I 
could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear; 
for they were the first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my 
own excepted, for above twenty^five years. But there was no time 
for such reflections now; the savftge who was knocked down re- 
covered himself so far as to sit up upon the ground, and I perceived 
that my savage began to be afraid ; but when I saw that, I presented 
ray other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him : upon this my 
savage, for so I called him now, made a motfon to me to lend him 
my sword which hung naked in a belt by my side, which I did. He 
no sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow, cut off 
his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it 
sooner or better ; which I thought very strange for one who, I bad 
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except thei?

make their wooden fwords so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is bq 
hard) &ai they will cut oflF heads even with them, ay, and arinA, oad 
Ui&t it one blow, too. Wlien he had done this, he comes laug}ung to 
me, in eigri of triumph, and brought me the swcrd again, and wi^ 
abundanoe of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it down, with 
&he head of tho savage that he had killed, just before me. But that 
which astonished him most was to know how I killed the other Indian 
■» fiur off : 80 pointing to him, he made signs to me to let him %o to 
iuEfi ; BO I bade him go, as well as I could. When he came to him, he 
■tood like one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on one <iide, 
then on the other, looking at the wound tho bullet had made, which i^ 
neems, was just in his breast where it had made a hole, and no great 
quantity of blood had followed, but he had bled invrardly, for he was 
quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I 
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to 
mm that more might come after them. Upon this he made pgna to 
me that he should bury them with sand, <hat they might not be peen by 
the rMt, if they followed ; and so I made signs to him again to do so 
He ibU to work ; and, in an instant, he had scraped a hole in the sand 
with hie hands, big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him 
into it, oad covered him ; and did so by the other also , I believe he 
had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. Then calling him 
away, I carried him not to my castle, but quite away, to my cave, <m 
tlia fiurther part of the island ; so I did not let my dream come x> 
paos in that part, viz., that he came into my grove for shelter. Herd 
I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught o{ 
water, which I found he was indeed in great distress for, by his run- 
ning ; and having refreshed him, I made signs for him to go uid li« 
down to sleep, showing him a place where I had laid some rice straw 
and a blanket upon it, which I used to rioep upon myself sometioMi 
30 the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep 

He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly woU made, with 
atanught, strong limbs, not too large, tall, and well shaped, and as I 
reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a very good count»- 
aanoe, not a fiuroo and surly aspect, but seemed to have somethii>g 
very m'\nly in bin frvno ; and yet he had all the sweotnoBS and softness 
of a Earopean in his eountcnance, too, ospeoially when he smiled. 
His y*ii was long and black, HOt curled like wool, hln forehead very 
high and largo, and a great vifaoity aad sparkling sharpness in ha 
gyes. The color of J ' |0t quite black but very tawwy mi

oad dowB before, and after this made all tJie signs to me of subjection,

me luf Igng as he lived. I anderstood him in many things, and lei 
him knsfw I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I be- 
gui to apeak to him, and teach him to speak to me ; and, first, I 1^ 
him knew his name should be Fridat. which was the day I saved his 
life 5 I called him so fot the memory of the time. I likewise taught 
Mm to say " Master ;" and then let him know that was to be my 
ft&me ; I likewise taught him to say " yes " and " no," and to know 
the meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, and 
let lum see me drink it before him and sop my bread in it : and gave 
him a cake of bread to do the like, which ho quickly complied with, 
tnd made signs that it was very good for him, I kepi there with him 
all that night, but as soon as it was d».y I beckoned to him t<> coma

the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to tti€ 
piase, and showed me the marks that he had made to find them agai&, 
making signs to me that we dioold dig them up again and eat them. 
At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, mads

to him to come away, which he did immediately, with great sabmk-

tiie place where tbeue creatures had been, for I bad a miud now te 
get some fuller intelligeuce of them. TMiea I came to the place mj 
rery blood ran chill in my vdins, and my h«art suuk within me at the 
horror of the speciuule ; indeed it was a dreadful sight — at least it 
iru 80 to me, though Friday made nothing of it. The plnce w&« 
eorered with human bones, the grou a i dyed with their blood, and 
great pieces of flesh left here and there half eaten, maagled, and 
Boorohed, and, in shoi-t, all the tokens of 'Jie triumphant feast they 
bad been making there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw 
^iree skulls, live bauds, aud the bones of three or four legs and fee«, 
&nd abundance of other parts of the bodies ; aud Friday, by his iigoit, 
m&de me understand that they brought over four prisoners to fettsl 
upoi^ that three of them were eaten up, %nd that he, pointing to him* 
Bel^ was the fourth ; that there had beei> a great battle between them 
aud their next king, whose subjects it soems he had been one of^ and 
they had taken a great number of prisoners, till of which were earned 
to several places by tnose who had taken them La the fight, in order to 
feast upon them, as was done here by these wretckee upon those tMy 
brought hither. 

I caused Friday to gather up all the skulls, bones, flesh, and wh&i 
ever remained, and lay them together in a heap, and make a great 
fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. J found Friday had still a 
hankering stomacii after some of the flesh, 4ud was still a cannibal in 
his n<iture ; but I diiicovered so much abhorrence at the very thought 
of it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst not discover it— 
&r I had, by some means, let him know that I would kill him if he 
offered it. 

When bo had done this we came back to our castle, and there I fell 
ko work for my man Friday ; and, firnt of all, I gave him a pair uf 
linen drawers, which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I mer< 
tioned which I found in the wreck, and which, with a little altera- 
iioQ, fitted him very well, and then I made him a jerkin of goat^s 
skin, as well as my skill would allow (for I was now grown a tulet^ 
able good tailor), aud I gave tiim a cap, which I made of nare's gkin,

Awkwardly in those clothes at first ; wearing the drawers was very 
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waiaicoat galled his ehoul. 
ders aud the inside of his arms, but after a little easing them where 
he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them, he took te 
them at length very well. 

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to 
consider where I should lodge him ; and that I might do well for him, 
ana yet be perfectly easy myself, made a little tent for him in the 
vacant place between my two fortifications, in the inside of the last 
ana in the outside of the first. As there was a door or entrance there 
into my cave, I made a formal framed doorcase, and a door to it of 
boards, and set it up in the passage, a .little within the entrance ; and 
causing the door to open in the inside, I barred it up in the night, 
taking in my ladders too ; so that Fridiiy could no way come at me in 
the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much noise in 
getting over, that it must needs waken me ; for my first wall had now a 
complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning 
up to the side of the hill ; which was again laid across with smaller 
eticks, instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with 
the rice straw, which was strong, like reeds ; and at the hole or place 
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of 
trap door, which if it had been attempted on the outside, would not 
bave opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great 
noise ; as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. But 
I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had a more faith- 
ful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without passions, 
willenness, or designs, perfectly obliged and engaged — his very afiec- 
tions were tied to me, like those of a child to a father ; aud, I dar« 
say, he would have sacrificed his life for the saving of mine upon an} 
occasion w'^atsoever ; the many testimonies he gave me of this put it 
out of doubt, and soon convinced me that I needed to use no precau* 
tions, as to my safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wondar, 
that however it had pleased God, in his providence, and in the govern- 
ment of the works of his hands, to take from so great a part of the 
world of his creatures the best uses to which their fiiculties and the 
powers of their souls are adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon them 
the same powers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sen- 
timents of kindness and obligation, the same passions and re-sentments 
of wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the 
cr.r>acitie8 of doing good, aud receiving good, that he has given to us;

melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions present- 
ed, how mean a use we make of all these, even though we have thesff 
powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of 
Giod, and by the knowledge of his word added to our understanding ; 
and why it has pleased God to hide the like saving knowledge from 
so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, 
would make a much better use of it than wo did. From hence, I 
sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence, 
and as it were arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of 
things, that should hide that light from some and reveal it to others, 
and yet expect a like duty from both j but I shut it up, and checked 
my thoughts with this conclusion : first, that we did not know by 
what light and law these should be condenmed ; but that as God was 
necessarily, and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and just, so 
it could not be, but if these creatures were all sentenced to absence 
from himself, it was on acoount of sinning against that light, which, 
as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules a« 
theh- consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation 
was not discovered to us ; and, secondly, that still, as wo all are the

Sofeiiiieon inetnzcts and civilizes his Man Friday— Endeavors to g^ve Him an 
Idea of Christianity. 

FTER I hod been two or three days returned to my caatle, ^ 
thought that in order to bring Friday off from his horrid 
way of feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's Btomao)^, 
I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out witti 
me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid 
out of my own flock, and bring it home and dress it, but as I was going, 
I eaw a she goat lying down in tho diade, and two young kids sitting 
ly her. I catchcd hold of Friday—" Hold," said I ; " stand still ;* 
tod made signs to him not to stir ; immediately I presented my piece, 
shot, and killed one of the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a 
distance, indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy, but did not know 
nor could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised, trembled 
and shook, and looked so amazed, that I thought ho would have sunk 
4own. He did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, 
but ripped up his waistcoat to feel whether he wcs not wounded, and 
as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him ; for he came 
and kneeled down to me, and embraced my knees, said a great many 
things I did not understand ; but I could easily see the meaning was, 
to pray me not to kill him. 

I Boon found a way to comdnce him that I would do him no harm ; 
and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the 
kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he di^ ; 
and while he was wondering, and ' ooking to see how the creature wsks 
killed, I loaded my gun again. By-and-by, I saw a great fowl, like a 
hawk, sitting upon a tree, within shot ; so, to let Friday understand a lit- 
tle what I would do, I called to him again, pointed at tho fowl, which 
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk : I say, point- 
ing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under the parrot 
to let him see I would make it fall, I made him understand that I would 
shoot and kill that bird ; acoordingly, I fired, and bade him look, and 
immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened 
again, notwithstanding all I had said to him : and I found he was the 
more axuazed, because he did not see me put anything into the guo, 
bxife thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death a&d de- 
etrtictioti in that thing, able to kill man, beast Of bird, or anything

near or far off; aod th^ ssetoiiahmdnt this created in him was inch, as 
could not wear off for a long time ; and I believe, if I would have let 
him, he would have worehipped me and uiy gun. As for the gun itself, 
he would not so much as touch it for feveral days after ; but he would 
speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by 
himself; which, as I afterward learned of him, was to desire it not to 
kill him. Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I point- 
ed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but stay- 
ed some time ; for the parrot not being quite dead, had fluttered away 
a good distance from the place where she fell : however he found her, 
took her up, and brought her to me, and as I had perceived his ignor- 
ance about the gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, 
and not to let him see me do it, that I might be ready for any other 
mark that might present; but nothing more offered at that time; so I 
brought home the kid, and the same evening I took the skin off, and 
cat it off as well as I could ; and having a pot fit for that purpose, I 
boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good broth. 
After I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed 
very glad of it, and liked it very well : but that which was strangest 
to him, was to see me eat salt with it. He made a sign to me that the 
salt was not good to eat; and putting a little into his mouth, he seem' 
ed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth 
with fresh water after it ; on the other hand, I took some meat into 
my mouth without salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of 
salt, as fast as he had done at the salt ; but it would not do ; he would 
never care for salt with his meat or in his broth ; at least not for a 
great while, and then but very little. 

Havmg thus fed him with broiled meat and broth, I was resolved 
to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of the kid ; this I did, 
by hanging it before the fire on a string, as I had seen many peop'e 
do in England, setting two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and 
one across on the top, and tying the string to the orosp-stick, letting 
the meat turn continually. This, Friday admired very much ; but 
when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me bow 
well he liked it, that I could not understand him ; and at last he told 
me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's flesh any more, 
which I was very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work beating some corn out, and sifting 
it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before ; and he soon un- 
derstood how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what 
the meaning of it was, and that it was to make hread of it ; for aftef 



ROBIKSON CRUSOfi. . 391 

that 1 let him see rac make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little 
time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as well as I could do 
it myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of 
one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger 
quantity of corn than I used to do ; so I marked out a larger piece of 
land, and began the fence in the same manner as before, in which 
Friday worked not only very willingly and very hard, but did it very 
cheerfully ; and I told him what it was for ; that it was for corn to 
make more bread, because he was now with me, and that I might have 
enough for him and myself too. He appeared very sensible of that 
part, and let me know that he thought I had much more labor upoa 
me on his account than I had for myself; and that he would work tb« 
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place. 
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost 
everything I had occasion to call for, and of every pluce I had to 
Bend him to, and talked a great deal to me ; bo that, in short, I now 
began to have some use for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had 
very little occasion for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides 
the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the 
fellow himself; his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to me more 
and more every day, and I began really to love the creature ; and, oa 
his side, I beUeve he loved me more than it was possible for him ever 
to love anything before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination to hia 
own country again; and having taught him English so well that he could 
answer me almost any question, I asked him whether the nation that 
he belonged to, never conquered in battle ? At which be smiled, and 
said, "Yes, yes, we always fight the better:" that is, he meant, al- 
ways get the better in fight ; and so we began the following dis- 
course : — 

Master. You always fight the better ? how came you to be takea 
prisoner, then, Friday ? 

Friday. My nation beat much, for all that. 

Master. How beat ? If your nation beat them, how came you to ba 
taken 1 

Friday. They more many than my nation in the place where mo 
was; they take one, two, three, and me ; my nation overheat them in 
th« yonder place, where me no was ; there my nation take one, tw(^ 
gr«at thousand. 



192 ADVENTURES OF 

Master. But why did not your side recover you from the hands of 
your enemies, then ? 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go m the 
canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with the mea 
tbey take ? Bo they carry them away and eat them as these did ? 

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too ; eat all up. 

Master. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other place, where they think. 

Master. Do they come hither 1 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither ; some other else place. 

Master. Have you been here with them ? 

Friday, Yes, I have been here ; (points to the N. W. side of the 
island, which, it seems, was their side.) 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been 
among the savages who used to come on shore on the farther pnrt of 
th« idand, on the same man-eating occasions he was now brought for; 
and some time after, when I took the courage to carry him to that 
side, being the same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew the 
place, and told me he was there once when they eat up twenty men, 
two women, and one child ; he could not tell twenty in English, but 
he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a row, and pointing 
to me to tell them over. 

I have told this passage, beoauso it introduces what follows ; that 
after I had tliis discourse with him, I asked him how far it was from 
our island to the shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost. 
He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but tlaat, after 
a little way out to sea, there was a current and wind, always one way 
in the morning, the other in the afternoon. This I understood to b» 
no more than the seta of the tide, as going out or coming in j but 1 
afterward understood it was occasioned by the great draft and reflux 
ef the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth or gulf of wliioh river, as 
I found afterwai'd, our island lay ; and that this land which I per- 
oeived to the W. and N. W. was the great island of TrLddad, on the 
north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thoosajid 
quostions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and 
what nations wore near ; ho told me all he knew, with the greatest 
openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the eeverai nationsi 
©f his sort of people, but got no other name than Caribs ; from wlicnce 
he understood, that those were the Carribees, which our maps place 
p& the part of America which reaches from the moutlj of the river 



EOBINSON CRU3(». 193 

Orooooko to Guiana, and onward to St. Martha. He told m© tliat 
up a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the 
moon, which must be west from their country, there dwelt white 
bearded men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I 
mentioned before ; and that they had killed much mans, that was his 
word ; by all which I understood, he meant the Spaniards, whose 
cruelties in America had been spread over the whole country, and 
were remembered by all tho nations, from father to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might go from this island aad 
get among those white men ; he told me, " Y(»s, yes, you may go io 
two eanoe." I could not understand what he meant, or make bins 
describe to me what he meant by two canoe ; till, at last, with great 
difficulty, I found he meant it must be in a large boat, as big as two 
canoes. This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with me very 
Avell ; and from this time I entertained some hopes that, one time o? 
other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this place^ 
and that this poor savage might be a means to help me. 




Eobinson and Friday build a Canoe to carry Them to Friday's Country— Their 
Scheme prevented by the Arrival of a Party of Savages. 

FTER Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and 
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak 
pretty tlucntly, though in broken English, to me, I acquaint- 
ed him with my own history, or at least so much of it aa re- 
lated to my coming to this place, how I had lived here, and how long. 
I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder and 
bullet, and taught him how to shoot. T gave him a knife, which he 
was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a belt with a frog 
lianging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the 
frog, instead of a hangar I gave him a hatchet, whicli was not only as 
good a weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon other oc- 
casions, 

I described to him tho country of Europe, particularly England, 
which I came from ; how wo lived, how we worshipped God, how wo 
behaved to one another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of 
the wwfld. I gave him an j/scouat of the wreck which X had 'beea on

board of, and showed him, as near as I could, the place Trhere she 
lay, but she was all beaten in pieces before and gone. I showed h'n•^ 
the rains of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which I 
could not stir with my whole strength then, but was now fallen almc'-!; 
all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat Friday stood musing a great 
while and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upo:.? 
At last, says he, " Me se^ such boat like come to place at my nation." 
I did not understand him a good while, but at last, when I had ex- 
amined farther into it, I understood by him that a boat, such as that 
had been, came on shore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as 
he explained it, was driven thither by stress of weather. I presently 
imagined that some European ship must have been cast away upon 
their coast, and the boat might get loose and drive ashore, but was so 
dull that I never once thought of men making their escape from a 
wreck thither, much less whence they might come, so I only inquired 
after a description of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough, but brought me bet. 
ter to understand him when he added, with some warmth, " We sava 
ihe white mans from drown." Then I presently asked him if there 
were any white mans, as he called them, in the boat. " Yes," he 
said, " the boat full of white mans." I asked him " How many ?" He 
told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him then, "What became of 
them ?" He told me " They live ; they dwell at my nation " 

This put new thoughts into my head, for I presently imagined that 
these might be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in 
the sight of my island, as I now called it, and who, after the ship was 
struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved them- 
selves in their boat, and were landed upon that wild shore among the 
savages. Upon this 1 inquired of him more critically what was be- 
come of them. He assured me they still lived there ; that they had 
been there about four years; that the savages let them alone, and 
gave them victuals to live on. I asked him how it came to pass they 
did not kill them and eat them. He said, " No, they make brother 
with them ;" that is, as I understood him, a truce ; and then he add- 
ed, " They no eat mans but when the wa«r fight."' That is to say, they 
never eat any men but such as come to fight with them, and are taken 
in battle. 

It was after this some considerable time, that, being upon the top 
"sf the hill, at the east side of the island, whence, as I have said I had, 
in a clear day, discovered the main, or continent of America, Friday, 
the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly toward the m»«ia

land, and, In t> rind of surprise, falls a jumping and uiuicing, and calls 
out to me, for 1 was at BOuie distauce from him. 1 asked bini what 
■was the matter. '* joy !" saya he ; "0 glad ! there, see my coun- 
try, there my nation !" I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure 
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance dis- 
cov rod a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own 
country again. This observation of mine put a great many thoughts 
into me, which made me at first not so easy about my new man, Fri. 
day, as I was before ; and I made no doubt but that if Friday could 
get back to his own nation again, he would not only forget all his re» 
Ugion but all liis obligation to me, and would be forward enough t« 
give his countrymen an account of me, and come back, perhaps, with 
a hundred or two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which ha 
might be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies, wheji 
they were taken in war. But I wronged the poor honest creatur« 
very much, for which I was very sorry afterward. However, as my 
jealousy increased, and held me some weeks, I was a little more cir- 
cumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before ; in which I 
was certainly in the wrong, too, the honest grateful creature having 
no thought about it but what consisted with the best principles, both 
as a religious Christian and as a grateful Mend, as appeared after« 
ward to my full satisfaction. 

While my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day 
pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts 
which I suspected were in him, but I found everything he said was 
so hone.«t and so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my 
Buspicion, and in bpite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last en- 
tirely his own again ; nor did he, in the least, perceive that I waa 
uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at 
sea, so that wo could not see the continent, I called to him and said, 
•* Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own country, your own na- 
tion V " Yes," he said, " I be much O glad to bo at my own nation.*' 
" What would you do there ?" said I. " Would you turn wild again, eat 
men's flesh again, and be a savage, as you wore before ?" lie looked full 
of concern, and shaking his head.said," No, no ; Friday tell them to live 
good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn bread, cattle flesh, 
milk ; no eat man again." " Why, then," said I to him, " they will kill 
you." Ha looked grave at that, and then said, " No, no, ihey no kill 
me, they willing love learn." He meant by this they would be will- 
Uig to learn. He added,^- They, learned much of the bearded maiw

ibhi oame in tto boat" Theo I aaked him «lf &» ^ooM go hksSi *f. 
Ihem." He emiled at that, and told me he could not swim so &r 
i told him I voold make a canoe for him. He told me he would ^ 
if I would go with him. " I go !" says I ; « wh j, they will eat me 
\fl oomo there." "No, no," says he; "me make them no eat yoa 
me make them maoh love yoa." He meant he would tell them how 
[ had killed his enemies and saved his life, and so he woald makt 
ibem loTe me. Then he told me, as well aa he could, how kind they 
were to serenteen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who 
Moae ashore there in distress. 

From this time I confess I had a mind to ventrire over and see if I 
eoold possibly join with those bearded men, who, I made no doubt, 
were Spaniards and Portuguese, not doubting but if I could we might 
taA some method to escape thence, hdng upon the continent, and in a 
good compasy together, better than I could from an island forty miles 
off the shore, and alone, without help. So, after some days, I took 
Friday to worit again, by way of discourse, and told him I would give 
him a boat to go back to hie own nation, and accordingly I carried 
him to my firigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and bar- 
ing cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in water) I brought 
it out, showed it Iiim, and we both wont into it. I found be was a 
BKMt dexterous fellow at managin|r H, and would make it go almost as 
swift agam as I could. So, whea ae was la, I said to him, " Well, 
aow, Friday, shall we go to your nation t" He looked rery dull at 
my saying so ; which, it seems, was because he thought the boat to9 
Bnall to go so &r ; I then told him I had a bigger ; so the next day 
I went to the place where the first boat lay which I had made, but 
which I oould not got into the water. He said that was big enough 
^ut then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three 
.lad twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it that it was in a 
aaanner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do Tory well, and 
^ would carry much esongb Tittle, drink, broad;" that was his way 
ef talking. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design ol 
going orer with him to the continent, that I told him we would go 
and make one as big as that, and he should go home in it. He an* 
swered not one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked him 
what was the matter with him. He asked me again, " Why yoi 
tagry road with Friday T What me done T" I asked him whas k» 
meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all. " No angry P

ftWAy to my nation?" " Why," says I, Friday, "did yon not say you 
T*i«hed you were there?" " Yes, yes," says he, " wish we both there, 
no wish Friday there, no master there." In a word, he would not 
think of going there without me. "1 go there, Friday " says I 
"what shall I do there?" He returned very quick upon me at thi.s. 
"Yon do great deal much good," says he ; " you teach wild mans b® 
good, Bober tame mans ; you tell them know God, pray God, and live 
neyr life." "Alas, Friday," says I, "thou knowest not whai thou 
ssyest ; I am but an ignorant man myself." "Yes, yes," says he 
" you teachee me good, you teachee them good." " No, no, Friday," 
says I, "you shall go without me, leave me here to live by myself, a? 
I did before." He looked confused again at that word, and running 
to one of th# hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, 
and gives it to me. "What must I do with this?" says I to hioi 
" You take kill Friday, " says he. "What must I kill you for?" said 
I again. He returns very quick: "What yon send Friday away for? 
Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly, 
ihat I saw tears stand in his eyes : in a word, I ^so plainly discovered 
the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that 1 
told him then, and often after, that I would never send him away 
from me, if he was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found, by all discourse, a settled affection to 
me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the 
foundation of his desire to go to his own country was laid in his 
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my doing them good 
a thing, which as I had no notion of myself, so I had ^not the leas^ 
thought, or intention, or desire of undertaking. Sut still I found a 
strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as above, founded on 
the supposition gathered from the discourse, viz., that there were 
seventeen bearded men there ; and, therefore, without any more delay 
I went to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to form 
and make a large perigaua or canoe, to undertake the voyage. 
There were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, say 
of periaguas, or canoes, but even of good large vessels ; but the main 
thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we might 
launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at 
first. At last, Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found he knew muck 
better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell, t» 
this day, what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it was 
very Uke the tree we call fustic, or between that and the Nicarag«» 
wood, for it was niticli of the same color and smell. Friday was Ust

IxmiBg th« hollow ot e&Tity of this tree oat, to ma.^e it for a i>^> «4) 
but I showed him how to out it with tools ; which, after I Jaiui ehow»4 
him how to use, he did very handily : and in about a saoutb's ba>rd 
labor, we finished it, and made it very handsome; especially when, 
with our axes, which I showed him how to handle^ we cut and hewed 
the outside into the trne shape of a boat. After this, however, it cobI 
us near a fortnight's time to get her along, af it were inch by inch, 
■poB great rollers, into the water, but whes she was in, she would 
tere carried twenty men with great ease. 

Wheki she was in the water, and thoggh she was so bis;, it amazed 
ma to see with what dexterity and how swift my man Friday would 
manage her, turn her, aud paddle ner along. So I asked him if he 
would, and if we might, venture over in her. " Yes," he said ; " we 
TCnture over in her very well, though great blow wind." However, 
I had a further design, that he kaew nothing of, and that wat> to make 
A mast aud a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable. As to a 
malt, that was easy enoagb to get : so I pitched upon a straight young 
oedar tree, which 1 found near the place, and which there were ( 
great plenty of in the inland, and I set Friday to work to cut it I'jvra 
aad gave him directions bow to shape and cr^er it. But as to th 
■ail, that was my particular care. I knew I had old nails, or rathei 
pieces of old sails enough, but as I had had them now six-and-twentj 
years by me, and not been very careful to preserve them, not imagin 
Uig that 1 should ever have this kind of use for thsm, I did net duub^ 
hut that they were all rotten, and, indeed, most of them were sc 
However, 1 found two pieces which appeared pretty good, and witl; 
these I went to work, aud with a great deal of paiug aud awkward 
■titching, you may be sure, for want of needles, I at length made a 
tttree-comered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulde'' 
#f-muttou sail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at 
the top, such as nsually our ship's long boats sail with, and such as I 
beat knew how to manage ; as it was such a one I had to the boat ia 
which I made my escape from Barbary, as related in the .^rst part ^f 
mj story. 

I was near two months performing this la^t work, nz , riggbg aiid 
ttting my mast and sails, for I finished them very complete, makicg 
a imall stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we ethould turi to 
windward ; and, which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to thf stern 
of her to steer with. I was but a bungling shipwright, yet ae i kfw 
tkd asefuluess and even necessity of such a thing, I applied v>j<!eli 
wtth so muoft p«ins to dc it that at last I brought it to f Mt : thou|^ 



ROSniflON ORITBOB. 199 

consideriQg the many dull contrivances I had for it that &iled, I think 
it cost mo almost as much labor as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what 
belonged to the navigation of my boat, for though he knew very wei? 
how to paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and 
a rudder, and was the most amazed wh«i he saw me work the boat 
to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the sail jibed, and 
filled this way or that way, as the course we sailed changed j I say, 
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed. However, 
with a little use, I made all these things familiar to him, and he be< 
came an expert sailor, except that, as to the compass, I could mako 
him understand very little of that. On the other hand, as there wo» 
very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those partis^ 
there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars wer* 
always to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy 
seasons, and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or lea. 

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity 
in this place, though the three last years that I had this creature with 
me ought rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being 
quite of another kind than in all the rest of the time. I kept the anui« 
versary of my landing here with the same thankfulness to God for 
his mercies, as at first ; and if I had such cause of acknowledgment 
at first, I had much more so now, having such additional testimonies 
of the cai-e of providence over me, and the great hopes I had of being 
effectually and speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impres> 
eion upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand and that I 
should not be another year in this place. I went on, however, with 
my husbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. I gathered 
and cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing as before. 

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when I kept more 
within doors than at other times. We had stowed our own vessel as 
secure as we oould, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said* 
in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the ship ; and hauling her 
up to the shore, at high-water mark, I made my man Friday dig a 
little dock, just big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to giv« 
her water enough to float in ; and then, when the tide was out, w« 
made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the water out ; and 
so she lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea ; and to keep the rain off, 
we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick, that she was as well 
thatched as a house ; and thus we waited for the months of Noven*' 
her and December, in which I designed to make my adveature. 



200 ADVENTURES OB^ 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my 
design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the 
voyage, and the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of 
provisions, being the stores for our voyage; and intended, in a wee^ 
or fortnigh-t's time, to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I waa 
busy one morning upon something of this kind, when I called to Frj. 
day, and bid him go to the seashore, and see if he could find a turtle, 
^r tortoise, a thing which we generally got once a week, for the sake 
of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone 
when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, or fence, 
Jiko one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; anc) 
Ibefore I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, " master ! 
master ! sorrow ! bad !" '♦ What's the matter, Friday V says I. 
" Oh, yonder there," says he, " one, two, three, canoe ; one, two, three !'' 
By this way of speaking, I concluded there were six ; but on inquiry, 
I found it was but three. *•' Well, Friday," says I, '' do not be fright- 
ened !" So I heartened him up as well as I could ; however, I saw the 
poor fellow was most terribly scared ; for nothing ran in his head but 
that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, 
and eat him ; and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew 
what to do with him. I comforted him as well as I could, and told 
him I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me as 
well as him. But, says I, " Friday, we must resolve to fight them. 
Can you fight, Friday ?" " Me shoot," says he ; " but there come many 
great number.i" " No matter for that," said I, again ; " our guns will 
jfright them that we do not kill." So I asked him whether, if I resoU 
ved to defend him he would defend me, and stand by me; and do just 
as I bid him. He said, " Me die, when you bid die, master." So I 
went and fetched a good dram of rum and gave liim ; for I had been 
so good a husband of my rum, that I had a ;reat deal left. When ha 
drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which we always 
carried, and loaded them with large swan shot, as big as small pistol- 
bullets ; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs 
and five small bullets each ; and my two pistols I loaded with a brace 
of bullets each; I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my 
side; and gave Friday his hatcliet. When I had thus prepared my- 
self, I took my perspective glass, and went up to the side of the hill, 
to see what I could discover ; and I found quickly, by my glass, that 
there were one-and-twcnty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes , 
and that their whole business seemed to be thu triumphant banquet 
«u>OQ these throe human bodies ; a 1»arbarous feast, indeed ! but uoth-

ing more than, as I had observed, was usual with them. ' I observed^ 
also, that they were landed, not where they had done when Fridiiy 
made his escape, bufe nearer to my creek ; where the shore was low, 
and where a thick Avood came almost close down to the sea. This, 
with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these wretches came about, 
filled mo with such indignation, that I came down again to Friday, 
and told him I was resolved to go down to them and kill them all • 
and asked him if he would stand by me. He had now got over his 
fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given 
him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would " die when 
I bid die." 

In this fit of fury, I took and divided the arms which I had charged, 
as before, between us : I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, 
ajid three guns upon his shoulder ; and I took one pistol, and the 
other three guns myself; and in this posture we marched out. I took 
a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag 
with more powder and bullets ; and as to orders, 1 charged him to 
keep close behind me, and not to stir or shoot, or do anything, till I 
bid him ; and in the meantime, not to speak a word. In this posture, 
I fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get 
over the ci-eek as to get into the wood, so that I might come within 
shot of them before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my 
glass, it was easy to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, J 
began to abate my resolution ; I do not moan that I entertained any 
fear of their number; for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it 
was certain I was superior to them ; nay, though I had been alone. 
But it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less 
what necessity I was in, to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack 
people who had neither done nor intended me any wrong ; .who, as 
to me, were innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their own 
disaster ; being in them, a token indeed of God's having left them, 
with the other nations of that part of the world, to such stupidity, 
and to such inhuman courses . but did not call me to take upon me to 
be a judge of their actions, much less an executioner of his justice ; 
that whenever he thought fit, he would take the cause into his own 
hands, and, by national vengeance, punish them, as a people, for na- 
tional crimes ; but that, in the meantime, it was none of my business; 
that it was true, Friday might justify it, because he was a declared 
enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular people, and it 
was lawful for him to attack them ; but I could not saj the same with 



i02 AOVEm-UMS OP 

respect to myBelf. Theeo things were so warmly pressed upoh mjf 
thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved 1 would jo and place 
myself near them, that I miglit observe their barbarous least, and liiac 
I would act then as God should direct; but that unless houicthiiig 
offered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, 1 would not 
meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood ; and, with all possible 
wariness and silence, Friday followed close at my heels, I marched 
till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was next to 
them, only that one corner of the wood, lay between mo and them. 
Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a great tree, which 
was just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and 
bring me word if he could see there plainly what they were doing. 
He did so ; and came immediately back to me, and told me that they 
might be plainly viewed there; that they were all about their fire, 
eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound 
upon the sand, a little from them, which, he said, they would killnext^ 
and which fired all the very soul within me. He told me it was not 
one of their nation, but one of the bearded men he had told me of, 
that came to their country in the boat. I was filled with horror at 
the very naming the white bearded man ; and going to the tree, I saw 
plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the beach of the sea 
with bis hands and feet tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that 
he waa a European, and bad clothes on. 

There waa another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifky 
yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by going i 
Httle way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then 
I should be within half a shot of them ; so I withheld my passion, 
though I was indeed enraged to the highest degree ; and going back 
about twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which held all the 
way till I came to the other tree ; and then came to a little rising 
ground, which gavA me a full view of them, at the distauc: . ^"bom 
f ighty yards.

HAD now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the dreadful 
wretches eat upon the ground, all closely huddled together 
and had just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian^ 
and bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire ; and they 
were stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri. 
day— "Now, Friday,'' said I, "do aa I bid thee." Friday said he 
would. " Then, Friday,'" says I, •' do exactly as you see me do ; fail 
in nothing." So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece 
upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with my other 
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him to do the like ; 
then asking him if he was ready, he said " Yes." " Then fire at 
them," said I ; and the same moment I fired also. 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he 
shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my 
eide, I killed one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, 
in o dreadful consternation ; and all of them who were not hurt 
jumped upon their feet, but did not immediately know which way to 
run, or which way to look, for they knew not from whence their de- 
etruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that, as I had 
bid him, he might observe what I did ; so, as soon as the first shot 
was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, 
*nd Friday did the like ; he saw mo cock and present ; he did the 
same again. " Are you ready, Friday ?*' said I. " Yes," says he. 
" Let fly, then," says I, " in the name of God I" And with that, I 
fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday ; and aa 
our pieces were now loaded with what I call swan-shot, or small pis. 
tol bullets, we found only two drop, but so many were wounded, that 
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody 
and most miserably wounded, whereof three more fell quickly after, 
though not quite dead. 

'•' Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and 
taking up the musket which was yet loaded, " follow me," which h^ 
did) with a great deal of courajg^e ; upon which I rushed oat «f th« 



204 ADVENTURES OP 

wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at r/iy foot. As soon as 1 
perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday 
do so too ; and running as fast as I could, which, by the way, was 
not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly 
toward the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach, or 
shore, between the place they sat and the sea. The two butchers, 
who were just going to work with him, had left him at the suiprise 
of our first fire, and fled at a terrible fright to the sea-side, and 
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. 
I turned to Friday, and bade liim stop forward, and fire at them ; he 
understood me immediately, and running about forty yards, to be 
nearer them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed them all, 
for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though I saw two of 
them up again quickly; however, he killed two of them, and wounded 
the third, so that he lajpfiown in the bottom of the boat as if he had 
been dead. 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife, and cut 
the flags that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his hands and feet^ 
I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he 
was. He answered in Latin, " Christianus ;" but was so weak and 
faint that he could scarce stand or speak. I took my bottle out of my 
pocket, and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, which he 
did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he ate. Then I asked 
him what countryman he was ; and he said, Espagniole ; and being a 
little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, 
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. "Signer," said I, 
with as much Spanish as I could make up, " we will talk afterward, 
but we must fight now ; if you have any strength left, take this pistol 
and sword, and lay about you. He took them very thankfully ; and 
no sooner had he the arms in his hands, but, as if they had put new 
vigor into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had cutt 
two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole 
was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures were so much frightened 
with the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere amazement 
and fear, and had no more power to attempt their own escape, than 
their flesh had to resist our shot ; and that was the case of those five 
that Friday shot at in the boat ; for as three of them fell with the 
hurt they received, so the other two fell with the fright. 

I Kept my piece iu my hand still without firing, being willing to 
koej) my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol 
ftnd Bword ; so I called to Friday^ and bade Wnx rua ap to the treg 



ROBINSON CEUSOEJ. 2(liB 

from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay there 
that had been discharged, which he did with great swiftness ; and 
then giving him my musket, I sat down myself to load ail the rest 
again, and bade them come to me when they wanted. While I was 
loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the 
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one of their 
great wooden swords, the same-like weapon that was to have killed 
him before, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold 
and brave as could be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian 
a good while, and had cut him two good wounds on his head ; but the 
savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him. had thrown 
him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of his hand, 
when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the sword, 
drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body. 
and killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help him, 
could come near him. 

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches, 
with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with that he dis- 
patched those three, who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and 
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and the Spaniard 
coming to me for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling pieces, with 
which he pursued two of the savages, and wounded them both; but, 
as he was not able to run, they both got from him into the wood, 
where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the other 
was too nimble for him ; and though he was wounded, yet be plunged 
^^ himself into the sea, and swam, with all his might, off to those two 
who were left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one 
Wounded, that we knew not whether he died or no, were all that es- 
caped our hands of one-and-twenty. The account of the whole is as 
follows : three killed at our first shot from the tree ; two killed at the 
next shot; two killed by Friday in the boat: two killed by Friday of 
those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood; three 
kUled by the Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped here and 
there of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase of them; four 
escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead. Twenty-one 
in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gunshot, 
and though Friday made two or three shots at them I did not find 
that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of 
their canoes and pursue them; and, indeed, I was very anxious about 
their escape, lest, carrying the aews hoaxe to their people, they should 



sod AJ>V1ENTUBEa 01? 

come back, perhaps with two or three hundred of the canoes, and da. 
vour us by mere multitude, so I couseuted to pursue tbem by sea, and 
running to one of the canoes I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me, 
but wbon I was in the canoe I was surprised to find another poor 
creature he there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for the 
slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was the mat- 
ter, for he had not been able to look over the side of the boat ; he was 
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had 
really but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes which they had bound 
him with, and would have helped him up, but he could not stand or 
speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems still', that be 
was only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday came to him 
I bade him speak to him and tell him of his deliverance, and pulling 
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a dram ; which, with 
the news of Ms feeing delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the 
boat. But wlien Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, 
it would have moved any one into tears to have seen how Friday 
kissed him, embraced him, luiggcd him, cried, laughed, hallooed, 
jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hand;?, beat 
his own face and head, and then sung and jumped about again, like a 
distracted creature. It was a good while before I could make him 
Bpeak to me or tell me what was the matter, but when he came a 
little to himself he told me that it was his father. 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what 
ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight 
of his father, and on his being delivered from death; nor, indeed, can 
I describe half the extravagances of his afi'ection after this, for he 
went into the boat and out of the boat a great many times. When he 
went into him he would sit down by him, open his breast, and.hold 
Lis fathers head close t^ his bosom for many minutes together, to 
nourish it ; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed 
and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his 
hands, and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out 
' of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good. 

This affair put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other 
savages, who wore got now almost out of sight ; and it was happy for 
us that we did not, for it blew so hard, within two hours after, and 
before they could be got a qfiarter of their way, and continued blow- 
ing 80 hard all night, and that from the nortlnvest, which was against 
them, that I could not suppose their boat could live, or that they evwf 
X9&ch0'l thftir own coas» 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 207 

But, to return to Friday ; he was so busy about his father that I 
could not find in my heart to take him off for some time, but after I 
thought he could leave him a little I called him to me, and he came 
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme; then I 
asked him if he had given his father any bread. He shook his head 
nod said, '' None ; ugly dog eat all up self." I then gave him a cako 
of bread out of a little pouch I carried on piirpose ; I also gave hira 
a dram for himself, but he would not taste it, but carried it to his 
father. I had in my pocket two or three bunches of raisins, so I gave 
him a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his 
father these raisins but I saw him come out of the boat and run away, 
as if he had ificn bewitched, he ran at such a rate, for he was the 
swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I saw. I say, he ran at such a 
rate that he was out of eight, as it were, in an instant, and though 1 
called, and hallooed out, too, after him, it was all one way, away b« 
went ; and, in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back agaii)| 
though not so fast as he went, and as he came nearer I found his paee 
slacker, because he had something in his hand. When he came up 
to me I found he had boen quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to 
bring his father some frssh water, and that he had two more cakes or 
loaves of bread ; the bread he gave me, but the water he carried fej 
his fixther ; however, as I was very thirsty, too, I took a little sup of 
it. The water revived his father more than all the rum or spirits I 
had given him, for he was just fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drunk I called to him to know if there wao 
any water left ; he said " Yes," and I bade him give it to the poor 
Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and I sent 
one of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard, too, who wac 
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green place undo 
the shade of a tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and ver^ 
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with. When 
T saw that, upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat up 
und drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went to him and 
gave him a handful of raisins. He looked up in my face with all the 
tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any coun- 
tenance, but was BO weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself 
in the fight, that he could not stand upon his feet ; he tried to do it 
two or three times, but was really aot able, his ankles were so swelled 
and so painful to him, so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub 
his ankles and bathe them with rum, as he had done his father's. 

I obeerved the poor affectionate creature, every two minate6» oj 



208 ADViiNTUiaES OF 

perhaps less^ all the while he was here, turn his head about to see if 
his father was in the same place and posture as he left him sitting ; 
and at last he found he was not to be seen, at which he started Up, 
and without speaking a word, flew with that swiftness to him that one 
could scarce perceive his feet to touch the ground as he went ; but 
when he came, he only found he had laid himself down to ease hia 
limbs, so Friday came back to me presently ; and then I spoke to the 
Spaniard to let Friday help him up if he could, and lead him to the 
boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would 
take care of him ; but Friday, a lusty, strong fellow, took the Span- 
iard quite upon his back, and carried him away to the boat, and set 
him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with hia feet 
in the inside of it, and then lifting him quite in, he set himself close 
to his father, and presently stepping out again launched the boat off, 
and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, though the 
wind blew pretty hard, too ; so he brought them both safe into our 
creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other 
canoe. As he passed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he 
went. He told me, " Go fetch more boat ;" so away he went like the 
wind, for sure never man or hor^e ran like him, and he had the other 
canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land : so be wafted 
me over, and then went to help our new guests out of the boat, which 
he did, but they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor Fri- 
day knew not what to do. 

To remedy this I Avent to work in my thoughts, and calling to Fri. 
day to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon 
made a kind of a hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car- 
ried them both up together upon it, between us. But Avhen we got 
them to the outside of our wall or fortification, we were at a worsa 
loss than before, for it was impossible to get them over, and I was re- 
solved not to break it down. So I set to work again, and Friday and 
I, in about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered with 
old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the space 
without our outward fence, and between that and the grove of young 
wood which I had planted ; and here we made them two beds of such 
things as I had, viz., of good rice straw, with blauket« laid upon it to 
lie on, and another to cover them, on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself rich in subjeetaj 
and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a 
king I looked. First of all, the whole country was my own niere 
property, m th?;t T ^a.<l ao. uadoubted ri^ht of dominion. Secondl-s 



BOBINSON CRfSOE, 209 

my people were perfectly subjected ; I was absolutely lord and law- 
giver; tbey all owed their Ihea to me, and were ready to lay down 
their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for me. Is was remark- 
able, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three different 
religions ; my man Friday was a Protestant ; his father was a Pagan 
and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist ; however, I allowed 
liberty of conscience throughout my dominions. But this is by the 
way. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given 
them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to think of 
making some provision for them ; and the first thing I did, I ordered 
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a goat, out of my 
particular flock, to be killed ; when I cut off the hinder quartei-j and 
chopping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and 
stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure you, of flesh and 
broth, having put some barley and rice also into the broth ; and as I 
cooked it without doors, for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I 
carried it ail into the new tent, and having set a table there for them, 
I sat down, and ate my dinner also with them, and, as well as I 
could, cheered them, and encouraged them. Friday was my inter- 
preter, especially to his father, and, iradeed, to the Spaniard, too ; for 
the Spaniard spoke the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one 
of the canoes, and go fetch our muskets and other firearms, which, for 
want of time, we had left upon the place of battle ; and, the next day, 
I ordered him to go and bui-y the dead bodies of the savages, which 
lay open to the sun, and would presently be offensive. I also order- 
ed him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which 
I knew were pretty much, and which I could not think of doing my- 
self; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that way ; all which 
he punctually performed, and effeced the very appearance of the 
eavages being there ; so that when I went again, I could scarce know 
where it was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to 
the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new 
Bubjecta; and, first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he 
thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe, and whether we 
Plight expect a return of them, with a power too great for us to re- 
sist. His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat coul4 never 
live out the storw ^Meh blew that night they went off, but must of 
uece.§|^ty be drow^^j or driven soutfe to those Other st\o,reSj, ^b^ere 



tlO ADTEimmES OF 

ih«y were &c eiure to be devoured as they were to be dro-wned, if they 
were cast away ; but, as to what they would do, if they came safe on 
ehore, be said he knew not ; but it was his opinion, that they were so ■ 
dreadfully frightened with the manner of their being attacked, the 
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would tell the people they 
were all killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man : 
and that the two which appeared, viz., Fridaj' and I, were two heav- 
enly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not men with 
weapons. This, he said, he knew ; because he heard them all cry out 
BO, in their language one to another ; for it was impossible for them 
to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at 
& distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now ; and this old 
eavage was in the right ; for, as I understood since, by other hands, 
the savages never attempted to go over to the island afterward, they 
were so terrified with the accounts given by those four men (for, it 
eeems, they did escape the sea), that they believed whoever went to 
that enchanted island would be destroyed by fire from the gods. This^ 
hdwever, I knew not ; and therefore was under continual apprehen- 
sions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, with all my 
army ; for, as there were now four of us, I would have ventured upon 
a hundred of them, fairly in the open field, at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of 
their coming wore off; and I began to take my former thoughts of a 
voyage to the main into consideration ; being likewise assured, by 
Friday's father, that I might depend upon good usage from their 
nation, on his account, if I would go. But my thoughts were a little 
suspended when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and 
when I understood that there were sixteen more of his countrymen 
and Portuguese, who, having been cast away, and made their escape to 
that side, lived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were very 
sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the 
particulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, 
bound from the Rio de la Plata, to the Havana, being directed to leave 
thair loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring 
back what European goods they could meet with there ; that they had 
five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of another 
wreck ; that five of their own men wore drowned, when first the ship 
was lost, and that these escaped through infinite dangers and hazards, 
and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they ex- 
pected to have been devoured every moment. He Jold me they had

Wd neithcv powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having Bpoiled- 
all their powder, but a little, which they used at their first landing, to 
provide themselves some food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if 
they had formed no design of making any escape. He said they had 
many consultations about it, but that having neither vessel, nor tools 
to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their councils always ended 
in tears and despair. I asked him how he thought they would re- 
ceive a proposal from me, which might tend toward an escape ; and 
whether, if they were all here, it might not be done. I told him with 
freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put 
my life in their hands, for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in the 
nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings by the obli- 
gations they had received, so much as they did by the advantages they 
expected. I told him it would be very hard that I should be the in. 
strument of their deliverance, and that they shuold afterward mako 
me their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to 
be made a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident soever brought 
him thither ; and that I had rather be delivered up to savages, and be 
devoured alive, than fall into -the merciless claws of the priests, and 
be carried into the Inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was per- 
Buaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build 
a bark large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils, 
southward, or to the islands, or Spanish coast, northward ; but that if, 
in requital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, 
carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill used for my 
kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before. 

lie answered with a great deal of candor and ingenuousness, that 
their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, thai 
he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly 
that should contribute to their deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he 
would go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about! 
it, and return again, and bring me their answer ; that he would maka 
conditions with them upon their solemn oath, that they should be ab- 
solutely under my leading, ''.s their commander and captain ; and that 
they should swear upon \ne holy sacraments and gospel, to be true to 
me, and go to such Christian country as I should agree to, and no 
other, and to be directed wholly and absolutely by my orders, till 
they were landed safely in such country as I intended : and that be 
would bring a contract from them, under their hands, for that puiw 
pose. Thea he told me he would fii-st ewear to me himMU) that h^

would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave hinj orders, 
and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, if there 
should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen. He 
tQid me they were all very civil, honest men, and they were under the 
greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons, nor clotlies, nor 
any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages ; out of all 
hopes of ever returning to their own country ; and that ho was sure, 
if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by mo. 
j Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relievo them if pos^ 
sible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them tfr 
treat. But when we got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard 
himself, started an objection, which had so much prudence in it, on 
one hand, and so much sincerity, on the other hand, that I could not 
be very well satisfied in it ; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance 
of his comrades for at least half a year. The case was thus : He had 
been with us now about a month, during which time, I had let him see 
in what manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for 
my support ; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had 
laid up; which, though it was more than suflScient for myself, yet it 
was not suflBcient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was 
increased to four; but much less would it be sufficient if his country, 
men, who were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come over ; and 
lesist of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should 
build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America j 
BO he told me he thought it would be more advisable to let him and 
the other two dig and cultivate more land, as much as I could spare 
seed to sow, and that we should wait another harvest, that we should 
have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they should come ; 
fojp want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think 
themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another. 
"You know," says he, " the children of Israel, though they rejoiced 
first for being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God 
himself, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the 
wilderness." 

His caution was so seasonable, and his voice so good, that I coulj 
not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I waa Batia. 
fied with his fidelity ; so we fell to digging, all four of ns, as well aa 
the wooden tools permittedr; and in about a month's time, by the end 
of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and trim- 
med up as we sowed two-and-twonty bushels of barley on, and sixteen 
j»r* of rice j which was, in short, all the seed we ha<^ to spare ; ao^ 



kOBINSON CRU?0* ^l4 

indeed, did we leave ourselves "barley sufBcient for our food, for the 
six month|gthat vre had to expect our crop ; that is to say, reckoning 
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing ; for it is not to be 
supposed it is six months in the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being suflScientto" put 
us out of the fear of the savages if they had come, unless their num' 
ber had been very great, we went freely all over the island, whenevei* 
we found occasion ; and as here we had our escape or deliverJlnce upon 
our thoughts, it was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of 
it out of mine. For this pui-pose, I marked out several trees which I 
thought fit for our work, and I set Friday and his father to cutting 
them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted 
my thought on that affair, to oversee and direct their work. I showed 
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into sin, 
gle planks, and caused them to do the like, till th«y had made about 
a dozen large planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet 
long, and from two inches to four inches thick; what prodigious labor 
it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame 
goats as much as I could; and for this purpose, I made Friday and 
the Spaniard go out one day, and myself with Friday the next day 
(for we took our turns), and by this means we got about twenty young 
kids to breed up with the rest : for whenever we shot the dam, we 
saved the kids, and added them to out flock. But, above all, the sea- 
son for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a prodigious 
quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we been at 
Alicaiit, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have filled 
sixty or eiglity "barrels ; and these, with our bread, was a great part 
of our food, and was a very good living, too, I assure you, for it is 
exceedingly nourishing. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order ; it was not the most 
plentiful increase I had seen inlhe island, but however, it was enough to 
answer our end; foi- from twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in 
and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like 
proportion of the rice ; which wag store enough for our food to the next 
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me ; or 
if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victual- 
led our ship to have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say 
any part of America. When we had thus housed and secured our mag- 
azine ofcorn, we fell to work to make more wickerware, viz.,greatbaskets 
in which we kept it ; and the Spaniard was very handj and de?:teroua

%t thu pAii, and often blamed me that I did not make 8om<>) tUttgv bk 
defeuoe of this kina of work; bat I saw no need nt it. % 

Ai»d now, having a full euppiy of food for all tho quests I expected, 
I gave the Spaiiiard leave to go over to tho main, to eeo what he could 
io with those he had left behind him there, i prave him a utrio^ 
shftrg-t) not to bring any man with him who would not tiist ^wear is 
«he presence of himself and the old savage, that ho would no way in 
^re, tight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who 
was so kind us to send for them in order to their deliverance ; bul 
that they would stand by him, and defend him against all such at- 
tempts, and wherever they went, would be entirely under and subject- 
ed to his command ; and that this should be put in writing, and signer 
with their hands, ilow they were to have done this, when I knew 
they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which we never asked. 
Under these mstructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, tie father 
of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be eaiij 
to come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners t« 
be devoured by the savages. I gave each of them a musket, with a 
firelock on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging 
them to be very good husbands of both, and not to use either of theia 
bat upon urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in 
r»ew of my deliverance, for now twenty-seven years and some days. 
I gave them provisions of broad, and of dried grapes, sufficient for 
themselves for many days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards for 
aboat eight days' time ; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them 
go ; agreeing with them about a signal that they should haii? out at 
their return, by which I should know them again, when they came 
back, at a distance, before they cau)e on shore. They went away wit)» 
a fair gale, on the day that the moon was full, by my account in tkt 
month of October ; but as for an exact reckoning of days after I ha6 
once lost it, 1 could never recover it again ; nor had I kept even tb« 
number of years so punctually as to be sure I was right ; though, aa 
it proved, when I afterward examined my account, I fcund I had 
kept a true reckoning of years. 

It was no less than eight days I hod waited for them, when a 
Btrange and unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like hai 
aot perhaps been heard of in history. I was fast aaleep in my hutch, 
on* morning, when my man Friday came running in to me, and called 
Aloud, * Master, master, they are oome, they are come !" I juupoQ 
ip, and, re^ardleM of danger, i went out as soon aa I oonld £et iLf 



8lothe« on, throagh mj little grove, which by the w\j, was \y thit 
tarns grown to be a very thick wood; I say, rogardloas ot danger, 1 
went without my arms, which it was not my custom to do ; twt I wa* 
Hu rprised, when turning my eyes to the eea, 1 presently saw a boa» 
about a league and a half distant, standing in for the shore, with a 
dioulder-of-mutton sail, ae thoy call it. and the wind blowing prettj 
Stir to bring them :n ; also I observed presently, that they did not 
some from that side which the shore lay on, but from the southeru- 
niost end of the island. Upon this, I called Friday in, and bade hica li» 
close, foi tliese were not the people wo looked for, and that we miglt 
not Know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the next 
place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to see what I coal(J 
make of them; and having taken the ladder out, I cUinbed to tbs 
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anyihinf^ 
and to take my view the plainer without being discovered. 1 ha^ 
scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye "pla^inly discovered i 
ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a half distance froj« 
me, S. S. E., but not above a league and a half from the shore. By 
my observation, it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and tb« 
boat appeared to be an English long-boat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in , though the joy of seeinff 
a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my owj' 
countrymen, and, consequently, friends, was such as I cannot de 
scribe : but yet I had some secret doubts hang about me — I canno' 
tell from whence they came, bidding me to keep upon my guard Ir 
the first place it occurred to me to consider what business an English 
ship could have in that part of the world, since it wfis not tlie wa,y t' 
>r from any part of the world where the English had any traffic anC 
I knew there had been no stqpras to drive them in there, as in din 
irese ; aud that if they were really English, it was most prcl abk 
sliat they were here upon no good design ; and that 1 had better can 
ticuo as 1 was, than fail into the hands of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of diiuger, whlob 
3*>metimos are given him when he may think there is no jiossibility of 
its being real. That such liints and notices are given us, I believe 
few that have made a;iy observation of things can deny; that tbsy 
are certain discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of epirit*. 
we cannot doubt ; and if the tendency of them seems to be to weirn af 
of danger, why should we not suppose they are froia some friendly agent

Th« present question abandantly coiifirma itte in the juetioe of ihk 
reMoning j for had I n^t been made cautious by this soorot admoni* 
tion, come it from vrhence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and 
ki a far woree condition than before, as you will see presently. I had 
Bot kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the boat draw near the 
^re, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenienoe 
i landing ; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did 
aoi see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafte, but run 
their boat on shore upon' the beach, at about half a mile &om me, 
which was very happy for me j for otherwise they would have landed 
jast at my door, as I may say, and would soon bave beaten me out 
of my castle, and perhaps have plundered me oi ail I had. When 
they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were Englishinon, &t leaet 
most of them ; one or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove 
•0 J they were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I found were 
onarmed, and as I thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of 
them were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the boat aa 
prisoners ; one of the three I could perceive using the most passionate 
gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of ex- 
travagance; the other two I could perceive lifted up their hands 
sometimes, and appeared concerned, indeed, but not to such a degree 
as the first. I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not 
what the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in Eng- 
lish, as well as he could, ^'O master! you see English mans eat 
prisoners as well as savage mans." '• Why, Friday," says I, "do yon 
think they are going to eat them, then ?" " Yes," says Friday, " they 
will eat them." * No, no," says I ; " i'riday, I am afraid they will 
nurder them, indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat them." 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, bat 
to >d trembling with horror of the sight, expecting every moment 
whdn the three prisoners should be killed ; nay, ouce I saw one of the 
yilluns Uft up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or 
sword, to strike one of the poor men ; and I expected to see him fall 
every moment ; at which all the blood in my body seemed to run 
ehJll in my veins. I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the 
savage that was gone with him, or that I had any way to have ccma 
uudiscovsred within shot of them, that I might bave rescued thtt 
(hred men, for I saw no firearms they had among them ; but it fell 
eat to my mind another way. After I had observed the outrageous 
•sage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows

ROBINSON CRUSOE, 217 

X observed that the three other men had liberty to go also where thej 
pleased; \)ut they sat down all three upon the ground, very pensive, 
und looked like men in despair. This put me in mind of the first 
time when I came on shore, and began to look about me : how I gave 
myself over for lost: how wildly I looked around me; what dreadful 
apprehensions I had ; and how I lodged in the tree all night, for fear 
of being devoured by wild beasts. As 1 knew nothing that night of 
the supply I was to receive by the providential driving of the ship 
nearer the land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been 
»o long nourished and supported; so these three poor desolate 
men knew nothing how certain of deliverance and supply they were, 
how near it was to them, and how efiPectually and really they were in 
a condition of safety, at the same time that they thought themselves 
lost, and their case desperate. So little do we see before us in the 
world, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the 
great Maker of the world, that he does not leave his creatures so ab- 
solutely destitute, but that, in the worst circumstances, they have 
always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their 
deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their de- 
liverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their 
destruction.

T was just at the top of high water when these people came 
on shore ; and partly while they rambled about to see what 
kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till 
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably 
away, leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in the 
boat, who, as I found afterward, having drunk a little too much 
brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them waking a little sooner than 
the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, 
hallooed out to the rest, who were straggling about ; upon which 
they all soon came to the boat ; but it was past all their strength to 
launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side be- 
ing a soft oQsy eaadji almost like t^ qnioksaud. Ixi \hm condition, lik«^

true aearaen, who are perhaps the least of all majJdnd given to {or^ 
thought, they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country 
ugain ; and I heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them 
off from the boat, " Why, let her alone. Jack, can't you ? she'll float 
nezt tide ;" by which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry of 
what countrymen they were. All this while I kept myself very close, 
not once daring to stir out of my castle, any further than to my place 
of observation, near the top of the hill ; and very glad I was to think 
how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be- 
fore the boat could float again, and by that time it would be darky 
and I might be more at hberty to see their motions, and to hear their 
discourse, if they had any. In the meantime, I fitted myeelf up fat 
a battle, ds before, though with more caution, knowing I had to do 
with another kind of an enemy than I had at first. 1 ordered Friday 
also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load 
himself with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave 
him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I had my 
formidable goat's skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, 
a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon 
each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt 
till it was dark, but about two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I 
found that, in short, they were all gone straggling into the woods, 
and as I thought, laid down to sleep. The three poor distressed men, 
too anxious for their condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat 
down under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile 
from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this 
I resolved to discover jnyself to them, and learn something of their 
condition ; immediately I marched in the figure as above, my man 
Finday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as I^ 
but not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came 
as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any of them 
saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, " What are yc, gentle- 
men ?" They started up at the noise, but were ten times more con- 
founded when they saw me and the uncouth figure that I made ; they 
made me no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going 
to fly from mc, when I spoke to them in Engliish : "Gentlemen," said 
I, " do not be surprised at mo, perhaps you may have a friend near 
when you do not expect it." '• lie must bo sent directly from Heav- 
en, then," said one them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat 
at the same time to me, '* for jsmj condition ^e past the help of man.* 



ttOBlNSON CRUSOE, jllft 

** All help is from Heaven, sir/' eaid I j " but can you put a etrangeir 
in the way how to help you, for you seem to be in some great dis- 
tress ? I saw you when you landed, and when you seemed to make 
supplication to the brutes that came with you, I saw one of them lift 
up his sword to kill you." 

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, 
looking like one astonished^ returned, " Am 1 talking to God or man ? 
Is it a real man or an angel V " Be in no fear about that, sir,'' said, 
I ; '■' if God had sent an angel to relieve you he would have come bet- 
ter clothed, and armed after another manner than you see me ; pray 
lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to 
assist you : you see I have one servant only, we have arms and am- 
munition, tell us freely, can we serve you ? What is your case ?'' 
" Our case," said he, sir, " is too long to tell you while our murderera 
are so near us, but in short, sir, I was commander of that ship, my 
men have mutinied against me ; they have been hardly prevailed on 
not to murder me, and at last have set me on shore in this desolate 
place, with these two men with me — one my mate, the other a pas- 
senger — where we expected to perish, believing the place to be unin- 
habited, and know not yet what to think of it." " Where are these 
brutes, your enemies V said I ; "do you know where they are gone ?" 
" There they lie, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees ; '*my heart 
trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak ; if they have, 
they will certainly murder us all." " Have they any fiarearms ?" said 
I. He answered they had only two pieces, one of which they left in 
the boat. " Well, then," said I, " leave the rest to me; I see they are 
all asleep ; it is an ea.sy thing to kill them all, but shall we rather 
take them prisoners ?" He told me there were twe desperate villains 
among them, that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to, but if they 
were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty." I 
asked him which they were. He told me he could not at that dis- 
tance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in anything I 
would direct. " Well," says I, '' let us retreat out of their view or 
hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve further." So they wil- 
lingly went back with me till the woods covered us from them. 

"Look you, sir," said I, "if I venture upon your deliverance are 
you willing to make two conditions with me ?" He anticipated my 
proposals, by telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should 
be wholly directed and commanded by me in everything; and, if the 
ship was not recovered, he would live and die with me in what park 
of the world soever I would send hirr;. and th« two other aeu eaid

tho same. ** Well," says I, " my conditions arc but two : irst, thai 
whilo you stay in this isl&nd with me you will not pretend to any 
autbo;-ity here, and if I put arms into j'Oi/r hands, you will, upon all 
occasions, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine 
upon this island, and, in the meantime, be governed by my orders; 
eecondly, that if the ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry me 
and my man to England, passage free. 

He gave me all tho assurances that the invention or faith of man 
could devise that he would comply with these most reasonable de- 
mands, and, besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it 
upon all occasions as long as he lived " Well, then," said I, " here 
are three muskets for you, with powder and ball ; tell me next what 
you think proper to be done." He showed me all the testuuonies of 
his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be wholly guided by 
me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing anything, but the 
best method I could think of was to fire upon them at once, as they 
lay, and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to sub- 
mit, we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence 
to direct the shot. He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill 
them, if he could help it, but that those two were incorrigible villains, 
and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they 
escaped we should be undone still, for they would go on board and 
bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. " Well, then," 
says I, " necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to 
save our lives." However, seeing him still cautious of shedding 
\ blood, I told him they should go themselves and manage as they 
found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and 
soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him if either 
of them were the heads of the mutiny. He said " No." " Well, then," 
said I, "you may let them escape, and Providence seems to have 
awakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, "if the 
rest escape you, it is your fault." Animated with this, he took the 
musket I had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his 
two comrades with him, with each a piece in his hand. The two men 
who were with him going first, made some noise, at which one of the 
seamen who was awake turned about, and seeing them coming, cried 
out to the rest, but it was too late, then, for the moment he cried out 
they fired — I mean the two men — the captain wisely reserving his 
own piece. They had so well aimed their shots at the men they 
knew, that one of them was killed on the spot and the other ^ery

much wounded, but, not being dead, he started upon his feet and 
called eagerly for hoJp to the others, but the captain stopping to him, 
told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to 
forgive his villany, and with that word knocked him down with the 
Btock of his musket, so that he never spoke more. There were three 
more in the company, and one of them was also slightly wounded. 
By this time I was come, and when they saw their danger, and that it 
was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them 
be would spare their lives if they would give him any assurance of 
their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would 
Bwear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterward in 
carrying her back to Jamaica, whence they came. They gave him all 
riie protestations of their sincerity that could be desired, and he was 
willing to believe them, and spare their lives ; which I was not against, 
only that I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they 
were on the island. 

While this was. doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the 
boat, vrith orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, 
which they did ; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (hap- 
pily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing tbe guns 
fired, and seeing the captain, who before was their prisoner, now their 
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also j and so our victory was 
complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one 
another's circumstances ; I began first, and told him my whole history, 
which he heard with an attention even to amazement ; and particu- 
larly at the wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions 
and ammunition ; and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of 
Wonders, it affected him deeply. But when he reflected from thence 
upon himself, and how I seemed to have been preserved there or 
purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not 
speak a word more. After this communication was at an end, I car- 
ried him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in just 
where I came out. viz. : at the top of the house, where I refreshed 
them with such provisions as I had, and sliowed them all the contri- 
vances I had made, during my long, long inhabiting tbat place. 

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing ; but, 
above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I 
had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having now 
been planted near twenty years, and the trees growing much faster 
than in England, was become a little wood, and so thick, that it wR§

impassable in any p.irt of It, but a* that one side where I had reserved 
ray little winding passage into it. I told him this was my castle and 
my residence, but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes 
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him 
that, too, another time ; but at present our business was to consider 
how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that ; but told mo 
he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were 
Btill six-and-twenty hands on board, who having entered into a cursed 
conspiracy, by which they had forfeited their lives to the law, would 
be hardened in it now by desperation, and would carry it on, knowing 
that, if they were subdued, they would be brought to the gallows, as 
soon as they came to England, or to any of the English colonies ; and 
that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so small a 
number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a 
very rational conclusion, and that, therefore, something was to be re- 
eolved on speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snanj 
for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying 
us. Upon this, it presently occurred to me, that in a little while tho 
ship's crew, wondering what was become of their comrades, and of 
the boat, would certainly come on shore in their other boat to look 
for them ; and that then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too 
strong for us ; this he allowed to be rational. Upon this, I told him 
the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon tho 
beach, so that they might not carry her off; and tak ng everything 
out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim ; accord- 
ingly we went on board, took the arms which were left on board out 
of her, and whatever else we found there, which were a bottle of 
brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, 
and a great lum^ of sugar in a piece of canvass (the sugar was five or 
Bix pounds) ; all which was very welcome to me, especially the brandy 
and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years. 

"When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail 
and rudder of the boat were carried away before, as above), we 
knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come strong 
enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat. Indeed it 
was not much in my thoughts that we could be able to recover the 
ship : but my view was, that if they went away without a boat, I did 
not much question to make her fit again to carry us to the Leeward 
Islands, and call upon our friends th« Spaniards in my way ; fer I 
bad them still in my thoughts.

not float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in

what we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw hor make a 
waft w ith her ensign as a signal for the boat to come on board ; but

for the boat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved fruit 
lee^ and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help 
ef my glasses, hoint another boat out, and row toward the shore ; and 
ye found, as they approached, that there were no less than ten men 
in ber, and that they bad fire-arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full 
f iew of them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces b» 
Muse the tide having set them a little to the east of the other ooat, 
they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place where th« 
other had landed, and whore the boat lay ; by this means, I say, ws 
had a full view of them, and the captain knew the persons and char 
aciers of all the men in the boat, of whom he said, there were three 
very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy 
by the rest, being overpowered and frightened ; but that as for thd 
boatswain, who it eoems, was the chief officer among them, and aE 
the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and werw

We had, apou the first appoaraooe of tho boat's coming froxs IL3 
ship, ooaeidered of wparating our prisoners ; and we had, indeed, "^s- 
oared them effectually. Two of them, of whom *he captain vas 1'-^ 
assured Ihan ordinary, I sent with Friday, and cse of the thros Zi- 
iiverod wen, to my cave, where they were remote onoogh, and oot i 
danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their wty ont of lb 3 
wood* if they could have delivered themselves ; here they left thcra 
bound, but gave them provisions; and promised them if they coa- 
tinned there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two ; buft 
that if they attempted their escape, they should be put to death with- 
out meroy. They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with 
patience, and were very thankful that they had such good usage as to 
have provisions and light left them ; for Friday gave them candles 
(such as we made ourselves) for their comfort ; and they did not know 
but that be stood sentinel over them at the entrance. 
The other prisoners had better usage ; two of them were kept 
inionod ; indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them ; but 
&e other two were taken into my service, upon the captain's recom- 
mendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and die with us ; 
80 with them and the three honest men we were seven men well 
armed ; and I made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough 
with the ten that were coming, considering that the captain had said 
that there were three or four honest men among them also. As soon 
as they got to the place where their othcir ooat lay, they ran their 
boat into the beach, and came on shore, hauling tho bok. up aftei 
them, which I was glad to see ; for I was afraid they would rather 
have left the boat at an anchor, some distance from the shore, with 
some hanas m ner to guard her, and so we should not be able to 
seize the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all 
to their other boat ; and it was easy to see they were under a great 
onrprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and • 
great hole in hor bottom. After they had mused a while upon this, 
they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might 
to try if they could make tJieir companions hoar ; but all was to no 
purpose ; then they came all cJoso in a ring, and fired a volley of 
their small amu, which, indeed, we heard, ahd tho echoes made the 
woods ring ; but it wa« all one ; those in tho cave we were sure oould 
not hear; and those in our kooping, though they heard it well enough, 
yet duret give no answer to tliem. They were so astonished at tha 
nrpriM of this, that, aa they told afterward, they resolved to go all 
1« lM>erd apain to their ship, and let them know that tho men wet*

Ab mar<3er9d, and the long-boat staved; accordingly, they imioe< 
iittely lann^hed their bnat again, and got all of them on board. 

The captain wai terribly amiuzed and oven confounded at this, 
beliefing tliev would gtt on board the ship again, and set gail> giving 
iheir ooxnradea over fur lost, and so he should still lose the ship 
which he vrae inbope» we should have recovered; sat he was quickly 
M mnoh frightened Uw, other way. 

They had not bean long put off with the boat, but we perceived 
ftem all ooming on shore again ; but this with this new measure in 
heir conduct, whio«i> it jeems they consulted together upon, viz. : te 
Isave three men in ^e boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up 
into the country t» look for their fellows. This was a great disap^ 
pointment to us, fer now we were at a loss what to do ; as our seizing 
those seven mep on shore would be no advantage to us, if we let tho 
boat escape ; booause they would then row away to the ship, and then 
Jie rest of theia would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so trttr re- 
covering the rtip would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to 
w«t and see 'rhat the issue of things might present. The seven men 
eame on 8ho»^, and the three who remained in the boat put her off to 
a good distfr*ce from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for 
them ; so tbAt it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat 
Those that came on shore kept close together, marching toward the 
top of the little hill under which my habitation lay ; and we could 
eed them j^inly, though they could not perceive us. We could have 
b«}n very »lad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might 
hare fired at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we 
mfght hav« come abroad. But when they were come to the brow 9i 
tha hill, where they could see a great way into the valleys and wood* 
w'lich lar toward the northeast part, and wher^ the island lay lowei t, 
ibey shouted and bsllooed till they were weary ; and not caring, h 
seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they 
»t dow« together under a tree, to consider of it. Had they thought 
It to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had dona, 
h*rf *»ad done the job for us ; but they were too fall of apprehension.^ 
•f ia»ger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what 
th« danger was they had to fear neither. 

Th* oapteun made a very just proposal to me upon this consul tatioa 
of theirs, viz. : that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to en^ 
deavor to make their fellows hoar, and that we should all sally upon 
thaao, just at the juncturo, when their pieces were all discharged, aod 
th«f would certainly vrtno, and we should have them without b!o«|

Bhed. I liked this proposal, providca it tvas (5ono vnile w« w^vt) 
near enough to como up to them before they could load their pieces 
again : but this event did not happen ; and we lay still a long while, 
very irresolute what course to take. At length I told them that, 
there would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night ; and then, if 
they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get 
between them and the shore, and so we might use some stratagem 
with them in the boat to get them on shore. We waited a great 
while, though very impatient for their removing ; and were very un- 
easy, when, after long consultations, we saw them all start up and 
march down toward the sea; it seems they had such dreadful appre- 
hensions upon theui of the danger of the place, that they resolved to 
go on board the ship again, give their companions over for lost, and 
BO go on with their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them to go toward the shore, I imagined it 
to be, as it really was, that they had given over their search, and were 
for going back aaain ; and the captain, as soon as I told him my 
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it ; but I pres- 
ently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again, and which 
answered iny end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and the captain's mate 
to go over the little creek westward, toward the place where the sav- 
ages came on shore when Friday was rescued, a,nd as they came to a 
little rising ground, at about a half a mile distance, I bade them halloo 
out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard 
them ; that as soon as they heard the seamen answer them, they 
should return it again ; and then keeping out of sight, take a round, 
always answering when the others hallooed, to draw them as for into 
the island, and among the woods, as possible, and then wheel about 
again to me, by such ways as I directed them. ^ 

They were just going into the l)oat when Friday and the mate hal- 
looed ; and they presently heard them, and answering, run along the 
shore westward, toward the voice they heard, when they were pres- 
ently stopped by the creek, where the water being up, they could' 
not get over, and called for the l)oat to come up and set them over; 
aa indeed I expected. When they had set themselves over, I ob- 
served that the boat being gone a good way into the creek, and, as it 
were, in o> harbor within the land, they took one of the three men out 
of bar, to go along with them, and l«ft only two in the boat, having 
fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. This was 
what I wished for ; and inmiediately leaving Friday and the captain's 
mate to their business, I took the rest with me, and crossing the creek

©ut of their sight, we surprised the two men before thsy wft?6 aware; 
one of them lyiug on the shore, and the other being in the boat. The 
fellow on the shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to 
ttart up 3 the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and 
knocked him down, and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or 
he was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to persuade 
a single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his com- 
rade knocked down ; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who 
were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and there- 
fore was easily persuaded, not only to yield, but afterward to joia 
very sincerely with us. In the meantime, Friday and the captain's 
mate so Avell managed their business with the rest, that they drew 
them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from 
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left 
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the 
boat before it was dark ; and, indeed, they were heartily tired them- 
selves also, by tho time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in cne dark, and 
to fall upon them so as to make sure work with th'^m. It was seve- 
ral hours after Friday came back to me before they came back t« 
their boat, and we could hear the foremost of them, long before they 
came quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could also 
hear them answer and complain how lame and tired they were, and 
not able to come any faster, which was very welcome news to us. At 
length they came up to the boat, but it is impossible to express their 
confusion when they found the boat fast aground in the creek, the 
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We could hear them call to 
one another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another they 
were got into an enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants 
in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there were devils and 
spirits in it, and they should he all carried away aikl devoured. 
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their names a 
great many times, but no answer. After some time we could see 
them, by the little light there was, run about wringing their hands, 
like men in despair, and that sometimes they would go and sit down 
In the boat to rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk 
about again, and so the same thing OA-er again. My men would fain 
have had me give them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark, 
but I was willing to take them at some advantage, so as to spare 
them, and to kill as few of them as I could ; and especially I was 
unwilling to hazard the killing an^ of our men, knowing the others 



228 ADVENTURES OF 

were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they did not Bttp. 
arate, and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade 
nearer, aud ordered Friday and the captain to creep upou their hands 
and feet as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be 
discovered; and get as near them as they could possibly before they 
offered to fire. 

) They had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who 
was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown him- 
self the most dejected aud dispirited of all the rest, came Avalking to- 
ward them, with two more of the crew ; the captain was so eager at 
having thid principal rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly 
have patience to let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they 
only heard his tongue before, but when they came nearer the captain 
and F'"iday, ctarting up on their'feet, let fly at them. The boatswain 
was kiUed upon the spot, the next man was shot in the body and fell 
just by him, though he did not die for an hour or two after, and the 
third ran for it. At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with 
my whole army, which was now eight men, viz., myself, generalissi- 
mo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general ; the captain and his two men, 
and the three prisoners-of-war, whom we had trusted with arms. We 
came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our 
number, and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now 
one of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a 
parley, and so might perhaps reduce them to terms, which fell out 
just as we desired ; for, indeed, it was easy to think, as their con- 
dition then was, they would bo willing to capitulate. So he calls 
out, as loud as he could, to one of them, "Tom Smith ! Tom Smith!" 
Ton> Smith answered immediately, " Is that Robinson ?" For it 
seems he knew the voice. The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for God's 
sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all 
dead men this moment." "Who must we yield to? Where are 
they V says Smith again. " Here they are," says he ; " here's our cap- 
tain, and fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two hours; 
the boatswain is killed, Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner, 
and if you do not yield you are all lost." " Will they give us quarter, 
then r says Tom Smlt^j, " and we will yield." " I will go ask, if you 
promise to yield," says Koiskison. So he asked the captain, and the 
captain huusclf then calls out, " You, Smith, yov \ix9w my voice ; if 
you lay down your arms immediately, and submit^ yon ehaU have 
your lives— all but Will AtkiQS."

iMKtnfl entreats the Captain to spare ida Life— The latter recovers his Yess^ 
from the Mutineers, and Robinson leaves the Island. 

PON this "Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake, captain,j 
give me quarter. What have I done ? They have all been 
as bad as 1." Which, by the way, was not true, neither, 
for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man that laid 
hold of the captain when they fix-st mutinied, and used him barba- 
rously, in tying his hinds and giving him injurious langaage. How' 
ever, the captain told him he must lay down hie arms at discretion, 
and trust to the governor's mercy ; by which he meant me, for they 
all called me governor. In a word, they all laid down their arms and 
begged their lives, and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, 
and two more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty 
men, which, particularly with those three, were in all but eight, came 
up and seized upon them and upon their boat, only that I kept my- 
self and one more out of sight for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing thb 
ship ; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to par'ey with them, 
he expostulated with them upon the villany of their practices with 
him, and at length upan the further wickedness of their design, and 
how certainlj" it must bring them to misery and distress in the end, 
and perhaps to the gallows. They all appeared very penitent, and 
begged hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they were none 
of his prisoners, but the commander's of the island ; that they thought 
they had set him on shore on a barren, uninhabited island, but it had- 
pleased God so to direct them that it was inhabited, and that the gov- 
ernor was an Englishman; that he might hang them all there, if he 
pleased, but as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he would 
send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice required, ex- 
cept Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advis© t« 
prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though all this was but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired 
effect; Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede 
with the governor for his life, and all the rest begged of him, for 
God's sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It BOW occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, 
and that it would be a most ea.sy thing to bring these fellows in to be 
hearty in getting poBsession of the ship, so I retired in the dark frow

theui, that they might not see what kind of a governor th«y hki, ani 
called the captain to me ; ■when I called, as at a good distance, one 
of the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, " Cap- 
tain, the commander calls for you;'' and presently the captain re- 
plied, " Tell his excellency I am just a-comiug." This more perfectly 
assured them, and they all believed that the commander was just by> 
with his fifty men. Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my 
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and ro 
Bolved to put it in execution the next morning ; but, in order to 0x6- 
cute it with more heart, and to be sure of success, I told him we must 
divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins, and two 
more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the oave where 
the others lay. This was committed to Friday and the two men who 
eame on shore with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave aa 
to a prison ; and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men in 
their condition. The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of 
of which I have given a full description, and as it was fenced in, and 
they pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were 
upon their behavior. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a 
parley with them ; in a word, to try them, and tell ine whether he 
thought they might be trusted or no to go on board and surprise tho 
ship. He talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they 
were brought to, and that though the governor had given them 
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet that if they were 
sent to England, they would all be hanged in chains, to be sure ; but 
that if they would join in so ju^t an attempt as to recover the chip, he 
would have the governor's engagement for the^r pu?d'^. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal vv Juld be p^cepted 
by men in their condition ; they fell down on their knees to the cap- 
tain, and promised with the deepest imprecations, that they would b», 
faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives 
to him, and would go with him all over the world ; and that they 
would own him as a father as long as they lived. " "Well," says the 
captain, " I must go and tell the governor what you say, aod see what 
I can do to bring him to consent to it." So he brought mo an ac- 
count of the temper he found thera in, and that he verily believed 
they would be faithful. However, that we might be very secure, I 
told him we should go back again and choose out those five, and tell 
them, that they might see he did not want men, that he would take 
out those five to be his OMsiBtante. and that the goreruor would keep

the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle 
(my cave) as hostages for the fidelity of those five ; and that if they 
proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged 
in chains alive on the shore. This looked severe, and convinced 
them that the governor was in earnest : however, they had no way 
left them but to accept it; and it was now the business of the 
prifioners, as much as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do 
their duty. 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition ; first, the 
captain, his mate, and passenger ; second, the two prisoners of tha 
first gang, to whom, having their character from the captain, I had 
given their liberty, and trusted them with arms : third, the other two 
that I had kept till now in my bower pinioned, but, on the captain's 
motion, had now released ; fourth, these five released at last ; so 
that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners in the 
cave for hostages. 

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands 
01, board the ship : but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think 
i\ was proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was 
employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them 
with victuals. As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them 
fust, but Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with 
necessaries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain 
liistance, where Friday was to take it. 

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the cap- 
tain, who told them I was the person the governor had ordpred to 
look after them ; and that it was the governor's pleasure that they 
should not stir anywhere but by my direction ; that if they did, 
they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons : so that as we 
never sufiered them to see me as a governor, I now appeared as 
another person, and apoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle, 
and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his 
two boats, stop the breach in one, and man them. He made his pas- 
senger captain of one, with four of the men ; and himself, his mate» 
and five more, went in the other ; and they contrived their businesa 
very well, for they came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as 
they came within call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and 
tell them they had brought off the men and the boat, but that it wae 
a long time before they had found them, and the like, holding theu> 
ia a chat till they came to the ship's side ; when the captain and tb« 



232 ADVENTU^lES Of 

I 
I mate entering first, with their arms, immediately knocked down vriwi 
eecond mate aud carpenter with the butt eud of their muskets, being 
yery faithfully seconded by their men ; they secured all the rest that 
were upon the main and quarter decks, and began to fasten the 
hatches, to keep them down that were belew ; when the other boat 
and their men entering at the fore-chains, secured the forecastle of 
the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the cook-room, mak- 
.iug three men they found there prisoners. When this was d®ne, and 
all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mat€ with three men, to 
break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who 
having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had 
got firearms into their hands ; and when the mate, with a crow, split 
open the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among 
them, and wounded the mate with a musket ball, which broke his 
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. The 
mate calling for help, ruahed, however, into the round-house, wounded 
as he was, and with his pistol shot the new captain through the head, 
the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of 
-his ears, so that he never spoke a word more : upon which the resfc 
yielded, and the ship was taken efiiectually, vdthout any more live* 
lost. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven 
guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give 
me notice of his success, which you may be sure I was very glad to 
hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it till near two o'clock 
in the morning. Having thus heard the signals plainly, I laid me 
down ; and it having been a day of fatigue to me, I slept very sound, 
till I was something surprised at the noise of a gun ; and presently 
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of "Governor, 
Governor," and presently I knew the captain's voice; when climbing 
up to the top of the bill, there he stood, and pointing to the sliip, he 
embraced me in his arms. " My dear friend and deliverer," says he, 
"there's your ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that be- 
long to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode within 
a little more than half a mile of the shore; for they had weighed her 
anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and the weather being 
feir, had brought her to anchor just against the mouth of the little 
oredk; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace in 
HOST the place where I at first landed my rafts, and so landed just at 
my door. I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise ; for I 
[j*w my deliveranco inde /I, visUilv put into my hands, all things 



B0B2NS0K GRUSOS, MS 

ftasy, and a large ship just ready to oarrj me away whither I pleased 
to g@. At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one 
word; but as he had taken me in'hia arma, I held fast by him, or I 
ghould have fallen to the ground. He perceived the surprise, and 
immediately pulls a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of 
eordial, which he had brought on purpose for me. After I had drank 
)it, I sat down upon the ground ; and though it brought me to myself 
;,yefc it was a good while before I could speak a word to him. All 
this time the poor man was in as great an ecstacy as I, only not under 
any surprise, as I was ; and he said a thousand kind and tender things 
to me, to compose and bring me to myself: but such was the flood of 
joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits into confusion ; at last it> 
broke out into tears ; and in a little while after I recovered my 
speech. I then took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and 
we rejoiced together. I told him I looked upon him as a man sent 
from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to 
be a chain of vvonders ; that such things as these were the testimonies 
we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and an 
evidence that the eye of an infinite power could search into the re- 
motest corner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever 
he pleased. I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to 
Heaven : and what heart could forbear to bless him, who had not only 
in a miraculous manner provided for me in such a wilderness, and ia 
such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance musi 
always be acknowledged to proceed ? 

When he had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought 
me some little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the 
wretches, that had been so long his masters, had not plundered him 
of. Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring 
the things ashoi'e that were for the governor ; and, indeed, it was » 
present as if I had been one that was not to be carried away with 
them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island still. First, h» 
had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six 
large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two 
pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship's 
beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and about a hundred 
weight of biscuit ; he also brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, 
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice, and abundance of 
other things. But, besides these, and what was a thousand times 
more useful to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, sis very good 
)ieokcloth8| two ^air c^ glOT«$!, Que pair of shoes^ a hat, and QHe pair 



234 advejmturss 09 

of Btockings, with a rery good suit of clothes of hit own, which had 
been worn but verj little ; in a word, he clothed me from head to 
foot. It was a very kind and ag;reeable present, as any one may im- 
agine, to one in my circumstances ^ but never was anything in the 
world, of that kind, so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to 
me to wear such clothes at first. 

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things 
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what 
was to be done with the prisoners wo had ; for it was worth consider- 
ing whether we might venture to take them away with us or no, 
especially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible and refrac- 
tory to the last degree ; and the captain said he knew they were such 
rogues, that there was no obliging them ; and if he did carry them 
away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to jus- 
tice at the first English colony he could come at ; and I found that th« 
captain himself was very anxious about it. Upon this I told him, 
that if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the two men he spoke 
of to make it their own request that ho should leave them upon the 
island. " I should be very glad of that," says the captain, " with all 
my heart" " Well," says I, " I will send for them up, and talk with 
them for you." So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they 
were now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise ; 
I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men pin- 
ioned, as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came. 
After some time I camo thither dressed in my new habit; and now I 
was called governor again. Being all met, and the captain with me, 
J caused the men to be brought before me, and I told them I had got 
a full account of their villanous behavior to the captain, and how 
they had run away \nth the ship, and were preparing to commit fur- 
ther roijberies, but that Providence had ensnared them in their own 
ways, and that they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for 
others. I let them know that by my direction the ship had been 
seized ; that she lay now in the road ; and they might see, by-and-by, 
that their new captain had received the reward ef his villany, and 
that they would see him hanging at the yard-arm ; that as to them, 1 
wanted to know what they had to say why I should aot execute them 
as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt 
but I had authority so to do. 

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had notb- 
iag to say but this, that when they were taken the captain promised 
t^em their Urea, and they humbly implorvd n^ ni«r0^. Bqt I told 



Ibava i know not what mercy to eliow tliem . fcr, as for myself, I had 
Miolvod to quit the island with all my men, and had taken pa8t^ag9 
with the captain to go for England ; and as for the captain be could 
not carry them to England other than as prisoners, in irons, to be tried 
ibr mutiny, and running away with the ship ; the consequence of 
which, they must needs know, would be the gallows ; so that I could 
sot tell what was best for them, unless they had a mind to take theii* 
iate in the island ; if they desired that, as I had liberty to leave the 
island, I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they thought 
they could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful for it, and 
said they would much rather venture to stay there than to he carried 
to England to be hanged ; so I left it on that issue. 

However, the captain seemed to mako some difficulty of it, as if he 
durst not leave them there. Upon this I seemed a little angry with 
the captain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not bis; and 
seeing that I had offered them so much favor, I would be as good a* 
my word ; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I would set 
them at liberty, as I found them ; and if he did not like it, he might 
take them again if he could catch them. Upon this they appeared 
very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them 
retire to the woods from whence they came, and I would leave them 
some fire-arms, some amrauuition, and some directions how they should 
live very well, if they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go oa 
hoard the ship ; but told the captain I would stay that night to pre- 
pare my things, and desired him to go on board, iu^'the meantime, and 
keep all right in the f<hip, and send the boat oa shore next day for 
me ; ordering him, at all events, to cause the new capta,in, who was 
killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him. 

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me, to my 
Apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them on their 
oireumstances. I told them I thought they had made a right choice ; 
that if the captain had carried them away, they would certainly be 
banged. I showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm of 
the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expect 

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told 
thorn I would let them into the story of my living there, and put them 
into the way of making it easy to them : accordingly, I gave them 
ihe whole history of the place, and of n\y coming to it; showed them 
mv fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured 
iiy grapes ; and, in a word, all that was neoessary to make them easy. 
i told th«tt the Mnj aiio of the ssveBteen Spaniards that were to U

expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat 
them in common with themselves. Here it may be noted, that the 
captain had ink on board, who was greatly surprised that I never hit ' 
upon a way of making ink of charcoal and water, or of something 
else, ag I had done things much more difificult. 

I left them my fire-arms, viz., five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and 
three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left \ for 
after the first year or two I used but little and wasted none. I gave 
them a description of the way I managed the goats, and direction to 
milk and fatten them, and to make butter and cheese ; in a word, \ 
gave them every part of my own story, and told them I should pre. 
vail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, 
and some garden-seeds, which I told them I would have been very 
glad of; also I gave them the bag of peas which the captain brought 
me to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increae© them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on board 
the ship. We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that 
night. The next morning, early, two of the five men came swimming 
to the ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint of the 
other three, begged to be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they 
ehould be murdered, and begged the captain to take tham on board, 
though he hanged them immediately. Upon this the captai%pretend. 
ed to have no power without me; but after some difficulty, and after 
their solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on board, and 
were some time airer soundly whipped and pickled ; after which they 
proved very honest and quiet fellows. 

Some time after this, the boat was order d on shore, the tide being 
up, with the things promised to the men ; to which the captain, at my 
intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they 
took, and were very thankful for. I also encouraged them, by telling 
them, that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, 
1 would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for reliques, 
the great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my par- 
rote ; also I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which 
had laid by me so long useless, that it was grown rusty or tarnished, 
and could hardly paas for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and 
handled; as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. 
And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I found by the 
ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and- 
twenty year», two monthi, aad nineteea days j b«ing deKvered from

Esi^l^nd by Land. 

HEN I came to England, I was a perfect stranger to all 
5) the world as if I had never been known there. My ben- 
efactor and faithful steward, whom I had left my money 
in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in 
(he world ; was become a widow the second time, and very low in tiie 
\rorld. I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her 
I would give her no trouble ; but on the contrary, in gratitude for 
former care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock 
Would afford ; which, at that time, would indeed allow me to do but 
little for her; but I assured her I would never forget her former 
Idndness to me ; nor did I forget her when I had iufBcient to help 
her, as shall be observed in its proper place. I went down afterward 
into Yorkshire ; but my father and mother were dead, and all the 
family extinct, except that I found two sisters, and two of the chil- 
dren of one of my brothers ; and as I had been long ago given over 
for dead, there had been no provision made for me ; so that, in » 
word, I found nothing to relieve or aswist me ; and that the little 
money I had would not do much for me as to settling in the world. 

1 met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expeot* 
and this was, that the master of the ship whom I had so happily de- 
livered, and by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having 
sjiven a very handsome account to the owners of th« manner how I 
tad saved the lives of the men and the ship, they invited me to meet 
them, and some other merchants concerned, and all together made me 
a very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a present of almost 
two hundred pounds sterling. 

But, after making several reflections upoa the circumstaneee of my 
Ufa, and how little wa.y this would jfo toward eettUgg me ia the worlfl. 



SoS jU>vfiirrDRSs oj^ 

I resolved to go to Lisbon, and lee if I might not como by sane infer^ 

matioii uf the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of ^hat was 
boouiue of my partner, who, I bad reason to suppose, had some years 
past givcu lue over for dead. With this •view 1 took shipping for 
Lisbon, where I arrived in April following; my man Friday accom. 
paaying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and proving a most 
faithful servant upon all occasions. When I came to Lisbon, I found 
out, by inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend th« 
captain of the ship who first took me up at sea off the shore of Africa. 
He was now grown old, and had left off going to sea, having put his 
sou, who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who still used 
the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly 
knew him ; but I soon brought him to my remembrance, when I told 
liim who I was. 

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between 
us, I inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner. 
The old man told lUe he had not been in the Brazils for about nine 
years, but that he could assure me that when he came away my part- 
ner was living, but the trustees whom I had joined with him to take 
cognizance of my part, wore both dead : that, however, he believed I 
would have a very good account of the iniprovemeut of the planta- 
tion, for that, upon the general belief of my being cast away and 
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the produce of my 
part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had appropriated 
it, in case I never came to claim it, one third to the king and two 
thk-di to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the 
benefit of the poor, nnd for the conversion of the Lidians to the Catho- 
lic faith ; but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the in- 
heritance, it would be restored, only that the improvement, or annual 
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored; 
but he assured me that the steward of the king's revenue from land% 
and the proviodore, or steward of the monaRtery, had taken great car© 
all along that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner, gave every 
year a faithful account of the produce, of which they had duly re- 
ceived my moiety. I asked him if he knew to what height of im- 
provement he had brought the plantation, and whether he thought it 
might, be worth looking after, or whether, on my going thither, I 
■hould meet with any obstruction to my possessing my just right to 
the nioieiy. Ho told me he could not tell exactly to what degree the 
plantation was improved, but this he knew, that my partner was 
giowa exceeding rich upoa tUo onjoying bis part of it, and that, to 



the best of his remembrance, lie had heard that the auig's third of 
mj parts \vhi(jh was, it seems, granted uway to ^ouie other luoiiastery 
cr religious house, amounted to above two huudied moidores a year; 
that, aa to my being restored to a quiet possession of it, there was no 
question to bo niado of that, my partner being alive to witness my 
title, and my name being also enrolled in tho register of tho country. 
Also, he told me that the su'-vivora of my two trustees were very fair, 
honest people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only 
have their assistance for putting mo in possession, but would find o 
very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account, being 
the produce of the farm while their fathers heM the trust, and before 
it was given up, as above, which, as bo remembered, waa for about 
twelve years. 

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and 
in]uirod of the old capt;ain how it came to pass that tho trusieea 
should thus dispose of my eflFects when he knew that I had made my 
will, and had made hiri, tho Portuguese captain, my universal 
heir, &c. 

He told me that was true, but that oa there was no proof of my 
bemg dead, he could not act as executor until some certain account 
should come of my death ; and, besides, he was not willing to inter- 
meddle with a thing so remote ; that it was true he had registered my 
will, and put in his claim, and could he have given any account of my 
being dead or alive, he would have acted by procuration, and taken 
possession of the ingenio (so they called the sugar-house), and have 
given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to do it. " But," 
Bays the old man, *• I have one pieca of news to tell yon, which, per* 
haps, may not be so acceptable to you as the rest, and that is, believ- 
ing-vou were lost, and all the world believing so, also, your partner 
and trustees did offer to account with me, in your name, for six or 
eight of th0 first years' profits, which I received. There being at 
that time great disbursements for increasing the works, building an 
ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as 
afterward it produced; however," says tho old man, •' I shall give 
you a true account of what I liavo received ia all, and hov: I have 
disposed of it." 

After a few days' further conference with this ancient friend, he 
brought me an account of the first sis years' income of plantation, 
signed by my partner and tho merchant trustees, being always de- 
livered in tho goods, viz., tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides 
nun, molasses, &c,, which is the consoqurnc? of r\ si^gar wort. • f«2cl I 



24d ADVENTURES OF 

found, bj this acoouat, that every year the incoi^e considerably in- 
treased, but, as above, the disbursements being large, the sum at first 
was nnall ; however, the old man let me see that he was debtor to me 
four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of 
sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship, 
he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven 
years after my leaving the place. The good man then began to complain 
of his misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of my 
money to recover his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. 
" However, my old friend," says he, " you shall not want a supply in 
your necessity, and, as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully 
satisfied." Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me one 
hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and, giving the wri- 
iiags of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, 
of which he was a quarter part owner, and his son another, he puts 
them both into my bands for security of the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor 
man to be able to bear this, and remembering what he had done for 
me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how generously ho had used 
me on all occasions, and particularly, how sincere a friend he was 
now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what he had said to me ; 
therefore, I asked him if his circumstances admitted him to spare so 
much money at that time, and if it would not straiten him. lie told 
me he conld not say but it might straiten him a little, but, however, 
it was my money, and I might want it more than he. 

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could 
hardly refrain from tears while he spoke ; in short, I took one hun- 
dred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a re- 
ceipt for them ; then I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I 
had possession of the plantation, I would return the other to him also 
(as, indeed, I afterward did) ; and that, as to the bill of sale of his 
part in his son's ship, I would not take it by any means, but that if 
I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to pay me, and if 
I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to oxpeot, I 
would never have a penny more from him. 

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into 
a method to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I thought 
to go over to it myself He said I might do so if I pleased ; but that 
if I did not, there were ways enough to seouro my right, and im- 
mediately to appropriate the profita to my nm ; and as there were 
ships in t^« yivpr of Insbon juat. ready to go away to Braril^ he madf

toe enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit, affii'ming, 
upon oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same persoa who took 
up the land for the planting the said plantation at first. This being 
regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed 
me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his ac- 
quaintance at the place ; and then proposed my staying with him till 
an account came of the return. i 

Never was anything more honorable than the proceedings upon, 
this procuration ; for in less than seven months I received a large 
packet from the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose 
account I went to sea, in which were the following particular letters 
and papers^nclosed : 

First. There was the accoun.t current of the produce of my farm 
or plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my 
old Portugal captain, being for six years : the balance appeared to ba 
one thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favor. 

Secondly. There was the account of four years more, while they 
kept the effects in their hands, before the government claimed the ad^ 
ministration, as being the effects of a person not to be found, which 
they called civil death ; and the balance of this, the value of the 
plantation increasing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred 
and forty-six crusadoes, being about three thousand two hundred and 
forty moidores. 

Thirdly. There was the prior of Augustine's account, who had re- 
ceived the profits for above fourteen years ; but not being able to ac- 
count for what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly de- 
clared he had eight hundred and seventy -two moidores not distributed, 
which he acknowledged to my account : as to the king's part, that 
refunded nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner's, coiagratulating me very 
r.ffectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the 
estate was improved, and what it produced a year ; with a particular 
of the number of squares or acres that it contained, how planted, 
how many slaves there were upon it, and making two-and-twenty 
crosses for blessings, told he had said so many Ave Marias to thank 
the blessed Virgin that I was alive ; inviting me very passionately to 
come over and take possession of my own ; and, in the meantime, to 
give him orders to vhom he shock! deliver my effeets, if I did not 
come myself; coneluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and 
that of his family; and sent ms, as a present, seven fine leopards'

ship that he had sent thither, and who, it Beems, had made a bett«f 
voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, 
and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so largo as moidores. 
By the Bame fleet, my two merchant trustees shipped me one thousand 
two hundred chesta of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and the 
wet of the whole account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job waa better 
than the beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of my 
rery heart, when I found all my wealth about me ; for as the Brazil 
ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters 
brought my goods : and the effects were safe in the river before the 
letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale and grew aick; 
and had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the 
sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the 
spot : nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours, till 
a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause of my ill- 
ness being known, he ordered me to be let blood ; after which I had 
relief, and grew well : but I verily beUeve, if I had not been eased by a 
vent given in that manner to the spirits, I should have died. 

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds 
sterling in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the 
Brayjls, of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of 
lands in England; and, in a word, I was in a condition which I 
scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the en. 
joyment of it. The first thing I did was to recompense my original 
benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me 
in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to mo at the 
end. I showed him all that was sent to mo ; I told him, that next to 
the providence of Heaven, which disposed all things, it was owing to 
him, and that it now lay on me to reward him, which I would do a 
hundred-fold : so I first returned to him the hundred moidores I had 
received of him; then I sent for a notary, and caused him to draw up 
a general release or discharge from the four hundred and seventy 
moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and 
firmest manner possible. After whieh I caused a procuration to be 
drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the annual profits of my 
plantation, and appointing my partner to account with him, and make 
the returns by the usual fleets to him in my name ; and a clause in 
the end, being a grant of ono hundred moidores a year to him during 
his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores a year to his son after 
him, for his life : and thu> I requited my old mae 



^ \^as aow to consider which way to steer my course next, and 
frhat to do with tiio estate that Providence had thus put into my 
hands ; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I had 
in my silent state of life in the island, where I ■wanted nothing but 
what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted ; whereas I had now 
a great charge upon nie, and my business was how to secure it, I 
had never a cave now to hide my money in, or a place where it 
might lie without a lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished, 
before anybody would meddle with it ; on the contrary, I knew not 
where to put it, or whom to trust with it. My old patron, the cap- 
tain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only refuge I had. In the 
next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon ma thither; 
but now I could not tell how to think of going thither till I had 
settled my afiairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind me. 
At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who I knew was 
honest, and would be just to me ; but then she was in years, and but 
poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt : so that, in a word, I 
had no way but to go back to England myself, and take my effecta 
with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and 
therefore, as I rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, 
■who had been my former benefactor, so I began to think of my poor 
widoW; whose husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while 
it wad in her power, my faithful steward and instructor. So the first 
thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write his correspondent in 
London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her 
ir money a hundred pounds for me, and to talk with her, and comfort 
her in hex poverty^ by telling her she should, if 1 lived, have a further 
supply : at the same time I sent my two sisters in the country a 
hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want, yet not in 
very good circumstances; one having been married and left a widow; 
and the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should 
be. But among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet 
pit<5h upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock, that 
that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind me j 
and this greatly perplexed me. 

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled 
myself there ; for 1 was, as it were, naturalized to the place ; but I 
had some little scruple in ray mind about religion, wliich insensibly 
drew me back. However, it was not religion which kept me from 
going there for the present ; and as I had made no scruple of bei^g 



844 ADVBNI'URES OP 

openly of the religion, of the country all the while I was among them, 
so neither did I yet; only that, now and then, having of late thouglu 
more of it than formerly, when I began to think of living and dying 
among them, I began to regret my having professed myself a Papist, 
and thought it might not be the best religion to die with. 

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from 
going to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom tq 
leave my effects behind me ; so I resolved, at last, to go to Englan(^ 
with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I should make eome ac^ 
quaintancfc. or find some relations that would be faithful to me ; and, 
accordingly, K prepared to go to England with all my wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first, the Brazil 
fleet being just going away, resolved to give answers suitable to the 
just and faitliful account of things I had from thence ; and, first, t<? 
the prior of St. Augustiae I wrote a letter full of thanks for their just 
dealings, and the offer of tbo eight hundred and seventy-two moidores 
which were undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hun- 
dred to the monastery, and thre^ hundred and seventy-two to the 
poor, as the prior should direct ; desiring the good padre's prayers 
for me, and the like. I wrote next C letter of thanks to my two trus- 
tees, with all the acknowledgment that »C much justice and honesty 
called for ; as for sending them any present, they were far above 
having any occasion for it. Lastly, I wrote *i» zny partnei", acknowl- 
edging his industry in the improving the planwtic.n, and his integrity 
in increasing the stock of the works; giving him inetructions for his 
future government of my part, according to the powers I had left 
with my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became 
due to me, till he should hear fi'om me more particularly ; aesuy-in* 
him that it was my intention not only to oome to him, but to se*^^tl? 
myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very 
handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two daugh' 
ters, for such the captain's son informed me he had; with two pieces 
of fine Eogiish broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five piece? 
of black baize, and some Flanders lace of good value. 

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and tamed all m;^ 
effects into good bills of exchange, my nest difficulty was, which way 
to go to England ; I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet 
I had a strange aversion to go to England by sea at that time ; and 
though I could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon 
me 80 mueh, that though I had once shipped my baggage, in order to 
go, yet I altered my miad, (vud that not oncoj but two or tlu:e« timea. ( 



ftOBlNSON OUtJSOB. ^\5 

It IS ttne, I had been rery unfortunate by g«», and this might be 
some of the reasons ; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his 
own thoughts in cases of such moment; two of the ships which I had 
singled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any 
*ther, having put my things on board one of them, and in the othee 
to have agreed with the captain ; I say, two of these ships miscarried, 
viz. : one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was cast away on 
the Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned, except three ; so 
that in either' of those vegselsl had been made miierable. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whota 
I communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by saa, 
but either to go by land to the Groyne (Corunna), and cross over the 
Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and iafe 
journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover ; or to go up 
to Madrid, and so all the way by \and through France. In a word, I 
W'as so prepossessed against my going by sea at all, except from 
Calais to Dovar, that I resolved to travel all the. way by land; which, 
as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by much the 
pleasanter way ; and to make it more so, my old captain brought an 
English gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing 
to travel with me ; after which we picked up two more English mer- 
chants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to 
Paris only ; so that in all there were six of us, and five servants ; the 
two merchants and the two Portuguese contenting themselves with 
one servant between two, to save the charge ; and as for me, I got an 
English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, 
who was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of 
a servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out fi'om Lisbon ; and our company being 
very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof, they 
did me the honor to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest 
jman, as because I had two servants, and, indeed, was the original of 
the whole journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall 
trouble you now with none of my land journal : but some adventures 
that happened to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit. 

When we came to Madrid, Ave, being all of us strangers to Spain, 
were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and to 
see what was M'orth observing ; but it being the latter part of the 
summer, we hastened away, and set out fi-ona Madrid about the mid- 
die of October ; but when we came to the edge of Navarre^ we WQM 



S46 i.DV1£NTU££S 0^ 

alarmed, at several tOTrns ou the Mraj, with an account that so muclk 
«jc\v was fallen on the French side of the mountains, that eeverul 
travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having at. 
tempted, at an extreme hazard, to pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found ifc so, indeed, and to 
me, that had been always used to a hot climate, and to countrie* 
where I could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable p 
nor, indeed, was it more painful than surprising, to come but ten days 
before out of Old Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but 
very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyreuean moun? 
tains, 80 very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en- 
danger the benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when ho saw the mountains all 
covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen 
or felt before in his life. To mend the matter, when we came to 
Pampeluna, it continued snowing with so much violence, and so long, 
that the people said winter was come before its time; and the roads, 
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable; for, in a 
word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel, and 
being not hard frozen, as is the case in the northern countries, there 
was no going without being in danger of being buried alive every 
step. We stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna ; when, seeing 
the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was 
the severest winter all over Europe that had been known in the 
memory of man, I proposed that we should all go away to Fontarabia, 
t and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little 
voyage. But while I was considering this, there came in four French 
gentlemen, who having been stopped on the French side of the passes, 
as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who traversing 
the country near the head of Langucdoc, had brought them over tho 
Hiountains by such ways, that they were not much incommoded witb 
the snow; for where they met with snow in any quantity, they said 
it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their horses. We sent 
for this guide, who told us he would undertake to carry us the same 
way with no hazard from tho snow, provided we were armed suffi- 
ciently to protect ourselves from wild beasts ; for, he said, upon these 
great snows it waa frequent for some wolves to show themselves at 
ike foot of tho mountains, being made ravenous for want of food, the 
ground being covered with snow. We told him we wore well enough 
prepared for such creatures as they were, if he would insure us from 
ft )dad of two-legged wolves, which, we were told, we were ia most

danger from, especially on the French side of the mountains, H» 
satisfied us that there was ao danger of that kind in the way that wo 
■were to go ; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve 
other gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, 
M I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna, with our guide, on the 
15fch of November : and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of 
going forward, he came directly back with us on the same road thak 
\re came from Madrid, about twenty miles ; when having passed two 
rivers, and came into the plain country, we found ourselves in a warm 
climate again, where the country was pleasant, and no snow to bd 
seen ; but on a sudden turning to his left, he approached the moun< 
tains another way ; and though it is true the hills and precipices look- 
ed dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by 
such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the 
mountains without being much encumbered with the snow ; and, all oa 
a sudden, he showed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoo 
and Qascouy, all green and flourishing, though, indeed, at a greet 
distance, and wo had some rough way to pass still. 

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed, one 
whole day and a night, so fast that we could not travel ; but he bid us be 
easy ; we should soon be past it all ; we found, indeed, that we began 
to desce nd every day, and to come more north than before ; and so, 
d^>6nding upon our guide, we went on. 



ifdday'a Encounter with a Bear— Bobiaeon and hie Fellow-Traveller attacked Iv 
a Flock of Wolves— His Arrangement of biaAffitira^ and Ifarriage after iiia 
Betora to England. 

T was about two hours before night, when our guide being 
Komething before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three 
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way 
adjoining to a thick wood ; two of the wolves made at the guide 
and had he been far before us, he would have been devoured before 
we could have helped him ; one of them fastened upon his horse, and the 
other attacked the man with that violence, that he had not time or 
presence of mind enough to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried 
out to me most Justily. My man Friday being next to me, I bade him 




i4A ADVBNTURES OF 

riie up, and see what ■vras the matter. As soon as Friday came in 
sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, " master ! 
master !" but like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, 
and -with his pistol shot the wolf, that attacked him, in the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; for h« 
having been used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear r©y 
speoting them, but went close up to him and shot him, as above ; 
whereas any other of us would have fired at a greater distance, and 
Vave perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered shooting the man- 
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I ; and, in- 
deed, it alarmed all our company, when with the noise of Friday's 
pistol, we heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves ; 
and the noise, redoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to 
n» as if there had been a prodigious number of them ; and perhaps, 
there was not such a few as that we had no cause of apprehensions ; 
howeTer, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other that had fastened 
upon the horse left immediately, and fled, without doing him any 
damage, having happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of 
the bridle had stuck in his teeth. But the man was most hurt; for 
th© raging creature had bit him twice, once in the arm, and the other 
time a little above bis knee : and though he had made some defence, 
fee was jugt as it were tumbling down by the disorder of his horse 
when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday's pistol we all 
mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very 
difSculf, would give us leave, to see what was the matter. As soon as 
we came clear of tho trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly 
what had been the case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor 
guide, though we did not presently discern what kind of creature it 
was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising 
manner, as that which followed, between Friday and the bear, which 
gave us all, though at first we were surprised and afraid of himj the 
p-eatest diversion imaginable. As tho bear is a heavy, clumsy crea- 
ture, and does not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so 
he has two particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his 
o,cii(«:R: first, as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not 
usually attempt them, except they first attack him, unless he be ex- 
cessively hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the 
ground Ijeing covered with snoAv), if you do not meddle with him, he 
\i\]X not meddlp with you,' but (:h(|ir\ you. mwst t^ke ^lar^ to be very

civil to him, and give him the road, for he is a very nice gentleman; 
he will not go a Btep out of his way for a prince ; nay, if you are 
really afraid, your best way is to look another way, and keep going 
on ; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look steadfastly at 
him, he takes it for an affront ; but if you throw or toss anything at 
him, and it hitg him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as youij 
finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all other bnsiness aside to 
pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honor ; this 
is his first quality ; the next is, if he be once affronted, he will never 
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good 
Tound rate, till he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to 
him, he was helping him off his horse, for the man was both hurt and 
frightened, when, on a sudden, we espied the bear come out of the 
wood, and a vast, monstrous one it was, the biggest, by far, that ever 
I saw. "We were all a little surprised when we saw him ; but when 
Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's 
countenance; "0, 0. 0!" says Friday, three times, pointing to him J 
•'Oh master ! you give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him ; me 
makee yQu good laugh." 

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. " You fool," says 
I, " he will eat you up." " Eatee me up ! eatee me up !" says Friday, 
twice over again ; " me eatee him up ; me makee you good laugh ; 
you all stay here, me show you good laugh." So down he sits, and 
gets off his boots in a moment, and puts on a pair of pumps (as we 
call the flat shoes they wear, and which he had in his pocket), gives 
my other servant his horse, and with his gun away he flew, swift like 
the wind. 

. The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with nobodyj, 
till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could un- 
derstand him, " Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, " me speakee with 
you." We followed at a distance ; for now being come down on the 
Gascony side of the mountains, we were entered a vast great forer*", 
whore the country was plain and pretty open, though it had many 
trees in it scattered here and there. Friday, who had, as we say, the 
heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a great 
stone and throws it at him, and hit him just on the head, but did hina 
no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall ; but it answer- 
ed Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely 
to make the hoar follow him, and show us " some laugh,/' as he called it. 
As IQQu aa tho \\qm felt the blw, ivpd saw hi^^ he i}i^m. ^)yiv^^\ and

comefl after him, taj^Iag devilish long strides and shatflln^ On all 
strange rate, such as would have put a horse to a middling gallop; 
away runs Friday, and takes his course as if he ran toward us tor 
help J so we all resolved to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my 
man; though I was angry at him, heartily, for bringing the bear 
back upon us, when he was going about his own business another 
way ] and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear upoi 
us, and then run away : and I called out, *' You dog, is this your ma^ 
king us laugh ? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoofe 
the creature." He heard me, and cried out, '' No shoot^ no shoot; 
stand still, and you get much kugh f an<i as the nimole creature ran 
two feet for the beai-'s one, he tui'ned or. a sudden, on one eide of as, 
and seeing a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to 
follow ; and doubling his pace, he geti nimbly up the tree, l.iyirig his 
gun down on the ground, at about fivL or six yards from the bottom of 
the tree. The bear soon came to tht tree, and we followed at a dis- 
tance ; the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt of it, bui 
let it lie, and up he bcrambles into che tree, climbing like a oat, though 
80 monstrous heavy. I was amaztd at the folly, aa I thought it, of my 
man, and could not, for my life, see anything to laugh at yel^ till see- 
ing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small 
end of a large branch, and the bear got about half way to him. As 
soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of the tree wa» 
weaker, " Ha !" says he to us, " now you see me teachee the bear 
dance." So he falls a jumping and shaking the bough, at which the 
bear began to totter, but stood still and began to look behind him, ♦<> 
twe how he should get back; then, indeed, we did laugh heartily. 
But Friday had not done with him by a great deal ; when seeing him 
stand still, he calls out to him again, as if he had supposed the bear 
could speak English, '•' What, you come no farther T Pray you come 
farther." So he left jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear 
just as if he understood what he said, did come a little farther ; then 
he fell a jumping again, and the bear stopped again. We thought 
now was a good time to knock him on the head, and called to Friday 
to stand still and we would shoot the bear, but he cried out carne.'^tly, 
'•0 pray ! pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then ;" he would have 
said by-and-by. However, to shorten the story. Friday danced so 
much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough, 
but still could not imagine what t^he fellow would do, for first wo 
thought he depended upon shaking tiie bear off ; and we found the 



Lear was too ounohig for that, too, for be would not go out far enough 
to be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad clawa and 
feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end ot" it, and 
what the jest would be at last. But Friday puts us out of doubt 
quickly^ for seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that he would 
not bo persuaded to come any farther, " Well, well,"' says Frida)^ 
"you no come faa-ther, me go; you no come to mo, me come to you;** 
and upon this he goes out to the smaller end of the bough, where it 
would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sli- 
ding down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on bis 
feet, and away he runs to his guu, takes it up, and stands still. " Well," 
said I to him, " Friday, what will you do now ? Why don't you shoot 
bim?'"' " No shoot," says Friday, "no yet; me no shoot now, me no 
kill; me stay, give you one more laugh;'"' indeed, so he did, aa you 
will see presently, for when the bear saw his enemy gone, he comea 
back from the bough where he stood, but did it mighty cautiously 
looking behind him every step, and coming backward till he got into 
the body of the tree, then, with the same hinder-end foremost, he came 
down the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a 
time, very leisurely. At this junctore, and just before he could set 
bis hind-foot on the ground, i'riday stepped up close to him, clapped 
the muzzle of hi» piece in his ear, and shot him dead. Then tha 
rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh ; and when he saw wa 
were pleased, by our looks, be falls a laughing himself very loud. 
•* So we kill bear in my country," says Friday. " So you kill them ?" 
Bdya I, '• why, you have no guns." 'No," says he, " no gun, but shoot 
great much long arrow." This was a good diversion to us; but we 
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much hurt, and what to 
do we hardly knew. The howling of wolves run much in my bead^ 
and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of 
which I have said somethmg already, I never beard anything that 
filled me with so much horror. 

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as 
Friday would have bad us, we should certainly have taken the skin 
of this monstrous creature off, which wao worth saving; but we bad 
near three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us, so we left bim, 
and went forward on our journey. 

The ground was still csvered with snow, though not so deep and 
dangerous as on the mountains, and the ravenous creatures, as wo 
heard afterward, were come down into the forest and plain country, 
tressed by hunger^ to seek for food, and bad douo a great deal of mi«'

chief ia the villages, vrhere they surprised the country people, killed 
a great mttny of their sheep and hoi-ses, and some people, too. We 
had one dangerous place to pass, of which our guide told us, if ihero 
were more wolves in the, country we should find them there; and ilii\? 
was a small plain, surrounded with woods on every side, and a long 
narrow defile or lane, which we were to pass to get through the 
■wood, and then we should come to the village where we were to lodge= 
It waa within a half an hour of sunset when we entered the first wood, 
and a little after suneet when we came into the plain. We met with 
»Otliing in the first wood, except that, in a little plain within tha 
wood, which was not above two furlongs over, we saw five great 
wolves cross the road, full speed, one after another, as if they had 
been in chase of some prey, and had it in view ; they took no notice 
of us, and were gone out of sight in a few moments. Upon this our 
guide, who, by-the-way, was but a faint-hearted fellow, bid us keep 
in a ready posture, for he believed there were more wolves a coming. 
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us, but we saw no more 
wolves till we came through that wood, which was near half a league, 
and entered the plain. As soon as we came into the plain we had 
occasion enough to look about us ; the first object we met with was a 
dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed, and 
at least a dozen of them at work, we could not say eating of him, but 
picking of his bones, rather, for they had eaten up all the flesh before^ 
We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither did they 
take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at them, but I 
would not sufier him, by any means, for I found we were like to have 
more business upon our hands than we were aware of. We were not 
gone half ?lver the plain when we began to hear the wolves howl in 
the wood on our left in a frightful manner, and presently after w« 
aaw about a hundred coming on directly toward us, all in a body, and 
most of them in a line, as regularly as an army, drawn up by an ex- 
perienced oflScer. I scarce knew in what manner to receive them, 
but found to draw ourselves in a close line was the only way, so wo 
formed in a moment; but, that we might not have too much interval, 
I ordered that only every other man should fire, and that the others 
who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second volley 
immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then, that 
thoec who had fired at first should not pretend to load their fusees 
agriiii, but strand ready every one with a pistol, for wo were all armed 
with a fusee and a pair of pistols each man ; so we were, by thi* 
method, able to fire six volleys, half of ua at a time. Howeve*; at

remembering that I had tsen told that the fiercest creatures were t«i. 
rliied at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo m 
Scud ae we could ; and I found the notion not altogether miitakon, ftw 
npon our ehout they began to retire and turn about. I then order©4 
4 Beoond volley to bo fired in their rear, which put them to the gaj. 
top. and away they went to the woods. This gave as leisure to oharjf i 
our pieces again, and that we might lose no time, we kept going ; 
Dut we had but little more than loaded our fusees, and pat ourselvei 
m readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in the same wood, ai 
our left, only that it was farther onward, the same way we were 
to go. 

"Hie night waa coming on, and the light began to be dusky, whicA 
»ade it worse on our side j but the noiw increasing, we could easily 
perceive that it was the howling and yelling of those helliah creatures • 
and on a sudden we perceived two or three troops of wolves, one 05 
our left, one behind us, and one in our front, so that we seemed to be 
surrounded with them ; however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept 
our way forward, as ftist as we could make our horsos go, v^Wch, the 
Way being very rough, was only a good hard trot. In this mannei 
*re came in view of the entrance of the wood, through which we were 
to pass, at the farther aide of the plain ; but we were greatly surprised, 
when, ooming nearer the lane or pass, we saw a confused number ©9 
wolves standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at another open 
ing of a wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and looking that way oat 
rnehed a horse, with a saddle and bridle on him, flying like the wind, 
4nd euxteen or seventeen wolves after him, full speed ; indeed, the 
horse had the heels of them, but as we supposod that he could not 
hold it that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at 
a«t ; no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for riding up to the en- 
tranoe where the horse came out, we found the careasaes of another 
horse and two men, devoured by the ravenous creatures : and one ot 
the men was no doubt the same whom we heard fire the gua, fer 
there lay a gun just by him fired off; but «3 to the man, his head aot 
Uie upper part of his body were eaten up. This filled u» with horror

for fi^ gathers^ ^bfrnt oa presently, b hopos of pr«7, ted 1 
Tsrily believe tt^re we.e three hundred of them, it happexied rvf) 
mach to our aUvantage, that at the entrance into the wood, bat • 
little way from it, there lay some large timber trees, which bad bees 
eat down the summer before, and I supposed lay there for carriage 
I drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing onrsolres in 
ft Une behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping 
tiuki tree before us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle or thre^ 
froDtM enclosing our horses in the centre. Wo did so and it was well 
we did; for never was a more furious charge than the oreaturei 
made upon us in this place. They came on with a growling kind of 
Doiae, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as I said, was our 
breastwork, aa if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and this 
fury of theirs, it seems, was prinoipally occasioned by their seeing 
our horses behind us. I ordered our men to fire as before, every other 
man ; and they took their aims so sure, that they killed several of the 
wolves at the first volley ; but there was a necessity to keep a ooa 
tinoal firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on 
those before. 

When we had fired a second volley of our fuses, we thought they 
■topped a little, and I hoped they would have gone off; but it wai 
out a moment, for others came forward again ; so we fired two vol- 
leyi of our pistols ; and I believe in these four firings we killed seven- 
teen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many, yet they came . o 
again. I was loath to spend our shot too hastily ; so I called my 
servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed, for, wiA 
the greatest dexterity imuginable, he had charged my fusee and hie 
own while we wore engaged; but as I said I called my other maH; 
And giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all along tfas 
Uece of timber, and let it be a large train. De did so ; and had bat 
juflt time to get away, when the wolves caitfe up to it, and some got 
open it, when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the powder 
wt it on fire; those that were upon the t'mber were scorched with it 
and six or seven of them fell or rather jumped in among us, with the 
force and fright of the fire ; we dispatched these in an instant, and the 
rest were so frightened with the light, which the night, for it was 
BOW very dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a little; 
upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one volley, and 
after that we gave a ^out ; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we 
■allied immediately upon D<)ar twenty lame ones, that we found strug-

better ofideratood by their fellows ; bo that they all fled aad left U8. 

We had, first aud last, killed about three score of them , and had It 
been daylight, we had killed many more. The field of battle being 
tbofl cleared, we made forward again, for we had still near a leagufl 
le go. We heard the ravenous creatures howl aud yell in the woods 
u we went, several times, and sometimes we fancied we saw some ci 
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were DOt certain ; in abcot 
ftD hour more we came to the town where we were to lodge, which 
we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms ; for, it seems, the night 
before, the wolves and some bears had broke into the village, and put 
them in such terror, that they were obliged to keep guard night and 
day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and, indeed 
their people. 

The next morning our guide was bo ill, and his limbs swelled $o 
much with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no 
farther ; bo we were obliged to take a new guide here, and go to 
Toulouse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant 
country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like them ; but when 
we told our Btory at Toulouse, they told us it ^vafl nothing but what 
wai ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains, espe- 
eially when the snow lay on the ground ; but they inquired much 
what kind of a guide we had got, who would venture to bring us that 
way in such a severe season ; and told us it was surprising we were 
not all devoured. When we told them how we placed ourselves, and 
the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it 
was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed : for it was the sight of 
ihe horses which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey ; aad 
tSiat, at other times, they are really afraid of a gun ; but being ez 
IMsive hungry, aud raging on that account, the eagerness tc (Hxsie at 
fte horses had made them senseless of danger ; and tbat if we had 
•ot, by the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the train of 
powder, mastered them, it bad been great odds but that we had been 
lom to pieces ; that whereas, had we been content to have sat still on 
horeebaok, and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the 
honee eo mnoh for their own, when men were on their backs, as 
etiterwise ; and withal they told us, that, at last, if we had stood alto 
gether, and left our horses, they would have been so eager to have 
iev^ured thexxi, that we might have come ofi* safe, especially having 
oat fire-Mrme in ou; hands, and being so many in number. For ray

?o6 ADVENTUJlES Of 

three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour \l9^ 
and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave myself oveor 
for lost ; and, as it was, I believe I shall never care to cross those 
mountains again ; I think I would much rather go a thousand leagues 
by sea, though I was sure to meet with a storm once a weeL 

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through 
France, nothing but what other travellers have given an account of, 
with much more advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse 
to Paris, and without any considerable stay came to Calais, and landed 
raafe at Dover, the 14th of January, after having a severe cold season 
to travel in. 

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little 
time all my new discovered estate safe about me ; the bills of ej- 
change which I brought with me having been very currently paid. 

My principal guide and privy counsellor was my good ancient 
widow ; who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no 
pains too much, nor care too great, to employ for me ; and I trusted 
her so entirely with everything, that I was perfectly easy as to the 
security of my effects : and, indeed, I was very happy from the be- 
ginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of thia good 
r«vntlewoman. 

i; aow resolved to dispose of my plantation in the Brazils, if I could 
find means. For this purpose, I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon, 
who havins; offered it to the two merchants, the survivors of my 
trustees, who lived in the Brazils, they accepted the offer, and re- 
mitted thirty-three thousand pjieces of eight to a correspondent of 
theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it. Having signed the instrument of sale, 
and sent it to my old friend, he remitted me bills of exchange for 
thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate, re- 
eerving the payment of a hundred moidoros a year to himself during 
his life, and fifty moidores afterward to his son for life, which I had 
promised them. 

Though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep 
ftie country out of my head ; nor could I resist the strong inclination 
I had to seo my island. My true friend, the widow, earnestly dis- 
Buaded me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for almost seven 
yearSTishe prevented my running abroad ; during which time I took 
my two nephews, the children of one of my brotliers, into my care ; 
the eldest havmg something of bis own, I bred up as a gentlemen, 
%nd gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate, after my 
decease. The other I put out to a captaiij of a ship j and after five

yea*^ 4ndiog him a sensible, bold, euterpriaing yeaiag fellow, I pat 
him into a good ship, and sent him to sea : and this young fellow 
aftei'ward drew me in, old us I was, to further adventures myself 

In the meantime, I in part settled myself here ; for, first of all, I 
married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, 
and had three children, two sons and one daughter ; but my wife 
I dying, and my nephew coming home with good success from a voyage 
to Spain, my inclination to go abroad and his importunity prevailed, 
and engaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the East 
Tndies ; this was in the year 1694. 

But these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new 
adventures of my own, for ten years more, I shall give a further ac- 
count of. 

That homely proverb used on so many occasions in England, viz., 
" That what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh," was 
never more verified than in the story of my life. Any one would 
think that, after five years' aflSiction, and a variety of unhappy cir- 
cumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through before, and 
after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fullness of all 
things, grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have 
had experience of every state of middle life, and to know which was 
most adapted to make a man completely happy ; I say, after all thie^ 
any one would have thought that the native propensity to rambling, 
which I gave an account of in my first setting out in the world to 
have been so predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the 
volatile part be fully evacuated, or at least condensed, and I might, 
at sixty-one years of age, have been a little inclined to stay at home 
and have done venturing life and fortune any more. 

Nay, further, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken 
away in me ; for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek: 
if I had gained ten thousand pounds, I had been no richer ; for I had 
already suflScient for me, and for those I had to leave it to ; and that 
I had was visibly increasing; for having no great family, I could not 
spend the income of what I had, unless I would set up for an esi- 
pensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, equipage, 
gayety, and the like, which were things I had no notion of, or inclina- 
tion to ; so that I had nothing indeed to do but to sit still, and fully 
enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily upon my hands. Yet 
ail these things had no effect upon me, or at least not enough to resist 
the strong inclination I had to go abroad again, which hung about 
me like a ahronicle distemper. lu particular, the desire of eeeine mv

upon it all day ; it was uppermost in all my thoughts ; and my fancy 
worked so steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my 
Bleep : in short, nothing could remove it out of my mind : it eveu 
broke so violently into all my discourses, that it made my conversa^ 
tion tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else : all my discourse raa

HAVE often heard persons of good judgment say, that all 
the stir people make in the world about ghosts and appari. 
tions is owing to the strength of imagination, and the power, 
i ful operation of fancy in their minds ; that there is no such; 
Ihing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like j that 
people's poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their de. 
ceased friends, so realizes it to them, that they are capable of fancying, 
upon some extraordinary circumstauces, that they see them, talk to 
them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but 
•hadow and vapor in the thing, and they really know nothing of the 
matter. 

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any euch 
things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people after they 
are dead : or whether there is anything in the stories they tell us of 
that kind, more than the product of vapors, sick minds, and wandering 
fancies ; but this I know, that my imagination worked up to uuch a 
height, and brouglit me into such excess of vapors, or what elsp I may 
call it, that I actually supposed myself often upon the spot, at my old 
citetle, behind the trees ; saw ray old Spaniard, Friday's father, and 
the reprobate sailors I left upon the island ; nay, I fancied I talked 
to them, and looked at them steadily, though I was broad awake, 
as at persons just before me; and this I did till I often frightened 
myself with the images my fancy represented to me. One time, 
in ray sleep, I had the villany of the three pirate sailors so lively 
related to me by the first Spaniard and Fxi^j's father, that it wa«

told me how they bftrbarouslv attempted to murder 
all the SpanlardB, and that thej set fire to the proviaioas they had laid 
ap, on purpose to distreee and staxYe them ; things that I had never 
Leard of, and that indeed vere never all of them true in &ct ; but it 
waa ic vrarm in my imagination, and so realized to me, that, to the 
hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it was, or wcula 
be true : also how I recocted H, when the Spaniards complained to me 
and how I brought thorn o joetice, tried them before me, and ordered 
them all three to be hangf d. What there wac really in this shall be 
seen in ite place: for however I came^to form such things in my 
dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there waa, 
I say, much ef it true. I own that this dream had nothing in it liter 
ally and specifically true , but tbe general part was so true, the base 
vilianouB behavior of these three hardened rogues was such, and had 
been so much worse than all I can describe, that the dream had too 
much similitude of the fact ; and as I would afterward have punished 
them severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I had been much in the 
right, and even should have been justified by the laws both of Oo<i 
and man. But to return to my story. In this kind of temper I lived 
some years ; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no 
agreeable diversion, but what had something or other of this in it , so 
iliat my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very se 
riously one night, that she believed there was some secret powerful im- 
pulse of Providence upon me, which had determined me to go thither 
Again ; and that she found nothing hindered my going, but my being 
engaged to a wife and children. She told me, that it was true she 
could not think of parting with me ; but as she was adsured, that if 
she was dead it would be the first thing I would do, so, as it seemed 
(o her that the thing was determined above, she would not be the 

only obstruction; for, if I thought fit, and resolved to go EJerc 

she found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked verj 
earnestly at her, so that it a Httle disordered her, and she stopped, i 
asked her why she did not go on, and say out what she was going to 
say. But I perceived that her heart was too full, and some tears 
stood in her eyes. " Speak out, my dear," said I ; " are you willing i 
should go ?" " No," says she, very afiectionately, " I am far front 
willing ; but if yon are resolved to go," says she, '♦ and rather than I 
would be the only hinderancc, I will go with you : for though I think 
U a most preposterous thing for one of your years, and in your eon 
£tion, yet if it must be," said she, again weeping,'' 1 would not leav« 
fpu f for If it be of Heaveo, jon must do it ; there is no resistio|; it 



Mi ADYXNTUBBiS ^ 

»nd if Heayaa make it your duty to go, lie will aIsu make H mine tt 
go witk yon, or otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct il" 

This affectionate behavior of my wife's brought me a little out of 
ttte vapors, and I began to consider what I was doing ; I corrected 
nay wandering fancy, and I began to argue with myself sedately, what 
businefls I had, after three-score years, and after such a life of tedious 
toflerings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner — -I 
say, what business had I to rush into new hazards, and put :nys€lf 
upon adventures fit only for youth and poverty to run i\.to t 

With these thoughts I considered my new engagements ; that I had 
a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child of another, 
that I had ell the world could give me, and had no need to seek hazard 
for gaia ; that I was declining in years, and ought to think rather of 
leaving what I had gained, than of seeking to increase it ; that as 
to what my wife had said of its being an impulse of Heaven, and that 
it should be my duty to go, I had no notion of that ; so, after many 
of these cogitations, I struggled with the power of my imagination, 
.reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people may always do in like 
oases if they wiil ; and in a word, I conquered it ; composed myself 
with such arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pres« 
ent oondition furnished me plentifully with ; and particularly, as the 
most effectual method, I resolved to divert myself with other things, 
and to engage in some business that might effectually tie me up from 
any more excursions of this kind ; for I found that thing return upo» 
me chiefly when I was idle, and had nothing to do, nor anything of 
moment immediately before me. To this purpose I bought a littie 
Gu*m in the county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. 
I bad a little convenient house upon it ; and the land about it, I fouad 
irae capable of groat improvement ; and it was many ways suited ta 
A/ iu c] ination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, 
!-atd impro\mg of land; and particularly being an inland county, I 
jTiie removed from conversing among sailors, and things relating ie 
remote parts of the world. 

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought m« 
ploughs, harrows, a cart, wagon, horses, cows, and sheep, and setting 
•eriously to work, became in one half year, a mere country gentle- 
man ; my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my Bervant% 
cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, &o. ; and I lived, as t 
thought, the most agreeable life that nature was capable of direotiog^ 
or that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of retreating te 

I ftirmed tipon s^ own land; J had bo rent to pay, was limited bj

WAC for myself, and what I improyed was for mj fiuuily ; and hariag 
thus lefi off the thoughts of wandering, X bad not the least diacom- 
fort in any part of life as to this world. N^ow I thought, indeed, thai 
I Mjoyed the middle state of life which m f father so earnestly re6ota> 
DBcnded lo me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, something like wha£ 
IT i«seribed by the poet, upon the sabjeot of a country life — 

" — — -Tre* from t1o«s, fr«e from e«jr«, 
A^ hMB no paia, and yonth no anar*." 

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen Provi- 
i»uo9 unhinged me at once ; and not only made a breach upon ba« 
Inevitab^ and incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, inta a 
daep relapse mi the wandering disposition, which, as I may say, beiijg 
bom in my ver^ blood, soon recovered its hold of me, and, like t^* 
returnc of a violent distemper, came on with an irresistible force upon 
me. This blow was the loss of my wife. It is not my business haz* 
to write an elegy upon my wife, give a charao«er of her particsdar 
virtues, and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a fon-aral 
•ermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of all my affairs, the oe» 
tro of all my enterprises, the engine that, by her prudence, reduced 
woe to that happy compass I was in, from the most extravagant and 
rainous project that fluttered in my head, as above, and did more to 
guide my rambling genius than a mother's tears, a father's instruo- 
tions, a friend's counsel, or my own reasoning powers, could do. I 
was happy in listening to her tears, and in being mo-v^ed by her ea 
treaties; and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the irorli 
by the loss of her. 

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly rooad me. i 
VM as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, aa I was in the Brazik^ 
when I first went on shore there ; and as much alone, except as to iha 
asBistanoe of servants, as I was in my island. I knew neither what 
to think nor what to do. I saw the world busy around me ,- one part 
bboring for bread, another squandering in vile exceisses or empty 
ideasares, equally miserable, because the end they proposed still flMi 
from them ; for the men of pleasure every day surfeited of their vio«, 
and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance ; and the men of 
UW>r spent their strength in daily struggling for bread to maintain 
the vital strength they labored with ; so living in a daily oirculati«ii 
an sor.ow, living but to work, and working but to live, as if daily bxM^

ThU put me in mind of tho life I lived Lq my kfaigdoiu, ttn* i^anfl , 
where 1 suffered no more corn to grow because I did uoi waut it. and 
bred no more goate, because I had no more use for them ; where the 
money lay in the drawer till "it grew mouldy, and had scarce the favor 
to be looked upon in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have don^, and 
M reason and religion had dictated to me, would have taught me to

ttiere wa« something which certainly was the reason aud end of life 
foperior to all these things, and which was eituer to be possessed, or 
ftt least hoped for, on this side the grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone ; I was like a ship without a pilot, 
that could only run afore the wind : my thougnts ran all away again 
into the old affair; my head was quite tumea with the whimsies of 
foreign adventures ; and all the pleasant innocent amusements of my 
farm, my garden, my cattle, and my family, which before entirely 
possessed me, were nothing to me, bad no relish, and wero like musiff 
to one that baa no ear, or food to one that nas no taste ; in a word, I 
TMolved to leave off housekeeping, let wy farm, and reto;'-i to Lon 
don ; and in a few months after I did oo. 

When I came to London, I was etiU an! uneasy as I w i%» before ; 1 
had no relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to 
saunter about like an idle peteou, of whom it may be tcid he is per. 
fectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one fartL'ng's matter to 
the re«t of its kind whether he be dead or alive. Th^ also was the 
thing which, of all other circumstances of life, was tho most my aver 
eion, who had been all my days used to an active L.e; and I would 
often say to myself: a state of idleness is the very diegs of life; aud 
indeed, I thought I was much more suitably empkyed when I wae 
twenty-six days making me a deal-board. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when ni/ nephew, whom, 
as I have observed before, I had brought up to the ftea,and had made 
bim commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to 
Bilboa, being the first he bad made. He came tu me, and told me 
that some merchants, of his acquaintance, had been proposing to him 
to go a voyage for them to the East Indies and to China, <is private 
traders. '• And now, uncle," says he, " if you will go to sea ,nth me, 
I will engaj:e to land you upon jour old habitation in the island ; for 
we are to touch at the Brazils." 

Nothinjt can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of

eauMS with the ideas of things which we form in our Bii&dB, per£eoiI/ 
leserred, and not communicated to any in the world. 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering wai 
returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thoughts 
to say, when the very morning before he came to me, I had, in a great 
deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circum- 
stances in my mind, come to this resolution, viz., that I would go V> 
Lisbon, and consult with my old sea-captain; and so, if it waa rational 
and practicable, I would go and see the island again, and Bee what 
was become of my people there. I had pleased myself with the 
thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from henoe, 
getting a patent for the possession, and I knew not what ; when in the 
middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have eaid with his pro- 
ject of carrying me thither in his way to the East Indies. 

I paused awhile at his words, and, looking steadily at him, " What 
devil," said I, " sent you on this unlucky errand V My nephew starec^ 
as if he had been frightened, at first ; but perceiving that I was not so 
much displeased with the proposal, he recovered himself. " I hope 
it may not bean unlucky proposal, sir," says he; "I dare say you 
would be pleased to see your new colony there, where you onc« 
reigned with more felicity than most of your brother monarohs in th« 
world" 

In a word, the scheme hit bo exactly with my temper, that is to 
say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have said so much, 
that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with the merchants, 1 
would go with him; but I told him I would not promise to go any 
further than my own island. " Why, sir," eays he, " you don't want 
to be left there again, I hope." '♦ Why," said I, " can you not take 
me up on your return ?" He told me it would not be possible to do 
GO , that the merchants would never allow him to come that way with 
a laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of his way, and 
might be three or four. Besides, sir, if I should miscarry," said fae, 
" and not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the con- 
dition you were iu before." 

This was very rational, but we both found out a remedy for it^ 
which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which being 
taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship, might, by the help of 
some carpenters whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up again in 
the island, and finished, fit to go to sea, in a few days. 

I was sot long resolving, for indeed the importunities of my neph«w» 
joined so efieetaally with ou uaeUnoaon that aethiaic Mold oupon

toe ; on tide otber Aaiid, i»y wife being dead, I had nobodj ooncermtj^ 

thenxselyes 8o much for me as to persuade me to one way or the other, 
except my ancient good friend tlie widow, who earnestly struggled 
with me to consider my years, my easy circumstances, and the need- 
leas hazards of a long voyage— and, above all, my young children. 
But it was all to no purpose j I had an irresistible desire to the voy- 
age, and I told her I thought there was something so uncommon iu 
the impression I had upon my mind for the voyage, that it would be 
a kind of resisting Providence if I should attempt to stay at home ; 
after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not 
only in making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my 
family aftairs for my absence, and providing for the education of my 
children. 

In order to this I made my will, and settled the estate I had in 
such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands that I was 
perfectly easy, and satisfied they would have justice done them, M'hat- 
ever might befall me ; and for their education, I left it wholly to the 
widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care* all which 
she richly deserved, for no mother could have taken more care in 
their education, or understood it better ; and as she lived till I cam» 
home, I also lived to thank her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January, 
1694-'5, and I, with my man Friday, went on board in the Downs the 
8th ; having, besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very con- 
siderable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony ; which, 
if I did not find it in good condition, I resolved to leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I proposed to place 
there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there, upon my own 
account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there or carry them 
forward, as they would appear willing ; particularly, I carried two 
carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a 
cooper by trade, and was also a genaral mechanic, for he was dexter- 
ous at making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn — was a good turn- 
er and a good pot-maker ; he also made anything that was proper 
to make of earth, or of wood ; in a word, we called him our Jack-of- 
all-trades. With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himself to 
go a passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, but afterward 
consented to stay on our new plantation, and proved a most necessary 
handy fellow as could be desired, in many other businesses besides 
that of bis trade ; for, m T obseryed formerly, necessity arms us for 
ftU •roploymeutfc 



SOBINSON CRU80B. f 6A 

My cargo, m mar a« X oui reoolleet, for I had not kept account oi 
tke particulars, conjsisted of a sufficient quantity of liuon, and some 
JCnglish thin stuffa, for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find 
there, and enough of them, as^. by my calculation, jrdght comfortably 
supply them for seven years. If I remember right;, the materials I 
earried for clothing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all 
such things as they could want for wearing, amounted to about t\ro 
hundred pounds— including some beds, bedding, and household stuff, 
particularly kitchen utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c., 
and near a hundred pounds more in iron-work, nails^ tools of ev3ry 
kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could 
think of 

I carried, also, a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees, besides 
some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot, of all sizes, three or four 
tons of lead, and two pieces of brass cannon ; and, because I knew not 
■what time and what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hun- 
dred ban-els of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part 
of some pikes and halberds, so that, in short, we had a large maga- 
'zine of all sorts of stores; and I made my nephew carry two small 
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave behind 
if thero was occasion, that when we came there we might build a 
fort, and man it against all sorts of enemies ; and, indeed, I at first 
thought there would be need enough for all, and much more, if we 
hoped to maintain our possession of the island, as shall be seen in the 
course of this story. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet 
K-ith, and, therefore, shall have the less occasion to interrupt the 
reader, who, perhaps, may be impatient to hear how matters went 
with my colony ; yet some old accidents, cross winds, and bad 
weather, happened on this first setting out, which made the voyage 
longer than I expected at first ; and I, who had never made but on«» 
voyage, viz., my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to 
come back again, as the voyage was at first designed, began to think 
the same ill fate attended me, and that I was born to be never 
contented with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at 
sea. 

Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were obliged 
to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound two-and- 
twenty days • but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that pro- 
visions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty ; so that 
Tfhile we lay here we never touched the ship's stores, but rather

>^ E set out on the 5th of February from Iseland, end had a 
5) very fair gale of wind for some dnys. As I remember; it 
might be about the 20th of February, in the eTenin^- late, 
when the mate, having the watch, came into the round- 
bouse, and told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired ; and 
while he was telling us of it, a boy came in and told us the boatswain 
heard another. This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, 
where, for a while, we heard nothing, but iu a few minutes we saw a 
Tery great light, and found that there was some very terrible fire at a 
distance. Immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which 
we all agreed that there could be no land that way in which the fire 
showed itself, no, not foi five hundred leagues, for it appeared at W. 
N. W. Upon this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea ; 
and as, by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded it 
could not be far oflF, we stood directly toward it, and were presently 
ifttisfied we should discover it, because, the farther we sailed, the 
greater the light appeared, though, the weather being hasy, we couxd 
not perceive anything but the light for ft while. In about half an 
boards sailing, the wind being fair for us, though not much of it, and 
the weather clearing up a little, we could plainly cU««eni that it was 
a great ehip on fire, in the middle of the sen. 

I was mo8t sensibly touched with this disaster, though not ftt all 
Acquainted with the persons engaged in it ; I presently reoolleeted my 
former circumstances, and in what condition I was in, when taken up 
hj the Portuguese captain ; and how much more deplorable the circum- 
ikanoes of the poor creatures belonging to that ship must be. if they 
liad no other ship in company with them. Upon this, I immediately 
ordered that five guns should be fired, one soon after another, that, if 
poMible, we might give notice to them that there was help for them 
at hand, and that they might endeavor to save themselves in their 
boat-, for though w.-; oQuId IM th» fiftmes of *"he sh»j), vet they, it

We lay Vv for some time upon this, only driving as the btirning ship 
drove, waiting for daylight ; when, on a sudden, to our great terror, 
though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air ; and 
immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all the fire was out, that 
is to say, the rest of the ship sunk. This was terrible, and indeed an 
afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men ; who, 1 concluded, must 
•be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost distress in their 
<^boat, in the middle of the ocean ; which, at present, by reason it was 
''dark, I could not see. However, to direct them as well as I could, I 
caused lights to be hung out in all parts of the ship where we could, 
and which we had lanterns for, and kept firing guns all the night 
long ) letting them know, by this, that there was a ehip not far off. 

At about eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's 
boats by aid of our perspective glasses ; found there were two of them, 
both thronged with people, and deep in the water. We perceived 
they rowed, the wind being against them ; that they saw our ehip, and 
did their utmost to let us see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know v e saw them, 
and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on board ; and 
then made more Bail, standing directly to them. In little more than 
half an hour we came up with them; and, in a word, took them all 
in, being no les* than sixty-four men, women, and children ; for there 
were a great many passengers. 

Upon the whole, we found it was a Htench merchant ship of three 
hundred tons, home-bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The 
master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship ; how the fire 
began in the steerage, by the negligence of the steersman ; but ou 
his crying out for help, was, as everybody thought, entirely put out; 
but they soon found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten into 
some part of the ship eo difficult to come at, that they could not 
effectually quench it ; and afterward getting in between the timbers, 
and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and 
mastered all the skill and all the application they were able to 
exert. 

They had no more to do then, but to get into their boats, which, ta 
their great comfort, were pretty large ; being their long-boat, and 
their great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no great ser- 
vice to them, other than to get some fresh water and provisions into 
her, after they had secured their lives from the fire. They had, in- 
deed, small hope of their lives by getting into these boats, at that 
^fetaso« from aa;^ land ; onlf , as they said well, that they were e»-

oaped from the fire, and a possibility that some ship might happen to 
bo at sea, aud might take them in. They had sails, oars, and a com- 
pass ; and were preparing to make the best of their way back to 
Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty fair, for it blew an easy gale 
at S. E. by E. They had as much pxovisioa and water, as, with 
sparing it, so as to be next door to starving, might support them about 
twelve days ; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary 
winds, the captain said he hoped he might got to the Banks of New- 
foundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they 
might go on shore. But there were so many chances against them in 
all these cases, such aa storms, to overset and founder them ; rains 
and cold, to benumb and perish their limbs ; contrary winds, to keep 
them out aud starve them ; that it must have been next to miraculous 
if they had escaped. 

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and 
ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they 
were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and 
after that four more ; these were the five guns which I caused to be 
fired at first seeing the light. Tliis revived their hearts, and gave them 
the notice, which, as above, I desired it should, viz., that there was a 
ship at hand for their help. It was upon the hearing of these guns 
that they took down their masts and sails ; the sound coming from the 
windward, they resolved to lie by till morning. Some time after this, 
hearing no more guns, they fir«d three muskets, one a considerable 
while after another ; but these, the wind being contrary, we never 
heard. 

Some time after that again, they were still more agreeably sur- 
prised with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns which, as I have 
said, I caused to be fired all the rest of the night ; this set them t<y 
work with their oars, to keep their boats ahead, at least, that we 
might the sooner come up with them ; and, at last, to their inexpres-l 
Bible joy, they found we saw them. 

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange 
ecatacies, the variety of postures, which these poor delivered peoplo 
ran into, to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliver- 
ance. Grief aud fear are easily described ; sighs, tears, groans, and 
very few motions of the head and hands, make up the sum of its 
variety; but an excess of joy, a surprise of j«,, hai a thousand ttx- 
travaganoes in it ; there were some in tears ; some raging and tearing 
thomsolves, as if they had beec in the greatest agonies of sorrow ; eome 
stark raving, and downright lunatic ; some ran about the ship stamping

with their teet, otners wringiug their hands ; some were dancing, sqju© 
ringing, some hxughing, moro crjing ; many quite dumb, not ablo to 
spoak a word : others sick and vomiting ; several swooning, and 
ready to famt; and a few were crossing themselves, and giving God 
tlumks. 

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that were 
thankful afterward, but the passion was too strong for them at first 
and they were not able to master it ; they were thrown into ecstacies, 
and a kind of frenzy ; and it was but a very few that were composed 
and serious in their joy. 

Perhaps, also, the case may have some addition to it from the par- 
ticular circumstance of that nation they belonged to ; I mean th« 
French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile^ more passionate, 
and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than in other nations 
I am not philosopher enough to determine the cause ; but nothing 1 
had ever seen before came up to it. The ecstacies poor Friday, my 
trusty savage, was in, when he found his father in the boat, came the 
the nearest to it, and the surprise of the master and his two compan- 
ions, whom I delivered from the villains that set them on shore in 
the island, came a little way toward it; but nothing was to compare 
to this, either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else in my life. 

It is further observable, that these extravagances did not show 
themselves, in that different manner I have mentioned, in different 
persons only ; but all the variety would appeal", in a short succession 
of moments, in one and the game person. A man that we saw this 
I minute dumb, and as it were stupid and confounded, would the next 
^minute be dancing and hallooing like an antic; and the next moment 
be tearing his hair or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them 
under hid feet like a madman : in a few moments after that, we 
would have him all in tears, then sick, swooning, and, had not imme- 
diate help been had, he would in a few moments have been dead ; and 
thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the 
greatest part of them ; and if I remember right, our surgeon was ob- 
liged to let blood of about thirty of them. 

There were two priests among them, one an old man, and the other 
a young man ; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was 
the worst. As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw 
iimself safe, he dropped down stone dead, to all appearance ; not the 
least sign of life could be perceived in him : our surgeon immediately 
applied proper remedies to recover him, and was the only man in the 
ihip that believed he was not dead. At length he opened a vein in 



27'0 AJDVtXfTUSm Of 

i.ld arm, having first chafed and ruVbed ih« part, bo m to warn it &a 
much as possible : upon this blood, -which only dropped at first, 
flowing freely, in thr«e minuteB after the man opened his eyes; and a 
quarter of an hour after that h« spoke, grevr better, and in a little 
time quite well. After the blood was stopped, he walked about ; told 
us he was perfectly well ; took a dram of cordial which the siirgcoa 
gave h m, and was what we called come to himself. About a quarter 
of an hour after this, they came running iuto the cabin to the surgeon? 
who was bleeding a Frenchwoman that had fainted, and told him the 
priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the 
change of his circumstances in his mind, and again this put him into 
an ecstacy of joy ; his spirits whirled about faster than the vessels 
could convey them, the blood grew hot and feverish, and the man wasi 
as fit for Bedlam as any creature thai ever was in it : the sur- 
geon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him 
something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after some time, 
operated upon him, and he awoke next morning perfectly composed 
and well. 

The younger priest behave<J with great command of his passions 
and was really an example of a serious, well-governed mind : at his 
first coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, 
prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I un- 
happily and unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been 
in a swoon, but he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me was giving God 
thanks for his deliverance ; begged me to leave him a few moments, 
and that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left him, but 
kept others from interrupting him also. He continued in that posture 
about three minutes, or little more, after I left him ; then came to me, 
as he had said he would, and with a great deal of seriousness and 
affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me, that had, under Qod, 
given him, and so many miserable creatures, their lives. I told him I 
had no room to move him to thank God for it, rather than me, for I 
bad seen that he had done that already ; but, I added, that it wa« 
nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men; and that 
we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had blewwd 
QS 60 far, as to make us the instrument* of his mercy to so many of 
his creatures. 

After this, the young priest applied himself to his countryfolks; 
*abored to compose them : persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with 
th«si. and did hia utmost to keep them vrithio t)w ezereiee of tbeif

te<a6oo } and with some be had aoccees, though others were tor a tim«i 

out of all governmeat of themselves. 

I eannot help committiug this to writing, as perhaps it may beuse< 
fill to those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding themselves 
ia all the extravagances of their passions ; for if an excess of joy caa 
earry men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what 
will not the e:itravagance3 of anger, rage, and a provoked mind, carry 
Ufl to ? And, indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding 
trateh orer our passions of every kind, as well those of joy and 
satiafactiou as those of sorrow and anger. 

We were something disordered, by these extravagances among our 
sew guests, for the first day ; but when they had been retired, lodg- 
ings provided for them, as well as our ship would allow, and they had 
slept heartily — as most of them did, being fatigued and frightened— 
thay were quite another sort of people the nest day. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the kind- 
adss fihowtt them, was wanting ; the French, it is known, are naturally 
apt enought to exceed that way. The captain and one of the priests, 
came to me the next day, and desired to speak with me and my 
aephew : the commander began to consult with us what should be 
done with them ; aud first, they told us that we had Saved their lives, 
BO all they had was httle enough for a return to us for that kindness 
received. The captain said they had saved some money, and some 
things of value, in their boats, catched hastily out of the flames, and 
if we would accept it, they were ordered to make an offer of it all to 
us : they only desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, 
if possible, they might get a passage to France. My nephew was for 
accepting their money at first word, and to consider what to do with 
them afterward; but I overruled him in that part, for I knew what 
it was to be set on shore in a strange country ; and if the PortugueM 
captain that took me up at sea had served me so, and took all I had 
for my deliverance, I must have starved, or have been as much a slave 
at the Bvazilfl as I had been at Barbary, the mere being sold to a 
Mohammedan excepted ; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much bet- 
termaster than a Turk, if not, in some cases, much worse. 

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up io 
their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as we were 
foUow-creatures ; and we would c'esire to be so delivered, if we were 
in the like, or aay other extremity ; that we had done nothing for 
theai but whs* we bftUevgd they trould bav» doa* for us^ if we had 
\^» ia ^ir <i^^ mi tbsy m Qxmj, but th?^t w? to©k thew up to 



BftTe tli0iu, uot CO piouder them; aad it would be a moBt barbar^Mxi 
tUug to take that little from them which they had saved out of the 
fire, and then set them on shore and leave them ; that this would b» 
first to save them from death, and then kill them ourselves ; save them 
from drowning, and abandon them to starving ; and therefore I would 
not let the least thing be taken from them. As to setting them on 
ihore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding difBculty to us, for 
'liiat the ship was bound to the East Indies ; and though we were 
driven out of our course to the westward a very great way, and per- 
haps were directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet 
it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on their par. 
ticular account; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it to the 
freighters, with whom he was under charter-party to pursue his 
voyage by the way of Brazil : and all I knew we could do for them, 
was to put ourselves in the way of meeting with other ships home- 
ward bound from the West Indies, aiid get them a pasiage, if possible 
to England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they could, 
not but be very thankful for it ; but they were in a very great con 
Bternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried 
away to the East Indies : they then entreated me, that seeing I wai 
driven so far to the westward before I met with them, I would at leaa* 
keep on the same course to the banks of Newfoundland, where it was 
probable I might meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire 
to carry them back to Canada, whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and tkere^ 
fore I inclined to agree to it ; for, indeed, I considered, that to cartj 
this whole company to the East Indies, would not only be an intolera- 
ble severity upon the poor people, but would be ruining our whole 
voyage, by devouring all our provisions ; so I thought it no breach of 
oharter-paity, but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely neces- 
sary to us, and in which no one could say we were to blame ; for the 
laws of God and nature would have forbid that we would refuse to 
take up two boats' full of people in such a distressed condition; and 
the nature of the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor peo- 
ple, obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or other for their de-

)HE wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty 
good ; and as the wind had continued in the points between 
N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed several opportunities 
of sending them to France ; for we met several ships boimd 
fio Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's; but 
they had been so long beating up against the wind, they durst take in 
no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage, as well 
for themselves as for those they should take in ; so we were obliged 
to go on. It was about a week after this that we made the Banks of 
Newfoundland; where, to shorten my story, we put all our French 
people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on 
shore, and afterward to carry them to France, if they could get pro- 
visions to victual themselves with. When I say all the French weufc 
on shore, I should remember, that the young priest I spoke of, hear- 
ing we were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage vrith 
us, and to be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel ; which I read- 
ily agreed to, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good 
TcasorL, as will appear afterward ; also four of the seamen entered 
themselves on our ship, and proved very useful fellows. 

From hence we directed our course to the West Indies, steering 
Away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes little 
or no wind at all ; when we met with another subject for our human- 
ity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before. 

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees five minutes north, 
on the 19th day of March, 1694-'5, when we spied a sail, our course 
S. E. and by S. ; we soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that sha 
bore up to us, but could not at first know what to make of her, till, 
after coming a little nearer, wo found she had lost her main topmast, 
foremast, and bowsprit ; and presently she fired a gun, as a signal of 
distress ; the weather was pretty good, wind at N. N. W., a fresh gale, 
and we soon came to speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but, 
had been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was 
ready to sail, by atei*rible hurricane, while the captain and chief mat« 
were both gone on shore ; so that besides the terror of the storm, they 
were in an indiffsr^Bt oaae for good artists to bring the ship home.

terrible rterm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them 
quite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost 
their masts, as above. They told ub they expected to have eeenthe 
Bahama islauda, but were then driven away again to the southeast, by 
a strong gale of wind at N. N. W., the same that blew now ; and har- 
fug no sails to work the ship with but a maincourse, and a kind 
of square sail upon a jury foremast, which they had set up, they 
could not lie near the wind, but were endeavoring to stand away foi 
the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost starved 
for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had undergone ; their 
bread and flesh were quite gone ; they had not one ounce left in the 
ehip, and had none for eleven days. The only relief they had was 
their water was not all spent, and they had about half a barrel of 
flour left : they had sugar enough ; some succades or sweetmeats, 
they had at first, but they were devoured ; and they had seven casks 
•f rum. 

There were a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant on board. 
who were going passengers, and thinking the ship was ready to sailj 
unhappily came on board the evening before the hurricane began ) 
and having no provisions of their own left, they were in a more dfl 
plorable condition than the rest ; for the seamen being reduced to such 
ftD extreme necessity themselves, had no compassion, we may be sure, 
for the poor passengers ; and they were, indeed, in a condition, that 
their misery is very hard to describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led m« 
{the weather being fair, and the wind abated) to go on board the ship. 
The second mate, who, upon this occasion, commanded the ship, had 
been on board our ship, and he told me, indeed, they had three pas. 
■engera in the great cabin, that were in a deplorable condition. "?f ay ," 
says he, " I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothmg of them for 
above two days ; and I was afraid to inquire after them," said he, 
* for I had nothing to relieve them with." 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we oould 
•pare ; and, indeed, I had so far overruled things with ray nephew, 
that I would have victualled them, though we had gone away to Vir- 
ginia, or any other part of the coast of America to have supplied 
•arselres ; but there was no necessity for that. 

But now they were in a new danger ; for they were afraid of eating 
too much, even of that little we gave them. The maote ox commandet 
^ueht 9VI xa^n witli him in hift bockt; bvbt c6««9 vtm wt^t^i^^a Iwk

fed like ekoletons, and were eo weak, that they eould hardly sit to their 
oars. The mate himself was very ill, and half starved ; tor he de' 
olared he had reserved nothing from the men, and went share aiid 
»haa-e alike with them in every bit they ate. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him Immedi- 
diately ; aud ho had not eaten three mouthiula before he began to b« 
sick, and out of order; %o he stopped awhile, and our surgeon mixed; 
hint up something with some broth, which he said would be to hina^ 
both food and physic ; and after he bad taken it he grew better, la 
the meantime, I forgot not the men ; I ordered victuals to be givea 
them; and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it; they wer« 
80 exceedingly hungry, that they were in a kind ravenous, and had no 
eommand of themselvea ; and two of them ate with so much greedi- 
ness, that they were in danger of their lives the next morning, 

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me, &nd[ 
brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming 
")n shore in my island, where I had never the least mouthful of food, 
jr any prospect of procuring any ; besides the hourly apprehensions 
I had of being made the food of other creatures. But all the whila 
the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ship'd 
company, I could not put out of my thought the story he had told ma 
of the three poor creatures in the great cabb, viz., the mother, her 
son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or 
three days, and whom he seemed to confess, they had wholly neglect- 
ed, their own extremities being so great ; by which I understood that 
they had really given them no food at all, and that therefore they 
must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck 
of the cabin. 

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called caption, ov 
board with his men, to refresh them, bo I also forgot not the etarvinif 
crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat to go or- 
board the ship, and with my mate and twelve men, to carry them tk 
sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to boil. Our eurgeoi^ 
eharged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed, 
and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men taking it to 
eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was well boiled, and then 
to give every man but a very little at a time ; and by this caution h» 
preserved the men, who would otherwise have killed themselves with 
that very food that was given them on purpose to save their lives. 

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great oabil^ 
af&d see ^hat condition the poor paaaea^ere wer« la, aud if tbejr w«r%

alivo^ to comfort them and give them what refreshment waj proptije; 
and the Bui'geon gave him a large pitcher, with some of the prepared 
broth which he had given the mate that was ou board, and which he 
did not question would restore them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above, having. a great 
mind to see tho scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would 
present me with, in a more lively manner than I could have it by re- 
port, I took tho captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me, 
and went myself, a little after, in their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the victual* 
©ut of the boiler before it was ready ; but my mate observed his or- 
ders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room door ; and the man he 
placed th«ro, after using all possible persuasion to have patience, kepfc 
them ofif by force. However, he caused some biscuit cakes to be dip 
pod in the pot, and softened with the liquor of the meat, which they 
called brewis, and gave them every one some to stay their stomachs, 
and told them it was for their own safety that he was obliged to give 
them but a little at a time. But it was all in vain ; and had I not 
oomo on board, and their own commander and officers with me, and 
with good words, and some threats, also, of giving them no more, I 
believe they wo'iid have broken into the cook-room by force, and 
torn the meat rut of the furnace ; for words are, indeed, of very small 
ft)rco to a lu'.ngry belly. However wo pacified them, and fed them 
gradually <ind cautiously for the first, and the next time gave them 
more, and at last wo filled their bellies, and the men did well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another 
nature, and far beyond the rest; for, as the ship's company had so 
little for themselves, it was but too true that they had at first kept 
them very low, and at last totally neglected them ; so that for six or 
Beven days it might be said they had really no food at all, and for 
eereral days before, very little. The poor mother, who, as the men 
reported, was a woman of sense and good breeding, had spared all 
she could 80 affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sunk 
»ndcr it ; and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the 
floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two chairs^ 
which were lashed fast, and her head sunk between her shoulders, 
like a corpse, though not quite dead My mate said all he could to 
reviro and encouratie her, and with a spoon put some broth into her 
month. She opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, tut could not 
^eak, yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him, inti- 
m»tiug that it woa too late for her^ but pointed to her child, slb if sh^ 



Would have said they should take oare of him, How«T©r, the ruat^ 
who was exceedlno;ly moved with the sight, eudeavor»d to get some 
of the broth into her mouth, and, as he said, got two or thr»e spoon- 
fuls down, though I question whether he could be sure of it or not; 
but it was too late, and she died the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most aflfectionato 
mother's life, was not so far gone, yet he lay in a cabin-bed, as one 
■tretched out, with hardly any life left in him. lie had a piece of aa 
old glove in his mouth, having eaten up all the rest of it; however, 
being j'oung, and having more strength than his mother, the mate got 
something down his throat, and he began sensibly to revive ; though, 
by giving him, some time after, but two or three spoonfuls extraordi' 
nary, he was very sick, and brought it up again. 

But the next care was the poor maid ; she lay all along upon tha 
deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down 
with an apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her Iknba were distorted ; 
one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, and she 
griped it so hard that we could not easily make her let it go ; her 
other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together, set. fast 
against the frame of the cabin table; in short, she lay just like one 
in the agonies of death, and yet she was alive, too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and terrified 
with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us afterward, was 
broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying for two or three 
days before, and whom she loved most tenderly. 

We knew not what to do with this poor giil, for when our surgeon, 
who was a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, with 
great application, recovered her as to life, he had her ujion his hands 
as to her senses, for she was little less than distracted for a consider- 
able time after, as shall appear presently. 

Whoever shall read these m.emoraudums, must be desdred to con- 
sider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, where 
Bometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place ; our business 
■was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for them, and 
though they were willing to steer the same course with us for some 
days, yet we could carry no sail, to keep pace with the ship that had 
no masts ; however, as their captain begged of us to help him to set 
up a maiutopmast, and a kind of topmast to his jury foremast, we did, 
aa it were, lie by him for three or four days, and then, having given 
hiin five barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, 
tuad a proportion of peas, flouTj and what other things we could 6pap«i

and taking three casks ©f sugar, some ram, and fott* ^Imm ef elg'ht 
from them, for satiafaction, we left them ; taking on board with ua, 
at their own earnest request, the jouth and the maid, and all their 
goods. 

The young lad was aliout seventeen years of age; a pretty, well 
bred, modest and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the .'osb of his 
mother, and, aa it seems, had lost his father but a few months before, 
at Barbadoes ; he begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him 
out cf the bhip, for he said the cruel fellows had murdered his mother. 
And, indeed, so they had ; that is to say, passively, for they might 
tiave spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless widow, that 
might Iv.ive preserved her life, though it had been but just enough to 
keey her alive. But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice. 
no right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no compassion. 

The surgt n told him how far we were going, and that it would 
carry him a.^ay from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as bad 
circumstances almost as those we found him in — that is to say, starv- 
ing in the world. He said it mattered not whither he went, if he was 
delivered from the terrible crew that he was among ; that the captaiu 
(l)y wliich he meant me, for he could know nothing of my nephew) 
had saved his life, and he was sure, would not hurt him; and as for 
the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be very thank- 
ful for it, let us carry thom where we would. The surgeon repre- 
sented the case so affectionately to me that I yielded, and we took 
them both on board, with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of 
Bugar, which could not be removed or come at; and, as the j'outh had 
a bill of lading for theni, I made his commander sign a writing, obli. 
ging himself to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogera, 
a roprchant there, to whom the youth said he was related, and to de* 
liver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the goods he had belong- 
ing to the deceased widow ; which, I suppose, was not done, for I 
could never learn that the ship came to Bristol, but was, as it is most 
probable, lost at sea ; being in so disabled a condition, and so far 
from any laud, that I am of opinion the first storm she met with after- 
ward she might founder in the sea : for she was leaky, and had dam- 
age ia her hold, when we met with her. 

I was now in the latitude of nineteen degrees thirty-two minutes, 
and luul liitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, thnagh, at first, 
the winds had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little 
incidents of wind, weather, currents, &c., on the rest of our voyage; 
but ta shortcu my etoix ^^^ the &ukc oi what is to follow^ shall ol^ 



ROBINSON CSUSOB. S79 

eerve, thai I came to mj old habitation, the island, on tho 10th of 
April, 1695. It was with no email difficulty that I found the place; 
for as I came to it, and went from it, before, on the south and east 
side of tho island, as coming from the Brazils, so now, comiug in be- 
tween the main and the island, and having no chart for the coast, nor 
any landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, or know whether I 
«aw it or not 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands 
in the mouth of the great river Oronooko, but none for my purpose ; 
only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one 
great mistake before, viz. : that the continent which I thought 1 sJvW 
from ttle island I lived in, was really not continent, but a long island, 
or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side of the 
extended mouth of that great river ; and that the savages who came 
to my island were not properly those which we call Caribbees. but 
islandei-s, and other barbarians of the same kin^i who inhabited some' 
thing nearer to our side than the rest. 

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose ; some I 
found were inhabited, and some were not ; on one of them I found 
some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there ; but speaking 
with them, found they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by, and 
eame thither to make salt and to catch some pearl muscles, if they 
could ; but that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay 
farther north, in the latitude of ten and eleven degrees. 

Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship. 
Bometimes with the Frenchmen's shallop, which we had .ound a con 
venient boat, and therefore kept her with their very g,ood will, ai 
length I came fair on the south side of my island, jtud presently 
knew the very countenance of the place ; so I brougiit the rhip safe 
-to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where my old habitation 
was.

S SOOQ aa I aaw the place, I called for Friday, and aske4 
him if he knew where he was ; he looked ahoat a little, and 
presently clapping hifl hands, cried : " yes, O thet^, 
yes, there," pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing 
and capering like a ntad fellow ; and I had much ado to keep hin 
from jumping into the sea, to swim ashore to the place. 

** WeU, Friday," says I, *• do you think we shall find anybody here 
or no ? and do you think we shall see your father ?" The fellow 
stood mute as a stock a good while, but when I named his father, the 
poor affectionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears 
run down his face very plentifully. " What is the matter, Friday P' 
■ays I ; ** are you troubled because you may see your fsither T" " No, 
no," says he, shakmg his head, " no see him more ; no, never more 
see him again." * Why so," said I, " Friday T how do you know 
that ?" « no, no," says Friday ; " he long ago die, long ago ; he 
much old man." " Well, well," says I, *♦ Friday, you don't know ; 
but shall we see any one else, then T" The fellow, it seems, had 
better eyes than I, and he points to the hill just above my old house ; 
and though we lay half a league off, he cries out, " We see, we see — 
jres, yes, we see much man there, and there, and there." I looked, 
but 1 saw nobody, no, not with a perspective glass, which was, I sup- 
pose, because I could not hit the p^ace ; for the fellow was right, as 
I found upon inquiry the next day and there were five or six mea 
ttiere altogether, who stood to look at the ship, not knowing what t6 
Hunk of us. 

As soon as Friday told us he saw people, I caused the Eaglisb 
mneietU to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them notice wo 
wsre friends; and in about half a quarter of an hour after, we perceived 
* smoke arise from the side of the creek ; so I immediately ordered 
the boat out, taking Friday with me ; and banging out a white fia{^ 
or a flag of truce, I went directly on shore, taking with me the young 
friar I mentioned, to whom I told the story of my living there, and

of weapons. 

At we went ashore upon ^^ £JLe flood, near high water, we rowed 
tiirestlj into the creek ; and tUe Csrert man I fixed my eye apon W6i 
Out Spaniard whose life I had i^tcvsd, and whom I knew by hii fiboe 
perfectly well; a£ to bis habit, i wholl describe it afterward, t 
ordered nobody to go on shore at ftf9» but myself: but there was no 
keeping Friday in the boat, for the affectionate creature had spied ht<i 
father at a distance, a good way off the bpuiuards, where indeed I saw 
nothing of him ; and if they had not let hiu^ f^d ashore, he would hare 
jomped into the sea. He was no sooner on «Iiore, but he flew away 
to his father, like an arrow out of a bow. A would have made any 
man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolu«](C/n, to have seen the 
first transports of this poor fellow's joy when be jame to his father ; 
how he embraced bun, kissed him, stroked his t\M, took him up in 
his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down tf bim ; and then 
■tood and looked at him, as any one would look at «. strange picture^ 
for a quarter of an hour together ; then lay down on the ground, and 
stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got up ajj;ain, and stared 
at him ; one would have thought the fellow bewitched. But it would 
nave made a dog laugh the next day to see how his passion ran oat 
another way ; in the morning he walked along the shore, to and agtun, 
with hia father several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if 
he had been a lady ; and every now and then he would come to the 
boat to fetch something or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a 
dram, a biscuit-cake, or something or other that was good. In tbo 
afternoon his frolics ran another way ; for then he would set the old 
man down upon the ground and dance about him, and make a thousaoi 
antic postures and gestures ; and all the while he did this, he wotdd 
be talking to him, and telling him one story or other of his travela, 
Kad what had happened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if 
the same filial affection was to be found in Christians to their parents 
in our part of the world, one would be tempted to say, there would 
kutUy have been any need ^f the fifth commandment. 

Bat this is a digression ; I return to my landing. It woald be 
aeedlesa to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that thi 
Spaniards received me with. The first Spaniard, who, aa I said, I knew 
very well, was he whose life I had saved ; he came toward the boa^ 
aUended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also ; and he not only 
£d not know me at first, but he had no tiiioagbtV) 90 uotioo of ilf

aV/oad, saying something in Spanish that I did not p«rfeotly bear, 
€«MDe forward and embraced me ; telling me he was inexcnaable not 
to know that face again, that he had o^ce seen ad of an angel fross 
kcaren sent to save his life ; he said abundance of very handsom* 
thiagfl, as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how ; and then beokoiv 
iQg to the perdOb tnat attended him, bade him go and call out his 
eomradee. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habitation^ 
where he would give me possession of my own house again, tend where 
I rix>uld see they had made but mean improvements ; so i walkoi 
along with him ; but, alas ! I could no more find the place again than 
if I had never been there ; for they had planted bp many trees, an4 
placed them in such a posture, so thick and close to one another, anQ 
in ten years' timei they were grown so big, tiiat, in short, the plaod 
was inaccessible, except by such windings and blind ways as thef 
tbamselves only, who made them, could find. 

I asked them what pat them upon all these fortifications : he told 
me I would say there was great need of it, when they had given me 
an account how they passed their time since their arriving in the 
island, especially after they had the misfortune to find I was gone 
He told me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortuoa. 
when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction ^ 
and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that, one time or oth^r^ 
he should see me again ; but nothing that ever befell him in his lifa 
he Bud, was so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the dbap> 
pointment he was under when he came back to the island and fbosi 
I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left be- 
hind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the Spa&- 
iarOs all thought themselvee much better among the savages, only 
that their number was so small ; " and," says he, " had they been 
strong enough, we had been long ago in purgatory ;" and with that 
he crossed himself on the breast. " But, sir," says he, " I hope yoa 
will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, forced by necessity, 
vrs were obliged, for our own preservation, to disarm them, end make 
theaa our subjects, who would not be content with being moderately 
our masters, but would be our murderers." I answered I was heartily

have put them in poflseMion of everything firgt, and left tiie othow in 

a state of subjection, as they deserved ; but if they had reduced them 
to it, I was very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault 
vfith it : for I knew they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned vil* 
laius, and were fit for any manner of mischief 

While I was thus saying this, the man came whom he had lent 
back, and with him eleven men more. In the dress they were ui, it 
was impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he made all clear 
both to them and me. First he turned to me, and pointing to them, 
said, *' These, sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to 
you ;" and then turning to them, and pointmg to me, he let them know 
who I was : upon which they all came up, one by one, not as if they 
had been sailors and ordinary fellows, and the like, but really as if 
they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or great 
conqueror : their behavior was to the last degree obliging and courte- 
ous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well 
became them ; and, in short, they had so much more manners than I, 
that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to 
return them in kind. 

The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island, after my 
going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents, which 
the former part of my relation will help to understand, and which 
will, in most of the particulars, refer to the accourt I have already 
given, that I cajinot but commit them, with great delight, to the read- 
ing of those that come after me. 

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first per- 
ison, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand said Ps, and 
$aid he's, and he told me's, and 1 told him's, and the like ; but I shall 
collect the facts historically, as near as I can gather them out of my 
memory, from what they related to me, and from what I met with in 
eonversing with them and with the place. 

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, T musfc 
go back to the circumstances in which I left the island and in which 
the persons were of whom I am to speak. And first, it is necessary 
to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard (the 
two whose lives I had rescued from the savages) in a large canoe, to 
the main, aa I then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's com- 
panions that he left behind him, in order to save them from the like 
calamity that he had been in, and in order to succor them for the 
present ; and that, if possible, we might together find Mane way for 
our delivai-anee afterward. 



WWi I seaA tliem ftway, I had uo Tisibla app«arano« o^ er tj&e io&si 
s«om to hope for, my own deliverance, any more than I had twenty 
years before ; much less had I any foreknowledge of what afterwaid 
happened, I mean, of an English ship coming on shore there to fetch 
ine off; and it could not but be a very great surprise txi them, whea 
they came back, not only to find that I was gone, but to find thre« 
ptrangera left on the spot, possessed of all that I had left behind me, 
which would otherwise have been their own. 

The first thing, however, that I inquired into, that I might begin 
where I left off, was of their own part; and I desired he would give 
Bae a particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with 
the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over. He told mo there wm 
little variety in that part, for nothing remarkable happened to them 
©n the way, having had very calm weather and a smooth sea. Aa 
for his countrymen, " it could not be doubted,'^ he said, '• but that they 
were overjoyed to see him" (it seems he was the principal man among 
them, the captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in hjiving 
been dead some time) ; " they were," he said, " the more eurprieed to 
see him, because they knew that he was fallen into the hands of the 
savages, who, they were satisfied, would devour him, as they did all 
the rest of their prisoners; that when he told them the story of his 
deliverance, and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them 
away, it was like a dream to them, and their astonishment," he said, 
** was somewhat like that of Joseph's brethren, when he told them 
who he was, and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's 
court ; but when he showed them the arms, the powder, the ball, and 
provisions, that he brought them for their journey or voyage, they 
were restored to themselves, took a just share of the joy of their de- 
liverance, and immediately prepared to come away with him." 

Their first business was to get canoes ; and in this they were obli« 
ged not to stick so much upon the honest part of it, but to trespass 
upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two large canoes, or peri- 
aguas, on pretence of going out ta-fishing, or for pleasure. In these they 
eame away the next morning. It seems they wanted no time to get 
themselves ready ; for they had no baggage, neither clothes nor pro- 
visions, nor anything in the world but what they had on them, and a 
few roots to eat, of which they used to make their bread. 

They were all three weeks absent; and in that time, unluckily for 
them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I mentioned in my 
other pfirt, and to jrot off from the island, leaving three of the most 
iaipudeut^ hardened, ungoyemed, disagreeable villains behind me, that 



BOBINSON CKTISOE, 365 

any man could desire to meet with^ to the poor Spaxiiards great 
grief and disappointment you may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did -was^ that when the Spaniards 
came aehore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions 
and ot^ier relief, as I had ordered them to do \ also they gave them 
the long paper of directions which I had left with them, containing 
the particular methods which I took for managing every part of my 
life there ; the way how I baked my broad, bred up my tame goats, 
and planted ray corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, ia 
a word, everything 1 did ; all this being written down, they gave to 
the Spaniards (two of them understood English well enough) ; nor 
did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, for 
they agreed very well for some time. They gave them an equal ad- 
mission into the house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably ; 
and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my methods, 
and Friday's father together, managed all their affairs : but as for 
the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the island, shoot 
parrots, and catch tortoises ; and when they came home at night, the 
Spaniards provided their suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, had the others 
bat let them alone; which however, they could not find in their hearts 
to do long, but like the dog in the manger, they would not eat them- 
selves, neither would they let the others eat. The differences, never-, 
theless, were at first but trivial, but such as are not worth relating, 
but at last it broke out into an open war; and it began with all tha 
rudeness and insolence that can be imagined, without reason, without 
provocation, contrary to nature, and, indeed to common sense ; and 
though it is true, the first relation of it came from the Spaniards 
themselves, whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to esam^ 
ine the fellows, they could not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply a i. 
defect in my former relation ; and this was, I forgot to set down, 
among the rest, that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail, 
there happened a little quarrel on board of our ship, which I was 
once afraid would have turned to a second mutiny ; nor was it ap- 
peased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and taking us all to 
his assistance, parted them by force, and makmg two of the most re- 
fractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons ; and as they had 
been active in the former disorders, and let fall some ugly, dangerous 
words, the second time he threatened to cnrry them in irons to Eng- 
Ifttid and have them hanged there for mutiny, and running away wi*1j 



886 ADViarruRES or 

tho ship. This, It seems, though the captain did not intend to io it, 
frightened some other men in the ship ; and some of them had put it 
into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them good words 
for the present till they should come to some English port, and that 
then they should be all put into jail, and tried for their lives. Tho 
mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it ; upon which 
it was desired that I, who still passed for a great man among them, 
should go down vriih the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them that 
tiiey might be assured, if they behared well the rest of the voyage, 
all they had done for the time past should be pardoned. So I went, 
and after passing my honor's word to them, they appeared easy, and 
the more so when I caused the two men that were in irons to be re- 
leased and forgiven. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night ; the 
wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our two men who 
had been laid in irons, had stole each of them a musket, and some 
other weapons (what powder and shot they had we knew not), and 
had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run 
away with her to their companions in roguery on shore. As soon as 
we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, with twelve men and 
the mate, and away they went to seek the rogues ; but they could net. 
ther find them or any of the rest, for they all fled into the woods whea 
they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate was once resolved, in 
j«8tioe to their roguery, to have destroyed their planta,tion6, burned 
all their household stuff and furniture, and left them to shift without 
it ; but having no orders, he let it all alone, left everything as ht 
found it, and bringing the pinnace away, came onboard without them. 
These two men made their number five ; but the other three villain* 
were so much more wicked than they, that after they had been two 
or three days together, they turned the two new-comers out of doors 
to shift for themselves, and would have nothing to do with them ; nor 
could they, for a good while, be persuaded to give them any food ; as 
for the Spaniards, they were not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business oegan to go 
forward ; the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English 
brutes to have taken in their two countrymen again, that, as they said, 
they might be all one family ; but they would not hear of it ; so the 
two poor fellows lived by themselves ; and finding nothing but industry 
and application would make them live comfortably, they pitched their 
teats on the north shore of the i!«land. but a little more to the west, to !)« 
«at of danger of the savages, wiio always l«uded on the east parte of 
ftie island. 



Here th«j buili them two hate, one to lodge in, and ttio other to laj 
up their magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards having given 
them eome corn, for seed, and especially some of the peas which I had 
left them, they dug, planted, and enclosed, after the pattern I had set 
for them all, and began to live pretty well. Their first crop of corn 
was on the ground ; and though it was but a little bit of land whioh 
they had dug up at first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to 
relieve them, and find them with bread and other eatables ; and one 
of the fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at 
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations as the rice an4 
the milkt and such little fiesh as they got, furnished him to do.

tlers. 

|I1EY were going on in this little thriving posture, when the 
[three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere 
humor, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told 
them the island was theirs ; that tiie governor, meaning mo, 
had given them the possession of it, and asbody else had any right 
to it ; and that they should build no houses upon their ground, unless 
they would pay rent for them. 

The two men, thiiaking they were jesting at first, asked them to 
eome in and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they 
had built, and to tell them what rent they demanded ; and one of 
them merrily said, " If they were the ground-landlords, he hoped, if 
they built tenements upon their land, and made improvements, thej 
would, according to the custom of landlords, grant along lease ;" and 
desired they would get a scrivener to draw the writings. One of the 
three cursing and raging, told them they should see they were not in 
jest ; and going to a little placo at a distance, where the honest men 
had made a fire to dress their victuals, lie takes a firebrand, and claps 
it to the outside of their hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it 
would have been burned all down in a few minutes, if one of the two 
had not run to the fellow, thrust him away, and trod tho fire out witk 
hi« feet and that not witbout-swiie difficulty too. 



288 ADVKNTUilES OP 

The felloAV vras in euch a rage at the honest man's thrna&ag hiirr 
away, that he returned upon hira with a pole he had in his hand, atd 
had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the hn-, 
he had ended hia days at once. His comrade, seeing the danger tl ^ 
\Tere both in, ran in after him, and immediately they came both c ': 
■with their muskets, and the man that was first struck at with the pf^ -; 
knocked the fellow down that had begun the quarrel with the stock ( f 
his musket, and that before the other two could come to help him ; and 
then seeing the rest come at them, they stood together, and presenting 
the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand oflf. 

The others had firearms with them, too ; but oce of the two honest 
men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his danger, told 
them, if they offered to move hand or foot, they were dead men, and 
boldly commanded them to lay down their arms. They did not, in. 
deed, lay down their arms, but seeing him so resolute it brought them 
to a parley, and they consented to take their wounded man with them 
and begone ; and, indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently 
with the blow. However, they were much in tne wrong, since they 
had the advantage, that they did not disarm them effectually, aa they 
might have done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards and 
given them an account how the rogues had treated them, for the three 
villains studied nothing but revenge, and every day gave them some 
intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of th* 
rogueries, such as tneading down their corn, shooting three young 
kida and a ehe-goat, \^ich the poor men had got to breed up tame 
for their store, and, in a word, plaguing them night and day in thisr 
niMiner ; it forced the two men to such a desperation, that they re- 
solved to fight them all three, the first time they had a fair opportu- 
nity. In order to this they resolved to go to the castle, as they called 
it (that was my old dwelling), where the three rogues and tlie Spau- 
i&rdt all lived together at that thne, intending to have a fair battle, 
and the Spaniards $hould stand by to see fair play ; so they got up 
in the morning, before day, and came to the place, and called the 
Englishmen by their names, telling a Spaniard that answered that 
they wanted to speak with them. 

It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, having bee* 
in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom for distinc 
tion I called the honest men, and he had made a sad complaint to 
the Spaniards of the barbarous usace they had met with from theiT 
three countrymen, and how they had ruined their plontatioD, and do* 



Stroyed thoir corn that they had labored so bard to hring forward, 
and killed the mikh goat and their three kids, which was all they had 
provided for their sustenance, and that if he and his friends, meaning 
the Spaniards, did not assist them again, they should be starved. 
When the Spaniards came home at night and they were all at supper, 
one of them took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though 
in very gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them how they could 
be so cruel, they being harmless, inoffensive fellows ; that they were 
pntting themselves in a way to subsist by their labor, and that it had 
cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as 
they were then in. 

One of the Englishmen returned, very briskly, *' What had they to 
do there ? that they came on shore without leave, and that they should 
not plant nor build upon the island ; it was none of their ground." 
" Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly, " Senhor Inglese, Ihey must 
not starve." The Englishman replied, like a rough-hewn tarpauling, 

" they might starve and be d d ; they should not plant nor build 

in that place." "But what must they do, then, senhor?" said the 
Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned, " Do ? d — n them, they 
should be servants, and work for them." " But how can you expect 
that of them ?" says the Spaniard ; '• they are not bought with your 
money ; you have no right to make them servants." The English- 
man answered, " The island was theirs • the governor had given it to 
them, and no man had anything to do there but themselves ;" and with 
that, swore by his Maker that they would go and burn all their new 
huts ; they should build none upon their land. " Why, Senhor," says 
the Spaniard, " by the sanie rule, we must be your servants, too." 
" Ay," says the bold dog, " and so j^u shall, too, before we have done 
with you" (mixing two or three G-d d — n me'e in the proper inter- 
rals of his speech); the Spaniard only smiled at that, and made him 
no answer. Howevei", this little discourse had heated them, and, 
starting up, one says to the other — I think it waa he they called Will 
Atkins — " Como, Jack, let's go and have t'other brush with 'em ; we'll 
demolish their castle, I'll wnrrant you ; they ihall plant no colony ia 
©ur dominions." 

Upon this they all went trooping away, with every man a guu, a 
pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among them- 
selves of what they would do to the Spaniards, 4oo, when opportu- 
nity offered ; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so per§^ -'.tly under- 
Ktand them as to know all the particulars, only that, in general, ihey 
threatened them hard for taking the two Englishmen's part. 



290 ADVENTURES O* 

Whither they "went, or how they bestowed their timft tnat evening, 
ihe Spaniards said they did not know ; but it seems they wandered 
about the country part of the night, and then lying down in the place 
■which I used to call my bower, they were weary and overslept them- 
selves. The case was this : they had resolved to stay till midnight 
ajid 80 take the poor men when they were asleep, and, as they ac- 
knowledged afterward, intended to set fire to their huts while they 
were in them, and either burn them there or murder them as they 
came out. As malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange 
they should not have been kept awake. 

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I hav6 
•aid, though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering, 
it happened, and very luckily for them all^ that they were up and 
gone abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to their huts. 

When they came there and found the men gone, Atkins, who, it 
eeems, was the forwardest man, called out to his comrade, " Ha ! Jack, 
here's the nest, hut, d — n them, the birds are flown." They mused 
awhile, to think what should be the occasion of their being gone 
abroad so soon, and suggested presently that the Spaniards had given 
them notice of it ; and vrith that they shook hands, and swore to one 
another that they would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as 
they had made this bloody bargain, they fell to work with the poor 
men's habitation. They did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but they 
pulled down both their houses, and pulled them so limb from limb 
that they left not the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the 
ground where they stood ; they tore all their little collected house- 
hold stufi" in pieces, and threw everything about in such a manner 
that the poor men afterward found some of their things a mile off their 
habitation. When they had done this, they pulled up all the young 
trees which the poor men had planted, pulled up an enclosure they 
had made to secure their cattle and their corn, and, m a word, sacked 
and plundered '^vervthing as completely as a horde of Tartars would 
have done. 

The two men were, at this juncture, gone to find them out, and had 
resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but 
two to three ; eo that, had they met, there certainly would have been 
bloodshed among them ; for they were all very stout^ resolute fol- 
lows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they 
themselves could do to meet, for as if they had dogged one another, 
Trhtu the thr«e were gone thither, the two were here ' and, afterward, 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 201 

when &e two went back to find them, the three w^re ciine to the old 
habitation again. Wo shall see their different conduct; presently. 
When the three came back like furious creatures, flushed with the 
rage which the work they had been about had put them into, they 
came up to the Spaniards and told them what they had done, by way 
of scoff and bravado ; and one of them, stepping up to one of the 
Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of 
his hat aa it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering 
in his face, says to him, " And you, Senhor Jack Spaniard, shall have 
the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners." The Spaniard, 
who, though a quiet, civil man, was as brave a man as could be, and 
withal a strong, well-made man, looked at him for a good -while, and 
ihen, having no weapon in his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and 
with one blow of his fist knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a 
pole-axe ; at which one of the rogues, as insolent as the first, fired hia 
pistol at the Spaniard immediately. He missed his body, indeed, for 
the bullets went through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of 
his ear, and he bled pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard be- 
lieve he was more hurt than he really was, and that put him int« 
some heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm ; but now resolv- 
ing to go through with his work, he stooped, and took the fellow's 
musket whom he had knocked down, and was just going to shoot the 
man who had fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in 
the cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, 
secured the other two, and took their arms from them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the 
Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they began 
to cool, and, giving the Spaniards better words, would have their 
arms again ; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was between 
them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best 
method they could take to keep them from killing one another, told 
them they would do them no harm, and if they would live peaceably, 
they would be very willing to assist and associate with them as they 
did before : but that they could not think of giving them their arma 
again, while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to 
their own countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make 
them their servants. 

The rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to acft 
with reason ; but being refused their arms, they went raving away 
s»i raging like madmen, threatening what they would do, though 
&ey had no fireayms. But the Spaniards', despiaiug their threateR* 



292 ADVENTCRE8 OF 

iitg, told them 6i«./ should take care how they ofEerod anj injury to 
their plautatiou or cattle, for if they did, they would shoot them ai 
they would ravenous beasts, wherever they found them; aodif tJioy 
fell into their hands alive, they should certainly be hanged. How- 
♦ver, this was far from cooling them, but away they went, raging and 
swearing like furies of hell. As soon as they were gone, the two men 
oame back, in passion and rage enough also, though of another kind;; 
for having been at their plantation, and finding it all demolished and 
destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed that they had provoca. 
tion enough. They could scarce have room to tell their tale, the 
Spaniards were so eager to tell theirs ; and it was strange enough to 
find that three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no pun- 
ishment at all. 

The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially having thug 
disarmed them, made light of their threatenings ; but the two English- 
men resolved to have their remedy against them, what pains soever it 
cost to find them out. But the Spaniards interposed hero, too, and 
told them, that as they had disarmed them, they could not consent 
that they (the two) should pursue them with firearms, and perhaps 
kill them. " But," said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, 
* we vrill endeavor to make them do you justice, if you will leave it to 
ua ; for there is no doubt but that they will come to us again, when 
their passion is over, being not able to subsist without our assistance ; 
we promise you to make no peace with them, without having a full 
satisfaction for you ; and upon this condition we hope you will 
promise to use no violence with them, other than in your own de- 
fence. The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and 
with great reluctance ; but the Spaniards protested that they did it 
only to keep them from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last. " For,' ^ 
said they, " we are not so many of us ; here is room enough for ua 
all, and it is a great pity we should not be all good friends. At 
length they did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, living 
for Bomo days with the Spaniards ; for their own habitation was de 
Btroyed. 

In about five days' time the three vagrants, tired with wandering, 
and almost Btarved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs 
all that while, came back to the grove ; and finding ray Spaniard, 
who, as I hare said, was the governor, and two more with him walk- 
ing by tht sids of the creek, they came up in a very fubmissive. 
humble manner, and begged to be received again into the family. 
7)m Spamards nB9<l them civilly, but told them the^ actod bo tia» 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 5W9 

naturally by their ovra countrymen, and so very grossly by them (tbe 
fepaniards), that they could not come to any conclusion without con< 
Bulting the two Englishmen and the rest ; but, however, they would 
go to them, and discourse about it, and they should know in half an 
hour. It may be guessed that they were very hard put to it ; for, it 
scorns, as they were to \r&,it tliis half hour for an answer, they begged 
thoy would send them out some bread in the meantime, which they 
did ; sending, at the same time, a large piece of goat's flesh, and a 
boiled parrot, which they ate very heartily, for they were hungry 
enough. 

After half "an hour's consultation, thoy were called in, and a long 
debate ensued ; their two countrymen chai-giog them Avith the ruin of 
all their labor, and a design to murder them ; all which they owned 
before, and therefore could not deny now. Upon the whole, the 
Spaniards acted the moderator between them ; and as they had ob- 
liged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while tliey were naked 
and unarmed, so now they obliged the three to go and rebuild their 
fellows' two huts, one to be of ♦^e same, and the other of larger di- 
mansions, than they were before ; to fence their ground again where 
they had pulled up their fences, plant trees in the room of those 
pulled up, dig up the land aguin for planting corn where they had 
spoiled it, and, in a word, to restore everything to the same state as 
they found it, as near as they 'jould ; for entirely it could not be, tha 
season for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges, not being 
possible to be recovered. 

Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty of pro- 
visions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and the 
whole society began to live jpleasantly and agreeably together again •, 
only, that these three fellows could never be persuaded to work, I 
•■nean for themselves, except now and then a little, just as liey 
pleased; however, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they 
would but live sociably and fiiendly together, and study the good of 
the whole plantation, they would be content to work for them, and 
let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased; and thus having 
lived pretty well together for about a month or two, the Spaniards 
gave them arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with them 
as before. 

It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went abroad, 
but the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome 
as jcfore ; but, however, an accident happened presently upon this, 
which endangered the safety of tbAm alii and they were obliged to 



-rdi ADrENTURES OF 

ky by all private resentments, and look to the preserration of thet* 
liTes. 

It happened one night that the Spanish governor, as I call him. 
that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who was now the 
captain, or leader, or governor of tlie rest, found himself very uneasy 
in the night, and could by no means get any sleep ; he was perfectly 
well in body, as ho told me the story, only found his thoughts tumult 
uous ; his mind ran upon men fighting and killing of one another, 
but he was broad awake, and could not by any means get any sleep ; 
In short, he lay a great while; but growing more and more imeasy, 
ne resolved to rise. As they lay, being so many of them, upon goats' 
Bkins laid thick upon such couches and pads as they had made for them, 
selves, and not in hammocks and ship beds, as I did, who was but one, 
so they had little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get up 
npon their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their 
pumps, and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts 
guided them. Being thus got up, he looked out ; but, being dark, he 
could see little or nothing ; and, besides, the trees which I had 
planted, as in my former account is described, and whiflh were now 
grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that ho could ■only look up^ 
and see that it was a clear starlight night, and hearing no noise, 
he returned and laid him down again; but it wa* all one; ha 
could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to anything like 
rest; but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew 
not what. 

Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going ou* 
and coming in, another of them waked, and calling, asked who it was 
that was up. The governor told him how it had been with him. 
" Say 3'ou so ?" says the other Spaniard ; " such things are not to ba 
slighted, I assure you ; there is certainly some mischief working near 
us;" and presently he asked him, "Where are the Englishmen ?"< 
'• They are all in their huts," says he, '^ safe enough." It seems the 
Spaniards had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made 
a place for the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, were 
always quartered by themselves, and could not come at the rest. 
" Well," says the Spaniard, •' there is something in it, I am per- 
suaded, from my own experience. I am satisfied our spirits cm- 
bodied have a converse with, and receive intelligence from, the spirits 
unembodipd and inhabiting the invisible world ; and this friendly 
itotice is given for our advantage, if we knew how to make use ef it.

at all in it to justify the trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose, 
that shall convince you of the justice of my propoang it." 

In a word, they went out, to go on the top of the hiH where I used 
lo go ; but they being strong, and a good company, not alone, as 
I was, used none of my cautions, to go up by the ladder, and pulling 
it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, but were going 
round through the grove, unconcerned and unwary, when they were 
Burprised with seeing a light as oi fire, a very little way off from 
them, and hearing the voices of men, not one or two, but of a great 
number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on the 
island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the least dis- 
covery of there being any inhabitant upon the place ; and when by 
any occasion they come to know it, they felt it so effectually, that they 
that got away were scarce able to give any account of it ; for we dis- 
appeared as soon as possible ; nor did ever any that had seen me, 
escape to tell any one else, except it was the three savages in our last 
encounter, who jumped into the boat ; of whom I mentioned, I was 
afraid they should go home and bring more help. Whether it was 
the consequence of the escape of those men that so great a number 
came now together, or whether they oame ignorantly, and by acci- 
dent, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could not. it seems, 
understand ; but whatever it was, it had been their businesB either to 
have concealed themselves, or not to have seen them at all, much less 
to have let the savages have seen that there were any inhabitants in 
the place ; or to have fallen upon them so effectually, as that not a 
man of them should have escaped, which could only have been by 
getting in between them and their boats; but this presence of mind 
was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a 
great while. 

We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, 
turprised with this eight, ran back immediately, and raised their fel- 
lows, giving them an account of the imminent danger they were all in, 
and they again as readily took the alarm; but it was impossible to 
persuade them to stay close within, where they were, but they must 
all run out to see how things stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they had 
opportunity enough for some hours, to view them by the light of three 
fires they had made at a distance from one another ; what they were 
doing they knew not, and what to do themselves they knew not. For, 
first, the enemy wer« too many ; and, secondly, they did not keeji

logether, but were divided into several partiee, acd were on shore in 
several places. 

The Spaniards were in uo small conBternation at this »gbt ; and 
when they found that the fellows ran fctraggling all over the shore, 
thfey made no doubt but fii-st or last, some of them would chop in upon 
their habitation, or upon some other place where they would see th* 
token of inhabitants ; and they were in great perplexity also for fear 
of fbeir flock of goats, wliich A70uld have been little less than stunr- 
ing them, if they should have been destroyed ; so the first thing they 
resolved upon was to despatch throe men away before it was light, 
two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to 
the great valley where the cave was, and, if need were, to drive 
them into the cave itself. Could they have seen the savages all 
together in one body, and at a distance from their canoes, they re- 
solved, if there had been a hundred of them, to have attacked them ; 
but that could not be obtained ; for they were some of them two miles 
off from the other ; and, as it appeared afterward, were of two dif- 
ferent nations. 

After having mused a great while on the course they should taia, 
and beating their brains in considering their present circumstance^ 
they resolved, at last, while it was still dark, to send the old savage, 
Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, something concern- 
ing them : as what they came for, what they intended to do, and the 
like. The old man readily undertook it ; and fetripping himself quite 
naked, as most of the savages were, away he went. After he had 
been gone an hour or two, he brings word that he had been among 
them undiscovered ; that he found they were two parties, and of two 
several nations, who had war wi^h one another, and had a great bat- 
tle in their own country; and that both sides having had several 
prisoners taken in the fight, they were, by mere chance, landed all on 
the same island, for the devouring their prisoners and making merry, 
but their coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their 
mirth ; that they were in a great rage at one another, and were eo 
near, that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight 
began to appear : but he did not perceive that they had any notion of 
anybody being on the island but themselves. He had hardly made 
an end of telling his story, when they could perceive, by the unusual 
noise they made, that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody 
fight. .

ROBINSON ORUBOB, 8&? 

elated in % and t!iat they bad nothing to do but li« etill, and t^ 
sarages would kill one another to their bands, and then the reil 
would go away ; and it was so to a tittle. But it was impoBsibl* to 
prevail, especially upon the Englishmen ; their curiosity was so im- 
portune upon their prudentials, that they must run out and see the 
battle: however, they used some caution, too, viz., they did not go 
openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther into the woodi^ 
and placed themselves to advantage, where they might securely 8W 
them manage the fight, and, as they thought, not be seen by tb«ra ; 
but it seems the savages did see them, as we shall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce; and, if I might believe the Englishmeay 
one of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of 
great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding tb.« 
fight. The battle, they said, held two hours before they could guees 
which party would be beaten ; but then, that party which was nearer 
our people's habitation began to appear weakest, and, after some 
time more, some of them began to flyj and this put om* men again 
into a great consternation, lest any one of those that fled should run 
into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and thereby involun- 
tarily discover the place; and that, by consequence, the pursuera 
would do the like in search of them. Upon this they resolved that 
they would stand armed within the wall, and whoever came into the 
grove, they resolved to sally out over the wall and kill them ; so that, 
if possible, not one should return to give an account of it they ordered 
also that it should be done with their swords, or by knocking them 
down with the stocks of their muskets, but not by shooting them, foi 
fear of raising an alarm by the noise. 

As they expected, it fell out ; three of the routed army fled for life, 
and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in the leajrt 
knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick wood for 
shelter. The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of thia 
within, with this addition, to our men's great satisfaction, viz., that 
the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way they were 
gone ; upon this the Spaniard governor, a man of humanity, would 
not suffer them to kill the three fugitives, but sending three men out 
by the top of the hill, ordered them to go round, come in behind them, 
and surprise and take them prisoners ; which was done. The reeidae 
of the conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to eea ; the 
victors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing themselves 
into a body together, gave two screaming shouts, which they sup- 
posed was by way of triumph, and f^ the fight eoded ; and tbe avns

d»y, about Aree o'clock in the afternoon, tbey also marched to thei* 
canoes. And thus the Spaniards had their island again free to then> 
selves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages in several years 
after. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and 
viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty men dead 
on the spot ; uome were killed with great long arrows, some of which 
were found sticking in their bodies ; hut most of them were killed 
with great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found 
cu the field oif battle, and as many hows, with a great many arrows. 
These swords were strange, great unwieldy things, and they must b« 
very strong men that used them ; most of those men that were killed 
with them had their heads mashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as we 
call it in English, their brains knocked out, and several of their arms 
and legs broken ; so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible 
rage and fury. Wo found not one man that was not stone dead, for 
either they stay by their enemy till they have quite killed him, or 
they carry all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with 
them. 

This delfverance tamed our Englishmen for a great while; the 
sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences appeared 
terrible to the last degree, especially upon supposing that some time 
or other they should fall into the hands of those creatures, who would 
not only kill them as enemies, but kill them for food, as we kill our 
cattle ; and they professed to me, that the thoughts of being eaten up 
like beef or mutton, though it was supposed it was not to be till they 
were dead, had something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their 
very stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and filled 
their minds with such unusual terror, they were not themselves for 
some weeks afler. This, as I said, tam(;d even ^e three English 
brutes I have been speaking of, and, for a great whila after, they were 
tractable, and went about the common business of the whole society 
well enough ; planted, sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalized 
to the country. But some time after this, they fell into such simple 
measures again, as brought them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as T observed ; and these three 
being lusty, stout young fellow«, they made them servants, and taught 
them to work for thpm : and, as slavps, they did wpU enough; bat 
they did not take thpir tnpn^nres with them as I did by my man 
Friday, viz., to bpein wifh tb^^m upon the principle of having Raved 
their liyesi aad then instruct them udoq the ratlonalpriiiciplefi of life;

tnaen lesi of religion, eivilizing them, and rodacing them b j kind 
usage and affectionate arguings ; but as tbej gave them their food 
©Tery day, bo they gave them their vrork too, and kept them fully 
employed in drudgery enough ; but they failed in this by it, that they 
never had to assist them, and fight for them, as I had my man Friday, 
who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bonos. 

But to come to the family part. Being all now good friends, for 
eommoD danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled them, they 
began to consider their general circumstances ; and the tirst thiag 
that came under their consideration, was, whether, seeing the savages 
particularly haunted that side of the island, and that there were mora 
remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living, 
and manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather move their 
habitation, and plant in some more proper place for their safety, and 
especially for the security of their cattle and corn. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would not 
remove their habitation ; because that, some time or other, thej 
thought they might hear from their governor again, meaning me ; and 
if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct 
them to that side ; where, if they should find the place demolished, 
they would conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were 
gone ; and so our supply would go too. But as to their com and 
cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave 
was, where the land was as proper for both, and where, indeed, there 
was land enough ; however, upon second thoughts, they altered one 
part of their resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of their 
cattle thither, and plant part of their corn there; and so if one park 
was destroyed, the other might be saved. And one part of prudouco 
they used, which it was very well they did, viz., that they never 
trusted those three savages, which they had prisoners, with knowing 
^ything of the plantation they had made in that valley, or of acy 
cattle they had there, much less of the cave there, which they kept, in 
case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and thithe. they carried also the 
two barrels of powder which I had sent them at my coming away. 
But however they resolved not to change their habitatioji, yet they 
agreed, that as I had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortifica- 
tion, and then with a grove of trees, so seeing their safety consisted 
entirely in being concealed, of which they were now fully convinced, 
they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually 
than before. For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in 
Btal^ea, which ia Uai« all gr«w up to be trees^ fer some good distancd 



JBVir^ AI>VENTURES OP 

befbre tlw entrance iuto nay apartments, they went on in the sath* 
manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground, from the 
traes I had set, quite down to the side of the creek, where, as I said, 
I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide flowed, 
not io much as leaving any place to land, or any sign that there had 
been any landing thereabout; these stakes also being of a wood very 
forwai'd to grow, as I have noted formerly, they took cai'e to have 
them generally much larger and taller than those which I had 
planted ; and as they grow apace, so they planted them so very thick 
and close together, that when they had been three or four years 
grown, there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way iuto 
the plantation ; and, as for that part which I had planted, the treea 
■were grown as thick as a man's thigh, and among them they placed 
so many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a 
palisade a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to 
{>eaetrat« it, but with a little army to cut it all down ; for a little dog 
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close. 

But this was not all, for they did the same by all the ground to the 
tight hand and to the left, and round even to the top of the hill, leav- 
ing no way, not so much as for themselves to come out, but by the 
ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted up and placed 
again from the first stage up to the top ; and when the ladder was 
taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it^ 
could come at them. This was excellently well contrived; nor was 
h less than what they afterward found occasion for: which served to 
©onTinoe me that as human prudence has the authority of Providence 
to justify it, so it has doubtless the direction of Providence to set it to 
work ; and if we listened carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded 
"we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives are now, by 
©ur own negligence, subjected to ; but this by the way. 

I return to the story. They lived two years after this in perfect re- 
tirement, and had no more visits from the savages. They had indeed 
ao alarm given them one morning, which put them into a great con- 
gtemation ; for somo of the Spaniards, being out early one morning on 
the west side, or rather end, of the island (which was that end where 
I never went, for fear of being discovered), they were surprised with 
Bteing above twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore. They 
made the best of their way home, in hurry enough, and giving tho 
alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that day and the next 
going out only at night to make their observation. But they had the 
good luck to be mistaken, for, wherever the savages went, they <*id 
no^ laad that time on the i«laud, but pursued some other desij[!v 



JLdcI iiow they had another broil with the three Engliuhmen, em 
«)f whom, a most turbulent fellow, being iu a rage at one of the three 
elaves which I mentioned they had taken, because the fellow had not 
done something which he bid him do, and seemed a little untractablb 
ia his showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt, in which he 
wore it by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to con'ect him 
but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give 
the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at hia 
head but struck into his shoulders, so that he thought ha had cat the 
poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating him not to murder 
the poor man, placed himself between him and the savage to prevent 
the mischief. Tho fellow being enraged the more at this, struck at 
the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as b« 
intended to serve the savage ; which, the Spaniard perceiving, avoided 
the blow, and with a shovel which he had in his hand (for they were 
cll working in the field about their corn-land) knocked the brute dowa 
Another of the Englishmen running at the same time to help bis coin» 
rade, knocked the Spaniard down ; and then two Spaniards more came 
in to help their man, and a third Englishman fell in upon tbem. They 
had none of them any firearms, or any other weapons but hatchets and 
ether tools, except this third Englishman ; he had one of my rusty 
cutlasses, with which he made at the two last Spaniards and wounded 
them both. This fray set tho whole family in an uproar, and mcr« 
help coming in, they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The next 
question was what should be done with them. They had been so often 
mutinous, and were so very furious, so very desperate, and so idle 
withal, they knew not what course to take with them, for they were 
mischievous to the highest degree, and valued not what hurt they di<| 
to any man; so that, in short, it was not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard who was governor told them, iu so many words, tha* 
if they had been of his country, he would have hanged them ; for all 
laws and all governors were to preserve society, and thoae who wwro 
dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it ; but, ta they 
were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness of an Ea- 
glishman that they owed their preservation and deliverance, he would 
use them with all possible lenity, and would leave them to the judg- 
ment of the other two Englishmen, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said they deared 
it might not be left to them, " For," says he, " I am sure we ought to 
sentence them to the gallovrs." And with that ha gives aa acceunfc 
how Will Atkins, one of the three, had erojaosed to have all the fiY« 



802 'AUVSSTX7S2KS Of 

Englishmen join together and murder all tb« Spaniards when thej 
were iii their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkina, 
" IIow, Seuhor Atkins, would you murder us all ? What Lave you to 
say to that V The hardened villain was bo far from denying it thi^ 
he said " it was true , and, Q-d d — n him, they would do it btill, 
before they had doue with them." " Well, hut Senhor Atkins," saya 
the Spaniard, ♦'what have we done to you, that you would kill us ? 
And what would you get by killing us ? And what must we do to 
prevent your killiug us ? Must we kill you, or you kill us ? Whj 
will you put us to the necessity of this, Senhor Atkins ?■' eays th« 
Spaniard, very calmly, and smiling. Senhor Atkins was in such a 
rage at the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been held 
by three men, and withal had no weapon near him, it "was thought he 
would have attempted to have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all 
the company This hair-brain carriage obliged them to consider se- 
riously what was to be done. The two Englishmen, and the Spaniard 
who saved the poor savage, were of the opinion that they should hang 
one of the three for an example to the rest, and that particularly it 
should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with bia 
hatchet ; and, indeed, there wa« some reason to believe he had done 
it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the 
wound he had received, that it was thought he could not live. But 
the governor Spaniard still said no ; it was an Englishman that had 
saved all their lives, and he would never consent to put an English- 
man to death, though he had murdered half of them ; " Nay," he said, 
"if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and bad time left 
to speak, it should be that they should pardon him !" 

This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spatxiard, thai 
there was no gainsaying it, and as merciful counsels are most apt to 
prevail whera they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into jtj 
but when it was to be considered what should be done to keep them 
from doing the mischief they designed, for all agreed, governor and 
all, that means were to bo used for preserving the society from daa» 
ger. After a long debate it was rgreed, Brst, that they should be dis- 
armed, and not permitted to have either gun, powder, shot, sword, or 
any weapon, and should bo turned out of the society, and left to live 
where they would, and how they would, by tV^mHelvea ; but that none 
of the rest, either Spaniards or English, shi ul'l converse with them, 
speak with them, or have anythina; to do with them ; that they should 
bo forbid to eomo withiu a ccitvvlu dl;«tftuc9 of the place where tlie

rest dwelt ; and, if tbey offered to commit any disorder, bo as to epoil, 
bum, kill, or destroy any of the coru, plantiugs. buildings, fences, or 
cattle, belonging to the fcociety, they Hliould dio without mercy, and 
tiicy should bhoot them wherever they could find them. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the sentencei 
considered a little upon it, and turning to the two honest Englishmen 
•aid, " Hold ! you mu^ t reflect that it will be long ere they can raise 
corn and cattle of their own, and thoy must not starve ; we must, 
therefore, allow them provisions." So he caused to be added, " ihat 
they should have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight 
months, and for seed to sow, by which iikej might be supposed to 
raise some of their own ; that they should have six milch goats, four 
he-goats, and six kids given them, as well for present subsistence as 
for a store ; and that they should have tools given them for their 
work in the fields, such as six hatchets, an adze, a saw, and the like ; 
but they should have none of these tools or provisions, unless thej 
would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the 
Spaniards with them, or of their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them tke society, and turned them out to shift 
for themselves. They went away sullen and refractory, as neither 
content to go away nor to stay ; tut as there was no remedy, they 
went, pretending to go and choose a place where they would settle 
themselves; and some provisions were given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for some victuals, 
and gave the governor an account where they had pitched their tents, 
ftnd marked themselves out a habitation and plantation ; and it was & 
very convenient place, indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N. 
E., much about the place where I providentially landed in my first 
voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord alone knows whither, 
in my foolish attempt to sail round the island 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived them, 
in a manner, 1 k© my first habitation, being close under the side of a 
hill, having some trees growing already on three sides of it, so that 
by planting others, it would be very easily covered from the sights 
unless narrowly searched for. They desired some dried goat's skinf^ 
for beds and covering, which were given them : and upon giving thar 
words that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their plan* 
tations, they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they could 
spare ; some peas, bartey, and rice, for sowing : and, in a word, any* 
thing they wanted except arms and ammunition. 

They lived in this separate condition about sis months, and h^ zoi

te tktb flnt harreet, tboofii the qruuititj wu but anal], the pwnwl of 
land they had planted being but littl* ; for, indeed, haying all th^ 
plantation to form, thej had a great deal of work upon their handi* 
and when thej came to make boards and pots, and ouch things, they 
were quite oat of their element, and could make nothing of it ; and 
when the rainy season came on, for want of a cave in the eartbt they 
eeold not keep their grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling , 
ead this humbled them much ; so they came and begged the Span* 
iards to help them, which they very readily did ; and in four days 
worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them, big enough to 
eeeure their com and other things from the rain ; but it was but q 
poor place, at best, compared to mine, and especially as mine was 
tben, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged i(^ and made several 
new apartments in it 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolio 
took thwe rogues, which, together vrith the former villany they had 
eommitted, brought mieohief enough upon them, and had very near 
been the ruin of the whole celony. The three new associates began, 
it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they led, and that without 
hope of bettering their oiromnstanoes ; and a whim took them, that 
tiiey would make a voyage to the continent, whence the savages 
eame, and would try if they could seiie upon some prisoners among 
&e natives there, and bring them home^ so to make them do the labo- 
rious part of the work for theuL 

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no further , 
bfot they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had either misohief 
in the design, or mischief in the event; and, if I may give my opin- 
ion, they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven ; for if we will not 
allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we reoon<^ 
tbe events of things with the divine justice ? It was certainly an aj^ 
parent vengeance on their crimes of mutiny and piracy that brought 
them to the state they were in ; and they showed not the least remorse 
for the crime, but added new villanies to it, such as the piece of mon 
BtrouB cruelty of wounding a poor slave, because he did not, or per- 
haps could not, understand to do what he was directed, and to wound 
him in such a manner as made him a cripple all his life, and in a 
place where no surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure ; an<?

UT I leave observing aad return to the story. The Uire« 
felloT^s came down to the Spaniards one morning, and is 
very humble terms desired to bo admitted to ppeak with 
thom ; the Spaniards very readily heard what they had to 
Bay, which was this : That they were tired of living in the manner 
they did ; and that they were not handy enough to make the neceesa* 
riee they wanted, aud that having no help, they found they should b« 
■tarved ; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one <A 
the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and ammu' 
lation proportioned to their defence, they would go over to the main 
uad seek their fortimes, and so deliver them from the trouble of sup- 
plying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very hon- 
*tly represented to them the certain destruction they were running 
into; told them they had suffered such hardships upon that very spot 
tioAt th<*y could, without any spirit of prophesy, tell them they would' 
b« Btai-ved, or murdered, and bade them consider of it. 

Thp men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they stayed 
hero, for they could not work, and would not work, and they could 
but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered, there was an erti 
of them ; they had no wives or children to cry after them ; and, in short, 
insisted importunately upon their demand ; declaring they would g(H 
whether they gave them any arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they wer» 
TMoived to go, they should not go like naked men, and be in no eon' 
Stion to defend themselves ; and that though they could ill spare theix 
irearms having not enough for themselves, yet, they would let them 
have two muskets, a pistol and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet, 
which they thought was sufficient for them. In a word, they aciieptdd 
&e offer ; and having baked them bread enough to serve thom a month 
ftad ^ven them as much goat's flesh as they eould eat while it waa 
twevt, and a great basket of drie ': grapes, and a pot of fresh water, 
md a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the canoe for a Toyiig«

gether, and away thej went merrilj enough; the Spaniards called 
after them Butn viagt / and no man erer ihought of seeing tkess 
anj more. 

The Spaniards were often sajing to one another, and to the tKO 
honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietlj and oomfort- 
ablj thej had lived, now these three turbulent fellows were gone ; as 
for their coming again, that was the remotest thing from their 
thoughts that could be imagined; when, behold, after two-and-twentj 
dajs' absence, one of the Englishmen, being abroad upon his planting 
work, sees three strange men coming toward him at a distance, with 
gons upon their shoulders. 

Awaj runs the EngUshman, as if he was bewitched, comes fright 
ened and amazed to the governor Spaniard, and tells him thej were 
all undone, for there were strangers landed upon the island, bul 
could not tell who. The Spaniard^ pausing a while, sajs to h iyn^ 
" How do jou mean, jou cannot tell who ? Thej are the savages, to 
be sare." " No, no," sajs the Eng^lishman, " thej are men in clothes, 
with arms." " Naj, then," eajs the Spaniard, " whj are jou con- 
cerned ? If thej are not savages, thej must be friends ; for there is 
no Christian nation upon earth but would do us good rather than 
harm." 

While thej were debating thus, came the three Englishmen, and 
standing without the wood, which was new planted, hallooed to thaia , 
thej presentlj knew their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind 
eeaaed. But now the admiration was turned upon another questiea, 
ri&, what could be the matter, and what made them come back

another ieland on the right hand, north, and several more wefttj aud 
being resolved to land somewhere, thej^put over to one of the islands 
which lay west, aud went boldly on shore ; that they found the 
jeople very courteous and friendly to them; and that they gave them 
several roots and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable ; and 
the women as ■vrell as the men were very forward to supply them with 
anything they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a 
great way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days ; and inquired, as well as they could 
«f them, by signs, what nations were this way, aud that way ; and 
were told of several fierce and terrible people that lived almost every 
way. who, as they made known by signs to them, used to eat men ; 
but as for themselves, they said they never ate men or women, except 
only such as they took in the wars : and then, they owned, they made 
a great feast, and ate their prisoners. 

The Englishmen inquu-ed when they had a feast of that kind ; and 
they told them about two months ago, pointing to the moon, and to 
two fingers ; and that their great king had two hundred prisoners 
how, which he had taken in his war, aud they were feeding them to 
make them fat for the next feast. The Englishmen seemed mighty 
desirous of seeing those prisoners ; but the others mistaking them, 
thought they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for 
their own eating ; so they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting 
of the sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify that the next 
morning at sun-rising they would bring some for them; and, accord- 
:|ingly, the next morning, they brought down five women, and eleven 
men, and gave them to the Englishmen, to carry with them on their 
voyage, just as we would bring so many cows aud oxen down to a 
eeaport town to victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, theip 
stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do. To 
refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to the savage 
gentry that could be offered them, and what to do with them they 
knew not. However, after some debate they resolved to accept of 
them ; and, in return, they gave the savages that brought them one of 
their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of their bullets; 
which, though fliey did not understand their use, they seemed par- 
ticularly pleased with ; and then tying the poor creatures' hands be- 
hind them, they dragged the prisonors in the boat for our men. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had 
them, or else thej that gave Uieu this noble pxeeent vrould certainlj

Lave expected that they should have gone to vrork with th«n, have 
killed two or three of them the nest morning, and perhaps have hi- 
vited the donors to dinner. But having taken their leave, with 
all the respect and thanks that could well pass between people, 
where, on either side, they understood not one word they could eay, 
they put off with their boat, and came back toward the first island; 
where, when they arrived, they set eight of their prisonei-s at liberty, 
there being too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage, they endeavored to have some commuBication with 
their prisoners; but it was impossible to make them understand 
anything ] nothing they could say to them, or give them, or do for 
them, but was looked upon as going to murder them. They first of 
all unbound them ; but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially 
the women, as if they had just felt the knife at their throats j for they 
immediately concluded they were unbound oh purpose to bo killed. 
If they gave them anything to eat, it was the same thing; they then 
concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh, and so not be fat 
enough to kill. If they looked at one of them more particularly, the 
party presently concluded it was to see whether he or she was fattest, 
and fittest to kill first ; nay, aft-er they had brought them quite over, 
and begun to use them kindly, and treat them well, still they expected 
every day to make a dinner or supper for their new masters. 

'Yhen the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or 
journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them, where their new 
family was ; and being told that they had brought them on shore, and 
put them into one of their huts, and were come up to beg some 
victuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the other two Englishmen 
that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all down to the place 
and see them ; and did so, and Friday's father with them. 

When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound ; for whet 
they had brought them on shore, they bound their hands, that they 
might not take the boat and make their escape ; there, I say, thej" 
sat, all of them stark naked. First, there were three men, lusty, 
comely fellows, well-shaped, straight and fair limbs, about thirty to 
thirty-five years of ago ; and five women, whereof two might be from 
thirty to forty ; two more not above four or five-and-twcnty ; and the 
fifth, a tall comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen. The women 
wore well-favored, agreeable person?, both in shape and features, 
only tawny ; and two of them, had they been perfect white, would 
have passed for very handsome women, even in London itself, having 
;)leaflaat agreeable counteuaiioea^ and of a very modefit bfihAVior; 



KOBINSON eRUSOB, SUukfii 

ftapeiially when they came afterward to be clothed and dressed, as 
they tailed it, though that dress was very indifferent, it must be con- 
fessed; of which hereafter. 

The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our 
Spaniards, who were, to give them a just character, men of the bwl 
behavior, of the most calm, sedate tempers, and perfect good humor, 
that ever I met with; and, in particular, of the most modest, as will 
presently appear ; I say the sight was very uncouth, to see three 
naked men and five naked women, all together bound, and in the 
most miserable circumstances that human nature could be supposed to 
he, viz. : to be expectiug every moment to be dragged out, and have 
their brains knocked out, and then to be eaten up hke a calf that is 
killed for a dainty. 

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's father, 
to go in and see, first, if he knew any of them, and then if he under* 
stood any of their speech. As soon as the old man came in he looked 
seriously at them, but knew none of them, neither could any of them 
understand a word he said, or a sign he could make, except one of 
the women. However, this was enough to answer the end, which was 
to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were 
Christians ; that they abhorred eating men or women, and that they 
might be sure they would not be killed. As soon as they were assured 
ef this, they discovered such a joy, and by such awkward gestures, 
several ways, as is hard to describe, for it seems they were of several 
nations. 

The woman who was their interpreter was bid, in the next place, 
to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and to work for the 
men who had browght them away, to save their lives. At which they 
all fell a dancing, and presently one fell to taking up this, and an- 
other that, anything that lay nest, to carry on their shoulders, to intU 
aoate that they were willing to work. 

The governor, Avho found that the having women among them would 
presently be attended mth some inconvenience, and might occasion 
some strife, and perhaps Wood, asked the three men what they in- 
tended to do with these women, and how they intended to use them — > 
whether as servants or as women ? One of the Englishmen answered 
very boldly and readily, that " they would use them as both." To 
which the gOTernor said, "I am not going to restrain you from it; 
you are yo'-r own masters as to that ; but this I think is but just, for 
avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it of you for 
that reason only, viz. : that you will all engage that if auy of you taka 



51C jL»VEimiRB8 OS- / 

any of these women && a wouiau or wife, that he shall take but one, 
and that having takeu one, none else shall touch her ; for, though we 
can iiot marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that while you 
skiy hero, the woman any of you takes should be maintained by the 
man who takes her, and should be his wife; I mean," says he, "while 
he continues here, and that none else shall have anything to do with 
her." All this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without 
»ay difficulty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to tak« 
any of them, but every one of them answered no : some of them said 
they had wives in Spain, and the others did not like women that wert 
not Christians, and all together declared that they would not touch 
one of them ; which was an instance of such virtue as I have not met 
trith in all my travels. On the other hand, to be short, the five Eng- 
lishmen took them every one a wife, that is to say, a temporary wife, 
and 80 they set up a new form of living ; for the Spaniards and Fri- 
day's father lived in my old habitation, which they had enlarged ex- 
ceedingly within. The three servants which were taken in the late 
battle of the savages lived with them, and these carried on the main 
part of the colony, supplied all the rest with food, and assisted them 
in anything as they could, or as they found necessity required. 

But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, ill' 
matched fellows, should agree about these women, and that two of 
them should not pitch upon the same woman, especially seeing twa 
or three of them were, without comparison, more agreeable than thff 
others. But they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling 
among themselves, for they set the five women by themselves in one 
of their huts, and they went all into the other hul, and drew lots 
among them who should choose first. 

He that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut whera 
Iho poor naked creatures were and fetched out her he chose ; and it 
Was worth observing that he that chose first took her that was reckon- 
ed the homeliest and oldest of the fire, which made mirth enough 
among the rest, and even the Spaniards laughed ar it; but the f«lioT< 
considered better than any of them, that it was application apd busv 
D«BS they were to expect assistance in as much as in anything els^v 
and she proved the best wife of all the parcel. 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, i>nd ffetch* 
ed out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned upon them 
ayain, and they firmly believed they were now going to bo devoured. 
^^QT4vpjrij^ when the English sailor cam6 in and fetched out oae of

them, the reet Bet up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, and 
look their leave of her with such agonies and affection as would have 
grieved the hardest heart in the world ; nor was it possible for th© 
Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be iuunediately 
murdered, tiU they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who imme- 
diately let them know that the five men who had fetched them out 
one by one, had chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women w^ere in was a little 
over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped them, 
and in a few hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent for 
their lodging apart, for those they had already were crowded with 
their tools, household stuff, and provisions. The three wicked oaoi 
had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both on 
the north shore of the island, so that they continued separated, as be- 
fore ; and thus my island was peopled in three place^ and, as I miglrf 
Bay, three towns were begun to be built. 

And here it is very well worth observing, that, as it often happem 
in the world (what the wise ends of God's providence are, in such a 
disposition of things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows bad the 
two worst wives ; and the three reprobates, that were scarce worth 
hanging, that were fit for nothing, emd neither seemed bom to do 
themselves good nor any one else, had threo clever, diligent, careful, 
and ingenious wives. Not that the first two were bad wives, as to 
their temper and humor, for all the five were most willing, quiet, pas- 
sive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than wives; but my 
meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or industrious, or 
alike cleanly and neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honor of a diligent appli- 
cation, on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle 
temper on the other, that when I came to the place, and viewed the 
several improvements, plantings, and management of the several little 
colonies, the two men had so far outgone the three that there was no 
©omparison. They had, indeed, both of them, aa much ground laid 
out for corn as they wanted, and the reason was because, according to 
my rule, nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn 
than they wanted ; but the difference of the cultivation, of the plant- 
ing, of the fences, and, indeed, of everything else, was easy to be seen 
at first view. 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their hutt 
so that when you came to the place nothing was to be seen bat wood, 
and though they had twice had their plantation demolished, once by 



312 Al>VE5mTRE8"*Or —^ 

their owa countrjinen and once by the enemy, M shall b« finown 5[u 
its place, yet they had restored all again, and everything w»s thriv- 
ing and flourishing about them ; they had grapee planted in crdei^ 
and managed like a vineyard, though they had themselves never seen 
anything of that kind, and by their good ordering their rines, their 
grapes were a» good again as any of the others. They had also found 
themselves out a retroai in the thickest part of the woods, where, 
though there vras not a natural cave, as I had found, yet they madp 
one with incessant labor of their hands ; and where, when the mis- 
chief which followed happened, they secured their wives and children 
$0 as they never could be found, they ha^■ing, by sticking innumerable 
stakes and poles of wood, which, as I said, grew so readily, made the 
grove unpassable, except in some places where they climbed up to get 
over the outside part, and then went on by ways of their own leaving. 
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they were 
much civilized by their settlement, compared to what they were be- 
fore, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same opportunity ] 
yet one of the certain companions of a profligate mind never left them, 
and that was their idleness. It is true, they planted corn, and made 
fences ; but Solomon's words were never better verified than in them, 
" I went by the vineyard of the slothful, and it was all overgrown 
with thorns ;" for when the Spaniards came to view their crop, they 
eould not see it in some places for weeds, the hedge had several gaps 
in it, where the wild goats had got in and eaten up the corn ; perhaps 
here and there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for tho 
present, but it was only shutting the stable-door after the steed was 
stolen : whereas, when they looked on the colony of the other two, 
there was the very face of industry and success upon all they did*, 
there was not a weed to be seen in all thoir corn, or a gap in any of 
their hedges; and they, on the other hand, verified Solomon's wordg 
in another place, '• that the diligent hand maketh rich ;" for every- 
thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty within and without ; 
they had more tame cattle than the others, more utensils and neces- 
saries within doors, and yet more pleasure and diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly 
within doors, and having learned the English ways of dressing and 
cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a 
cook's mate on board the ship, they dressed their husband's viotualg 
very nicely and well ; whereas the others could not b« brought to 
understand it; but then the husbands of the three wives, they loitered

anything but labor, and they fared accordingly. Tlie diligent lived 
•well and comfortably ; and tbe slothful lived hard and beggarly ; and 
80, I believe, genemlly speaking, it is all over the world. 

But now I oome to a scene different from all that had happened 
before, either to them or to me ; and the original of the story was 
this : Early one morning, there came on shore five or eis canoes of 
Indians or savages, call them which you please, and there is no room 
to doubt they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their elaves*, 
but that part was now bo familiar to the Spaniards, and to our men, 
too, that they did not concern themselves about it, as I did ; but 
havmg been made sensible by their experience, that their only busi^ 
nees was to lie concealed, and that if they were not seen by any of 
the savages, they would go off again quietly, when their bu&iaesa 
was done, having, as yet, not the least notion of there being any in, 
habitants in the island; I say, having been made sensible of this, they 
had nothing to do but give notice to all the throe plantations to keep 
within doors, and not to show themselves, only placing a scout in c:. 
proper place, to give notice when the boats went to sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right : but a disaster spoiled all these 
measures, and made it known among the savages that there were in. 
habitants there; which was, in the end, the desolation of almost the 
whole colony. After the canoes, with the savages were gone off, the 
Spaniards peeped abroad again ; and some of them had the curiosity 
to go to the place where they had been, to see what they had been 
doing. Here, to their great surprise, they found three savages left 
behind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they 
had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, 
ihey were fallen asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or 
they had wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time to 
bs taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and perfectly at 
a loss what to do. The Spanish governor, as it happened, was with 
thera, and his advice was asked, but he professed he knew not what 
to do. As for slaves, they had enough already : and as to killing 
them, they were none of them inclined to that : the Spanish governor 
told me, they could not thiak of shedding innocent blood : for as to 
them, the poor creatures had done them no wrong, invaded none of 
their property, and they thought they had no just quarrel against 
them, to take away their lives. And here I must, in justice to tliesp 
Spaniards, observe, that let the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico 
and Peru bf What they will, I neT«r met with B6T«!i*f eti t^e» of atiy 



nation trhatBO«ver, in aoy foreign country, who were so universally 
modeet, temperate, rirtuowe, so very good-humored and so courteous, 
AS these Spaniards ; and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their 
very nature : uo inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions ; 
and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit. The temper 
and calmness had appeared in their bearing the insufferable usage of 
ifce three Englishmen ; and their justice and humanity appeared nov/ 
in the case of the savages, as above. After some consultation, they 
jresohed upon this : that they would lie still a while longer, till, if 
possible, these three men might be gone. But then the governor 
Spaniard recollected, that the three savages had no boat j and if they 
were left to rove about the island, they would certainly discover that 
there were inhabitants in it ; and so they should be undone that way. 
Upon this they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep 
still, and so they resolved to v/aken them, and take them prisoners ; 
and they did so. The poor fellows were strangely frightened when 
they were seized upon and bound ; and afiraid, like the women, that 
they should be murdered and eaten : for it seems those people think 
all the world does as they do, eating men's flesh j but they were socw 
made easy as to that, and away they carried them. 

It wfts very happy for them that they did not carry them home 
to their castle — I mean to my palace under the hill ; but they 
carried them first to the bower, where was the chief of their coun* 
try work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting the corn, &o: ; 
and afterward they carried them to the habitation of the two £a 
glishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had for 
them to do ; and whether it was by negligence in guarding them, or 
that they thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, 
but one of them run away, and taking to the woods, they could never 
hear of him any mora. 

They had jjood reason to believe he got home again soon after, 
in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on shore three or 
four weeks afterward ; and who, carrying on their revels as usual, 
went off in two days' time. This thought terrified them exceedingly; 
for they concluded, and that not without good cause indeed, that if 
this fellow came home safe among his comrades, he would certainly 
give them an account that there were people m the island, aud also how 
few and weak they were ; for this savage, as I observed before, had 
never been told, and it was very happy he had not, how many there 
were, or where they lived ; nor had he ever seen or heard the Are of 



toy cf their guna, much less had they shown him any of their other 
retired places; such aa the cave iu the vallej; or the new retreat 
whicn the two Englishmen had made, and the like. 

The first testiuiouy they had that this fellow had given intelligence 
of them was, that, about two months after this, six canoes of savages, 
with about seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along 
the nortli side of the island, where they never used to come before, 
and hmded, about an hour after sunrise, at a convenient place, about 
A mile from the habitation of the two Englishmen, where this escaped 
man had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said, had they beea 
all there, the damage would not have been so much, for not a man of 
them would have escaped : but the case differed now very much, for 
two men to fifty was too much odds. The tv.'o men had the hajipiness 
to discover them about a league off, so that it was above an hour be- 
fore they landed; aud as tliey landed a mile from their huts, it was 
Bome time before they could come at them. Now, having great 
reason to believe that they were betraj-ed, the first thiug they did 
was to bind the two slaves which were left, and caused two of the 
three men whom they had brought with the women (who, it seema, 
proved very faithful to them), to lead them, with their two wives, and 
whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired places in 
the woods, which I have spoken of above, and there to bind the two 
fellows hand aud foot, till they heard further. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, and 
that they had bent their course directly that way, they opened the 
fences where the milk goats were kept, and drove them all out; leav- 
ing their goats to straggle in the woods, whither they pleased, that the 
Savages might think they were all bred wild ; but the rogue who came 
with them was too cunning for that, and gave them an account of il 
all, for they went directly to the place. 

When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives and 
goods, they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with 
the women, and who was at their place by ac(;ident, away to the Spaa- 
iards with all speed, to give them the alarm and desire speedy help j 
and, in the meantime, they took their arms and what ammunition thej 
had, and retreated toward the place in the wood where their wivei 
were sent ; keeping at a distance, yet so that they might see, if poasi« 
fcle> which way the savages took. 

They had not gone far, but that from a rising ground they could see 
the little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, 
and. la a iii(»ueut more, could see ail their huta and household atafl 



flaming np together, to their groat gner ana toorOlI cation ; tor Uiey 
had a very great loss to them, irretrievable, at least for souio tiiue. 
They kept their station for a while, till they found the savages like 
wild heasis, spread themselves all over the place, rummaging even 
way asid every place they could think of, in search of prey j and in 
particular for the people^ of whom, now^ it plainly appeared they had 
intelligence. 

the two Eagliahmeu, seeing this, thinking themselves not securo 
waere thej stood, because it was likely some of the wild people might 
come that way, and they might come too many together, thought it 
proper to make another retreat about half a mile further ; believing, 
as it afterward happened, that the further they strolled the fewer would 
be together.

)HEIR next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grow* 
part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood, 
which was hollow and vastly large ; and in this tree they 
both took their standing, resolving to see there what might 
offer. They had not stood there long, before two of the savages ap^ 
peared running diroctHj^ that way, as if they had already had notic* 
where they stood, and were coming up to attack tbem ; and a littl* 
way further they espied three more coming after them, and five more 
beyond them, all oommg the same way ; besides which, they saw seven 
or eight more at a dintance, running another way ; for, in a word, 
tbey ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity whether thay ehouW 
Btand Mid keep their posture, or fly ; but after a very short debate 
with themselves, they considered, that if the savages ranged the coun- 
try thus before help camo, they might perhaps find out their retreat 
iu the woods, and then all would be lopt ; so they resolved to stand 
thcin there ; and if they were too many to deal with, then thoy would 
get up to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted not to de- 
feud themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammuDkion lftste(!^ 



ROBINSON CRtrSOB. ' 3 IT 

Wough all the savages that were landed, which was ndar fifty, we?« 
to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered wnether they should 
fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the middle party, 
by which the two and the five that followed would be separated ; at* 
length they resolved to let the first two pass by, unless thoy should spy 
them in the tree, and come to attack them. The first two savages 
confirmed them also in this resolution, by turning a little from them 
toward another part of the wood ; but the three, and the five after 
them, came forward directly to the tree, as if they had known the 
Englishmen were there. Seeing them come so straight toward thorn, 
tiiey resolved to take them in a line as they came ; and as they re- 
solved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the first shot might hit them 
all three ; for which purpose, the man who was to fire put three or 
four small bullets into his piece ; and having a fair loophole, as ii> 
were, fi'om a broken hole in the tree, he took a sure aim, without be-, 
ing seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree, 
BO that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they plainly 
saw that one of the three was the rmiaway savage that had escaped 
from them ; and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, ii 
possible, he should not escape, though they should both fire; so the 
other stood ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at tlie first 
shot, he should be sure to have a second. But the first was too good 
a marksman to miss his aim ; for as the savages kept near one another, 
% little behind, in a line^ he fired, and hit two of them directly ; the 
foremost was killed outright, being shot in the head ; the second, which 
was the runaway Indian, was shot through the body, and fell but was 
not quite dead ; and the third had a little scratch on the shoulder, 
perhaps by the same ball that went through the body of the second ; 
and being dreadfully frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down 
upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner. 

The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than sen- 
sible of danger, stood still at first ; for the woods made the sonnd a 
thooBand times bigger than it really was, the echoes rattUng from one 
side to another, and the fowls rising from all parts, screaBiing, and every 
sort making a difierent noise, according to their kind: just as it was 
when I fired the first gun that perhaps was ever shot off in the island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the 
watter was. oame on uaconeerned, till they came to the place where 
nheir companions lajt; in a oondition miserable enoug^h; and here thg

poor Ignorant oreatures, not eeneible that they were within reach o| 
the same mischief, Btood all of a huddle over the wounded man, talk' 
ing, and, aa may be euppoeed, inquiring of him how he came to bo 
hurt ; and who, it ia very rational to believe, told them that a flash of 
fire first, and immediately after that thunder from their gods, had kill- 
ed those two and wounded him ; this, I say, is rational ; for nothing 
is more certain than that, aa they saw no man near them, so they had 
never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so much aa heard of a gun ; 
neither knew they anything of killing and wounding at a distance 
with fire and bullets ; if they had, one might reasonably believe they 
would not have stood so unconcerned in viewing the fate of their fel- 
lows, without some appehensions of their own. 

Our two men, though as they confessed to me, it grieved them to be 
obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who, at the same time, had no 
notion of their danger ; yet, having them all thus in their power, and 
the first having loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly both to- 
gether among them : and singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, 
they shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them ; 
the fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest ; 
eo that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they had killed 
them all. 

The belief that the savagea were all killed, made our two men com* 
boldly out from the tree before they bad charged their guns, which 
was a wrong step ; and they were under some surprise when they 
came to the place, and found no less than four of them alive, and of 
them two very little hurt, and one not at all ; this obliged them to 
&11 upon them with the stocks of their muskets; and first they mad» 
sure of the runaway savage, that had been the cause of all the mis* 
^ief, and of another that was hurt in the knee, and put them out cf 
their pain ; then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled 
down to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous moans 
ic them, by gestures and signs for his life, but could not say one word 
te them that they could understand. However, they made signs to 
Vim to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by ; and one of the English- 
men, with a piece of rope twined, which he had by great chance in 
his pocket, tied his two hands behind him. and there they left him ; 
and with what speed they could made after the other two, which were 
gone before, fearing they or any of them, should find the way to their 
covered place in the woods, where their wives, and the few gooda 
they had left, lay. They came once in sight of the two men, but tt 
yrm at » ereat distance; however^ they kad the i»adafaotioD to ^

them cross over a valley toward the sea, quite the contrary way from 
that which led to their retreat, which they were afraid of; aud being 
satisfied of that, they went back to the tree where they left their 
prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered by his comrades, for 
be was gone, and the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had 
bound him, lay just at the foot of the tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing wha^ 
course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what numbers; 
so they resolved to go away to the place where their wives were, tc( 
see if all was well there, and to make them easy, who were in fright 
enough, to be sure ; for though the savages were their own country- 
folk, yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps the 
more for the knowledge they had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages had been in th^ 
wood, and very near that place, but had not found it ; for it was in* 
deed inaccessible, by the trees standing so thick, as before, unless the 
persons seeking it had been directed by those that knew it, which 
these did not; they found, therefore, everything very safe, only the 
women in a terrible fright. While they were here, they had the 
comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to their assistance ; the 
other ten, with their servants, and old Friday, I mean Friday's father, 
were gone in a body to defend their bower, and the corn and cattle 
that were kept there, in case the savages should have roved over to 
that side of the country; but they did not spread so far. With tho 
seven Spaniards came one of the three savages, who, as I said, wero 
their prisoners formerly: and with them also came the savage whom. 
th« Englishmen had left bound hand and foot at the tree ; for it seems 
they came that way. saw the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound 
the eighth, and brought him along with them ; where, however, they 
were obliged to bind him again, as they had the two others who wer» 
left when the third ran away. 

The prisoners now began to be a burthen to them ; and they wero 
BO afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill them 
all, believing they were under an absolute necessity to do so for their 
own preservation. However, the Spaniard governor would not con- 
B€nt to it ; but ordered, for the present, that they should be sent out 
of the way, to my old cave in the valley, and be kept there, with two 
Spaniards to o;uard them, and give them food for their subsistence, 
which was done ; and they were bound there hand and foot for that 
mght. 
'Wbsa the Spi>mard£ eame, the two Englishmen were eo encoarai;e<l 



' that they oould not Batwfy themselves to stay any longer there ; but 
taking five of the Spaniards and themselves, vnih four muskets and a 
pistol among them, and two stout quarter-staves, away they weut in 
que«t of the savages. And first they came to the tree where the men 
lay that had been killed ; but it was easy to see that some more of the 
savages had been there, for they had attempted to carry their dead 
men away, and had dragged two of them a good way, but had giren 
it over. From there they advanced to the first rising ground, where 
they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where they had 
the mortification still to see some of the smoke ; but neither oould 
they here see any of the savages. They then resolved, though with 
all possible caution, to go forward, toward their ruined plantations 
bat a httle before they came hither, coming in sight of the seashorOi 
they saw plainly the savages all embarked again in their canoes, ia 
order to be gone. They seemed sorry, at first, that there was no waj 
to come at them, to give them a parting blow ; but, upon the whole^ 
they were very well satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their im. 
provemeuts destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them t<ii 
rebuild, and to assist tkem with needful supplies. Their three coun 
trymen, who were not yet noted for having the least inclination to d« 
any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they, living remott 
eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all was over), came and 
offered their help and assistance, and did very friendly work foi 
several days, to restore their habitation, and make necessaries foj; 
them. And thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legi.". 
sigain. 

About two days after this, they had the further satisfkclion of see 
ing three of the savages' canoes come di'ivmg on shore, and, at eomr 
distance from them, two drowned men j by which they had reason ti. 
believe that they had met with a stoi-m at sea, which had overset 
isome of them ; for it had blown very hard the night after they went oflF. 

However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, enough of 
them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what they had done, as of 
what happened to them, and to whet them on to another enterprise of 
the same nature; which they, it seems, resolved to attempt, with 
sufficient force to carry all before them ; for except what the first ma« 
had told them of inhabitants, they could say Httle of it of their own 
knowlodgs, for they never saw oae man; and the fellow being 
killed that hod affirmed it^ tbo*" had no o^i;r witness to confirm it to

li was i}ve or six montihs after this, before they heard any more oi 
the savages, ia which time our men were iu hopes they either forgot 
their former bad luck, or had givou over hopes of better ; when, on a 
sudden, they were invaded with a most formidable ileet of no less than 
eight-and-tweuty oanoea, full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, 
great clubs, wooden swords, and such-like engines of war ; and they 
brought such numbers with them, that, in short, it put all our people 
iato the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side 
ef the island, our men had that night to consult and consider what to 
do; and, in the first place, knowing that their being entirely con- 
cealed was their only safety before, and would be much more so now, 
while the number of their enemies was so great, they therefore re- 
solved, first of all, to take down the huts which were built for the two 
Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the old cave; because they 
supposed the savages would go directly thither, as soon as it was day, 
to play the old game over again, though they did not now land within 
two leagues of it. In the next place, they drove away all the flocks 
cf goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to 
the Spaniards ; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants 
anywhere as was possible ; and the next morning early they posted 
themselves, with all their force, at the plantation of the two men, to 
wait for their coming. As they guessed, so it happened ; these new 
invaders leaving their canoes at the eaet end of the island, came 
ranging along the shore, directly toward the place, to the number of 
iwo hundred and fifty, as near as our men could judge. Our army 
'A-as but small, indeed ; but that which was worse, they had not arms 
for all their number neither. The whole account, it seems, stood 
thus : first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old 
'J'riday, or Friday's father, the three slaves taken with the women, 
who proved very faithful, and three other slaves, who lived with the 
Spaniards. To arm these, they had eleven muskets, five pistols, three 
fowling-pieces, five muskets or fowling-pieces which were taken by 
me from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced, two swords, and three 
old halberds. 

To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee, but they 
had evei-y one a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff, with a 
great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a 
hatchet; also, every one of our men had a hatchet. Two of the wo- 
men could not be prevailed upon, but they would come into the fight^ 
und they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken fi ^^

the savages whea the first action happened, which 1 nave spoken tff 
where tbo Indians fought with one another, and the women had bat* 
chets, too. 

The Spauiard governor, whom I described so often, commanded the 
whole, and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wicked* 
edaess, was a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him. The 
savages came forward like lions, and our men, which was the worst 
of their fate, had no advantage in their situation ; only that Will At* 
kins, who now proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was planted 
jast behind a small thicket of bushes, as an advance guard, with 
orders to let the first of them pass by, and then fire into the middle 
of them, and as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as nimble 
as he could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind 
the Spaniards, where they stood, having a thicket of trees before 
them. 

When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in 
heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let about fifty of 
them pass by him, then, seeing the rest come in a vei*y thick strong, 
he orders three of his men to tire, having loaded their muskets with 
six or seven bullets apiece, about as big as large pistol bullets. How 
many they killed or wounded they knew not, but the consternation 
and surprise were inexpressible among the savages ; they were fright- 
ened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise, and see their 
men killed and others hurt, but see nobody that did it ; when, in the 
middle of their fright, Will Atkins and his other three let fly again 
among the thickest of them, and in less than a minute, the first three 
Oeing loaded again, gave them a third volley. 

Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they 
had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body been 
at hand, to have poured in their shot continually, the savages would 
have been effectually routed, for the terror that was among them came 
principally from this, viz., that they were killed by the gods witb 
thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them; but 
Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat ; some of thrt 
savages who were at a distance spying them, came upon them be- 
hind; and, though Atkins and his men fired at them, also, two or 
three times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they could^ 
yet they wounded Atkins himself and killed one of his fellow English- 
men with their arrows, as they did afterward one Spaniard, and on« 
T»f the Indian slaves who came with the women. This slave was a 
most gallant fellow^ and fought most desperately, killing five of them

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other 
men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood ; and the Span, 
iards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also ; for tboir 
number was so great, and they were so desperate, that though above 
fifty of them wsre killed, ^nd more than as many wounded, yet they 
eame on in the teeth of our men, fearless of danger, and shot their 
arrows like a cloud ; and it was observed that their wounded men, 
who were not quite disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds, 
And fought like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the English- 
man that were killed behind them ; and the savages, when they can^e 
ap to them, killed them over again in a wretched manner, breaking 
their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubis and wooden swords, like 
true savages, but finding our men wsi-e gone they did not seem t<> 
pursue them, but drew themselves up in a ring, which is, it seems; 
their custom, and shouted twice, ia token of their victory, after which 
they had the mortification to see several of their wounded men fall, 
dying with the mere loss of 'c'lood. 

The Spaniard governor Laving drawn his little body up together 
upon a rising ground, AtLins, though he was wounded, would hav^ 
had them march, and cUarge again all together at once • but the 
Spaniard replied, " Senuor Atkins, you see how their wounded men 
€ght ; let them all alote till morning ; all the wounded men will be 
stiff and sore with theit wounds, and faint with the loss of blood, and 
80 we shall have the fewer to engage." This advice was good, but 
Will Atkins replied merrily, " That is true, senhor, and so shall I, too, 
and that is the reason I would go on while I am warm." " Well. 
Senhor Atkins," says the Spaniard, " you have behaved gallantly and 
done your part ; we will fight for you, if you cannot come on, but 1 , 
think it best to stay till morning ;'' so they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight n'ght, and they found the savages 
tn great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a great noise 
and hurry among them where they lay, they afterward resolved to 
fall upon them in the night; especially if they could come to give 
them but one volley before they were discovered, which they had a 
fair opportunity to do; for one of the Englishmen, in whose quarter 
it was where the fight began, led them round between the woods and 
the seaside, westward, and then turning short south, they came so near 
where the thiekest of them lay, that, before they were seen or heard. 



S24 ADVENTURES OJ" 

eight of them fired iji among them, and did dreadtui exewition upoa 
them. In half a minute more eight others fired after them, pouring in 
their small shot in such quantity that abundance weTe killed and 
■wounded, and all this "while they were not able to see ■who hurt themi 
©r ■which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then 
diyided themselres in three bodies, and resolved to fall in among 
th^n all together. They had in each body eight persons, that is to 
•ay, twenty-two, and two women, who, by the way, fought despe- 
rately. They divided the firearms equally in each party, and so the 
halberds and staves. They would have had the women kept back, 
but they said they were resolved to die with their husbands. Hav- 
ing thus formed their little army, they marched out from among the 
trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting and hallooing 
as loud as they could. The savages stood all together, but were in 
ths utmost confusion, hearing the noise of our men shouting from 
three quarters together : they would have fought if they had seen us, 
for as soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were 
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, though not dangerously ; but 
oar men gave them no time, but, running up to them, fired among 
them three ways, and then fell in with the butt-ends of their muskets, 
their swords, armed staves, and hatchets, and laid about them so well 
that, in a word, they set up a dismal screaming and howling, fiying to 
save their lives which way soever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally; 
wounded in two fights about one hundred and eighty of them ; the 
rest being frightened out of their wits, scoured through the woods and 
over the hills, with all the speed fear and nimble feet could help them 
to ; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them, they 
got altogether to the seaside where they landed, and where their ca- 
noes lay. But their disasters were not at an end yet ; for it blew a 
terrible storm of wind that evening from the sea, so that it was im- 
possible for them to go ofi^; nay, the storm continuing all night, when 
the tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven by the surge 
of the sea so high upon the shore, that it required infinite toil to get 
them oflP; and some of thera were even dashed to pieces against the 
beach, or against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little rest that night 
but having refreshed themselves as well as they could, they resolvea 
to march to that part of the island, where the savages had fled, and 
m9 what postufQ they wore k. This necessarily led them ov»r ths 



aOBINSON CRUSOBr.^ ^ f 

plac« wh«r« the fight had been, and whore they found several of i i^ 
poor oreaiures not quite dead, and yet past recovering life ; a sight 
disagreeabia enough to generous minds ; for a truly great man, though 
obliged by the la\Y of battle to destroy hia enemy, takes no dolig^ht ia 
his mi«ery. However, there was no need to give any orders in this 
ease , for their own savages, who were their servants, dispatched these 
poor creatures with their hatchets. 

At length they T^me in view of the place where the mo e misera- 
ble remains of the savages' army lay, where there appear d .about a 
hundred still ; their posture was generally sitting upon f ^e ground, 
with kheir knees up towar4 their mouth, and the head ) at betweea 
the two hands, leaning down upon the kneeij. 

When our men came within two musket-shots of th( a, the Span- 
iard governor ordered two muskets to be fired without I ^ill, to alarm 
them; this he did, that by their counienance he might [(now what to 
expect, viz., whether they were still in heart to fight, or A^ere so heart- 
ily beaten as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might man- 
age accordingly. This stratagem took ; for as soon as the savages 
heard the first gun and saw the flash of the second they started up 
upon their feet in the greatest consternation imagir .ble ; and as our 
men advanced swiftly toward them, they all ran sc earning and yell- 
ing away, with a kind of howling noise, which ou. men did not un. 
derstand, and had never heard before ; and thus thf-f ran up the hills 
into the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and 
they had all gone away to sea; but they did not then consider that 
this might probably have been the occasion of their coming again in 
such multitudes aa not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so many, 
and so often, as woiUd quite desolate the island and starve thorn. Will 
Atkins, therefore, w ho, notwithstanding his wound, kept always with 
them, proved the best counsellor in this case ; his advice wa?, to take 
the advantage that offered, and clap in between them and their boats, 
and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any mtTre Ca 
plague the island. 

Thiey consulted long about this ; and some were against it, for fear 
•f making the wretches fly to the woods and live there, desperate^ 
and so they should have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to 
stir out about their business, and have their plantation continually 
rifled all their tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a 
life of continual distress. 
Wil/ Atkins told them they had better have to do with a huntSl'^d 



M%% XDVBNTUBDS OF *- 

IMA ti^Mi a hundred nations ; th&t as they nnut destroy their boats. 
■0 tbey liiUBt destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed themselves. 
la a wo. d, ho Bbuwed them the necessity of it so plainly, that tliey 
ftll oame into it ; so they went to work immediately with the boats, 
and gett.jg eome dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to 
Bet some of taem on fire, but tbey were so wet they would not burn ; 
however, the fire so burned the upper part, that it soon made them 
unfit for Bwiiumiag in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw what 
Ihey were about, some of them came running out of the w oods, and 
soming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down and cried^ 
"Oa, Oa, Waramokoa," and some other words of their language, 
which none of the others understood anything of; but as they made 
pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was easy to understand they 
begged to have their boats spared, and they would begone, and ne^'&r 
•ome there again. But our men were now satisfied that they had 
no way to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, but effectu- 
ally to prevent any of these people from ever going home again ; de- 
pending upon this, that if even so much ai one of them got back into 
their country to tell the story, the colony was undone ; so that letting 
|hem know that they should not have any mercy, they fell to work 
with their canoes, and deetroyed them every one that the storm had 
not destroyed before ; at the sight of which the savages raised a hideoui 
cry in the woods, which our people heard plain enough, after which 
they ran about the island like distracted men ; so that, in a word, our 
men did not really know at first what to do with them. Nor did the 
Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider, that while they made 
those people thus desperate, they ought to have kept a good guard at 
the same time upon their plantations ; for though it is true, they had 
driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their main 
retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the valley, 
yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to 
pieces, and all the fences and planting about it ; trod all the corn un- 
der foot, tore up the vinei and grapes, being just then almost ripe, 
and did our men an inestimable damage, though to themselves not one 
farthing's worth of service. 

Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet 
they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down ; 
for as they were too nimble of foot for our men, when they found 
them single, bo our men durst not go abroad single for fear of being 
surrounded with their numbers. The best was, they had uo weapons; 
for though th«y had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any materials 
toouke any; nw had they ariT «d|!a 600I or weapon among them, ^j 



ROBINSON causes. 627 

Th« extremity and distreas they -were reduced to \rM great, and in- 
deed, deplorable ; but at the same time, our men were also brought to 
Tery bad circumstances by them ; for though their retreats were pre- 
Borved, yet their proyision was destroyed, and their harvest epoUed 
and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they knew not. 
The only refuge they had now was, the stock of cattle they had in tho 
valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew there, and tho 
plantation of the three Englishmen, Will Atkins and his comraide* 
who were now reduced to two ; one of them being killed by an ar- 
row, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the templee, 
60 that he never spoke more ; and it was very remarkable, that thia 
was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage slave with 
his hatchet, and who afterward intended to have murdered the 
Spaniards. 

1 looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mina 
was at any time, after I first discovered the grains of barley and rice, 
and got into the manner of planting and raising my corn, and my 
tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may say, a hundred wolves upon 
the island, which would devour everything they could come at, yet 
could be hardly come at themselves. 

When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing they 
concluded was, that they would, if possible, drive them up to the far- 
ther part of the island, southwest, that if any more savages came ou 
shore they might not find one another ; then they would daily hunt 
and harass them, and kill as many of them aa they could come at, 
till they had reduced their number ; and if they could at laet tame 
them, and bring them to anything, they would give them corn, and 
teach them how to plant, and live upon their daily labor. 

In order to do this, they so followed them and so terrified them witk 
their guns, that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at an Indian, 
if he did not hit him yet he would fall down for fear, and so dreadfully 
frightened they were, that they kept out of sight fiirther and farther, 
till at last, our men following them and almost every day killing or 
wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods or hollow places 
80 much that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of food ; 
and many were afterward found dead in the woods, without any hurt, 
absolutely starved to death. 

When our men found this it made their hearts relent, and pity 
moved them, especially the Spanish governor, who was the most gen- 
tlemanlike, generous-minded man that I ever met with in my Ufe^ 
Knd he proposed, if poeaibleu to take one of them alive, aad briug hin

to understand what diey meant, so far as to be able to act as inter, 
preter, and go among them, and see if they might be brought to 8om« 
cojwlitions that might be depended upoOf to save their lives and do us 
no harm. 

It was some while before any of them could be taken ; but, being 
weak and half etai'ved, one of them was at last surprised and made a 
prieoner. He was sullen at firet, and would neither eat nor drinkj 
but fiudiug himself kindly used, and victuals given him, and no via, 
leuce oflfered him, ho at last grew tractable and came to himself, 
Thoy brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him, and told 
him how kind the others would be to them all ; that they would no4 
only gave their lives, but would give them part of the island to liv« 
in, provided they would give satisfaction that they would keep in 
their own bounds, and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice 
others, and that they should have corn given them to plant and make 
it grow for their bread, and some bread given them for their present 
Bubsistenee; and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk with the rest 
of his countrymen, and see what they said to it, assuring them that if 
they did not agree immediately they should be all destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to 
about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at th« first offer, and beg- 
ged to have some food given them; upon which, twelve Spaniards and 
two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian slaves and old Fx-i« 
day, marched to the place where they were. The three Indian slaves 
carried them a large quantity of bread, some rice boiled up to cakes 
and dried in the sun, and three live goats ; and they were ordered to 
go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, ate their provisions very 
thankfalh', and were the most faithful fellows to their words that 
could be thought of, for, except when they came to beg victuals and 
directions, they never came out of their bounds j and there they lived 
when I came to the island, and I went to see them. 

They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread, breed tamo 
goats, and milk them : they wanted nothing but wives, and they soon 
would have been a nation. They were confined to a neck of land, 
Burroundod with high rocks behind them, and lying plain toward the 
Rea before them, on the southeast corner of the island. They had laud 
enough, and it was very good and fruitful, about a mile and a half 
broad and three or four miles in length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, each as I made for 
jayself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and three or four 
kaives; and there they livedo the most subjected, innoo*>ut creakirea. 
that ever were heard of^ 



KOBINSON CRUSOE. 329 

A£t«r this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect to 
the savages, till I came to re-visit them, which was about two years 
after ; not but that, now and then, some canoes of savages came on 
•here for their ti-iumphal, unnatural feasts ; but, as they were of seve- 
ral aationo, and perhaps had never heard of those that came before, 
or the reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after 
Ikeir countrymen ; and if they had, it would have been very hard to 
have foimd them out. 

Thus, I think I have given a fijll account of all that happened to 
them till my return, at least, that was worth notice. The Indians 
or savages were wonderfully civilized by them, and they frequently 
went among them, but forbade, on pain of death, any one of the In- 
dians coming to them, because they would not have their settlement 
betrayed again. One thijg was very remarkable, viz., that they 
taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon 
outdid their masters, for they made abundance of most ingenious 
things in wicker-work, particularly all sorts of baskets, sievrs, bird 
cages, cupboards, etc., as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, conches 
and abundance of other things, being very ingenious at such work, 
when they were once put in the way of it. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we fur' 
nished them with knives, scissoris, spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all 
things of that kind which they could want. With the help of those 
tools they were so very handy, that they came at last to build up 
their huts or houses very handsomely, raddling or working it up like 
basket-work, all the way round, which was a very extraordinary piece 
of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but was an exceeding good fence 
as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin; and our men 
were bo taken with it that they got the wild savages to come and do 
the like for them, so that when I came to see the two Englishmen's 
colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if they all lived like bees in 
a hive. As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industri- 
ous, ueeful, and sober fellow, he had mad© himself such a tent of 
basket-work, as, I believe, was never seen ; it was one hundred and 
twenty paces round on the outside, as I measured by my steps ; the 
walls were as close worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty- 
two in number, and very strong, standing about seven feet high: in 
the middle was another, not above twenty-two paces round, but built 
stronger, being octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood 
eight very strung posts, round the tnp of whi^'h he laid strong pieces, 
planed together with woeden piaJi, from which he raised a pyramid 



0?0 A»YTOmjRE9 OP 

for a roof of ejght rafters, very handsome. I assure you, aad joined 
together very well, though he had no nails and only a fev,- iron spikes, 
which he made himself, too, out of the old ii-on that I left tbei-e ; uud, 
indeed, this fellow tshowed abundance of iugciiuiiy i;i pcvoral thing.^ 
■which he had no knowledge of lie made hiui a forge, with a paii* 
of wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal fur his 
work, and he formed out of the iron crows a middling good anvil to 
hammer upon. In this mamier he made many things, but especially 
hooks, staples and spikes, bolts, and hinges. But, to return to the 
house. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he work- 
ed it up between the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched 
that over again so ingeniously with rice straw, and over that a largQ 
leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry as if 
it had been entiled or elated. Indeed, he owned that the savages had 
made the basket-work for him, The outer circuit was covered as a 
lean-to, all round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the 
tJiirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about 
twenty feet di*ant, so that there was a space like a Avalk within the 
outer wicker wall and without the inner, near twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned ofi" with the same wicker-work, but 
much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had six rooms 
on a floor, and out of every one of these there was a door ; first, into 
the entry, or coming into the main tent, another door into the main 
tent, and another door into the space or walk that was round it ; so 
that walk was also divided into six equal parts, which served not only 
fbr a retreat, but to store up any necessaries which the family had 
occasion for. These six spaces not taking up the whole circumference, 
vrhat other apartments the outer circle had were thus ordered : as 
Boon as you were in at the door of the outer circle, you had a short 
passage straight before you to the door of the inner house ; but on 
either side was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by which you 
went first into a large room or store-house, twenty feet wide, and 
about thirty feet long, and through that into another, not quite so 
long J 80 that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of 
•which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner 
tent, and served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective chambers 
of the inner circle ; and four large warehouses, or barns, or what 
you please to call them, which wont through one another, two ou 
either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the 
inner tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3S^ 

World, Bor a nouae or tent so neatly contrived, much less so buiifc. It 
this great bcc-hive lived the three families, that is to say, Will Atkina 
and his companion ; the third was killed, but his wife remained, with 
three children, for she was, it seems, big with child when he died ; and 
the other two were not at all backward to give the widow her full 
ehare of everything, I mean as to their corn, milk, grapes, &c., and 
when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore ; so that they 
all lived well enough ; though it was true they were not so industrious 
«s the other two, as has been observed already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz,, that, as for religion, I 
ao not know that there was anything of that kind among them ; they 
often, indeed, put one another in mind that there was a God, by the 
very common method of seamen, viz., swearing by his name : nor 
were their poor ignorant savage wives much better for having been 
married to Christians, as we must call them ; for as they knew very 
little of God themselves, so they were utterly incupable of entering 
into any discourse with their wives about a God, or to talk anything 
to them concerning religioo. 

The utmost of all the impro^^ement which I can say the wives had 
made from them was, that they had taught them to speak English 
pretty well; and most of their children, which were near twenty in 
all, were taught to speak English too, from their first learning to 
speak, though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner, like 
their mothers. There was none of these children above six years 
old when I came thither, for it was not much above seven years that 
they had fetched these five savage ladies over ; but they hiid all been 
pretty fruitful, for they had all children, more or less ; I think the 
cook's mate's wife was big of her sixth child ; and the mothers were 
all a good sort of well-governed, qniet, laborious women, modest wid 
decent, helpful to one another, mighty observant and subject to thslf 
masters (I cannot call them husbands), and wanted nothing but to b« 
well instructed in the Christian religion, and to be legally married; 
both which were happily brought about afterward by mj t^'^^bi, a^|' 
at least, in co "'equence of m.v coming among them. ^

AVING thus given an account of the colony in general, an(3 
pretty much of my runagate English, I must say Bomething 
of the Spauiards, who were the main body of the fkmily, and 
in whose story there are some incidents also remarkabla 
enough. 

I had a great many discourses witli them about their circumstance's 
when they were among the savages. They told me readily that they 
"had no .instances to give of their application or ingenuity in that 
country • that they were a poor, miserable, dejected handful of people ; 
that if means had been put into their hands, yet tliey had so aban- 
doned themselves to despair, and so sunk under the weight of their 
misfortunes, that they thought of nothing but starving. One of them, 
a grave and sensible man, told me he was convinced they were in the 
wrong ; that it was not the part of wise men to give themselves up to 
their misery, but always to take hold of the helps which reason 
offered, as well for present support as for future deliverance , he told 
me that grief was the most senseless insignificant passion in the 
world, for that it regarded only things past, which were generally 
impossible to be recalled, or to be remedied, but had no views of 
things to come, and had no share in anything that looked like deliver- 
ance, but rather added to the affliction than proposed a remedy ; and 
npon this he repeated a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot re- 
peat just the same words tJiat he spoke it in, yet I remember I made 
it into an English proverb of my own, thus : 

In trouble to be troubled, 

Is to liave your trouble doubled. 

Hd rea on then in remarks upon all the little improvemen4;s X had 
made in my solitude ; my unwearied application, as he called it; and 
how I had made a condition which in its circumstances was at first 
much Avorae than theirs, a thou^aiid thnes more happy tLau theirs 
was, even now when they were all together. lie told me that it wan 
remarkiihle that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind, in their 
(JjfltregB, than any people that evor ii* m«t with ; that their unhappy 



faatiox^ i»..i tue Portuguege "wero the ■worst mbn .u ino world to 
struggle with misfortnucs ; for that their firefc stop in dangers, nfter 
tlie comuioii efforts wera ovsr, was to despair, lie down under it, ar.d 
die, without rousing their thoughis up to proper remedies for escape. 

I told him their case and mine dlfTered exceedingly : that they were 
cast upon the shore ■without necessaries, -without supply of food, or 
present sustenance till they could provide it; Ihat it was true, I had 
this disadvantage and discomfort, that I waa alone ; but then the gop- 
plies 1 had providentially thrown into my hands, by the unexpected 
iriying of the ship on shore, was suoh a help aa -would have ea- 
,!Ouraged any creature in the world to have applied himself as I had 
done. ''Senhor," says the Spaniard, "had we poor Spaniards been 
in your case, we (should never have got half thofse things out of the 
ehip, aa you did ; nay," says he, " we should never have found 
means to have got a raft to carry them, or to have got the raft on 
shore witliout boai or sail ; and how much less should we have done 
If any of us had been alone !" Well, I desired him to abate his com- 
pliment, and go on with the history of their coming on ahoi-e, where 
they landed. He k)ld mo they unhappily landed at a place -where 
there were people without provisions ; wherer^s, had they the common 
sense to have put ofiFto sea again, and gone to another island a little 
ferther, they had found provisions, though without people ; there 
being an island that way, as they had been told, where there were 
provisions, though no people ; that is to say, that the Spaniards of 
Trinidad had frequently been there, and had filled the island with 
*goats and hogs at several times, whore they had bred in such multi- 
t'udes, and where turtle and seafowls were in such plenty, that they 
could have been in no want of flesh, though they had found no bread; 
whereas, here, they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs, 
which they understood not, and which had no substance in them, and 
which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough ; and who could 
treat them no better, unless they would turn cannibals, aud eat men^a 
flesh, which was the great dainty of their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilize 
the savages they were with, and to teach them rational customs in 
the ordinary way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted it 
upon them, as imjust, that they, -who came there for assistance aad 
support, should attempt to set up for instructors of those that gave 
them food ; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for the in- 
structors of others, but those who could live without them. 

They gave mo dismal aecouuts of tiws extremities they were driven 



S84 ADTENTDRE3 OF 

lo f how soraetimes they were many days without any fe>od at all, tha 
island they were upon being iuhab-ited by a sort of savages that lived 
more iudoleiit, and for that reason were less supplied with the nece?. 
earies of life, than they had reason to believe others were hi the same 
part of the world : and yet they found that these savages were les* 
ravenous and voracious than those who had better supplies' of food 
Also they added, they could not but see with v/hat demonstrations of 
wisdom and goodness the governing providence of God directfi the 
events of things in the world ; which, they said, appeared in their 
circumstances ; for if, pressed by the hardships they were under, and 
barrenness of the country where they were, they had searched after 
a better to live in, they had then been out of the way of the relief 
that happened to them by my means. 

They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived 
among expected them to go out with them into their wars; and, it 
was true, that as they had firearms with them, had they not had the 
disaster to lose their ammunition, they should have been serviceable 
not only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible both to 
friends and enemies; but being without powder and shot, and yet in 
a condition that they could not in reason deny to go out with their 
landlords to their wars, so when they came into the field of battle, 
thej were in a worse condition than the savages themselves : for they 
had neither bows nor ai-rows, nor could they use those the savages 
gave them ; so they could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded 
with arrows, till they came up to the teeth of their enemy; and then, 
indeed, the three halberds they had were of use to them; and they 
would often drive a whole little army before them with those halberds, 
and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets : but that, 
for all this, they were sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in 
great danger from their arrows, till at last they found the way to 
make themselves large targets of wood, which they covered with skins 
of wild beasts, whose names they knew not, and these covered them 
from the arrows of the savages : j^et, notwithstanding these, they were 
sometimes in great danger ; and five of them were once knocked down 
together with the clubs of the savages, which was the time when one 
of them was taken prisoner, that is to say, the Spaniard whom I had 
relieyed: that at first they thought he had beeu killed; but when 
they afterward heard ho was taken prisoner, they were under the 
greatest grief imagina})le, and would willingly bave al) "entured 
their lives to have rescued him. 

They told me that when thej were so knocked down, th« r«it of 



ROBINSON CRUSOE, SSo 

their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they 
were come to themselves, all but him who they thought had beeu 
dead ; and then they made their way with their halberds and pieces, 
standing close together in a line, through a body of above a thousand 
savages, beating down all that came in their way, got the victory over 
their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it waa with the losa 
of their friend, whom the other party, finding him alive, carried off, 
with some others, as I gave an account before. 

• They described most affectionately how they were surprised with 
joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery, who, thej 
thought, had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz., by 
wild men; and j^et how more and more they were surprised with the 
account he gave them of his errand, and that there was a Christian ia 
any place near, much more one that was able, and had humanity 
enough, to contribute to their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief 
I sent them, and at tho appearance of loaves of bread, things they 
had not seen since their coming to that miserable place : how often 
they crossed it and blessed it as bread sent from Heaven; and what a 
reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it, as also the other 
things I had sent for their supply ; and, after all, they would have 
told me something of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and 
pilots, to carry them away to the person and place from whence all 
these new comforts came, but it was impossible to express it by words, 
for their excessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming ex- 
travagances, they had no way to describe them, but by telling me 
they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to their pas- 
sions suitable to the sense that was upon them ; that in soma ifc 
worked one way, and in some another ; and that some of them, 
through a surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark mad, 
and others immediately faint. This discourse extremely affected me, 
and called to my mind Friday's ecstacy when he met his father, and 
the poor people's ecstacy when I took them up at sea after their ship 
was on fire ; the joy of the mate of the slyp when he found himself 
delivered in the place where he expected to perish ; and my own joy, 
when, after twenty-eight years* captivity, I found a good ship ready 
to caryy me to my own countrj'. All these things made me more 
sensible of the relation of these p or men, and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found them, I 
must relate the heads of what I did fer these people, and the condi- 
tion in which I left them, Ifc was thels ODinlon, and mine, too, thaj

they would b« troubled n© more with the savages, or, if they -srerft, 
they would be abla to cut them off, if they were twice as many as be- 
fore ; eo they had no concern about that. Then I entered into a 
serious discourse with the Spaniard, -whom I call governor, about 
ftieir Slay in the island ; for as I was not come to carry any of them 
off, so it would not be just to carry ofi some and leave others, who, 
perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished. 
On the other hand, I told them I came to establish them there, not to/ 
remove thorn : and then I let them know that I had brought with me 
relief of sundry kinds for them : that I had been at a great charge to 
supply them with all things necessary, as well for their convenience 
as their defence ; and that I had such and such particular persons 
with me, as well to increase and recruit their number, as by the par- 
ticular necessary employments which they were bred to, being artifi- 
cers, to assist them in those things in which at present they were in 
want. 

They were altogether when I talked thus to them ; and before I de- 
livered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one by one, 
if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had 
been among them, and would shake hands with one another, and 
engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, that so there might 
^e no more misimderstandings and jealousies. 

"VYill Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humor, said 
they had met with affliction enough to make them all sober, and ene- 
mies enough to make them all friends ; that, for his part, he would 
live and die with them : ai:d was so far from designing anything 
against the Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing to him 
but what his own mad humor made necessary, and what he would 
have done, and perhaps worse, in their case ; and that he would ask 
them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had 
done to them, and was very willing and desirous of living in terms 
of entir* friendship and union with them, and would do anything 
that lay in his power to convince them of it : and as forgoing to 
England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty years. 

The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and excluded 
Will Atkins and his two country)nen for their ill conduct, as they had 
let me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity they were 
under to do so, but that Will Atkins had behaved himself so Iravely 
in the great fight they had with the savages, nnd on several occasions 
Bince, and had showed himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the 
general interest of th^jpi aU. that thoy had forgotten all that vras pasi

and thought he merited as much to be trustod with arms and supplied 
with ueoessaries as any of them ; aud they had testified tiieir satisfac- 
tion in him by committing the command to him, next to the governor 
himself; aud as they had entire confidence in him, and ail bis coun- 
trymen, so they acknowifidged they had merited that confidence by 
all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued aud trustedj 
and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving nie this assu- 
rance, that they would never have any interest separate from ono an- 
other. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of fi-iendship, we appointed 
the next day to dine all together, and, indeed, we made a splendid 
feast. ■ I caused the ship's cook aud his mate to come on shore and 
dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted. 
We brought on shore six pieces of good beef, and four pieces of pork 
out of the ship's provision, with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill 
it; and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and 
ten bottles of English beer — things that neither the Spaniards nor the 
English had tasted for many years, aud which, i*" may be supposed, 
they were vei-y glad of. The Spaniards added to our feast fire whole 
kids, which the cooks roasted ; and three of them were sent, covered 
up close, on board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on 
fresh meat from on shore, ae we did with their salt meat from on 
board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought 
out my cargo of goods. Wherein that there might be no dispute 
about dividing, I showed them that there was a sufaciency for them 
all, desiring that they might all take an equal quantity of the goods) 
that were for wearing, that is to say, equal when made up : as, first, 
I distributed linen sufficient to make every one of them four shirts, 
and. at the Spaniard's request, afterward made them up to six. These 
were exceedingly comfortable to them, having been what, as I may 
say, they had long since forgot the use of, or what it was to wear 
them. I allotted the English thin stuffs, which I mentioned before, 
to make every one a light coat like a frock, which I judged fittest for 
the heat of the season, cool and loose, and ordered that whenever they 
decayed they should make more, as they thought fit. The like for 
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, etc.

kt 80 remoto a part of the world, it would make them forget that they 
were left in a daaolate place ; and they all voluntarily engaged to me 
not to leave the place without my consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, par- 
ticularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of them 
most necessary people ; but, above all, my general artificer, than 
whom they could not name anything that was more useful to them. 
And the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to work imme- 
diately, and, with my leave, made them every one a shirt, the first 
thing he did) and, which was still more, he taught the women not 
only bow to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them assist 
to make the shirts for their husbands and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they 
were, for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, and 
made them clever, convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, 
lockers, shelves, and everything they wanted of that Iind. But, to 
let them see how nature made artificers, at first I carried the carpen. 
ter to see "Will Atkins's basket-house, as I called it, and they both 
owned they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before, 
nor anything so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind ; and 
one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while, turning 
about to me, "I am sure," says he, "that man has no need of us; you 
need do nothing but give him tools. 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man 
a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no harrows or 
ploughs, and to every separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a broadax^ 
and a saw ; always appointing that as often as any were broken or 
worn out, they should be supplied, without grudging, out of the gene- 
ral stores that I left behind. Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chisels, 
knives, Eoissors, and all sorts of iron-work, they had without tale, as 
'they required; for no man would take more than he wanted, and ho 
must be a fool that would waste or spoil them on any account what- 
ever ; and, for the use of the smithy I left two tons of unwrought iron 
for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such, 
even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for now 
they could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, 
if there was occasion, and were able to fight a thousand savages, if 
they had but some little advantages of situation, which, also, they 
eould not miss, if they had occasion.

m^ved to death, and the maid, also. Sh« was a Bober, well educa- 
led, religious young woman, and behaved so inoffensively that every 
one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an unhappy life with ua, 
there being no woman in the ship but herself, but she boro it witk 
patience. After a while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so fine 
a way of thriving upon my island, and considering that they had nei- 
ther business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason for taking 
BO long a voyage ; I say, considering all this, both of them came to 
xa&f and desired I would give them leave to remain on the island, and 
ot entered among my family, as they called it. I agreed to thia 
readily ; and they had a little plot of ground allotted to them, whera 
'bey had three tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, 
palisadoed like Atkins's, adjoining to his plantation. Their tents were 
contrived so that they had each of them a room apart to lodge in, and 
a middle tent, like a great store-house, to lay their goods in, and to 
eat and drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed their 
habitation to the same place ; and so the island was divided into three 
colonies, and no more, viz., the Spaniards, with old Friday and th«| 
first servants, at my old habitation under the hill — which was, in a 
Word, the capital city — and where they had so enlarged and extended 
their works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, that they lived 
though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never waa there such 
a little city in a wood, and so hid, in any part of the world; for I 
verily believe a thousand men might have ranged the island a month, 
and, if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked on 
purpose for it, they would not have found it ; for the trees stood B(f 
Ihick and so close, and grew so fast woven one into another, tha* 
nothing but cutting them down first could discover the place, except th» 
enly two narrow entrances where they went in and out could Le foun^ 
which was not very easy. One of tbem was close down at the water's 
odge, on the side of the creek, a»d it was afterward about two han> 
dred yards to the place ; and the other was up a ladder at twice, aa I 
have already formally described it. And they had, also, a large wood 
thick planted on the top of the hill, containing above an aoro, whioh 
grew apace, and concealed the place from all discovery there, viith 
only one narrow place between two trees, not easily to be discovered, 
to enter on that side. 

The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four 
families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their wives 
and cliildren : three savages that were slaves; the widow and tb« 
children of the Englishman that was killed j the young man sad Qx%

maid ; and, by the way, we made a wife of her before we went away. 
There was also the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought 
with me .for theai; also the smith, who was a very necessary man to 
thom, especially as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms ; and my 
other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was, in himself aa 
good almost as twenty men; for he was not only a very ingenious 
fellow, but a very merry fellow ; and before I went away we married 
him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship I men- 
tioned before. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say •ome. 
thing of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out ot 
the ship's ferew whom I took up at sea. It is true this man was a 
Roman, and pei-haps it may give offence to some hereafter, if I leave 
aiij-thing extraordinary upon record of a man whom, before I begam 
I must (to set him out in just colors) represent in terms very much to 
bis disadvantage, in the account of Protestants : as first, that he was a 
Papist ; secondly, a Popish priest ; and thirdly, a French Popish priest . 
But justice demands of me to give him a due character; and I must 
Bay, he was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person ; exact in 
his life, extensive in his charity, and exenij^lary iu almost everything 
he did. What then can any one say against being very sensible of 
the value of such a man, notwithstanding his profession ? though it 
may be my opinion, perhaps, as well as the opinion of others who shall 
road this, that he was mistaken. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him after he had agreed 
to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight exceed- 
ingly in his conversation ; and he first began with me about religion, 
in the most obliging manner imaginable. " Sir," said he, "you have not 
only under God" (and at that he crossed his breast) " saved my life, bufe 
you have admitted me to go this voyage in yoar ship, and by your 
obliging civility have taken me into your family, giving me an oppor- 
tunity of free conversation. Now, sir, you see by my habit what my 
profession is, and I guess, by your nation, what 3'our8 is; I may think 
it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavors on all 
occasions, to bring all the souls I can to the knowledge of the truth, 
and to embaace the Catholic doctrine ; but as I am here under your 
peruiL-wion, and in your family, I am bound, in justice to your kind- 
Bess, as well as in decency and good manners, to be under your gov- 
ernment ; and, therefore, I shall not, without your leave, enter iato 
any del)atc on the points of religion in which we may not agrse, fiuv 
ther than you shall give mo leav*.

1 told him his carriage was so modest, that I could not but ac« 
knowledge it ; that it was true, we were such people as they called her- 
etics, but that he was not the first Catholic I had conversed with with- 
out falliug into inconveniences, or carrying the questions to unj 
height in debate; that he should not find himself the worse used tot 
being of a diffcrect opinion from us ; and if we did not converse with' 
©ut any dislike on either side, it should be his fault, not ours. 

He replied, that he thought all our conversation might be easily 
separated from disputes; that it was not his business to cap principles 
with every man he conversed with ; and that he rather desired me to 
converse with him as a gentleman than as a religionist; and that, 
if J would give him leave, at any tiuie, to discourse upon religioua 
subjects, he would readily comply with it, and that he did not doubt 
but I would allow him to tiefend hia own opinions as well as he could ; 
but that, without my leave, he would not break in upon me with any 
Buch thing. He tola me farthei*, that he would not cease to do all 
that became him, in his office as a priest as well as a private Christian, 
to procure the good of the ship, and the safety of all that was in her; 
and though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and he could not pray 
with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon aL 
occasions. In this manner we conversed ; and, as he was of the mont 
obliging gentleman-like behavior, so he was, if I may be allowed to 
Bay so, a man of good sense, and, as I believe, of great learning 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many 
extraordinary events of it ; of many adventures which had befallen 
him in the few years that he had been abroad in the world ; and par- 
ticularly this was very remarkable, yiz., that m the voyage he waa 
now engaged in, he had the misfortune to be five times shipped and 
nnshipped. and never to go to the place whither any of the ships ha 
was in were at first designed. That his first intent was to have gone 
to Martinico, and that ho went on board a ship bound thither at St. 
Malo; but being forced into Lisbon, by bad weather, the ship received 
some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river Tagus, 
and was obliged to unload her cargo there ; but finding a Portuguese 
ship there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail, and supposing he 
should easily meet with a veFScl there, bound to Martinico, he went 
en board^ in order to sail to the Jladeiras ; but the master of the Por- 
tuguese ship, being but an indifferent mariner, had been out of his 
reckoning, and they drove to Faynl ; where, however, he happened to 
find a very good noarket for his cargo, which was com, and therefone

and to go away to Newfoundland. lie had no remedy in tliia t.A. 
gence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty good Y03age as far as 
tL« banks (no they call the place where they catch the fi;sh); Ashoro, 
jaieeting with a French ship bound from France to Quebec, in the vi\e} 
of Canada, and from thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he 
thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first dcKign; 
but when he came to Quebec the master of the ship died, and the ves. 
eel proceeded no further; so the next voyage he shipped himself for 
France, in the ship that was burned when we took them up at sea, 
and then shipped with us for the East Indies, as I have already said. 
Thus he had been disappointed in five voyages, all, as I may call it, in 
one voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to mention hereafter 
of the same person. 

I But I shall not make digression into other men's stories, which 
have no relation to my own; I return to what concerns our affairs in 
the island.

^ E came to me one morning, for he lodged among us all tho 
while we were upon the island, and it happened to be jusi: 
when I was going to visit the Englishmen's colon}'-, at the 
farthest part of the island ; I say, he came to me, and toW 
tne with a vsry grave countenance, that he had for two or three day« 
desired an opportunity of some discourse with me, which, he hoped, 
would not be displeasing to me, because, he thought, it might in some 
measure correspond with my general design, which was the prosper- 
ity of my new colony, and, perhaps, might put it, at least more than 
he tliought it was, in the way of God's blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse, and turn- 
i:ig a littlo short, " How, sir," said I, " can it be said that we are not 
i'l i\ e way of God's blessing, after such visible assistances and won- 
derf d deliverances as we have seen here, and of which I have given 
you a liirge account ?" "If you had pleancd, sir,'^ said he, with a 
wfii'ld of modestYj and , yet with groat readiness, " to have heard m«^ 



you would have found no room fo be displeased, much less to think 
60 hard of me, that 1 should Bug^ust that jou have not had wonderful 
assistances and deliverances ; and I hope, on your behalf, that you arc 
in the way of God's blessing, as your design is exceedingly g'^od, and 
•will prosper ; but, sir, though it were more so than is even possible to 
you, yet there may be some among you that are not equally right in 
^their actions j and you know, that in the story of the children of Is- 
irael, one Achan in the camp removed God's blessing from them, and 
turned his hand so against them, that six-and-thirty of them, though 
not concerned in the crime, were the objects of Divine vengeance, and 
bore the weight of that punishment." 

I was sensibly touched with liis discourse, and told him his in. 
ference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, and was 
really so religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I had in- 
terrupted him, and begged him to go on ; and in the meantime, be- 
cause it seemed that what we had Ijoth to say might take up some time. 
I told him I was going to the Englishmen's plantations, and asked him 
to go with me, and we might disc.'Jurse of it by the way. He told me 
he would the more willingly wait on me thither, because there partl;y 
the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me about ; so we 
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in what 
he had to say. 

** Why then, sir," said he, "be pleased to give me leave to laj 
down a few propositions, as the foundation to what I have to say, that 
we may not differ in the gener- d principles, though we m;\j be ( i 
Bome differing opinions in the practice of particulars. First, sir. 
though v.'e differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion, and it i;; 
very unhappy it is so,e8peciall3' i.i the case before us, as I shall show 
afterward, yet there are some gi'neral principles in which we hot: 
agree, viz. : tha-t there is a God ; and that this God having given u. 
some stated general rules foroui- service and obedience, we ought not 
willingly and knowingly to offei.d him, either by neglecting to do 
what he has commanded, or bv doing what he has expressly for- 
bidden; and let our different rell' ions be what they will, this general 
principle is read'ly owned by all, that the blessing of God does not 
ordinarily follow presumptuous sinning against his command ; and 
every good Christian will be affrctionately concerned to prevent any 
that are under his care living in a total neglect of Goi and his com- 
mands. It is not your men bein,"' Protestants, whatever my opinion 
may bo of such, that discbarges n-c from being concerned for their souls, 
and from endeavoring, if it lies before me, that they should Utb in aa

littlfe didtanc© from enmity with Ibeir MaJter as possible, espeoially, if 
you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit." 

I could not yot imagine what be aimed at, and told him I granted 
all be had eaid, and thanked him that he would so far concern himeelf 
for us ; and begged he would explain the particulars of what he had 
•bberved, that, like Joshua, to take liis own parable, I might put away 
the accursed tiling from us. 

" Why then, sir," says he, " I will take the liberty you give me; 
and there are three things, which^if I am right, must stand in the 
way of God's blessing upon your endeavors here, and which I Khould 
rejoice, for your sake, and their own, to see removed; and, sir, I 
promise myself that you will fully agree with me in them all, as soon 
as I name them ; especially because I shall convince you that every 
one of them may, with great ease, and very much to your satisfaction, 
be remedied. First, sir," says he, " you have here four Englishmen, 
who have fetched women from among the savages, and have taken 
them as their wives, and have had many children by them all, and yet 
are not married to them after any stated legal manner, as the laws of 
God and man require ; and therefore are yet, in the sense of both, no 
less than fornicators, if not living in adultery. To tliis, sir, I know 
you will object that there was no clergyman or priest of any kind, or 
of any profession, to perform the ceremony ; nor any pen and ink, or 
paper, to write down a contract of marriage, and have it signed be- 
tween them ; and I know, also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has 
told you, I mean, of the agreement that he ©bilged them to make 
when they took these women, viz. : that they should choose them out 
by consent, and keep separately to them, which, by the way, is 
nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the women, as wives, but 
only an agreement among themselves, to keep them from quarrelling. 
But, sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony (so he called it, 
being a Roman) consists not only in the mutual consent of the parties 
to take one another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obli- 
gation that there is in the contract, to compel the man and woman, 
ftt all times to own and acknowledge each other ; obhging the man to ab- 
stain from all other women, to engage in no other contract while 
these subsist, and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide 
honestly for them and their children ; and to oblige the women to the 
same, or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side. Now., Blr." 
■ays he, " these men may, when they please, or when occasion pre- 
Bentfl, abandon these women; disown their children, leave them to 
fvei^ aa«l take otbar wpraan, and marry them while thew ^r*

living /' aad hero he added, with seme wawuth, " how, sir, is God 
honored in this unlawful liberty ? and how shall a blessing succeed 
your endeavors in this place, however good in themselves, and how- 
ever sincere iu your design, while these men, who at present are your 
subjects, under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed 
by you to live in open adultery ?" 

I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more with th« 
convincing arguments he supported it with ; for it was certainly true, 
that though they had no clergyman upon the spot, yet a formal con- 
tract on both sides, made before witnesses and confirmed by any 
token which they had all agi-eed to be bound by, though it had been 
but breaking a stick between them, engaging tlie men to own these 
women for their wives upon all occasions, and never to abandon them 
or their children, and the women to the same with their husbands, 
had been an effectual lawful marriage iu the sight of God ; and it was 
a great neglect that it was not done. But I thought to have got off 
my young priest by telling him that all that part was done when I 
was not hero ; and they had lived so many years with them now, that 
if it was adultery, it was pa?t remedy; they could do nothing in it 
now. 

" Sir/' says h«, " asking your pardon for such freedom, you are 
right in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could not be 
charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech you, flatter not 
yourself that you are not therefore under an obligation to do your 
utmost now to put an end to it. How can you think but that, let the 
time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt, for the future, vrill lie en- 
tirely upon you? because it is certainly in your power now to put an 
end to it, and in nobody's power but yours." 

I was so dull still, that I did not take him right ; but I imagined 
that, by putting an end to it, he meant that I should part them, and 
not to suffer tliem to live together any longer ; and I said to him I 
could not do that, by any means, for that it would put the whole 
island into confusion. He seemed surprised that I should so far mis- 
take him. " No, sir," says he, " I do not mean that you should now 
separate them, but legally and effectually marry them now ) and as, 
sir, my way of marrying them may not be easy to reconcile them to, 
though it will be effectual by your own laws, so your way may be aa 
well before God, and as valid among men ; I mean, by a written con- 
tract signed by both man and woman, and by all witnesses present 
which all the laws of Europe would decree to be valid.

veal, besides the unusual impa^ttalily in his dlacoutMe &• kr hk own 
party or church, and such «^r-ut» warmth for preserving the people that 
he had no knowledge o^ ^r relation to ; I say, for preserving them 
from transgressing iho laws of God, the like of which I had indeed 
not met with anywhere : but, recoUectiug what he had said of marry- 
ing them by a written contract, which I knew he would stand to, I 
returned It baok upon him, and told him, I granted all that he had 
Said to be ju't, and on his part very kind; that I would discourse 
With the men upon the point now, when I came to them ; and I knew 
bo reason why they should scruple to let him marry tbem all, which 
I knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in 
England as if they were married by one of our own clergymen. 
What was afterward done in this matter, I shall speak of by itself. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which 
he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much bis debtor for 
the first, and thanked him heartily for it. He told me he would uw 
the same freedom and plainness in the second, ant? hoped I woull 
taie it as well; and this was, that, notwithstanding these Englibh sub- 
jects of mine, as he called them, had lived with those women for 
almost seven years, had taught them to speak English, and even to 
read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable 
understanding, and capable of instruction, yet they had not, to this 
hour, taught them anything of the Christian religion, no, not as much 
as to know that there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner 
God was to be served ; or that their own idolatry, and worshipping 
they knew not whom, was false and absurd. This, he said, was ai 
unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly call thear to an 
account for, and perhaps, at last, take the work out of their hands. 
He spoke this very affectionately and warmly. " I am persuaded,'* 
says he, " had those men lived in the savage country whence theii 
wives came, the savages would have taken more pains to have brought 
them to be idolaters, and to worship the detil, than any of these men, 
BO far as I can see, have taken with them to teach them the knowledge 
of the true God. Now, sir," said be, ^ though I do not acknowledge 
your religion, or you mine, yet we would bo glad to see the devil's 
servants, and the subjects of his kingdom, taught to know the general 
prijciples of the Christian religion : that they might, at least, hear 
of God and a Redeemer, and of the resurrection, and of a future 
state — things which we all believe ; they would have, at least, been 
80 much nearer corning into the bosom of the true church than tb«y

i could hold no longer; I took him ia my arms, and embraced him 
with an excess of paeeion, " How far," said I to him, " have I been 
from understanding the most essential part of a Christian ? viz., to 
love the interest of the Christian church, and the good of other raen'a 
aouls : I scarce have known what belongs to the being of a Chrietian." 
* 0, sir, do not say so," replied he ; " this thing is not your fault." 
'■>■ No," eaid I ; " but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you ?" 
-" It i» not too late yet," said he ; " be not too forward to condemn 
yourself." " But what can be done now ?" said I ; '•' you see I am 
going away.''^ " Will you give me leave to talk with these poor men 
about it ?" " Yes, with all my heart," said I : " and will oblige them 
to give heed to what ycu say, too." " As to thai," said he, '' we must 
leave them to the mercy of Christ ; but it is your business to assist 
them, encourage them, and instruct them ; and if you give me leave, 
*nd God his blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall 
loe brought home to the great circle of Christianity, if not into the 
particular faith we all embrace, and that even while you stay here." 
Upon this I said, " I shall not only give you leave, but give you a 
>houaand thanks for it." What followed on this account I shall men- 
tion also again in its place. 

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame. 
" Why, really," says he, " it is of the same nature ; and I will proceed, 
rtsking your leave, with the same plainness as before ; it is about your 
■^oor savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered subjects. It is 
a maxim, sir, that is, or ought to be, received among all Christians, 
of what church or pretended church soever, viz., The Christian knowl* 
adge ought to be propagated by all possible means, and upon all pos- 
sible occasions. It is on this principle that our church sends mis- 
sicnaries into Persia, India, China ; and that our clergy, even of thft 
superior sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and 
most dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians, to teach 
tiiem the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to em^. 
oiace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such an opportanity 
here to have six or seven and thirty poor savages brought over from 
idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I 
wonder how jou can pass such an occasion of doing good, which is 
really worth the exjsenso of a man's whole life.'' 

I was now struck dumb, indeed, and had not one word to say. I 
had/hcre a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion before 
lid, iet his particular principles be of what kind soever : as for me, I 
hM cat 30 much as entertaiacd a thout^ht of this ia dmt heart befoM^

and I believe I should not have thought of ii; for I looked upoii 
these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we any work for them 
to do, we Avould have used as such, or would have been glad to liav« 
transported them to any other part of the world : for our busiuesn 
Avas to get rid of them ; and we Avould all have been satisfied if thej 
had been sent to any country, so they had never seen their own. But

what answer to make him. 

Ho looked earne!?tly at me, seeing me in some disorder — " Sir,' says 
he, " I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you any offence." 
" No, no,'' said I, " I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am 
perfectly coufouuded, not only to think that I should never take any 
notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice I am able to take 
of it now. You know, sir," said I, '' what circumstances I am in ; I 
am bound to the East Indies iu a ship freighted by merchants, and to 
■whom it would bo an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their 
ship here, the men lying all this while at victuals and wages on the 
owners' account. It is true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, 
and if I stay more, I must pay three pounds sterling per diem 
demurrage ; nor can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more, 
and I have been here tliirteen already ; so that I am perfectly unabla 
to engage in this work, unless I would suffer myself to be left behind 
here again ; in which case, if this single ship should miscarry in any 
part of her voyage, I should be just in the same condition that I •was 
left in here, at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully de- 
livered." He owned the case was very hard upon me, as to my 
voyage ; but laid it homo upon my conscience, whether the blessing 
of saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had in the 
world for. I was not so sensible of that as he was. I returned npoa 
him thus: " Whj', sir. it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an iustru- 
ment in God's hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to the knowlodgs 
of Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given over to ihe 
■work, 80 that it seems so naturally to fall into the way of your pro- 
fession, how is it then that you do not rather offer yourself to andw- 
take it, than press me to do it ?" 

Upon this ho faced about just before me, as he walked along, and 
putting me to a full stop, made mc a very low bow. " I most heartily 
thank God, and you sir," said he^ " for giving me so evident a call to 
BO olossed a work; and if you think yourself discharged from it, 
and dosir© mo to undertiike it, I will most readily do it, and think it a

ilisappoiuted voyag(fesI have met with, that I am dropped at last 
into 80 glorious a work.'* / 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to 
me ; his eye sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his color came and 
"went, as if he had been falling into fits ; In a word, he was fired with 
the joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a considerable 
while before I could tell what to say to him; for I was really sur. 
prised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal, and carried out in his 
seal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his profession only, but 
even of any profession whatsoever. But after I had considered it 
awhile, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would 
venture, on the single consideration of an attempt on those poor peo- 
ple, to be looked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his life, and 
at last might not know whether he should be able to do them good 
or not. 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a venture. 
*• Pray, sir," said he, " what do you think I consented to go in your 
ship to the East Indies-for V " Nay," said I, *' that I know not unless 
it was to preach to the Indians." " Doubtless it was," said he ; '' and 
do you think, if I can convert these thirty-seven men to the faith of 
Jesus Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should never be fetched 
off the island again ? Nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save 
BO many souls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the same 
profession ? Yes, sir," says he, " I would give Christ and the blessed 
Virgin thanks all my days, if I could be made the least happy instru- 
ment of saving the souls of those poor men, though I were never t« 
set my foot off this island, or see my native country any more. 
But since you will honor me with putting me into this work, for which 
I will pray for you all the days of my life, I have one humble peti- 
tion to you besides." '•' What is that ?" said I. " "Why," says he, 
• it is, that you will leave your man Friday with me, to be my inter- 
preter to them, and to assist me ; for without some help I cannot 
speak to them, or they to me." 

I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could not 
think of parting with him, and that for many reasons : he had been 
the companion of my travels ; he was not only faithful to me, but 
sincerely affectionate to the last degree ; and I had resolved to do 
something cxmsiderable for him if he outlived mc, as it was probable 
he would. Then I knew, that as I had bred Friday up to be a Protes- 
tant, it would qvtite confound him to bring him to embrace another 
profession j »n<J he wonid never, while hia e^'es were open, believe 



350 ADVEKTtmES OF 

thafc his old master was a heretic, and would b« damned ; and this 
might, in the end, ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so turn him 
back again to his first idolatry. However, a suddon thought relieved 
me in this strait, and it was this : I told him, " I coiUd not say that I 
was willing to part with Friday on any accoun!; whatever, though a 
work that, to him, was of more value than his lifo^ ought to he of 
much more value than the keeping or parting of a servant. But, on 
the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no means agree 
to part with me ; and I could not force him to it without hie con- 
sent, without manifest injustice; because I had promised I would 
never put him away, and he had promised and engaged to me that h« 
would never leave me unless I put him away." 

He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational access 
to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of their 
language, nor they one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told 
him '' Fi'iday's father had learned Spanish, which I found he also un- 
derstood, and he should serve him as an interpreter." So he was 
much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him but he would 
stay and endeavor to convert them ; but Providence gave another very 
happy turn to all this. 

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we came 
to the Englishmen, I sent for them altogether, and after some account 
given them of what I had done for them^ viz., what necessary things 1 
had provided for them, and how they were distributed, which they 
were sensible of, and %'ery thankful for, I began to talk to them of 
the very scandalous life they led, and gave them a full account of the 
notice the clergyman had taken of it ; and arguing how unchristian 
And iireligious a life it was, I first asked them if they were married 
men or bachelors ? They soon explained their condition to me, and 
showed that two of them were widowers, and the other three were 
angle men or bachelors. I ashed them with what conscience they 
could take these women, and lie with them as they had done, o&ll 
them their wives, and have so many children by them, and not bo 
lawfully mrrried to them ? 

They all gave me the answer I expected, viz., that there was nobody 
to marry them ; that they agreed, before the governo'., to keep them 
as their wives, and to maintain them and own them as their wives, 
and they thought, as things stood with theui, they were as legally 
married as if they had been married by a parson, and with aH the 
foTmalities in the world. 

\ told tbem that qo doubt they wero married ia. tli« tf!ght of Q«(^ 



&i»4 wera boTjnd in conscfenee to keep them as their wive? ; but that 
the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women 
and children hereafter; and that their wivea being poor desolate 
women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help them- 
selves. I therefore told them that unless I was assured of their hon- 
98* intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take care that what 
I did should be for the women and children without them; and tha^ 
unless they would give me some assurances that they would marrj 
the women, I could not think it was convenient they should continua 
together as man and wife; for it was both scandalous to men and 
offensive to God, who they could not think would bless them if they 
>yeut on thus. 

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, especially Will 
Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their 
Vvives as well as if they bad been born in their own native country, 
imd would not leave them upon any account whatever ; and they did 
verily believe that their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and 
did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and for their chil- 
dren, as any women could possibly do; and they would not part with 
(hem on any account; and Will Atkins, for his own particular added, 
(hat if any man would take him away, and offer to carry him home 
to England, and make him captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, 
he would not go with him, if he might not carry his wife and children 
with him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he would be 
married to her now, with all his heart. 

This was just as I would have it ; the priest was not witn me at 
that moment, but was not far off: so, to try him further, I told him I 
had a clergytjan with me, and. if he was sincere, I would have him 
married next morning, and bade him consider of it, and talk with the 
re«fc. He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it at all, for he 
was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a minister with me, and 
be believed they would be all willing also. I then told him that my 
friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and could not speak English, 
but I would act as the clerk between them. He never so much as 
asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was, indeed, 
what I was afraid of; so we parted ; I went back to my clergyman, 
and Will Atkins went in to talk with his companions. I desired the 
French gentleman not to say auytliing to them till the business waf 
thoroughly ripe ; and I told him what answer the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter they all oame to me, and told m© 
the.y had been considering wiiat I ka<l saidj that they were elad to 



352 AJJVENTUKES 01' 

lieai I bad a clergyman in my company, and they ware very wiiiu%g 
to jrive me the satisfaction I desired, and to be formally married M 
Foou as I pleased ; for they were far from desiring to part with th«or 
wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very honest vhvt 
they chose them. So 1 appointed them to meet mo the nest mora* 
ing, and in the meantime they should let their wives know the mdao^ 
ing of the marriage law, and that it was not only to prevent any 
scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake them, 
whatever might happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing 
and were very well satisfied with it, as indeed they had reason to bo; 
BO they failed not to attend all together at my apartment, next morn- 
ing, where I brought out my clergyman, and though he had not on a 
minister's gown, after the manner of England, or the babit of a priest, 
after the manner of France, yet having a black vest something like a 
cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very unlike a minister ; 
and, as for his language, I was bis interpreter. But the sorionsoess 
of his behavior t© them, and the scruple he made of marrying the 
■women, because they were not baptized and professed Christiana, 
gave them an exceeding reverence for his person, and there was no 
need, after that, to inquire whether he was a clergyman or not. In- 
deed, I was afraid his scruples would have been carried so far as that 
he would not have mai-ried them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I 
was able to say to him, he resisted me, though modestly yet very 
steadily, and at last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had 
first talked with the men and the women, too, and tliough I at first 
was a little backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good wilj> 
perceiving the sincerity of his design. 

When he came to them, he let them know that I had acc^ainted 
him with their circumstances, and with the present design ; th»t he 
waa very willing to perform that part of his function, and marry 
them, as I had desired, but that before he could do it he must tak« 
the liberty to talk with them. He told them that, in the sight of all 
indifferent men, and in the sense of the laws of society, they had lived 
all this while in open fornication, and that it was true that notliing 
but the consenting to marry, or effectually separating them from one 
another, could now put an end to it ; but there was a diflBculty in it, 
too, with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, which he was 
rot fully satisfied about, vix,, (hat of marrying one that is a profos-ged 
Ohristian to a savage,- an idol;it<^r. and a heathen, one that is not bap- 
tised: and yet that he did not sec that there was time left to endeavor 



BOBINSON CRUSOE!. 353 

to pareuade the women to bo baptized, or to profess the name of 
Christ, -whom they had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without 
which they could not be baptized. He told them he doubted they 
were but indifferent Christians themselves ; that they had but little 
knowledge of God or of his ways, and therefore he could not expect 
that they had said much to their wives on that head yet ; but that, 
unless they would promise him to use their endeavors with their wives 
to persuade them to become Christians, and would, as well as they 
could, instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made 
them, and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not 
marry them, for he would have no hand in joining Christians with say- 
ages, nor was it consistent with the principles of the Christian re- 
ligion, and was indeed expressly forbidden in God's law. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very faiths 
fully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I could, only 
sometimes adding something of my own, to convince them how just it 
was, and how I was of his mind; and I always very faithfully distin- 
guished between what I said from myself and what were the clergy- 
man's words. They told me it was very true what the gentleman 
said ; that they were very indifferent Christians themselves, and tha^ 
they had never talked to their wives about religion. " Lord, sir," 
says Will Atkins, '-how should we teach them religion? why, we 
know nothing ourselves ; and, besides, sir," said he, " should we talk 
to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven, and hell, it would 
make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves. And 
if we should tell them that we believe all the things we speak of to 
them, such as of good people going to heaven, and wicked people to 
the devil, they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves, that be_ 
lieve all this, and are such wicked fellows, as we indeed are. Why 
sir, 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing ; folkt 
must have some religion themselves before they pretend to teach other 
people." "Will Atkins,'' said I to him, "though I am afraid that 
what you say has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your wife 
that she is in the wrong ; that there is a God, and a religion better 
than her own ; that her gods are idols ; that they can neither hear 
nor speak ; that there is a great Being that made all things, and that 
can destroy all that he has made ; that he rewards the good and pun- 
ishes the bad, and that we are to be judged by him at last for all we 
do here ? You are not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach 
you that all this is true ; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, 
itftd believe it joureelf." " That b true, Bir," said Atkins. « but with 



J44 A&VBNTUBBS O^ 

whftt face can I say mythiDg to iny ■wife of all thia, when she vili 
tell m« immwliately it cannot be true V '•' Not trne !'' said I; "what 
do you mean by that ?" " Why, sir," said he, " she will tell me it 
cannot be true that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or can 
punish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, that 
have been such a wicked creature as she knows I have been, even to 
her and to everybody else ; and that I should be suffered to live, thai 
have been always acting so contrary to what I must tell her is goo^ 
and to what I ought to have done." " Why, truly, Atkins," said I, " I 
am afraid thou speakest too much truth;" and with that I informed 
the clergyman of what Atkins had said, for he was impatient to know. 
** Oh," said the priest, " tell him there is one thing will make him the 
best minister in the world to his wife, and tliat is repentance, for none 
teach repentance like true penitents. He wants nothing but to re- 
pent, and then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct his 
wife ; he will then be able to tell her that ihere is not only a God, 
and that he is the just rewarder of good and evil, but that he is a mer- 
ciful Being, and with infinite goodness and long-suffering, forbears to 
punish those that offend; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the 
death of a sinner, but rather that he should return and live ; and often- 
times he Buffers wicked men to go a long time, and even reserves 
damnation to the general day of retribution ; that it is a clear evi- 
dence of God, and of a future state, that righteous men receive not 
their reward, or wioked men their ]iunishment, till they come into an- 
other world ; and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of 
ttie resurrection and of the last judgment. Let him but repent 
for himself, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his 
wife." 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the while, 
and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily affected 
with it; when, being eager, and hardly suffering me to make an end; 
" I know all thi?; master," says he, " and a great deal more; but I 
have not the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when God and my 
conscience know, and my wife will bo an undeniable evidence against 
me, that I have lived as if I had never heard of a God, or a futur» 
state, or anything about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas.'" (and 
with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that the tears stood 
in his eyes) "'tis past all that with me." " Past it, Atkins ?" said I; 
•'what dost thou mean by that?'' "I know well enough what I 
mean," says he; "I mean 'tia too late, and that is too true. 

J *old the clergyman, word for word, what h« said : the poor aeal-

oun prieefc — I must call him bo, for, be his opinion what ifc will, lie had 
certaiuly a most singular affection for the good of other men's souls, 
and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own — I say, 
this affectionate man could not refrain from tears ; but, recovering 
<»im8elf, said to me, "Ask him but one question: is he easy that it ifl 
too late; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so?" I put tbe 
question fairly to Atkins ; and he answered with a great deal of pas- 
uion, " How could any man he easy in a condition that must certainly 
end in eternal destruction ? tha^ he was far from being easy ; but 
that, on the contrary, he believed he would, one time or other, ruin 
him." " What do you mean by that V said I. " Why/' he said, " he 
believed he should one time or other cut his throat, to put an end to 
ihe terror of it." 

The clergyman shook his head with great concern in his face, when 
I told him all this ; but turning quick to me upon it, says, " If that be 
his case, we may assure him it is not too late ; Christ will give him 
repentance. But pray, says he, " explain this to him: that as no 
mao is saved but by Chris*"-, and the merit of his passion procuring 
divine mercy for him, how can it too late for any man to receive 
mercy ? Does he think he is able to sm beyond his power or reach 
ef divine mercy ? Pray tell him, there may be a time when pro. 
Yoked mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear, 
but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy ; and we, that are 
Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent : so that it is 
never too late to repent." 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness ; but 
it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest, for he said to 
oie, he would go and have some talk with his wife ; so he went out 
awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly- 
ignorant as to matters of relig'on, as much as I was when I went 
rambling away from my father ; and yet there were none of thens 
backward to hear what had been said ; and all of them seriously 
\jromlsed that they would talk with their wives about it^ and do their 
endeavors to persuade them to turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me when T reported whac answer they 
gave, but said nothing a good while ; but at last, shaking his head, 
"We that are Christ's servants," says he, '' can go no farther than to 
exhort and instruct ; and when men comply, submit to the reproof, 
and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do ; wc are bound to accept 
their good words ; but, believe jne, sir,'' said he, " whatever yott may 



55€ ADTKNTUEES Or 

have known of th« life of that man you call Will Atkins, I believe h* 
IB th« only sincere convert among tliem : I take that man to he a true 
penitent: I will not despair of the rest; but that man is apparently 
struck -with the sense of hia past life, and I doubt not, when he eomes 
to talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it: 
fcr attempting to teaoh others is sometimea the best way of teaching 
©urselves I know a man, who, having nothing but a summary no- 
tion of religion himself, and being wicked and profligate to the last 
degree in his life, made a thorough reformation in himself by laboring 
to convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk 
Beriously of Jesus Christ to his wife, my Ufe for it, he talks himself 
into a thorough convert, makes himself a penitent ", and who knows 
what may follow ?'' 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to en- 
deavor to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he married 
the other two couple ; but Will Atkins and liis wife were not yet como 
in. After this, my clergyman waiting awhile, was curious to know 
where Atkins was gone ; and turning to me, said, " I entreat you, sir, 
let us walk out of your labyrinth here, and look ; I dare say we shaH 
find this poor man Romewhere or other talking seriously to his wife, 
and teaching her already something of religion." I began to be of 
the same mind; so we went out together, and I ca»ried him a way 
^hich none knew but myself, and where the trees were so very thick 
that it was not easy to Bee through the thicket of leaves, and far 
harder to see in than to see out ; when coming to the edge of the 
•wood, I saw Atkins and his tawny wife sitting under the shade of a 
hush, very eager in discourse ; I stopped short till my clergyman 
oame up to me, and then having showed him where they were, wo 
stood and looked very 8t«adily at them a good while. We observed 
Sum vesry earnest with her, pointing up to the sun, and to every quarter 
•f the heavens, and then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then 
to himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees. " Now," says tbo 
clergyman, " you see my words are made good, the man preaches to 
her ; mark him now, ho is telling her that our God has made him and 
her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c." 
" I believe he is," said I. Immediately we perceived Will Atkins 
Btart upon his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up both his hands. 
Wo supposed ho said something, but we could not hear him ; it was 
xoo fur for that. Ho did not continue kneeling half a minute, but 
eomee and sits down by his wife, and talks to her again ; we per- 
ceived then tho womaa very attentive, hut whether she said anythinjf,

both that we were not near enough to hear anything that passed b«- 
tw«en them. Well, howevex", we could come no nearer, for fear of 
distarbing them; so we resolved to see an oad to this piece of artiU 
aonvensatioa, and it spoke loud enough to ua without the help of voiw. 
H« sat down again, as I have said, close J)y her, and talked again 
aarnestiy to her, and two or three times wd^ could see him embrao© 
her most passionately ; another time we saw hira take out his haod 
keroluef and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, with a kind of 
transport veiy unusual ; and after sevei*al of thoBe things, we saw him 
on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his hand to help her up,, 
when immediately leading her by the band a step or twt», fiiey both 
kneeled down together, and continued so about two minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, " St Paul! 
St. Paul ! behold he prayeth," I was afraid Atkins would hear him, 
therefore I entreated him to withhold himself awhile, that wo might 
gee Rn end of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the most 
affecting that I ever saw in my life Well, he strove with himself for 
awhile, but was in .«uch raptures to think that the poor heathen 
woman was become b Christian, that he was not able to contain him- 
eelf ; he wept several times, then throAving up his hands and crossing 
his Ircpst, said over several things ejaculatory, and by way of giving 
God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of our en- 
deavors; some he spoke softly, and I could not well hear others; 
BOtae in Latin, some in French ; then two or three times the tears 
would interrupt him, that he could not speak at nil -, but I begged 
that he would contoin himself, and let us more nan-owly and fully ob- 
B«rve what was before us, which he did for a time, the scene not being 
near ended yet ; for after the poor man and his wife were risen agaic 
from thoir knees, we observed he stood t&lkiug still eagerly to her, 
and w© observed her motion, that she was gi-eatly affected with what 
he said, by her frequently lifting up her hands, laying her hands t© 
her breast, and such other postures as express the greatest serioasne« 
and attention : this continued about half a quarter of an hour, anA 
then they walked away ; so we could see no more of them in that 
eitudtion. I tvok this interval to talk with my clergyman ; and first, 
I was glad to SfcC the particulars we had both been witnesses to, that,

To this he answered, with abundance of candor, thus : " Sir, I am a 
Catholic of the Roman church, and a priest of the order of St. Bene- 
dict, and I embrace all the principles of the Romau faith ; but yet, if 
you will believe me, and that I do not speak in compliment to you, or 
in respect to my circumstances and your civilities ; I say, ne\ ertheless, 
I do not look upon you who call yourselves reformed, without som© 
charity : I dare not say (tnough I know it is our opinion in general) 
that you cannot be saved ; 1 will by no means Ihuit the mercy of 
Christ HO far as to think that he cannot receive you into the bosom of 
his church, in a manuer to us unperceivablo ; and I hope you have the 
same charity for us ; I pray daily for your being all restored to 
Christ's church, by whatsoever method He, who is all-wise, is plea^fed^ 
to direct. In the meantime, sure you will allow it consists with me, 
as a Roman, to distinguish far between a Protestant and a pagan; be- 
tween one that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not 
think is according to the true fhith, and a savage or a barbarian, that 
knows no God, no Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the 
pale of the Catholic church, we hope you are nearer being restored to 
it than those who know nothing of God or of his church : and I re- 
joice, therefore, when I see this poor man, who, you say, has been a 
profligate, and almost a murderei", kneel down and pray to Jesus 
Ci»m^ as we suppose ke did, thouel* uot fully enlightened ; believing 



that G«d, from wiiOHi wery ench wotk pioceeds, wtll eensibly toach 
his heart, aad Irriug him to the further knowledge of tbut truth iu his 
own time; and if God ehall influence this poor man to convert and 
instruct the ignorant savage, his wife^ I can never believe that ho shall 
be cast away himself. And have I not reason, then, to rejoice, the 
nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they may 
not be brought quite home into the bosom of the Catholic church just 
at the time when I may desire it, leading it to the goodness of Christ 
to perfect his work in his own time, and in his own way ? Certainly, 
I wonld rejoice if all the savages in America were brought, like this 
poor woman, to pray to God, though they were all to bo Protestants 
at first, rather than they should continue pagans or heathens ; firmly 
believing, that he that had bestowed the first light to them would 
farther illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and brin^ 
them into the pale of his church, when he should see good. 




Atldns relates his Conversation witli Ms Wife — The Latter Baptized oj tne 
Priest— Aeconnt of the Starving State of those on Board the R;scu.d Vtssol 
— Eobinson's D.parturo from the Island. 

Was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this pioua 
papist, a$ much as I was oppressed by the power of liia rca^ 
soniiig, and it presently occun-cd to my thoughts, that if such 
a temper was universal, we might all be Catholic Christians, 
whatever church or particular profession we joined in; that a spirit 
of charity would soon work us all up into right principles; and as he 
thought that the like charity would make us all Catholics, so I told 
him I believed had all the members of his church tholike moderation, 
they would soon all be Protestants. And there we left that part j for 
we never disputed at all. 

However, I talked to him another way, and taking him by the hand, 
** Jly friend," says I, " I wish all the clergy of the Romish church 
were blest with such moderation, and had an equal share of your 
charity. I am entirely of your opinion; but I must tell you, that if 
you should preach such doctrine in Ppain or Italy, they would put 
Voi? into the InauiBition." •' It may bo so," said he : " I know not

•what thej would do la Spaio ox Italy ; but I wUi ftot say tiiey woajui 
ba the bettor Chi-istians for that eevority; for I am sure thero is no 
heresy in abouudiag with chaiity."' 

As Will Atkins and Lis wifo Avere gone, oui buisiness there wa* 
over, so we -went back our own way ; and when we came b&ok, we 
found them waiting to be called in j observing this, I asked my clergy- 
)&an if we should dijscover to him that we had eoea him under the 
bush or not ; and it was his opinion we ehould not, but that wo shoald 
talk to him first, and hear what he would say to us; so we called him 
in alone, nobody being in the plaoe but oursclres, and I began wiih 
him ihua : 

'' Will Atkins," said I, " prithee what education had you ? What 
Vraa your father ?" 

W. A. A better man than ever I shall be, sir ; my father wiw a 
clergyman. 

R. C. What education did he give you ? 

W. A. He would havo taught me well, sii* ; but I despised all edu- 
eation, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was. 

R. C. It is true, Solomon says, he that despises reproof ia brutish. 

W. A. Ay, sir, I was brutish, indeed, for I murdered my father; 
for God's sake, sir, talk no more about that ; sir, I murdered my poor 
father. 

Pa. Ha i a murderer ! 

Here the priest stai'ted (for I interpreted every word as he spoke) 
«,nd looked pale ; it seems ho believed that Will had really killed his 
lather. 

R. C. No, no, sir, I do not imderetand him so ; Will Atkins, ezplaia 
yourself; you did not kill yoiT father, did you, with yoiu: owa 
bands? 

W. A. No, sir, I did not cut hi« throat ; but I out the thread of all 
his comforts, and shortened his days ; I broke his heart by the most 
ungrateful, unnatural return, for the most tender and affeotioaate 
treatment that father ever gave, or child could receive. 

R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your father, to extort thia oqb- 
fecsion ; I pray God give you repentance for it, and forgive that and 
all your other sins ; but I asked you because I see that though you 
havo not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are in 
things that are good; that you have known more of religion, a great 
deal, than you have practiced. 

W. A. Though yo»i, sir, did not citort the confession that I mak« 
ulinnt. mv father, conscience does; and whenever wo come to l*«k 



BOBXKeOM ORUlMai. 891

taiiily the first that touch us ; the wounds thej xaaka lie dMp«8% trnd 
«h« Wffight they leave wiU lie heaviest upon the miod of all ^e §itm 
W9 oau commit. 

B. 0. You talk too feelingly and censibly tot me, AQu&f: I oaanst 
}m&T it. 

W. A. You bear it, master ; I dare say yoa know nothing of it. 

R. 0. Yes, Atkins ; every shore, every hill, nay, I may say every 
tree of this island, is witness to the anguish of my soul for my ingrati- 
tude and bad usage of a good, tender father ; a fiather much like yourt, 
by your description. And I mui'dered my father as well as you, Will 
Ati^s, but I think, fbr all that, my repentance is shorf uf yours, too, 
by a gre:*t. deal. 

I would have said more, if I could have restrained my p«uwioo« ; 
but I tliought this poor man's repentance was so much aincerer than 
mine, that I was going to leave oflF the discourse and retire, for I was 
surprised at what he had said, and thought that instead of my going 
about to teach and instruct him, this man was made a teacher and ior 
structor to me, in a most surprising and unexpected manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly affected 
with it, and said to me, " Did I not say, sir, that when this man wa* 
converted he would preac h to lu all ? I tell you, sir, if this one man 
be made a true penitent, there will be no need of me ; he wUl make 
Christiana of all in the island." But having a little composed myself 
I renewed my discourse with Will Atkins. " But, Will," said I, •• how 
comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now V 

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a dart 
through my very soul ; I have been talking about God and religioa 
to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a Christian of he* 
ta\A she has preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forg^ 
while I live. 

R. C. No, no, it is not your wife has preached to you, but when y©« 
were moving religious arguments to her, conscience has flung th«Bi 
]bac/k upon you. 

W. A. Ay, sir, with such force as is not to be resisted. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between yeu aad yew 
vrtfe, for I know something of it already. 

^- A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a lull account of it ; I am 
too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express it ; but let h«p 
have said what she will, and though I cannot give you an acoount of 
it. tki« I can t»ll you, I hare resolved to amend and reform my li£s> 



S^ Al > VE N T tr RES OT 

R. C. But tell us Bome of it ; how did you begin, Will ? for this hta 
been an extraordinary case, that is certain. She has preached a ser- 
mon, indeed, if she has ^vrought this upon you. 

W. A. Wh3% I first told her the nature of our laws about marriage, 
and what the reafious -were that men and women were obliged to eater 
into such compacts as it was neither in the power of one nor other to 
break; that, othervi-ise, order and justice could not be maintixiaed, 
and men would run from their wives, and abandon their children, 
mis confusedly with one another, and neither fiimilies be kept entir», 
nor inheritances bo settled by legal descent. 

n. C. You talk like a civilian, AVill. Could you make her underv 
stand what you meant by inheritance and families? They know no 
such things among the savages, but marry any how, without regard 
to relation, consanguinity, or family — brother and sister, nay, aa I 
have been told, oven the father and the daughter, and the eon and tho 
mother. 

"W. A. I believe, sir, yon aro misinformed, and my wife assures m« 
of the contrary, and that they avjhor it: perhaps, for any farther rela- 
tions, they may not be so exact as we are ; but, she tells me, they never 
touch one another in the near relationship you speak of. 

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her ? 

W. A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much better thaji 
in her country. 

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage waa ? 

\V. A. Ay, ay ; there began our dialogue. I asked her if she would 
be married to me our way. She asked me what way that was. I 
told her marriage was appointed by God ; and here we bad a strange 
tr.lk together, indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe. 

N. B. This dialogue between "Will Atkins and hia wife I took down 
in writing, just after he had told it me, which was as follows : 

Wife. Appointed Dy God ! Why, have you a God in your country ? 

W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country. 

Wife. No your God in my country ; my country have the great 
old Cenamuckee God. 

W. A. Child, I am very unfit to shoTT you who God is. God is in 
heaven, and made tho heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that ia 
them is. 

Wife, No makeo do earth; no you God makee all earth ; no makw 
tny country. 

Will Atkins langhed a little at her expmsxon Mi God not makisg 
her country.

Wira. No laugh ; why laugh me ? This nothing to laupjh. 

He was justly reproved by his wife, for she waj more serious than 
he at £rst. 

W. A. That's true, indeed ; I will not laugh any more, my dear. 

Wife. Why you say you God makee all ? 

W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, and you and ma 
and all things ; for he is the only true God, and there is no God but 
him ; he lives forever in heaven. 

Wife. "Why you no tell me long ago ? 

W. A. That's true, indeed ; but I have been a wicked wretch, and 
have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with anything before, bat 
have lived without God in the world myself. 

Wife. What I have you a great God in y.'^ur country, you no know 
him ? Go say to him ? No do good thing for him ? That no 
possible. 

W. A. It is true ; though, for all that, we live as if there was n« 
God in heaven, or that ho had no power on earth. 

Wife. But why God let you do so ? Why he no makee you good 
live ? 

W. A. It is all our own fault. 

Wife. But you say me ho is great, much great, have much greut 
power, can makee kill when he will, why he no m^ee kill when you 
no serve him, no say to him, no be good mans? 

W. A. That is true, ha might strike me dead; and I ought to ex.* 
pect it, for I have been a wicked wretch, that is true ; but God is mer* 
ciful, and does not deal with us as we deserve. 

Wife. But then you do not tell God thankee for that, too ? 

W. A. No, indeed, I have not thanked God for his mercy any mor9 
than I have feared God for his power. 

Wife. Then you God no God : me no think believe ho be such one, 
great much power, strong ; no makee kill you, though you make him 
BO much angry. 

W. A. What, will my wicked life hinder you from believing in 
God ? What a dreadful creature am I ! and what a sad truth it is, 
that the horrid lives of Christians hinder tho conversion of heathens! 

Wife. IIow me think you have great much God up there (she points 
np to heaven) and yet no do well, no do good thing ? Can ho tell ? Suro 
he no tell what you do ? 

W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things ; he hears us speak, 
sees what we do. knows what we think, though we do not ppeak. 

Wws. What ! he ao hQ9t jsrou curse, swear, speak de gxe-»% iaxos. ?

W. A, Ym, yM, heari it all.

"W. A. He is merciful, that is all we can aay for it ; aud this protwa 
Mira to be the true God : he is God and not man, and therefora >Ye are

Here Will Atkins told us he was Btruck with horror, to think ho\r 
jie oould tell hb wife so clearly that God sees, and hear* aad knowe 
the secret thoughts of the heart, and all that we doj aud yefc t'lat he 
kad dared to do all the vile things he had done. 

Wife. Merciful I What you call that ? 

W. A. He is our father and maker, and he pities and spares as. 

Wira. So then he never makee kill, never angry when you do wick 
•d ; then he no good himself, Of no great able. 

W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he is infinitely good and infinitely great, 
idid able to punish too ; and sometimes to show his justice and ven- 
geance, he lets By his auger to destroy sinners and make examples; 
taany are out off in their sins. 

WiFB. But no makee kill you yet ; then he tell you, may be, that 
he no makee you kill ; so you makee de bargain with him, you do 
bad thing, he no be angry at you wl en he be angry at other mans. 

W. A. No, indeed ; my sins are all presumptions upon his good- 
ness ; and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me, as be has 
^ne other men. 

Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead ; what you tay to 
him for that ? You no tell him thankee for all that too ? 

W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is true. 

Wife. Why he no makee you much good better ? You say he makeo 
you. 

W. A. He made me as he made all the world; it is I have de. 
formed myself and abused his goodness^ aud made myself an abomiu' 
ftble wretch. 

Wife. I wish you makee God know me ; I no makee him angry, I 
no do bad wicked thing. 

Here Will Atkins said his heart sunk within him, to hoar a poor un- 
«aught creature desire to be taught to know God, and he such a wicked 
wretoh that he oould not say one word to her about God, but what 
the reproaoh of his own carriage would make most irrational to her 
to believe ; nay, that already she had told him that she oould not be- 
Al»ve in God, because he, that was so wicked, was not destroyed. 

W. A. My dear, you mean, yon wish I could teach you to know 
Ood, not God to know you ; for he knowi you already, aod every 
r.hniwlit lu yoar heart ' 



HOBINSON CBUiOE.^ 865 

Wipe. "Why, toen he know •what I say to you now ; h« know me 
wish to know him ; how shall me know who makee me 1 

W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee, I cannot teach thee ; X 
will pray to him to teach thee to know him, and forgive me, that am 
unworthy to teach thee. 

The poor follow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make 
her know God, and her wishing to know him, that he eaid he feU 
down on his knees before her. and prayed to God to enlighten her 
mind with the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, to pardon his eina, 
and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of instructing her 
•n the principles of religion ; after which he sat down by her again, 
ia,nd their dialogue went on. This was the time when we saw him 
kneel down, and hold up his hands. 

Wife. What you put down the knee for ? What you hold up th« 
hand for ? What you say ; Who you speak to ? What is all that ? 
' W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my submission to him 
ihat made me ; I said to him, as you call it ; and as your old meq 
do to their idol Benamuckee ; that is, I prayed to him. 

Wife. What you say to him for ? 

W. A. 1 prayed to him to open your eyes, and your understanding, 
Ihat you may know him, and be accepted by him. 

Wife. Can he do that too ? 

W. A. Yes, he can ; he can do all things. 

Wife. But now he hear what you say ? 

W. A. Yes ; ho has bid us pray to him, and promised to hear us. 

Wife. Bid you pray ? When he bid you ? How he bid you ? 
!fhat^ you hear him speak ? 

W. A. No, we do not hear him speak ; but he has revealed him- 
self many ways to us. 

Here he was at a great loss to make her understand that God baft 
revealed himself to us by his word, and what his word wasj but &% 
last he told it her thus : 

W. A. God has spoken to some good men in formsr days, «▼«• 
iVora heaven, by plain words ; and God has inspired good men by hia 
Spirit; and they have written all his laws down in a book. 

Wife. Me no understand that, where is my book ? 

W. A. Alas ! my poor creature, I have not this book ; but I ho^ 
I shall one tiuae or other get it for you, and help you to read it. 

Hero ho embraced her with great affection ; but with inexpressibla 
grief that he had not the Bible. 

Wife. But how you makee mo know that Qod te€M>he« iSnem te 
write that >»"'^i^ ' 



8W jwrvwrnnrcs of '^'^ 

W. A. Bj tlie same rule tbat we know him to he Gm. 

Wife. What rule ! what way do you know him ? 

W. A, Because he teaches and commands nothing but what is 
good, righteous, and holy, and tends to make us perfectly good. a» 
well as perfectly happy ; and beeause he forbids and commands ua to 
avoid all that is wicked, that is evU in itself, or evil in its con- 
eequence. 

Wife. That me would understand, that me fiiin see; if he teachee 
all good thing-, ho make© all good thing, he give all thing, he hear 
me when I s;iy O to him, as you do just now ; he makee me good, if 
I wish to be good ; he spare me, no makee kill me when I no be 
good : all this you say he do, yet he be great God: me take, think, 
believe him to be great God ; me say to him with you, my dear. 

Here the poor man could forbear no longer, but raised her up, 
made her kneel by him, and be prayed to God aloud to instruct her 
i» the knowledge of himself, by his Spirit; and that by some good 
providence, if possible, she might some time or other come to have a 
Bible, that she might read the word of God, and be taught by it to 
know him. This was the time that wo saw him lift her up by th-a 
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above. 

They had several other discourses, it seems, after this, too long to 
be set down here ; and particularly she made him promise, that since 
lie confessed his own life had been a wicked, abominable course of 
provocations against God, that he would reform it, and not make God 
angry any more; lest ho should make him dead, as be called it, and 
then she would be left alone, and never be taught to kno^v this God 
better; and lest ho should be miserable, as he told her wicked men 
would bo after death. 

This was a strange account, and very affecting to us both, but par- 
ticularly to the young clergyman : he was indeed wonderfully sur- 
prised with it, but under the greatest affliction imaginable that h© 
could not talk to hei-, that he could not speak English, to make her 
understand him ; and as she spoke but very broken English, ho could 
not understand lier ; hoAvcver, ho turned himself to me, and told me 
tbat bo believed tbat there nmst be more to do with this woman than 
to marry her. I did not understand him at first, but at length he 
explained himself, vix., that sho ought to bo baptized. I agreed with 
hmi in that port readily, and was for going about it presently. '• No, 
no; hold, sir," said ho; "tbouu;h T woiibl have her be baptized by all 
moans, yet I must ohservn th;it Will Atkins, her hnsl)and. has indeed 
brought her, iu a wonderful ur.winer, to bo willing to Oiubruc© *■ "*"

his power, justice, aucl mercy; yet 1 desire to kiiow oi liini, if lie baa 
fiaid auythiug to her of Jesus Clirist, and of the salvation of sinners; 
of the nature of fuith in him, aud redemption by hira ; of tlio Holy 
Spirit, the resurrection, the labt judgment, aud a future state." 

I called Will Atkins again, aud asked him; but the poor fellow^ 
fell immediately into tears, and told us he had said something to her 
of all these things, but that he was himself so wicked a creature, and 
his conscience so reproached him with his horrid ungodly life, that 
he trembled at the apprehensions that her knowledge of him should 
lessen the attention sUo should give to those things, and make her 
rather contemn religion than receive it; but be was assured, he said, 
that her mwd was so disposed to receive due impressions of all thoso 
things, and thsxt if I would but discourse with her, she would maka 
it appear to my satisiactioa that my labor would not bo lost upcB 
her. 

Accordingly, I called her in, and placing myself as interpreter bo 
tween my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him to begia 
with her; but sure such a sermon M'as never preached by a popish 
priest in these latter ages of the world ; and. as I told him, I thought 
he had all the zeai, all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian, 
without the error of a Roman Catholic : and I took him to be such a 
clergyman as the Roman Bishops were, before ihe Church of Romo 
assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men. In a word, 
ho brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of Christ, and 
of redemption by him, not with wonder and astonishment only, as sho 
did the first notions of a God, but with joy and faitii ; with an affecuoo, 
and a surprising degree of understanding, scarce to be imagined, much 
less to be expressed ; and, at her own request, she was baptized 

When he was preparing to baptize her, I entreated him that bo 
would perform that offico with some caution, that the man might not 
perceive le was of the Roman Church, if possible, because of other ill 
consequences which might attend a difference among tis in that veiy 
religion which we were instructing the other in. He told mo that as 
he had no consecrated chapel, nor proper things for the ofSce, I fehould 
see he would do it in a manner that T phould not know by it that ho 
was a Roman Catholic himself, if T had not tnown it before ; and so 
he did ; for saying only 6or*9 words over to hitncelf in Latin, which I 
oould not understand, he poured a whole dishful of water upon th« 
woman'rt head, pronourscing in French very loud ^ Marv" (which wm

hawM of. He gave the henediction afterward in Latin, but cither 
Will Atidns did not know but it was Franch, or else did not take notice 
of It at that time. 

At aoon as this waa over, we married them ; and after the marriage 
was oyer, he turned to Will Atkins, and in a very affectionate manner 
«xhorted him, not only to persevere in that good disposition he was 
In, bat to support the convictions that were upon him by a resolution 
(0 reform his Dfe ; told him it was in vain to say he had repented if 
hd did not forsake his crimes; represented to him how God had 
honored him with being the instrument of bringing his wife to the 
knowledge of the Christian religion, and that he should be careful he 
4id not dishonor the grace of God ; and that if he did, he would see 
khe heathen a better Chi-istian than himself; the savage converted, 
and the instrument thrown away. He said a great many good things 
lo them both.; and then recommending them to God's goodness, gav» 
Uiem the benediction again, I repeating everything to them in English ; 
«ad thus ended the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant and 
agreeable day to me that I ever passed in my whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts hung continu* 
ally upon the conversion of the thirty-seven savages, and fain he 
Would have stayed upon the island to have undertaken it ; but I con. 
vinced him, first, that his undertaking was impracticable in itself; 
and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it into a way of being dono 
Sn his abseuce to his satisfaction ; of which by-and-by. 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow compae^ 
t waa preparing to go on board the ship, when the young man I had 
taken out of the ^mished ship's company came to me, and told me he 
onderstood I had a clergyman with me, and that I had caused the 
JBnglishman to be married to the savages ; that ho had a match, too, 
which he desired might be finished before I went, between tw» 
Chrifltians, which he hoped would not be disagreeable t« me. 

I knew this must bo the young woman who was his mother's 
serrant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island ; so I 
began to persuade him not to do anything of that kind rashly, or be- 
oaaM ho found himself in this solitary circumstance. I represented 
to him that he had Ntsa considerable substanoe in the world, and 
good firioids, as I undtrstood by himself, and the maid also ; that the

and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would repent hi« 
choice, and the diblike of that circumstance might be disadvantageoiM 
to both. I was going to say more, but ho interrupted mc, emiling, 
and told me, with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my 
guesses ; that ho had nothing of that kind in his thoughts ; and th»t 
he waa very glad to hear that I had an intent of putting them in a 
way to see their own country again ; and nothing should have put him 
upon staying there, but that tlie voyage I was going was so exceed- 
ingly long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of the 
reach of all his friends; and that he had nothing to desire of me, but 
that I would settle him in some little property in the island where he 
was, give him a servant or two, and some few necessaries, and ha 
would settle himself here like a planter, waiting the good time wheni 
if ever I returned to England, I would redeem them; and hoped I 
would not be unmindful of him when I came to England ; that he 
would give me some letters to hia friends in London, and let them 
know how good I had been to him, and in what part of the world, 
and what circumstances I had left him in ; and he promised me that 
whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all improvements he 
had made upon it, let the value be what it would, should be wholly 
tnine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his youth, 
and was the more agreeable to me because he told me positively the 
match was not for himself. 1 gave him all possible assurances that if 
I lived to come safe to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his 
business effectually ; and that he might depend I should never forget 
the circumstances I had left him in ; but still I was impatient to know 
who was the person to be married ; upon which he told me it was my 
Jack-of-all-trades and his maid Susan. I was most agreeably sur- 
prised when he named the match ; for indeed I thought it very suit- 
able. The character of that man I have given already ; and as for 
the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober, and religious young 
woman ; had a very good share of sense, was agreeable enough in 
her person, spoke very handsomely, and to the purpose, always with 
decency and good manners, and neither too backward to speak, when 
requisite, nor impertinently forwrvd, when it wa*8 not her bueinees; 
Tery handy and housewifely, and an excellent manager ; fit, indeed, to 
have been govern®s to the whoje i?laacl\ *a4 si)e Imeyf YtTT 'Wfll b^W 



S7v) APVENTURBJi OF 

The txAtdh being proposed in this manner, we c;«rriecl them the 
Mme daj ; and aa 1 was father at the altar, ae I may say, and gars 
her away, so I gave her a portion; for I appointed her and her 
husband a handsome large space of ground for their plantation ; and, 
indeod, this match, and the proposal the young gentlemeu made to 
give him a small property in the island put me upon parcelling it out 
among them, that they might not quarrel afterward about their 
situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who was 
now grown a sober, grave, managing fellow, perfectly reformed, ex- 
ceedingly pious and religious, and as far as I may be allowed t& 
speak positively in such a case, I verily believe he is a true penitent. 
He divided things so justly, and so much to every one's satisfaction, 
that they only desired one general writing under my hand for tho 
%yhole, which I caused to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, 
setting out the bounds and situation of every man's plantation, and 
testifying that I gave them thereby severally a right to the whole 
possession and inheritance of the respective plantations or farms, with 
their improvements, to them and their heirs, reserving all the rest of 
the island as my own property, and a certain rent for every particular 
plantation after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in my 
name, came to demand it, producing an attested copy of the same 
writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I told them I was not 
capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give them* 
aelves ; only I made them promise me to live in love and good neigh« 
borhood with one another ; and so I prepared to leave them. 

One thing I must not omit, and that is, that being now settled in a 
kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having much business 
in band, it was but odd to have seven-and.thirty Indians live in a 
nook of the island, independent, and, indeed, uuomplo3'ed ; for, ex- 
cepting the providing themselves with food, which they had difficulty 
enough to do sometimeSj they had no manner of business or property 
to manage. I proposed, therefore, to the governor Spaniard, that bo 
should go to them, with Friday's father, and propose to them to re- 
move, and either plant for themselves, or take them into their several 
families as servants, to be maintained for their labor, but without be- 
ing actual slaves ; for I would not admit them to make them slaves 
by force, by any means ; beoause they had their liberty given them 
by capitulation, 9M \t were arfcioUa of iurr©nd«r, whidi thoy ought not 
te break. 



ROBTNTSON^ CRT7SOE. $71 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all very 
cheerfully along -with him : so we allotted them land, and plantations, 
which three or four accepted of, but ail the rest chose to be em- 
ployed as servants iu the oeveral families we had settled ; and thaf 
my colony was in a manner settled, as follows : The Spaniards pos- 
sessed my original habitation, which was the capital city, and ex- 
tended their plantations all along the side of the brook, which made 
the creek that I have so often described, as far as my bower ; and as 
they increased their culture, it went alway eastward The English 
lived in the northeast part, where Will Atkins and his comrades be- 
gan, and came on southward and southwest, toward the back part of 
the Spaniards ; and every plantation had a great addition of land to 
take iu, if they found occasion, so that they need not jostle one 
another for want of room. All the east end of the island was left 
iminhabited, that if any of the savages should come on shore there 
only for their usual customary barbarities, they might come and 
go ; if they disturbed nobody, nobody would disturb them ; and 
no doubt but they were often ashore, and went away again, for I 
never heard that the planters were ever attacked or disturbed anj 
more. 

It now came into my thoughts that 1 had hinted to my friend, tho 
clergyman, that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be 
set on foot iu his absence to his satisfaction, and told him that now 
1 thought it was put in a fair way ; for the savages being thus di- 
vided among the Christians, if they would but every one of them do 
their part with those which came under their hands, I hoped it might 
have a very good effect. 

lie agreed presently in that, if they did their part. *' But how," 
eays he, "shall we obtain that of them?" I told him wo would call 
them all together, and leave it in charge with them, or to go to them, 
one by one. which he thought best ; so we divided it, he to speak to 
the Spaniards, who were all papists, and I to tho English, who were 
all Protestants ; and wo recommended it earnestly to them, and made 
them promise that they would never make any distinction of papist 
or Protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn Cliristiaus, but 
teach them the general knowledge of the true God, and of their Sa- 
vior Jesus Christ ; and they likewise promised us that they would 
never have any differences or disputes one with another about re- 
ligion. 

When I came to Will Atkins's house (I may cnll it fo, for such a 
Jiouse, or such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was not standing In 



0i AtoVENHJRSS OF 

&e WW14 again), there I fbujud the young woman I have meRttdaei 
ftbove, and Will Atkixis's wifie, were become intimates ; and this prii- 
dent) religious youug woman had perfected the work Will Atkins had 
begun ; and though it vrus not above four days after what I have re- 
lated, yet the new-biTj)tized savo ge woman was made such a Chrktiaa 
as I have seldom heard of in all my observation or conversation id 
the world. 

It came next into my mind, in the morning before I went to thcnv 
that among all the needful things I had to leave with them, I had 
not left them a Bible, in which I showed myself less consitiei-ing fcr 
them than my good friend the widow was for me, when she 8er<t mo 
the cargo of a hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up 
three Bibles and a prayer-book. However, the good woman's cluirity 
had a greater extent t-han ever she imagined, for they were reserved 
for the comfort and instructioa of those that made much better UBe 
of them than I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to W^ill 
Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman and Atkins's 
baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together, for Will At- 
kins told me it with a great deal of joy, I asked if they were together 
now, and he said yes ; eo I went into the house, and he with me, and 
We found them together very earnest in discourse. '• sir,'' eftys 
Will Atkins, '' when God has sinners to reconcile to himself, and 
aliens to bring home, be never wants a messenger ; my wife has got 
a new instructor ; I knew I was as unwoi'tliy aa I was incapable of 
that work ; that young woman has been sent hither from heaven; sh\ 
is enough to convert a whole island of savages." The young woman 
blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desired her to sit stUl ; I told 
her she had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped God woQld 
bless her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any book among 
them, though I did not ask : but I put my hand into my pocket, and 
palled out my Bible. " Here," says I to Atkins, " I have brought 
yov an aseistant that perhaps you had not before." The man was so 
confounded that he was not able to speak for some time ; but recover- 
ing himself, he takes it with both his hands, and turning to his wife, 
" Uere, my dear," says he, '• did I not tell you our God, though he 
lives above, could hear what we said ? Here's the book I prayed for 
when you and I kneeled down Under the bush ; now God has heard 
U8, and sent it." When he had naid so, the man fell into auoh trans^ 
pprtf' of paadonate joy, that between the joy of haying it, and giving 



H0B1N80K OfKJBOK. S7$ 

Adl tha^a Ibr % tfad tears roa down bit laee like a ohild that was 
crying. 

The woman was surprised^ and was like to have run into a mistakA 
tliat none of us were awai*e of, for she firmly believed God had sesai 
the book upou her husband's petition. It is true, that providentially 
it waa 80, and might be taken eo in a consequent eenee ; but I believe 
it would have been no difficult matter, at that time, to have per- 
saaded the poor woman to have believed that an express meseeoger 
•ame from heaven on purpose to bring that individual book ; but it 
waa too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to take place ; so I 
turned to the young woman, and told her we did not desire to im^ 
poso upon the new convert, hi her first and more ignorant understand- 
ing of thiags, and begged her to explain to her that God may be very 
proparly said to answer our petitions when, in the course of his 
providence, such things are in a particular manner brought to pass as 
we petitioned for; but we did hot expect returns from heaven in a 
miraoalous ^and particular manner, and it is our mercy that it ia 
not so. 

This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that there was, 
I assure you, no priestcraft used hero ; and I should have thought it 
one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so. 
But the surprise of joy upon Will Atkins is really not to be expressed; 
and there, we may be sure, was no delusion. Sure no man was ever 
more thankful in the world for anything of its kind than he was for 
the Bible ; nor, I believe, never any man was glad of a Bible from a 
better principle ; and though he had been a most profligate creature, 
headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet this man is a stand- 
ing rule to us all for the well instructing children, viz. : that parents 
Bhould never give over to teach and instruct, nor ever despair of the 
sueoess of their endeavors, let the children be ever so refractory, or to 
appearance, insensible of instruction ; for if ever God, in his provi- 
denoe, touches the conscience of such, the force of their educatioa 
returns upon them, and the early instruction of parents is not lost, 
though it may have been many years laid asleep, b«t, some time or other, 
they may 2nd the benefit of it. Thus it was with this poor man; 
however ignorant he was of religion and Christian knowledge, he 
found ho had some to do with now more ignorant than himself, and 
that the least part of the instruction of his good father that now cam9 
to his mind was of use to him. 

Among the rest it occurred to him, he said, how his fether used t** 
insist 80 much on the inexpressible value of the Bible, the .pririleff^

•nd blcasing n? it to nations, families, and persons ; bat he never en* 
tertained the least notion of the worth of it till now. when being to 
talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help of the 
written oraclo for his assistance. 

The young woman was glad of it also for the present occasion, 
though she had one, and so had the youth, on board our ship, among 
their goods, which were not yet brought on shore. And now having said 
»o many things of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one story 
more of her and myself, which has something in it very informing and 
remarkable. 

I hare related to what extremity the poor young woman waa re- 
duced, how her mistress was starved to death, and died on board that 
unhappy ship we met at sea. and how the whole ship's company was 
reduced to the last extremity. The gentlewoman and her son, and 
this maid, were lirst hardly used, as to provisions, and at la«t totally 
neglected and starved ; that is to say, brought to the last extremity of 
hunger. One day, being discoursing with her on the extremities they 
Buffered, I asked her if he she could describe, by what she had felt, 
what it was to starve, and how it appeared? She told mo sIjc believed 
she could, and she told her tale very distinctly, thus : 

" First, sir,'' said she, " we had for some days fared exceeding hard, 
»nd suffered very great hunger; bat at last m'C were wholly without 
food of any kind, except sugar, and a little wine and water. The 
first day, after I had received no food at all, I found myself, toward 
evening, first empty and sick at the stomach, and nearer night much 
, inclined to yawning and sleep. I laid down on a couch in the great 
cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a little re- 
freshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down ; after being 
about three hours awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I 
found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay down again, but 
could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; and thus I continued 
all the second day, with a strange variety, first hungry, then sick 
again, with retchings to vomit. The second night, being obliged to go 
to bed again without any fond, more than a draught of fresh water, 
and being asleep, I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market 
was mightily strckod with provisions: that I bought some fi>r my 
mistress, and went and (lined very heartily. I thought mv stomneb 
was as full after this as it wmild have boon after a pood dinner but

teead; bat thore tebji; no substance in the stomach for the digesting 
oflBce to •work upon, 1 t'ound the only effect of the wine was, to raiso 
disagreeable fumes from the stoaaeh into the head ; and I lay, as 
they tuM me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some time. Tho 
third day, in the morning, after a night of strange, confused, and in- 
consistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked raven« 
oua and furious with hunger ; and I question, had not my understand* 
ing returned and conquered it, whetner, if I had been a mother, an4 
had had a little chiid v;ith me, its life would have been safe or not. 
This lasted about three hours; during which time I was twice raging 
mad as any creature in Bedlam; as my young master told me, auu aa 
he can now inform you. 

*'Ia one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down, and struck 
my face against the corner of a pallet bed, in which my mistress layi 
and, with the blow, the blood gushed out of my nose ; and the cabia- 
boy bringing me a little basin, I sat down and bled into it a great 
deal ; and as tho blood camo from me, I came to myself, and tba 
violence of the flame or fever I was in abated, and so did the raven- 
ous part of the hunger. Then I grew sick, and retched to vomit, but 
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up. After I ba4 
bled some time, I swooned, and they all believed I was dead ; but I 
came to myself soon after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my 
Btomach, not to be described, not like the colic, but a gnawing, eager 
pain for food ; and toward the night it went off, with a kind of earnest 
wishing or longing for food, something like, as I suppose, the longing 
of a woman with child. I took another draught of water with sugar 
In it ; but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought it all up again ; 
then 1 took a draught of water without sugar, and all staid with mo ; 
and I laid me down upon the bed, praying mo most heartily that it 
would please God to take roe away ; and composing my mind in 
hopes of it, I slumbered awhile, and then waking, thought myseJ 
dying, being light with vapors from an empty stomach ; I recom- 
mended my soul then to God, and e» mestly wished that eomcbody 
would throw me into the sea. 

" All this while my mistress lay by ;^9, jusr, aa I thought, cxpirinj?, 
but bore it with much more patience than I ; gave the last bit of bread 
ehe had left to her child, my young master, who would not have takcm 
it, but she obliged him to eat it; and I believed it saved his life. 

" Toward the morning i' slept again ; and when I awoke, I fell into 
a violent passion of crying, and after that had a second fit of violent 
bottgerj I got up ravenous, and iu a meet dreacifui condition; h%(|

have catco » pioce of her flesh with much relish, aad as uucoBO«rned 
as ever I did eat the flesh of any creature appointed for food; and 
once or twice I was going to bito my own arm ; at last I saw the haei» 
in which was the blood I had bled at my nose the day before ; I ran 
to it, and swallowed it with such haste, and such a greedy appetite, as 
If I wondered nobody had taken it before, and afraid it should bo 
fesken from me now. After it was down, though the thoughts of it 
filled me with horror, yet it checked the lit of hnnger, and I took 
another draught of water, and was composed and refreshed for gome 
hoars after. This was the fourth day ; and thus I held it till toward 
night ; when, within the compass of three hours, I had all the several 
oircumstauces over again, one after another, viz. : sick, sleepy, eagerly 
hnngry, pain in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then lu- 
natic, then crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter of au 
hour; and my strength wasted exceedingly ; at night I laid me down, 
having no comfort but in the hope that I should die before morn 
ing. 

" All this night I had no sleep ; but the hunger was now turned into 
a disease; and I had a terrible colio and griping, by wind, instead 
of food, having found its way into the bowels ; and in tliis condition I 
lay till morning, when I was sui-prised with the cries and lamenta<. 
tions of my young master, who called out to me that his mother waa 
dead : I lifted myself up a little, for I had not strength to rise, but 
foond she was not dead, though she was able to give very little signs 
of life. 

'^ I had then such convnldons in my stomach, for want of somo 
Bustenance, that I cannot describe ; with such frequent throes and 
pangs of appetite, that nothing but the tortures of death can imi- 
tate; and in this condition I was when I heard the seamen above 
cry out, ' A sail ! a sail !' halloo and jump about as if they were dis- 
tracted. 

" I waa not able to get off from the bed, and my mistress much loss ; 
and my young master was so sick, that I thought he had been ex- 
piruig ; so we could not open the cabin door, or get any account 
what it was that occasioned such confusion ; nor had wo any con- 
verBation with the ship's company for two days, they having told us 
that they had not a mouthful of anything to eat in the ship ; and this 
they told ub afterward, they thought we had been dead. It wai this"

Thin was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of stai'\'in2 
to de»th, as I confess, I never met with, and was exceeding entertala- 
ing to me. I am tlie rather apt to believe it to he a true account, be- 
cause the youth gave me an account of a good part of it ; thou^lx, I 
jpust own, not so distinct and so feeling as the maid : and the rather, 
because it seems his mother fed him at the price of her own life ; 
but the poor maid, though her constitution being stronger than that 
of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman, too, eh* 
might struggle harder with it : I say, the poor maid might be sup« 
posed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress, who 
might be allowed to keep the last bit something longer than she 
parted with any to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here 
Irelated, if our ship, or some other, had not providentially met thorn, » 
few days more would have ended all their lives, unless they had pre* 
vented it by eating one another ; and that even, as their case Btood, 
would have served them but a little while, they being five humirod 
leagues from any land, or any possibility of relief, other than in the 
miraculous manner it happened ; but this is by the way : I returii t« 
my disposition of things among the people. 

And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many reasons I did hoi 
think fit to let them know anything of the eloop I had framed, and 
which I thought of setting up among them ; for I found^ at lea.'-t at 
my first coming, such seeds of divisions among them, that I saw 
plainly had I set up the sloop, and left it among them, they would, 
upon every light disgust, have separated, and gone away from one 
another, or perhaps have turned pirates, and bo made the island a den 
of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and religious people, as I 
intended it ; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon that I 
had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns that my nephew took ex- 
traordinary, for the same reason : I thought it was enough to qualify 
them for a defensive war against any that should invade them, but 
not to set them up for an offensive war, or to go abroad to attack 
others; which, in the end, would only bring ruin and destruction 
upon them : I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the guns for their 
service another way, as I shall observe in its place. 

Having now done with the island, I left them all in good «ircum- 
stances, and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my ship 
again oa the 6th of May, having been about twenty-five days among 
them ; and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till I 
came to remove themj I promised to ••nd them, farther relief from the 
JiT-;t?.^i.s, if i ;^ould possibly fi«d 8,n onriortnmtT t a-iid, ■nsrtiovU&fij, I

promised to send them some cattle, such as ebeep, bogs, and cows ; M 
to the two cows and calves which I had brought from England, wo 
had been obUged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them tX sea^ 
for wa&t of hay to feed them. 




Inoffimter with Savages at Sea— Friday's Death— Robinson flnda )b« 
Partner in the Brazils-Saila for the East Indies. 

)HE next day, giving them a salute of five guns et parting 
wo set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the Bra* 
zils, in about twenty-two daj-s, meeting nothing remarkable 
in the passage but this : that about three days fitter we had 
mailed, being becalmed, and the current setting strong to the E. N. E. 
running, as it were, into a, bay or gulf on the land side, w© wore 
driven something out of our course, and once or twice our men criod 
out, " Land to the eastward ;" but whether it was the continent or 
islands wo could not tell by any means. But the third day, toward 
evening, the sea smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it 
vere, covered toward the land with something very black ; not being 
eble to discover what it was, till after some time, our chief mate, going 
op to the main-shrouds a little way, and looking at ihem with a 
perspective, cried out it was an army. I could not imagine what ho 
meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily. *• Nay, sir,'^ 
gays he, "don't bo angi*y, for 'tis an army, and a fleet, too : for I bo. 
Ueve there ore a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddl£< 
along, for they are coming toward us apace." 

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew the 
captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island, 
and having never been in those seas before, that he oould not tell 
what to think of it, but said, two or three times, we should all be de- 
voured. I must confess, oonsidoring wo were becalmed *nd the cur- 
rent set strong toward the shore, I liked it the "^ — se : however, I 
bade them not to be afraid, but bring the ship to an KMAot as soon as 
we oame so near to know that we must engage thenv 

The weather continued calm, and they came on apace towaid us ; 
eo I sav« ord^r to come to aa aaohor, and fori {^1 oor saik : as .*ec 



the oarages, I told thera they had nothinj to fet«r hit fire, dud tLere- 
fore thjy should get their boats out, and fcsten thbiu, one close by 
the head^ and the other by the stern, and man them both •vrell, and 
wait the isaue in that posture : this I did, that the men m the boata 
might be reaJy with sheets and buckets to put out uay fire thes9 
savages would tadeavor to fix to the outside of the ship. 

In this posture wo lay for them, and in a little while thoy came up 
•with as ; but never was such a horrid sight seen by Christians; 
though my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of vbeir num- 
ber, yet when they came up we reckoned about a hund/'vjd and 
twenty-six; some of them had sixteen or eeventeen men in thes^ 
Bome more, and the least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with won- 
der and astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they had ce\er 
seen before; nor could they at first, as we afterward underetoo<I, 
know what to make of us. They came boldly up, however, very near 
to us, and seemed to go about to row rouad us ; but we called to our 
men in the boata not to let them come too near them. This very order 
brought us to an engagement with them, witnout our designing it, for 
five or six of the large canoes came so near our iong boat that our 
men beckoned with their hands to keep them bajk, which they under- 
stood very well, and went back, but at their retreat about fifty nri-ows 
came on board us from those boats, and'ouc of oui* men in the long- 
boat was very much wounded. However, I called to them not to fire 
by any means ; but we handed down some deal boards into the boat^ 
and the carpenter presently set up a kind of fence, like waste boards, 
to cover them from the arrows of the savages, if they should thoov 
again. 

About half an hour afterward they all came up in a body astern of 
us, and so near as that we could easily discern what they were, though 
we could not tell their design ; and I easily found they were some of 
my old fi-icnds, the same sort of savages that I had been used to en- 
gage with, and in a short time more they rowed a little faither out to 
sea, till they came directly broad.side with us, and then rowed down 
straight upon us. till they came so near that they could henr us speak. 
Upon this I ordered all my men to kepp close, lost they should shoot 
any more arrows, and made all our guns readv ; but being so near as 
to be within hearing, 1 made Fridiiy go out upon the deck, and call 
out aloud to them in his language tn know what thoy meant, which 
accordingly he did. Whether thev undorstood him or not that I knew 
owt, but as soou as he had culled to them, sis of them} who were ia

the foremost ox nigbest boat to us, turned their canoes from «3, and 
stooping down, showed us their jaaked backsides; just as if, iu Eu- 

glisli, saving your i*esenee, they bid us kiss . WTiether this ■was 

a defiance or challenge Ave knew not, or whether it was done iu 
mere ootitcmpt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately Friday 
cried out they were going to shoot ; and, unhappily for him, poor fel- 
low, thfiy let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and, to my ijv- 
expressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their 
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrowy, 
and about three more fell very near him, such unlucky marksmen 
they were. 

I was 80 enraged at the loss of my old trusty servant aad compaa. 
ion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with email shot 
and four with great, and gave them such a broadside as they had never 
heard in their lives before, to be sure. They were not above half a 
£able length off when we fiji-ed, and our gunners took their aim so wel] 
that three or four of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to 
believe, by one shot only. 

The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to us gave us no 
great offence; neither did I know for certain whether that which 
would pass for Ihe greatest contempt among us, might be understood 
BO by them or not; therefore, in return, I had only resolved to havei 
fired four or five guns at them, with powder only, which I knew would 
frighten them sufficiently; but when they shot at us directly, with all 
the fury they were capable of, and especially as they had killed my 
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, 
SO well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifiable before God 
and n-ian, but would have been very glad if I could have overset every 
•anoo there, and drowned every one of them. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, nor how many we wounded 
at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never was seen 
Among such a multitude ; there were thirteen or fourteen of their ca- 
noes split and overset in all, and the men all set a swimming ; tho 
rcpt, frightened out of their wits, scoured away as fast as they could, 
taking but little care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled 
with our shot, so I suppose that many of them were lost, and oar men 
took up one poor fellow, swimming for his life, above an hour aft^jr 
tlicy were all gone. 

Tho small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a great 
many ; but, in short, we nover knew anything how it went writh fcbieoA, 
fw they fled so fast that in three boure, *¥ thvrvaboatGii we could oM

fg» »bov» tbreg oi* four straggling canoes, nor did we ever we {lie rest 
any more, for a breesse of wind epringing up the eame evenmg, we 
weighed, and set sail for the Brazils. 

We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was bo sullen that b« 
■would neither eat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve him-, 
self to death, but I took a way to cure him, for I made them take hiji 
and turn him out into the long-boat, and make him believe they would 
fto83 him into the sea again, and so leave hira where they found hin^, 
if he would not speak ; nor would that do, but they really did throw 
him into the 6«a, and came away from hira ; and then he followed 
them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in his tongue, 
though they know not a word of what he said. However, at last they 
took him in again, and then he began to be more tractable ; nor did I 
ever design they should drown bun. 

We were now under sail again, but I was the most disconsolate 
creature alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been verj 
glad to have gone back to the island, to have taken one of the rest 
from there for my occasion; but it could not be, so we went on. W« 
had one prisoner, as I have said, and it was a long time before w« 
could make him understand anything, but, in time, our men taughf- 
him some English, and he began to be a little tractable. Afterward, 
wo inquired what country he came from, but could make nothing of 
what he said, for his speech was so odd (all gutturals), and he spoke 
m the throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we could never form a 
word after him, and we were all of opinion that they might speak 
that language as well if they were gagged as otherwise ; nor could we 
perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth, tongue, lips, ol 
palate, but formed their words just as a hunting horn forms a tune, 
with an open throat. He told us, however, some time after, when w« 
had taught him to speak a little English, that they were going with 
their kings to fight a great battle. When he said kings, we asked him 
bow many kings ? He said there were five nation (we could not make 
him understand the plural s), and that they all joined to go against 
two nation. We asked him what made them come up to us ? He 
said, " To makee te great wonder look." Here it is to be observed 
that" all these natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn En- 
glish, always add two e'a at the end of the words where we use one, 
ftad they place the accent upon them, as makee, takee, and the like, 
and we could not break them of it ; nay, I could hardly make Friday 
\eave it off, though at last he did. 

AttOi,"'DO^ I naak« the poor fellow once more, I must tak« taj let0i 



leave of hhn. Poor, honest Friday ! We buried him wilh all the d* 
cency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin and throw- 
iag him into the sea, and I caused theni to fire eleven guns for him; 
and so ended the life of the most grateful, faithful, honesty and most 
affectionate servant thut ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, and ia about twelve 
days' time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees south of the 
line, being the northeastermost laud of all that part of America. We 
kept on, S. by E., in sight of the shore, four days, when we made 
Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came to an anchor off the bay . 
of All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, from whence came bo^ 
my good and evil fate. 

Never ship came to this port that had less baslness than I had, and 
yet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the 
least correspondence on shore ; not my partner himself, who was alive, 
and made a great figure among them, not my two merchant trustees, 
not the fame of my wonderful preservation in the island, could obtain 
mo that favor ; but my partner remembering that I had gi'cen fiv« 
hundred moidores to the priory of the monastery of the Augustines, 
and two hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to the monastery, 
and obliged the prior that then was, to go to the governor, and get 
leave for me personally, with the captain and one more besides eight 
eaamen, to come on chore, and no more ; and this upon condition ab- 
Bolutely capitulated for, that we should not offer to land any goods out 
of ttie ship, or to carry anyperson away without license They were 
fio strict with us as to landing and goods, that it was with extreme 
difficulty that I got on shore three bales of En.lish goods, such as fina 
broadcloths, stuffs, and uome linen, which I had brought for a present 
to my partner. 

He was a very generous, open-hearted man; though, like me, he 
oamo from little at first ; and though he knew not that I had the least 
design of giving bim anything, he sent me on board a present of fresh 
prevision, wine and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores, in- 
cluding some tobacco, and three or four fine medals of gold ; but 1 
■was even with him in my present, which, as I have said, consisted of 
fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine hollands ; I also delivered 
him about the value of one hundred pounds sterling, in the same 
goods, for other uses; and I obliged him to set up the ploop, which I 
had brought with me from England, as I have said, for the use of my 
colony, Iq order to send the refreshmenta I intended to my plantar 

tiao. 



EOBIKSON c«trso& 8S3 

Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the eloop in a very few 
days, for she was already framed ; aud I gave the master of her such 
instructions as that he could not miss the place ; nor did he miss them, 
as I had an account from my partner afterward. I got him soon 
loaded with a omall cargo I sent them; and one of our seamen, that 
bad been on chore with me there offered to go with the sloop and 
settle there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard to allot hira a 
BufiBcient quantity of land for a plantation, and giving hira some 
clothes and tools for his planting work, which he said he understood, 
having been an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer into the 
bargain. I encouraged the fellow, by granting all he desired; aud, 
as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we had taken prisoner of 
war to be his slave, and ordered the governor Spaniard to give him 
bis share of everything he wanted with tho rest. 

"When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me there 
^as a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, 
who had fallen into the displeasure of the church. •• I know not what 
the matter is with him," says he, " but on my conscience, I think he 
is a heretic in his heart, and he has been obliged to conceal himself 
for fear of tho Inquisition: that he would be very glad of such an 
opportunity to make his escape, with his wife and two daughters ; and 
if I would let them go to my island, and allot them a plantation, he 
«vould give them a small stock to begin with ; for the officers of the 
Inquisition had seized all his effects and estate, and he had nothing 
left but a little household stuff, and two slaves ; and," adds he, 
•* though I hate his principles, yet I would not hare hira fall into, 
their hands, for he will be assuredly burned alive if he does." 

I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them; 
and we concealed tho man, and his wife and daughters, on board our 
chip, till the sloop put out to go to sea ; and then, having put all 
their goods on bgard some time before, we put them on board the 
sloop after she was got out of the bay. 

Our seamen were mightily pleased with this new partner ; and their 
stocks, indeed, were much alike rich in tools, in preparations, and a 
farm ; bat nothing to begin with, except as above ; however, they 
carried over with them, which was worth all the rest, some materials 
for planting sugarcanes, with some phmts of canes, which he, I mean 
the Portugal man, understood very well. 

Among the rest of tho supplies sent to my tenants in the island, * 
sent them by the sloop three milch cows and fixe calves, about twenty^ 
t-^Q hogs among them, three sows bis; "with pig, two mares, aad *

•toafihorse. For ray Spandards, acoording to my promise, I engaged 
ibree Portugal women to go, and recommended it to them to marry 
them, and use tbem kindly. I could have procured more women, but 
I remembered tbat the poor prosecuted man bad two daugbterg, and 
tbat tbere were but five of tbo Spaniards wbo wanted; tbe re«t h*4 
wives of tbeir own, tbougb in another country. 

All this cargo arrived safe, and as you may easily eupposo, wm 
welcome to my old inhabitants, wbo were now, with this addition, b^ 
tween sixty and seventy people, besides little children, of which tber* 
were a great many. I found letters at London from them all, by way 
©f Lisbon, when I came back to England, of which I shall also tak« 
»ome notice immediately. 

I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse about 
it; and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums, would do well to 
turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the follies of 
An ©Id man, not warned by hia own harms, mnch less by those of 
other men, to beware of the like ; not cooled by almost forty years' 
wiseries and disappointments : not satisfied with prosperity beyond 
expectation, nor made cautious by afflictions and distress beyond 
imitation. 

I had no more business to go to tbe East Indies, than a man afe 
full liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire bini 
to lock him up among the prisoners there, and starve him. Ilad 
I taken a small vessel from England and gone directly to the is- 
land ; had I loaded her as I did the other vessel, with all the no 
cessaries for the plantation, and for my people ; taken a patent fronj; 
the government here to have secured my property, in subjection only 
to that of England ; had I carried over cannon and ammunition, 
servajits and people to plant, and taken possession of the place, forti- 
fied and strengthened it in the name of England, and increased it with 
people, as I might easily have done ; had I then settled myself there, 
and sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I might also have 
done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have fitted heif 
•ut again for our supply ; bad I done this, and stayed there myself^ I 
had at least acted like a man of common sense ; but I was possessed 
with a wandering spirit, and scorned all advantages ; I pleased my- 
self with being the patron of the people I placed there, and doing for 
them In a kind of haughty, majestic way, like an old patriarchal 
monarch, providing for them as if I had been father of the whole 
family, as well as of the plantation ; but I never so much a* pretended 
to plant in the uame of aay gorernment or nation, or to aoknowle<ifi;e

my |^iitk;e, ex ip call my people subjects to ^7 oda aation tnose tbaa 
aoother ; nay, I never so much as gave the place a name, but left it, 
M I found it, belonging to nobody, and the people under no disciplina 
or government but my own; who, though I had influence over them 
as a father and benefactor, had no authority or power to act or com- 
mand one way or other, farther than voluntary consent moved them to 
comply ; yet, even this, had I stayed there, would have done well 
•BOagh ; but as I rambled from them, and eame there no more, the 
i'ast Iett«ra I had from any of them were by my partner's means, who 
afterward sent another sloop to the place, and who sent me word, 
though I had not the letter till I got to London, several years after i* 
W^as written, that they went on but poor poorly, were malcontent with 
thoir long stay there; that Will Atkins was dead; that five of the 
Spaniarde were come away ; and though they had not been much 
icnolested by the savages, yet they had some skirmishes with them; 
and that they begged of him to write to mo to think of the promise 1 
had made to fetch them away, that they might see thoir country again 
before they died. 

But I was gone a wild gooee chase, indeed, and they that will have 
any more of me, must be content to follow mo into a new variety of 
follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice of Provi- 
dence may be duly observed ; and we may see how easily Heaven can 
gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest of our wishes be 
oar affliction, and punish us most severely with those very things 
which we think it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in. 
Whether I had business or no business, away I went. It is no time 
xiOAv to enlarge upon the reason or ateurdity of my own conduct, bus 
to come to the history : I was embarked for the voyage, and the voy- 
age I went. 

I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest popish cler- 
gyruan; for, let their opinion of us, and all other heretics in general, 
as they eall us, be as uncharitable as it may, I verily believe this maa 
was very sincere, and wished the good of all men; yet I believe he 
wa« upon the reserve in many of his espressions, to prevent giving 
me offence, for I scarce heard him once call on the blessed Virgin, or 
mention St. Jago or his guardian angel, though so common with the 
rest of them. However, I say, I had not the least doubt of his sin- 
cerity, and pious intentions on bis own part, and I am firmly of opia- 
7^'\ it the rest of the popish missionaries were like him, they would 
strive to visit even the poop Tartars, an^ Laplandera, where tb«y bad

A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked n-v 
leave to go thither, being still, as he observed, bound never to finiea

V<rithhiui; but it was too late now. All things Ileaven appoints for 
the best : had I gone with hun, I had never had so many things to bo 
thankful for. and the reader had never heard of the second part of 
the travels and adventures of Robinson Crusoe, so I must here leave 
exclaiming at myself, and go on with my voyage. 

From the Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the 
Cape of Good Hope, and had a tolerable good voyage, our course 
generally southeast; now and then a storm, and some contrary winds, 
but my disasters at sea were at an end ; my future rubs and cross 
events were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land was 
oa well prepared to be our scourge as the sea. 

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, 
•who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, only 
being limited to a certain number of days for stay, by charter-party, 
at the several ports she was to go. This was none of my business, 
neither did I meddle with it ; my nephew, the captain, and the 
supercargo, adjusting all those things between them as they thought

BOBIKSOK CSUSOS. $8? 

I shall not poster the reader with a tedious description of places, 
journals of our voyages, variations of the compass, latitudes, trade- 
winds, etc., it is enough to name the porta and places which wu 
touched at, and what occurred to us upon our passing from one ta 
another. We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where, though 
the people are fierce and treacherous, and very well armed with 
lances and hows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet 
we fivred very well with them a while; they treated us very civilly, 
and, for some trifles which wo gave them, such as knives, scissors, etc., 
they brought us eleven good fat bullocks of a middUng size, which wo 
took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spending, and tho 
rest to salt for the ship's use. 

"We were obliged to stay hero pomo tiraa after we had furnished 
ourselves with provisions; and I, who was always too curious to look 
into evury nook of the Avorld wherever I came, was for going on shore 
as often as I could. It was on the cast side of the island that we 
went on shore one evening ; and the people, who, by-the-way, are 
Very numerous, camo thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a 
distance ; but, as wo had traded freely with them, and had been kindlj 
used, we thought ourselves in no danger, but when we saw the peo- 
ple, we cut three boughs out of a tree and stuck them up at a distancs 
from us, which, it seems, is a mark in that country, not only of truce 
and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other side sets up three 
poles or boughs, which is a signal that they accept the truce, too ; 
but then this is a known condition of the truce, that you are not to 
pass beyond their three poles toward them, nor they to come past 
your three poles or boughs toward you ; so that you are perfectly ee* 
cure within the three poles, and all the space between your polos and 
theirs is allowed like a market for free converse, traffic, and corn- 
cnerce. When you go there you must not carry your weapons with 
you. and if they come into that space, they stick up their javelins and 
lances all at the first poles, and come on unarmed ; but if any violence 
is offered them, and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the 
poles and lay hold of their weapons, and the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a greater 
number of the people came down than usual, but all very friendly 
and civil : and they brought several kinds of provisions, for which we 
satisfied them with such toys as we had ; their women, also, brought 
us milk and roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and all 
was quiet, and we made U3>..a little tent or hut of some boujihs of trees 
and lay on shore all night. 



SlSS adventures Of 

I li-Bow not what was the occaslort, but I Tras not eo woll satisfied 
to lie. on shore as tho rost, and the boat riding at an anchor about a 
fltona's caet from the land, with two men in her to take cars of her, I 
made ono of them come on shore, and getting some boughs of trees to 
(joter uB, also, in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of th« boat 
aod lay under the oorer of the branches of the trees all night in ths 
boat. 

About two o'olook in the morning we heard one of our men mako a 
terrible noise on the shore, oalUng out, for God's sake, to bring the 
boafe in, and come and help them, for they were all like to fee mur- 
dered; at the same time I heard the fire of Atg muskets, which was 
the number of the guns they had, and that three times over ; for, it 
«e©ms the natives here were not so easily frightened with guns as the 
ravages were in America, where I had to do with them. All 
this while I knew not what was the matter, but rousing immedi- 
ately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be thrust ia 
and resolved, with three fusees we had on board, to laud and a88is.ii 
oar men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men were in too much 
haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged into the water, to 
get to the boat with all the expedition they could, being pursued by 
between three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine in all, 
and only five of them had fusees with them; the rest had pistols and 
Bwords, indeed, but they were of small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough too, threo 
of them being very ill wounded ; and that which was still worse wag, that 
while we stood in the boat to take our men in, wc were in as muolj 
danger as they were in on shore ; for they poured their arrows in 
upon us so thick, that we were glad to barricade the side of the boat 
up with the benches, and two or three loose boards, which, to oup 
groat satisfaction, we had by mere acciBent in the boat. And ycfc 
had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, that 
If they could have seen but the least part of us, they would hav« been 
8ur« of us. We had, by the light of the moon, a little sight of them, 
as they stood pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows ; and 
having got ready our fire-arms, we gave them a volley, that we oould 
hear, by the cries of some of them, had wounded several ; however, 
they stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which, 
tre suppose was that thoy might see the better to tale their aim at 
m.

•atboT or set ip Mtr Bail, because we must needs stond tip in the boat, 
and they were sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird on a tree with 
■mall shot We made signals of distress to the ship, which, though 
•he rode a league ofif, yet my nephew, the captain, hearing our firing, 
and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and that we fired 
toward the shore, pretty well understood us ; and weighing anchor 
with all speed, he stood as near thd shore as he durst with the ship, 
and then sent another boat, with ten hanos in her to assist us ; but we 
aalled to them not to come too near, telling them what condition wo 
were in j however they stood in near to us, and one of the men taking 
the end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping one boat between him 
and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam oa 
board us, and made fast the line to the boat ; upon which we slipped 
out a little cable, and leaving our anchor behind, they towed us out 
of the reach of the arrows ; we all the while lying close behind the 
barrioado we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore, that 
we could lay her side to the shore, she ran along just by them, and 
ponred in a broadside among them loaded with pieces of iron and 
lead, small bullets, and such stuff, besides, the great shot, wbioh made 
a terrible havoc among them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time to ex- 
amine into the occasion of this fray j and, indeed, our supercargo, who 
had been often in those parts, put me upon it ; for he said he was 
sure the inhabitant* would not have touched us after we had made a 
truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to it. At length 
h came out that an old woman who had come to sell U3 some milk, 
had brought it within our poles, and a young woman with her, who 
also brought some roots or herbs; and while the old woman (whether 
she was mother to the young woman or no they could not tellj was 
selling us the milk, one of our men ofiered some rudeness to the 
wench that was with her, at which the old woman made a great 
noise ', however; the seaman would not quit his prize, but carried her 
out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it being almost dark ; 
the old woman went away without her, and, as we may suppose, made 
ejx outcry among the people she came from, who, upon notice, raised 
this great army upon us in three or four hours ; and it was great odds 
but we had all been destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the 
beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had made;

for him, and made our boat sail up ehore and down shore several 
leagues, but in vain, so we were obliged to give him over ; and if 
he alone had suffered for it, the loss had been less. 

I oould not satisfy mystilf, however, without venturing on ehoi'e 
once more, to try if I could learn anything of him or them ; it 
was the third night after the action that I had a great mind to 
learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we had done, and 
how the game stood on th« Indian's side. I was careful to do it 
in the dark, lest we should be attacked again ; but I ought, indeed, 
to hare been sure that the men I went with had been under my com- 
mand, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous, aa 
I was brought into by it without design. 

We took twenty as stout f«jllow8 with ns as any in the ship, besides 
the supercargo and myself, fend we landed two hours before midnight, 
at the Bume place where the Indians stood drawn up in the evening 
before; I landed here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly 
to ieo if they had quitted the field, and if they had left any marks be. 
hind tkem of the mischief we had done them ; and I thought if we 
oould surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our man 
again, by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two bodies, 
whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the other. We neither 
saw nor heard anybody stir when we landed ; and we marched up, 
«De body at a distance from the other, to the place ; but at first could 
see nothing, it being very dark ; till by-and-by our boatswain, who 
led the first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This made 
them halt awhile ; for knowing by the circimastances that they were 
at the place where the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming 
up there. We concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which 
we knew would be in less than an hour, when we could easily discern 
the havoc wo had made among them. We told thirty-two bodies upon 
&t ground, whereof two were not quite dead ; some had an arm, and 
•ome a leg shot oiT, and one his hand ; those that wet>e wounded, w* 
Buppoee, they had carried away. 

When wo had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we could 
c«ma to the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on board; but the 
boatswain and his party sent me word that they were resolved to 
make a visit to tb« Indian town, where thess dogs, as they callo^

ibem, dwelt, and asked me to go along 'vrith them ; and if the/ coald 
find them, ae they still fancied they should, they did not doubt ol 
getting a good booty ; and it might be they might find Tom Jefiry 
there ; that was the man's name we had lost. 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough what, 
cutawer to have given them ; for I should have commanded thev 
instantly on board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who 
had a ship, and ship-loading in our charge, and a voyage to mak« 
which depended very much upon the lives of the men ; but as they 
sent me word they were resolved to go, and only asked me and my 
fiompany to go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose up, 
for I was sitting on the ground, in order to go to the boat. One or 
two of the men began to importune me to go ; and when I refused, 
began to grumble, and say they were not under my command, and 
would go. " Come, Jack," says one of the men, " will you go with 
me ? PU go for one." Jack said he would — and then another — ftnd» 
in a word, they aM left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a 
boy left in the boat. So the supercargo and I with the third mai\ 
went back to the boat, where we told them we should stay for them^ 
and take care to take in as many of them as should be left ; for I tohf; 
them it was a mad thing they were going about, and supposed mott 
of them would run the fate of Tom J«9ry. 

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would corns 
bS again, and they would take care, &c. ; so away they went. I en- 
treated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their lives 
were not their own, and that they were intrusted with the voyage in 
some measure ; that if they miscarried, the ship might be lost for 
want of their help, and that they could not answer for it to God or 
man. But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of the ship j 
thoy were mad upon their journey, only they gave me good worda, 
and begged I would not be angry , that they did not doubt but they 
would be back again in about an hour at farthest ; for the Indian 
town, they said, was not above half a mile off, though they found it 
above two miles before they got to it. 

Well, they all went away ; and though the attempt was desperate, 
and such as none but madmen would have gone about, yet to give 
them their due, they went about it as warily as boldly : they wer« 
gallantly armed, for they had every man a fusee or musket, a bayonet, 
and a pistol ; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of them had 
hangers, and the boatswain and two more had pole axes ; besides all 
which titiqy had among them thirteen hand-grenadoes : bolder f(»llow%

and better pro/ided, never went about any wicked work in ib« 

world. 

When tbey went out, their chief desire was plunder, and they were 
an mighty hopes of finding gold there ; but a circumetance. which 
none of them were aware of. set them on fire with revenge, and made 
devils of them alL When they came to the few Indian houeee which 
they thought had been the town, which was not above half a mile oS, 
they were under a great disappointment, for there were not above 
twelve or thirteen houses ; and where the town was, or how big, they 
knew not. They consulted, therefore, what to do, and were lome time 
1)efore they could resolve ) for if they fell upon these, they must cut 
All their throats, and it wae ten to one but some of them might escape 
it being in the night, though the moon was up ; and if one escaped, 
he would run and raise all the town, bo they should have a whole 
army upon them : agair, on the other hand, if they went away an<i 
left those untouched, for the people were all aeleep, they could not 
tell which way to look for the town : however, the last was the best 
advice J bo they resolved to leave them, and look for the town as well 
OS they could. They went on a little way, and found a cow tied to a 
tree j this, they presently concluded, would he a good guide to them ; 
for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the town bbfore them, or 
the town behind them ; and if they untied her, they should sec which 
way she went ; if she went back, they had nothing to say to her ; but, 
if she went forward, they would follow her : so they cut the cord, 
which was made of twisted flags, and the cow went on before them, 
directly to the town ; which, as they reported, consisted of above two 
hundred houses or huts, and in some of these they found several 
families living together. 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep oonld 
make them; and, first^ they called another council, to consider wha* 
They had to do ; and, in a word, they resolved to divide themselves 
into three bodies, and so set three house* on fire in three parts of thfl 
town ; and as the men came out, to seize them and bind them (if any 
resisted, they need not be asked what to do then), and so to search 
the rest of the houses for plunder : but they resolved to march silently 
first through the town, and see what dimensions It waB ofi and If they 
might venture upon it or no. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would veotttD 
upon them '. but while they were animating one another to the work, 
three of them, who were a little before the rest, called o^It aloud to 
tben^ and told them that they had found Tom JtSry ; thtiy all VM

ap xo tie place, where they found the poor fellow hanging up naked 
by on© arm, and his throat cut. There was au Indian house just by 
the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal 
Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with ua before, and two 
or three of them wounded with our shot ; and our men found they 
were awake, and talking end to another in that houae, but kn»w fiot 
ihdir number. 

, The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as be« 
for©, that they ewore to one another they would be revenged, and that 
aot an Indian that came into their hands should have any quarter ; 
and to work they went immediately, and yet not so madly as might be 
expected from the rage and fury they were in. Their first care waa 
to get something that would soon take fire, but, after a little search, 
they found that would be to no purpose ; for most of the houses 
were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of which the country is 
fall : so they presently made some wild-fire, as we call it, by wetting 
a little powder in the palm of their hands ; and in a quarter of an 
hour they set the town on fire in four or five places, and particularly 
that house where the Indians were not gone to bed. 

As soon as the fire began to blaze, the poor frightened creatures 
began to rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate ia 
the attempt ; and especially at the door, where they drove them back, 
the boatswain himself killing one or two with his pole-axe ; the house 
\)tang large, a-nd many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a 
hand-grenado, and threw it among them, which at first frightened 
them, but, when it burst, made such havoc among them, that they 
cried out in a hideous manner. In short, most of the Indians who 
were in the open part of the house were killed or hurt with the grca- 
ado, except two or three who pressed to the door, which the boatswain 
and two more kept, with their bayonets on the muzzles of their piece% 
and despatched all that came in their way : but there was anothei* 
apartment in the house, where the prince or king, or whatever he 
waa, and several others were ; and these were kept in till the house, 
•which was by this time all a light flame, fell in upon them, and they 
were smothered together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not waken 
the people faster than they could master them ;. but the fire began to 
waken them fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a little 
together in bodies; for the fire grew so raj^inof, all the houses being 
mode of light combustible stufi", that they could hardly bear the skeet 
'between them ', and Uaeix bunness was to follow the fire^ for the sucet

c94 APVBNTDHES Of 

cxecakion ; us feet ae tb© fire either forced the peuple out ot those 
houses which were burning, or frightened thorn out of others, our 
people were ready at their doors to knock them on the head, still 
calling and hallooing one to another to remember Tom JeSrj. 

While thia waa doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and 
especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being nighty 
seemed to be just by me. My nephew, the captain, who was rouircd 
by his men, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing what 
the matter was, or what danger I was in, especially hearing the guns, 
too, for by this time they began to use their firearms; a thousand 
thoughts oppressed hia mind concerning me, and the supercargo, wl at 
would become of us ; and, at last, though he could ill spare any incro 
men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be m, he takes another 
boat, and with thirteen men and himself comes on shore to n^.e. 

He was surprised to see me and the sspercargo in the boat, with no 
more than two men ; and though he was glad that we were well, yet 
he was in the same impatience with us to know what wn^ doing: for 
the noise continued, and the flame increased ; in short, it was next to 
an impossibility for any man in the world to restrain their curiosity 
to know what had happened, or their concern for the safety of the 
men : in a word, the captain told me he would go and help his men, 
let what would come. I argued with him, as I did before with the 
men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interest of 
the owners and merchants, &c., and told him I and the two men 
would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was like 
to be the event, and come back and tell him. It was all one to talk 
to my aephew, as it was to talk to the rest before ; he would go, he 
aaid ; and he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship ; for he 
oould not think of having his men lost for want of help ; he had rath- 
er lose the ship, the voyage, and his life and all ; and away he went. 

I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade 
them not to go : so, in short, the captain ordered two men to row back 
the pinoaoe, and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an 
anchor ; and that when they came back, six men should keep the twe 
boats, and six more come after us ; so that he left only sixteen men 
in the ship ; for the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, 
whereof two were lost in the late quarrel which brought this mischief 
on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of the 
ground we trod on ; and being guided by the fire, we kept no path, 
hut went directly to the place of the flame. If the noise of the gam

suyprtelng to us T^efore, the cries ©f ths poor people \f&^ aotf 
quite of another nature, and filled us with horror. I must confeea I 
■waa never at the sacking a citj"-, or at the taking a town by storoj. I 
had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and kill- 
ing man, woman, and child ; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking 
the city of Magdeburg, and cutting the throats of twenty-two thou- 
Boad of all sesos; but I never had an idea of the thing itself before 
nor is it possible to describe it, or the horror that was upo» our 
minds at hearing it. Hqjjvevcr, we went on, and nt length ca«ie to 
the town, though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire 
The first object wc met with was tho ruins of a hut or house, or rath, 
er the ashes of it, for the house was consumed ; and just before it, 
plain enough to ho seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and 
three women killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the 
heap among the fire; in short, there were such instances of rage al- 
together barbarous, and of a fury aoraething beyond what was human 
and we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it ; or if 
they were the authors of it, wo thought they ought to be every one of 
them put to the worst of deaths. But this was not all : we saw the 
fire increased forward, and the cry went on just as the fire went on ; 
60 that we were in the utmost confusion. We advanced a Httle way 
farther, and, behold, to our astonishment, three naked women, and 
crying in the most dreadful manner, came flying as if they had wings, 
and after them sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror 
and consternation, with three of our Enghsh butchers in the rear ; 
who, when they could not overtake them, fired in among them, and 
one that was killed by their shot, fell down in our sight. When tha 
rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and that we would mur. 
der them as well as those that pursued them, they set up a most 
dreadful shriek, especially the women, and two of them fell down, as 
if already dead wiA the fright. 

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my 
Tains, when I saw this; and I believe, had the three English sailors 
that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them all : how- 
ever, wo took some ways to let tho poor flying creatures know that 
w« would not hurt them ; and immediately they came up to us, and 
kneeling down with their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentataon 
to us to save them, which we let them know we would; whereupon 
they crept all together In a huddle close behind us for protection. I 
l©ft ray men drawn up together, and charging them to hurt nobody,

possessed them, end ■vrhftc they intended to do, and to command £heBi 
off; Sksaurkig them that if they stayed till daylight, they would haye 
a hitodred thousand men about their ears : I say I left them, and weafe 
among those flying people, taking only two of our men with mo ; and 
there vraa indeed a piteous epectacle among them ; some of them had 
their feet terribly burned, with trampling and running through the 
fire, other* their hands burned ; one of the women had fallen down in 
tiie fire, and wae very much burned before she could get out again ; 
aad two or throe of the men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from 
o\ir men pursuing ; and another was shot through the body, and died 
while I was there, 

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was, bat I 
could not understand one word they said ; though, by signs, I perceiv- 
ed some of them knew not what was the occasion themselves. I w««> 
so ten-ified in my thoughts, at this outrageous attempt, that I coold 
not stay there, but went back to my own men, and resolved to go 
into the middle of the town, through the fire, or whatever might he 
in the way, and put an end to it, cost what it would : accordingly, as 
I came back to my men, I told them my resolution and commanded 
them to follow me ; when at the very moment came four of our mon, 
with the boatswain at their head, roving over heaps of bodies they 
had killed, all covered with blood and duet, as if they wanted more 
people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as they 
could halloo; and with much ado one of them made them heac, so 
that they knew who we were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like s shout oC 
triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come ; and without 
waiting to hear me, " Captain," says he, •* noblo captain ! I am glad 
you are come ; we are not half done yet : villanous hell-hound dogs ! 
I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs «pon his head; we 
kave Bworn to spare none of them; we'll root out the very nation of 
them from the earth ;'' and thus he ran on, out of breath, too, wiA 
•ction, and would not give us leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him a little, * Barba* 
rous dog !*' said I, "what are you doing ? I won't have one creature 
touched more, upon pain of death: I charge you, upon your life, to 
stop your hands, and stand still hero, or 3-ou are a dead man this min- 
ute." " ^^hy, sir," says he, " do you know what you do^ or what they 
have done ? If you want a reason fur what wo have done, come hith- 
er ,-" and with that he showed mo the poor fellow basging, with bia 



"-\ 

I confess I was urged then myBelf, and at another time would hava 
been forward enough ; but I thought they had carried their rage too 
far, and reuieuibered Jacob's words to his oons, Simeon and Leri — 
" Cursed be their auger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, for it was 
cruel." But I had now a new task upon my hands ; for when the 
nian I carried with me saw the sight as I had done, I had as much ts 
do to restrain them aa I should have done with the others, nay, my 
. nephew himself fell in with them, aud told me, in their heaiiug, that 
he was only concerned for fear of the men being overpowered, and 
as for the people, he thought not one of them ought to live, for they 
had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man, and 
that they ought to Le used like murderers. Upon thesa words, away 
ran eight of my men, with the boatswain aud his crew, to completa 
their bloody work ; and I, seeing it quita out of my power to restrain 
them, came away pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sight, 
much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell 
into their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the Bupercargo and two 
men, and with these walked back to the boat. It was a very great 
piece of folly In me, I must confess, to venture back as it wero alon» 
for as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had run over the 
ooimtry, there stood about forty men, armed with lauo«8 and bows, at 
the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned 
before ; but by accident I missed the place, and came directly to the 
seaside ; and by the time I got to the seaside it was broad day. Im- 
mediately I took the pinnace and went on board, aud sent her back to 
assist the men in what might happen. 

1 observed about the time that I came to the boat's aide, that the 
fire wajs pretty well out, and the noise abated ; but in about half ar 
hour after I got on board I heard a volley of oar men'e firearms, end 
Bttw a great smoke ; this, aa I imderstood afterward, was our men fall. 
Ing upon the men who, as I eaid, stood at the few houses on the way, 
of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set aU the houses oa 
fire, but did not meddle with the women or children. 

By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace, o\a 
men began to appear. They came dropping in, not in two bodies as 
they went, but straggling here and there, in such a manner that a 
small force of lesolute men might have cut them all o£ Bat the 
dxead of tham was upon the whole country ; and the men were sur- 
prised, and BO frightened, that I believe a hundred of them would 
)a&^ fl«d at the eiaht of }rat fire of our mea ; aor la all this terrible 



398 AJJVENIPtTRES OF 

ticttOnwas there a man that made any coiisidera'ble defeace; l^eyvWfre 
to turprised with the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of oer 
men ia the dark, that they knew not which way to turn themaelTes ; 
for if they fled one way, they were met by one party ; if back again, 
by another ; bo that they wore everywhere knocked down : nor did 
any of our men receive the least hurt, except one that sprained his 
foot, and another that liad one of his hands burned. 

I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and indeed with 
all the men, in my mind, but with him in particular, aa well for hia 
acting 60 out of his duty, as commander of the ship and having the 
charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting, rather than 
cooling, the rage of his blind men, in so bloody and cruel an enter- 
prise. My nephew answered me very re^ipectfully, but told me that 
when he saw the body of the poor seaman whom they had murdered 
in so cruel and barbarous a manner, he was not master of himself^ 
neither could he govern his passion; be owned he should not have 
done so, as he was commander of the ship ; but as he was a man, and 
nature moved him, he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men, 
they were not uubjeot to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so 
they took no notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any more of it Our 
men differed in the account of the number they had killed ; but ac- 
cording to the best of their accounts, put all together, they killed or 
destroyed about one hundred and fifty people, men, women, and 
children, and left nut a house standing in the town. As for the poor 
fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite dead (for his throat was so cut 
that his head was half off), it would do no service to bring bim away, 
so they only took hun down from the tree, where he was hanging by 
Dne hand. 

However just our men thought this action, I was against them in it, 
and I always after that time told them God would blast the voyage, 
for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be murder in 
them ; for though it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry 
wa« the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had violated or de- 
bauched a young woman of theirs, who came down to them innocently, 
and on the faith of the public capitulation. 

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterward on 
board. He said it was true we bad pecmed to break the truce, but 
really had not: and that the war waa begun the night before by the 
natives themselves!, who bad shot at us, and killed one of our aa«u 
rithnut anT,-iuat provocation ; so that as we wer« in a capacity tf 



ROBINSON CRUSOE- 39V 

fight them dow, we might also bo in a capacity to do ourselves justic* 
upon tliem in an extraordinary manner ; that though the poor maa 
had taken a littlo liberty with the wench, he ought not to have been 
mardered, and that in sucli a villanous manner; and that they did 
nothing but what was just, and what the laws of God allowed to bft 
done to murderers. 

One -would think this ehould have been eno«gh to have warned us 
against going on shore among heathens and barbarians ; but it is im- 
;pos8iblo 10 m<ake mankind wise but at their own expense, and their 
expferiencu seems to be always of most use to them when it is dearest 
bought. 

We wete now bound to the gulf of Persia, and from thence to tha 
owaet of C'cromandel, only to touch at Surat ; but the chief of the 
supercargo's design lay at the bay of Bengal, where, if he missed hit 
business ouiward bound, he was to go up to China, and return to iHxi 
ooas-t as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the gulf of Persia, whera 
five of our men venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the gulf, 
were surroonded by the Arabians, and either all killed or carried 
away into slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue 
them, and had but just time to get off their boat. I began to upbraid 
them with the just retribution of Heaven in this case; but the boat- 
swain very warmly told me, he thought I went further in my censures 
than I could show any warrant for in Scripture, and referred to Luke 
xiii. 4, where our Savior intimates that those men on whom the tower 
of Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans. But that 
which put me to silence in the case was, that not one of those five 
men who were now lost were of those who went on shore to the mas- 
sacre of Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men could not 
bear to hear the word massacre with any patience. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse con- 
sequences than I expected ; and the boatswain, who had been the 
head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me ha 
found that I brought that affair continually upon the stage; that I 
made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the men very ill on that 
account, and himself in particular ; that I was but a passenger, and 
had no command in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not 
obliged to bear it; that they did not know but I might have some iU 
design in my head, and perhaps to call them to an account for it when 
they came to England ; and thai, therefore, unless I Would resolve to 
hare done with it, and J|,1«o not to cotwern mjeelf any further with

lura, OY toy of his affairs, he would leave the ship ; for he did nei 
think tl was cafe to eail with me amo&g them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him, 
that I oonfeae I had all along opposed the maesaore of Madagascar, 
and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind freely ahoufc It, 
though not more upon him than any of the rest ; that as to having no 
oonuuand in the ship, that was true : nor did I exercise any au< 
thority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in things whici 
publicly concerned us all ; and what concern I had in the voyage wa» 
none of his business ; that I was a considerable owner in the ship ; 
in that claim, I had conceived I had a right to speak even farther 
than I had done, and would not be accountable to him or any one 
else ; and began to be a little warm with him. He made but littl* 
reply to me at that time, and I thought the afikir had been over. We 
were at this time in the road at Bengal ; and being wHliug to see the 
place, I went on shore with the supercargo in the ship's boat to divert 
myself; and toward evening was preparing to go on board, when one 
of the men came to me, and told me he would not have me trouble 
myself to come down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry m« 
on board any more. Any one may guess what a surprise I was in 
at so insolent a message ; and I asked the man who bade birp deliver 
iiiat message to me ? He told me the cockswain. I said no more to 
the fellow, but bade him let them know he had delivered his message, 
aad that I had given him no answer to it. 

1 immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told hija the 
story ; adding, which I presently foresaw, that there would be a ma« 
tiny in the ship ; and entreated him to go immediately on board th« 
iftiip in an Indian boat, and acquaint the captain of it. But I might 
have spared this intelligeooe, for before I had spoken to him on shore 
tike matter was effected on board. The boatswain, the gunuer, th« 
oarpeater, and all th« inferior oflSoerSj as soon as I was gone off in tho 
boat, oame up, and desired to speak with the captain ; and there tli« 
boatswain, maJciug a long harangue, and repeating aU he had enid to 
me, told the captain in a few words, that I was now gone peaceably 
on shore, they were loath to use any violence with me, which, if I had 
not gone on fhore, they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to 
have pone ; they therefore thought fit to tell biro, that as they shipped 
themselves to serve in the ship, under his command, they would per. 
form it well ajid faithfully ; but if I would not quit the ship, or th« 
captain oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail

at which all the Beamen, being got together there, cried wit, •' One

My nephevr, the captain, was a man of epirit, and of great presence 
of mind ; and though he waa surprised, you may be sure, at the thing, 
yet he told them calmly that he would consider of the matter; but 
that he could do nothing in It till he had spoken to me about it lie 
used some arguments with them to thow the unreasonableness and ia- 
jucticd of the thing ; but it was all in vain ; they swore and shook 
hands round before his face, that they would all go on shore, unless 
he would engage to thorn not to suffdr me to come any more on board 
tho ship. 

This was a hard article upon hiie, who knew his obligation to me, 
and did not know how I might take itj so he began to talk smartly 
to them; told them that I was a very considerable owner of the ship, 
end that, injustice, he could not put me out of my own house; that 
this was tho next door to serving me as the famous pirate Kidd had 
done, who made a mutiny in the ship, set the captain oa shore on an 
uninhabited island, and ran away •with the ship ; that let tbeui go into 
what ship they would, if ever they came to England again it would 
cost them very dear; that the ship was mine, and that he could not 
put me out of it ; and that he would rather lose the ship and the 
voyage too than disoblige me so much; so they might do as they 
pleased ; however, he would go on shore and talk with mo, and in- 
vited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might ac- 
commodate the matter with me. But they all rejected the proposal, 
and said they would have nothing to do with me any more ; and if I 
oame on board, they weald all go on shore. " Well," said the cap- 
tain, " if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with 
hinv'' So away he came to me with this account, a little after ^e 
sausage had been brought to me from the cockswain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess ; for I was not 
without *pjirehensic«is that they would confine him by violence, set 
tail, and run away with the ship ; and then I had been stripped naked 
in a remote counny, having nothing to help myself; in short, I had 
heen in a worse case than when I was alone in the island. But they 
had not come to that length, it seems, to my satisfaction ; and when 
my nephew told me what they had said to him, and how they had_ 
Bworn and shook hands that they would, one and all, leave the ship it 
I was suffered to come on board, I told him he should not be coae^med

Thii was a heavy piece of news to my nephew, hut there was no 
way to help it hut to comply ; eo, in short, he went on board the «hip 
again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their im< 
portunity, and had sent for his goods from on board the ship ; eo that 
the matter was over in a few hours, the men returned to their duty, 
sad I began to consider what course I should steer.

WAS now alone in the most remote part of the world, as I 
^ think I may call it, for I was near three thousand leagues by 
sea farther off from England than I was at my island ; only, 
it is true, I might travel here by land over the great Mogul's 
country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the 
gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the Desert of 
Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by sea again to 
Italy, and so overland into France ; and this put together might at 
least be a full diameter of the globe, or more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some English 
■hipfl, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the island of 
Sumatra, and get passage on board them for England. But as I oara« 
hither without any concern with the English East India Company, so 
h would be difficult to go from hence without their license, unless 
with great favor of the captains of the ships, or the Company's factors, 
and to both I was an utter stranger. 

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without me ; a 
treatment I think a man in my circumstances scarce ever met with, 
except when pirates running away with the ship, and setting those 
who would not agree with their villany on shore. Indeed, this was 
ne:jii door fo it, both ways ; however, mj nephew lefl me two aeryantei^

or rather one companion and one servant ; the first waa olerk to the 
parser, whom he engaged to go with me, and the other was his own 
servant. I took me also a good lodging m the house of an English- 
woman, where several merchants lodged, some French, two Italians, 
or rather Jews, and one Englishman ; here I was handsomely enough 
entertained ; and that I might not be said to run rashly upon any- 
thing, I stayed here ab<i,ve nine months considering what course (• 
take, and how to manage myself. I had some English gooda with m*' 
of value, and a considerable sum of money ; my nephew furnishing m« 
with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more, if 
I had occasion, that I might not be straitened, whatever might 
happen, j 

I quickly disposed of my gooda to advantage, and, as I originally 
intended, I bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all oth«r 
things, were the most proper for me, in my present circumstancM; 
because I could always carry my whole estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my return to 
England, none falling out to my mind, the English merchant wh« 
lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaint&nfl« 
with, came to me one morning. " Countryman," says he, " I hare a 
project to communicate to you, which, as it suits with my thoughti^ 
may, for aught I know, suit with yours also, whet you shall hav« 
thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, you by accident, and 
I by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from our own 
country ; but it is in a country where, by us, who understand trade 
and business, a great deal of money is to be got. If you will put on© 
thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here 
the first we can get to our minds ; you shall be captain, I'll be mer- 
chant, and we'll go a trading voyage to China: for what should w© 
stand still foi- ? The whole world is in motion, rolUng round and 
round, all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies and earthly, axe 
busy and diligent : why should we be idle ? There are no drones in. 
the world but men ; why should we be of that number V 

I liked this proposal very well, and the more because it seemed to 
he expressed with so much good will, and in so friendly a manner. I 
will not say but that I might, by my loose, unhinged circuraBtancoa, 
be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or, indeed, anything 
else ; whereas, otherwise, trade was none of my element. However, 
I might, perhaps, say with some truth, that if trade was not my ele- 
ment, rambling was, and no proposal for seeing any part of the worid 
which I had never seen before oould poesiblT come amisB to m«« 



404 JS»vaiiTrBfis 09- 

It "vras, however, some time before we could get a ship to our minde^ 
and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to get English sailorB j 
that is to say, so many as were necessary to govern the voyage, 
and manage the eailora which we should pick up there. After 
eome time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, English ; a 
Dutch carpenter, and three foremastmen. With these we found wo 
could do well enough, having Indian BeameO; euch as they were, to 
make xnp. 

There are so many travellers who have wrote the history of their 
voyages and travels this way, that \t would be very little diversion 
to anybody to give a long account of the places we went to, and tho 
people who inhabit there : these things I leave to others, and refer 
the reader to those journals and travels of Englishmen, of which 
many I find are published and more promised every day ; it is enough 
for me to tell you that we made this voyage to Achin, in the island 
of Sumatra, and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged eome of 
our wares for opium and some arrack ; the first a commodity whioh 
bears a great price among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was 
much wanted there. In a word, we went up to Suskan, made a very 
great voyage, weie eight months out, and returned to Bengal ; and I 
was very well satisfied with my adventure. I observe that our people 
In England often admire how ofiBcers which the Company send into 
India, and the merchants which generally stay there, get such very 
great estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth sixty or 
seventy thousand pounds at a time ; but it is no wonder, or at least 
we shaW see so much farther ioto it, when we consider the innumera* 
bla ports and places where they have a free commerce, that it will be 
none ; and much less will it be so when we consider that at those 
places and ports where the English ships come, there is such great 
and constant demands for the growth of all other countries, that there 
is a certain vent for the returna, a» well aa a market abroad for the 
goods carried out. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so much money 
by my first adventure, and such an insight into the method of getting 
more, that had I been twenty years younger, I should have been 
tempted to have stayed here, and sought no farther for making any 
fortune : but what was all this to a man upward of threescore, that 
was rich enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a restless 
desire of seeing the world than b covetous desire of gaining by it ? 
A&d, indeed, I think It is with great justice I now call it a restless 
dsAv^ toe k w^ Kt Whoi I \fG» o^ hosae, I was watless to qfi 



abroad ; and when I was abroad, I was restless to be at bom©. I 
eay, what was this gain to me ? I was rich enough already, nor had 
I any uneasy desires about getting more money ; and therefore the 
profit of the voyage t9 me was of no great force for the prompting 
mo forward to farther undertakings ; hence I thought that by thip 
Toyage I had made no progress at all, because I was come beck, as I 
might call it, to the place from whence I came, as to home : whereae 
my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied 
with seeing, was still desirous of wandering and seeing more. I waa 
come into a part of the world which I never was in before, and that 
part, in particular, which I had heard much of, and was resolved 
to see as much of it as I could; and then I thought I might say I 
had seen all the world that was worth seeing. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions : I do not name 
this to insist on my own, for I acknowledge his was the most just, and 
most suited to the end of a merchant's life; who, when h? is abroad 
apon adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as the best thing 
for him, which he is like to get the most mocey by. My new friand 
kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would have been content 
to have gone like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn, backward 
end forward, provided he could, as he culled it, find his account in it- 
On the otlier hand, mine was the notion of a mad rambling boy, that 
never cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not all ; I had a 
kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet the moa> 
unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go. lu the interval of 
these consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search for 
business, proposed another voyage to me among the Spice Islanda. 
and to briug home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or there* 
abouts ; places, indeed, where the Dutch trade, but islands belonging 
partly to the Spaniards ; though we went not so far, but to some 
other, where they have not the whole power, as they have at Batavia. 
Ceylon, &o. 

We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty 
WM In bringing me to come into it : however, at last, nothing els9 
offering, and finding that really stirring about and trading, the profit 
being 80 great, and, as I may say, certain, had more pleasure in It 
and had more satisfaction to my mind than sitting still, which, to me 
especially, was the unhappiest part of my life, I resolved on tW» 
voyage, too, which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo> 
and several Islands whose names I do not remember, and came homo 
in about fiiw aacnth^ We sold our eoloQ, whioh was oiiidfly elovQt

and 8^336 nutmega, vo the Peraian merchants, who carried them away 
to the gulf; aad makipg near five of one, we really got a great deal 
of money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me. ■' "Well, 
now," said he, with a eort of agreeable insult upon my indolent 
temper, " is not this better than walking about here, like a man of noth- 
ing to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense and igno- ' 
fancoof the pagans?" '' Y^hy, truly," says I, "my friend, I think 
it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles of merchandifiing; 
but I must tell you," said I, " by the way, you do not know what I 
am doing ; for if I once conquer my backwardness, and embark 
heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the world 
till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you 
lie Blill." 

Bet, to be short with my speculations, a little while after this there 
«aaie in a Dutch ship from Batnvia : she was a coaster, not a Eu- 
ropean trader, of about two hundred tons burden; the men, as they 
pretended, having been so sickly, that the captain had not hands 
enough to go to sea vrith, he lay by at Bengal ; and having, it seems, 
got money enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go for Eu- 
rope, he gave public notice he would sell his ship. This came to my 
ears before my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy 
f t ; eo I went to him, and told hha of it. He considered awhile, for 
he was no rash man neither ; but musing some time, he replied, " She 
is a little too big ; but, however, we will have her." Accordingly, 
we bought the ship, and agreeing with the master, we paid for her 
and took possession. When we had done so, we resolved to eutertai* 
the men, if we could, to join them with those we had, for the pursuing 
our business ; but on a sudden, they having received, not their wage% 
but their share of the money, as we afterward learned, not one of 
them was to be found ; we inquired much about them, and at lengtlj 
were told that they were all gone together by land to Agra, the great 
city of the jMogul's residence, and from thence to travel to Surat. and 
go by sea to the gulf of Persia. 

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should 
miss the opportunity of going with them ; for such a ramble, I thought, 
and in such company as would both have guarded and diverted mo, 
would have suited mightily with my great design ; and I should have 
both seen the world and gone homeward too ; but I was much better 
Batisfied a few days after, when I came to know what sort of fellowa 
thejr were ; for, in ehort, their history was, that this maa thej OftU«4

captain, was the gunner only, not the commander; that they had been 
a trading voyage, in which they had been attacked on shore by some 
of the Malays, who had killed the captain and three of his men; and 
that after the captain was killed, these men, eleven in number, had 
resolved to run away with the fchip, which they did, and brought het 
to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more oa shore ; of whom 
hereafter. 

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly by 
her, as we thought, though we did not, I confese, examine into thinge 
BO exactly as we ought : for we never inquired anything of the seamen 
who would certainly have faltered in their account, oontradioted one 
another, and perhaps contradicted themselves ; or one how or othei 
^e should have kiid reason to have suspected them ; but the ma-a 
showed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel Cloatershoveii, 
or some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and called him- 
self by that name, and we could not contradict him; and withal, 
ha\^ing no suspicion of the thing, we went through with our bargain. 
"Wo picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some 
Dutch ; and now we resolved for a second voyage to the southecust 
for cloves, &c. ; that is to say, among the Philippine and Molucca 
isles ; and, in short, not to fill up this part of my story with trifle-s, 
when what is to come is so remarkable, I spent from first to last, sit 
years in this country, trading from port to port, backward and foi . 
ward, and with very good success, and was now in the last year with 
my now partner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage to 
China, but designing first to Siani. to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and 
down a great while in the straits of Malacca, and among the islands, 
we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas than we foimd our 
ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all our industry, to 
find out where it was. This forced us to make some port; and my 
partner, who knew the country better than I did, directed the captain 
to put into the river of Cambodia ; for I had made the English mate, 
one Mr. Thompson, capiain, not being willing to take the charge of 
the ship upon myself This river lies on the north side of the great 
biiy or gulf which gees up to Siam. While we were here, and going 
often on shore for refreshment, there comes to me one day an English- 
man, and he was, it seems, a gunner's mate on board an English 
East India ship which rode in the same river, at or near the city of 
Cambodia ; what brought him hither we knew not ; but be eomes to 
sae, and speaking English, " Sir," says fee, " you are a gtr?tQ,?er to me.

I looked Bteadf&stlj ftt him a good while, and thought at firet I hod

I, « and not yourself^ what moves you to tell it to me T "I am 
moved," eaye he, " by the imminent danger you are in, and for aught 
I see you have no knowledge of it." ' I know no danger I am in," 
says I, " but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out ; but I ii>' 
tend to lay her aground to«morrow, to see if I can find it," " But, 
nx," says he, " leaky or not leaky, find it or not find it, you will b« 
wiser than to lay your ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what 
I have to say to you j do you know, sir," said he, "the town of Cam* 
bodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river ? and there are two largg 
English ships about five leagues on this side, and three Dutch:** 
^Well," said I, *'and what is that to me?" ''Why, sir," said he, 
"is It for a man that is upon such adventures as you ore, to oome 
into a port and not examine first what ships there are there, and 
• whether h© is able to deal with them ? I suppose you do not think 
you are a match for them ?" I was amused very much at his dis- 
course, but not amazed at it, for I oould not conceive what he meant ; 
and I turned short upon him, and said, "Sir, I wish yon would ex- 
plain yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of 
any of the Company's ships, or Dutch ships; I am no interloper; 
what can they have to say to me V He looked like a man half angry 
acd half pleased, and pausing awhile, but smiling, " "Well, sir," said 
be, " if you think yourself secure, you must take your chance ; I am 
Borry your fate should blind you against good advice ; but assure 
yourself if you do not put to sea immediately, you will the very

however, since you say there is no time to bo lost, and that there Is 
iome vilKnouB design on hand against me, I will go on board this 
minute, and put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the leak, or 
if we can swim without stopping it ; but, sir," said I, '■' shall I go

Hfht into it V' " I can t«U jeu but part of th^ story, bIt," says he 



*lrat I bave a Dutch seaman here with me, and I beliere I could 
persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is eoarce time for it) 
but the short of the st«ry is this, the first part of which, I euppooe, 
you know well enoughj viz. : that you were with thia ship at Sumatra; 
that there your captain was murdered by the Malays, with three of 
his men ; and that you or eom© of those that were oa board with you, 
ran away with the ship, and are eiace turned pirates. This is the sum 
cf the story, and you will all be seized as pirates, I can assure you, 
And executed with very little ceremony ; for you know merchant-ehipi 
^low but little law to pirates, if they get them into their power*' 
"Now you speak plain English,'' said I, ^aud I thank you; aod 
though I know nothing that we have done like what you talk of^ for 
I am sure we came honescly and fairly by the ship, yet seeing such 
ft work is doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I 
wi)l be upon my guard." "Nay, sir," says he, ''do not talk about 
being upon your guai-d ; the best defence is, to bo out of the danger; 
If you have any regard for your life, and the lives of all your men, 
put to sea, without fail, at high water ; and as you have a whole tide 
before you, you will be gone too far out before they can come down ; 
for they will come away at high water, and as they have twenty 
miles to come, you will get near two hours of them by the difference 
of the tide, not reckoning the length of the way ; besides, as they are 
only boats and not ships, they will not venture to follow you far oui 
to sea, especially if it blows." " Well," said I, " you have been very 
kind in this ; what shall I do for you to make you amends." ** Sir,* 
says he, '' you may not be willing to make me any amends, beoauM 
you may not be convinced of the truth of it; I will make an offer to 
you ; 1 have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship ***j 
which I came out of England m ; and the Dutchman that is with me 
had seven months' pay due to him ; if you will make good our pay to

desire no more : but if we do convince you that we have saved yoor 
lives, and the bhip^ and the lives of all the mea in ber, ^v»a wiU leas^ 
the rest to you. 

I consented to this readily, and went imme^ately on "boaani, and 
the two men with me. As soon as I ciime to the ship's side, my part- 
ner, who was on board, came out on the qnarter-deck, and called to 
me, with a great deal of joy, " ho I ho! we stopped the leak! 
we have stopped the leak !" " Say you so !" said I, " thank God ; but 
weigh anchor then immediately." " Weigh \" says he ; " what do you

" but all hands t« ^oik, and weigb withput losing a mmttte.*' He 
was Burprised, but, however, he called the captain, and he imnaediately 
ordered the anchor to be got up : and though the tide was not quite 
down, yet a little land breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I 
called him into the cabin, and told him the story ; and we called in 
the men, and they told us the rest of it : but as it took up a great deal 
of time before we had done, a seaman comes to the cabin door, and 
•ailed out to us that the captain bade him tell us we were chased. 
'* Chased !" says I ; '■' by what ?" " By five sloops, or boats," says the 
fellow, "full of men." "Very well," said I; "then it is apparent 
there is something in i|." In the next place I ordered all the men to 
be called up, and told them there was a design to seize the ship, and 
take us for pirates, and asked them if they would stand by us, and 
by one another : the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they 
would live and die with us. Then I asked the captain what way h« 
thought best for us to manage a fight with them ; for resist them I 
was resolved we would, and that to the last drop. He said readilj 
that the way was to keep them off with our great shot as long as we 
oould, and then ffre at them with our small arms, to keep them fronj 
boarding us ; but when neither of these would do any longer, w« 
should retire to our close quarters; perhaps they bad not materials 
to break open our bulk-heads, or get in upon us- 

The gunner had, in the meantime, orders to bring two guns to beat 
fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and load them with 
musket bullets and email pieces of old iron, and what came next to 
hands ; and thus we made ready for fight : but all this while we kept 
out to sea, with wind enough, and could see the boats at a distance, 
being five large long-boata, following us with all the sail they could 
mftke. 

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see were En- 
glish) outsailed the rest, were near two leagues ahead of them, and 
gained upon us considorably, so that we found they would come up 
with us; upon which we fired a gun without ball, to intimate that 
they should bring to ; and we put out a flag of truce, as • signal for 
parley ; but they came crowding after us, till they came within shot., 
when we took in our white flag, they having made no answer to ity

hig this, they came on till they were near enough to call to them with 
a speaking-trumpet which we had on board; so we called to them,

tiBder our Bters, so as to board us on our quarter; upon whioh, ««8ing 
thej were resolute for mischief, aad depended upon the strength that 
followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon 
our broadside ; when immediately we fired five guns at them, one of 
which had been levelled bo true as to carry away the stern of tht 
hindermost boat, and bringing them to the necessity of taking down 
their sail, and running all to the head of the boat to keep her from 
slaking ; bo she lay by, and had enough of it ; but seeing the foremosl 
b«at crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her in particular. 
WTiile this was doijag, one of the three boats, that was behind, being 
forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which wo had 
disabled, to relieve her, and we could see her take out the men ; wa 
called again to the foremost boat, and offered a truce, to parley again, 
and to know what her business was with us ; but had no answer, only 
she crowded close under our stern. Upon this our gunner, who waa 
ft very dexterous fellow, ran out his two chase guns, and fired again 
at her, but the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their 
caps, and came on ; but the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired 
among them a second time, one shot of which, though it missed the 
boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could easily see had 
done a great deal of mischief among them; but we took no notice of 
that, wore the ship again, and brought our quarter to bear upon 
them, and firing three guns more, we found the boat was almost split 
to pieces ; in particular, her rudder and a piece of her stern was shot 
quite away ; so they handed her sail immediately, and were in great 
disorder. But to complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two 
^uns at them again : where he hit them we could not tell, but we 
fi)uiid the boat was sinking, and some of the men already in the water : 
upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace, whioh we had kept 
close by our side, with orders to p'ok up some of the men, if they 
eould, and save them from drowning, and immediately come on board 
tiie ship with them, because we saw the rest of the boats began to 
eome up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, and took up 
tliree men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was a good while 
before we could recover him. Ag soon as they were on board, we 
crowded all the sail we could make, and stood farther out to sea ; and 
we found that when the other three boats came up to the first, they 
gave over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though 1 knew not th# 
reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended, I 
resolved that we should change our co'irseu and not le* anv on» kaQff

■whither we were going ; bo we stood out to sea eastward, qulv* 
out of the course of all European ships, whether they were hour.d 
to China or anywhere else withia the commerce of the European 
nations. 

When we were at sea, we began to consult with the two seameo. 
and inquire what the meaning of all this should be ; and the Dutchman 
let us into the secret at once, telling us that the fellow that sold us the 
•hip, as we said, was no more than a thief that had run away with 
her, Then he told us how the captain, whose name, too, he told us, 
though I do not remember it now, was treacherously murdered by 
the natives on the coast of Malacca, with three of his men ; and that 
Im^ this Dutchman, and four more, got into the woods, where they 
■wandered about a great while, till at length he, in particular, in a 
miracxtlouB manner, made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship, 
■which, sailing near the shore in its way from China, had sent their 
Wat on shore for fresh water ; that he durst not come to that part of 
the shore where the boat was, but made shift in the night to take the 
water &rther off, and swimming a great while, at last the ship's boat 
took him up. 

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of tho seaman 
belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travel*, 
and gave an account that the fellow who had run away with the ship 
sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, winch were gone a cruising iu 
her ; and that they had already taken on English ship and two Dutch 
ships very richly laden. 

{ This latter part was found to concern us directly, though vre knew 
it to be false J yet as ray partner said very justly, if we had fallen into 
iheir hands, and they had had such a prepossession against us before* 
hand, it had been in vain ua to have defended ourselves, or to hopf 
hv any good quarter at their hanJs ; end especially cousidering that 
oar accusers had been our judges, and that we could have expectsd 
xiothing from them but what rage would have dictated, and an un- 
governed passion have executed ; and therefore it was his opinion we 
•hould go directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, without 
potting in at any port whatever ; because there we could give a good 
ftfloount of ourselves, oould prove where we were when the ship put 
tBf of whom we bought her, and the like ; and which was more than 
ftll the rest, if we were put upon the necessity of Iringing it before 
tb« proper judges, we should be sure to have some Justice, and not be 
jlianged first and judged afterward.

Berious thinking I told him I thought it was a very great hazard far 
us to attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong sida 
of the Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should 
be sure to be waylaid on every side, as well by the Dutch of Bata* 
via as the English elsewhere ; that if we should be taken, as it were, 
Tunning away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there would 
want no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked the English »m1- 
or's opinion, who said he was of my mind, and that we should oer-' 
tainly be taken. This danger a little startled my partner, and all 
the ship's company, and we immediately resolved to go away to the 
eoast of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China ; and pursuing the 
first design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the ship, 
and come back in some of tho vessels of the country, such as we could 
get. This was approved of as the best method for our security ; and 
accordingly we steered away N, N. E., keeping about fifty leagues oft 
from the usual course to the eastward. This, however, put us to 
some inconvenience; for, first, the winds, when we came to that dis- 
tance from the shore, seemed to be more steadily against ua, blowing 
almost trade, as we call it, from the E. and E. N. E., so that we were a 
long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with vic- 
tuals for so long a run ; and, which was still worse, there was some 
danger that those English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us, 
whereof some were bound that way, might be got in before us, and if 
not, some other ship bound to China might have information of ufl 
from them, and pursue us with the same vigor. 

I must confess, I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, includ- 
ing the last escape from the longboats, to have been in the most dan- 
gerous condition that ever I was through my past life ; for whatever 
ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued for a thief be* 
fere ; nor had I ever done anything that merited the name of dishon' 
est or fraudulent, much less thievish ; I had chiefly been my own ' 
enemy, or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my 
own; but now I was embarrassed in the worst condition imaginable j 
for though I was perfectly iimocent, I was in no conditioa to maba 
tliat innocence appear ; and if I had been taken, it had be»n and*r s 
supposed guilt of the worst kind. This mado me very anxious to mak» 
an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or 
place we could go to. My partner seeing me thus dejected, though 
he was the most concerned at first, began to encourage me, and de- 
scribing to me the several ports of that coa«t. told me he would put in 
m the eoast of Oo«hia Chijia, or tike bay of Tonqius, bs^^aa^oig to gp 



414 ADVENTtTRBS OF 

■Xberwurd to Macao, a town onjce in poseeesion of the PortugtteBe, ftn4 
where etill a great many European families resided; and particularly 
the missionary priests ueoally went thither, in order to their going 
forward to China. 

Hither, then, we resolved to go ; and accordingly, though after a 
tedious and irregular course, and Tery much straitened for provisions, 
we came within sight of the coast very early in the morning ; and 
upon reflection on the past circumstances we were in, and the dongei: 
if we had not escaped, we resolved to put into a email river, which, 
however, had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we could, 
either overland or by the ship's pinnace, eome to know what shipa 
were in any port thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed, our de- 
liverance ; for though we did not immediately see any European shipa 
in the bay of Tonquin. yet the next morning there came into the bay 
two Dutch ships ; and the third, without any colors spread out, but 
which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues' 
distance, steering for the coast of China ; and in the afternoon went 
by two English ships steering the same course ; and thus we thougLt 
we saw ourselves beeet with enemies both one way and the other. 
The place we were ?.n was wild and barbarous ; the people thieveu, 
even by occupation or profession ; and though, it is true, we had not 
much to seek of them, and, except getting a few provisions, cared not 
how little we had to do with them, yet it was mth much difficulty 
that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them, several ways. 
We were in a small river of this country, withiu a few leagues of its 
utmost limits northward ; and by our boat we coasted northeast, to 
the point of land which opens the great bay of Tonquin: and it waa 
in this beating up along the shore that we discovered we were sur- 
rounded with enemies. The people we were among were the most 
barbarous of all the inhabitajuts of the coast, having no correspondence 
with any other nation, and dealing only in fish and oil, and such gross 
eommodities; and it may be particularly seen that they are the meet 
barbarous of any of the inhabitants. Among other customs, they 
hare this one, viz., that if any vessel has the misfonai«« to be ship- 
wrecked upon their coast, tbey presently make the men all prisoners 
or slaves ; and it waa not long before we found a pieut? of their kind- 
nese this way, on the occasion following : 

I have (. oserved above, that our ship sprung aleak at sea, and that 
we could not find it ont, and it happened that, as I have said, it was 
stopped unexpectedly in the happy minute of our being to be s«zed 
ky the Dutch ftnd £nfl;li^ ^ips ia the bay of Siam: vet ae te« did 



KOBiNflON G:^fr8o£. 415 

Bet find the ship go perfectly tight a»d nen&d ae we desirft^, we re* 
etrlved, while we were at this place, to lay her en shore, and take out 
what heavy things we had on board, and clean her bottom ; and, if 
possible, to find out where the leaks were. Accordingly, having light- 
ened the ship, and brought all our guns and other moveables to one 
side, we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom; 
but, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay her on dry grouoid} 
neither could we find a proper place for it. 

The iHhabitants, who had never been acquainted with euch a eighty 
eame wander4ng down the shore to look at us; and seeing the ship 
lie down on one side in such a manner, and heeling in toward the 
shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom with 
stages, and with their boats, on the off-side, they presently concluded 
that the ship was cast away, and lay so fast on the ground. On this 
supposition, they all came about us in two or three hours' time, with 
ten or twelve large boats, having some of them eight, some ten men 
in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on board and plundered 
the ship ; and if they had found us there, to have carried us away for 
slaves to their king, or whatever they call him, for we knew nothing 
of their governor. 

When they came vip to the ship and began to row round her, they 
discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom and 
side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man 
knows how. They stood for a while gazing at us, and we who were 
a little surprised, could not imagine what their design was ; but being 
willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us into the 
ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to those who 
were at work to defend themselves with, if there should be occasion ; 
and it was no more than need ; for in less than a quarter of an hour^s 
consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a wreck; 
and that we Avere all at work endeavoring to save her, or to save our 
lives by the help of our boats ; and when we handed our arms into 
the boats, they concluded, by that motion, that we were endeavoring 
to save some of our goods ; upon this they took it for granted we all 
belonged to them, and away they came directly upon our men, as if 
it had been in a line of battle. 

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we 
lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what 
they should do. I immediately called to the men that worked upon 
the stages, to slip them dewn, and get up the side into the ship ; and 
|)ade those in the boat to vovr roand, and come on board; aod tho»9 



"■ -^ ofxiz vv JO wara on board worked with all the sfcreogth (»id baand 
.;d, tu biiug the ship to rights; but, hoTn ever, neither the m^a 
.i;;ori the stages nor those in the boats could do as they were ordered^ 
-o-fore the Cochin Chinese were upon them ; and two of their boati 
|x)arded our longboat, and began to laj hold on tha men as tbait 
prisoners. : 

The first man they laid hold on was an English eeaman, a ttou^' 
strong fellow, who, having a musket in hia hand, never offered to fir« 
it, but laid it down in the boat, like a fool, a? I thought^ but he un* 
dorstood hia basinesa better than I could teach him, for he grappled 
the pagan, and dragged him by main force out of their boat into ours, 
where taking him by the eara, he beat his head so against the boat's 
gunnel, that the fellow died in his hands ; and, in the meantime, a 
Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and with the butt-end 
of it so laid about him, that he knocked down five of them who at- 
tempted to enter the boat. But this was doing little toward resistiDg 
thirty or forty men, who, fearless, because ignorant of their danger, 
began to throw themselves into the longboat, where wo bad but five 
men in all to defend it j but the following accident, which deserved 
our laughter, gave our men a complete victory. 

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as 
well aa to pay the seams where he had calked her to stop the leaks, 
had got two kettles just let down into the boat, one filled with boiUng 
pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such stuff as the 
fhipwrighta use for that work ; and the man that attended the car- 
penter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with which he supplied tha 
meu tbat were at work with the hot stuff; two of the enemy's men 
entered the boat just where this fellow stood, being in the foresheets; 
he immediately saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, 
which so burned and scalded them, being half naked, that they roared 
tmt like bulls, and enraged with the fire, leaped both into the sea. 
The carpenter saw it, and cried out^ " Well done, Jack I give them 
0ome more of it;'' and stepping forwai'd himself, takes one of the mops, 
and dipping it in the pitch- pot, he and his man threw it among them 
•o plentifully, that, in short, of all the men in the three boats there 
was not one that escaped beuig scalded and burned with it, in a most 
frightftil, pitiful manner, and made such a howling and crying, that I 
never heard a worse noise ; for it ia worth observing, that though 
pain naturally makes all people cry out, yet every nation has a par. 
tloalar way of exclamation, fn^ makes noisea aa different from on« 
•aotkat as their Bj7e«ch, I oannot . those creaturea mada 



&OBIKSON C&CSOK. 417 

ft better name than howling, nor a name more proper to the tone of 
it; for I never heard anything more like the noise of the -wulres, 
which, as I have said, J heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of 
Langnedoc. 

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life ; not only as it 
ras a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was inuninent be- 
{ors,but as we got this victory without any bloodshed, except of that 
man the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I was very 
much concerned at, for 1 was sick of killing such poor savage wretches^ 
even though it was in ray own defence, knowing they came on erranda 
which they thought just, and knew no better ; and that though it may 
be a just thing, because necessary (for there is no necessary wicked- 
ness in nature), yet I thought it was a sad life, when we must be al^ 
ways obliged to be killing our fellow-creatures tv preserve ourselves; 
and, indeed, I think so still, and I would even now suffer a great deal 
rather than I would take away the life even of the worst person in- 
juring me ; and I believe all considering people who know the value 
of life would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously into the ooa- 
eideration of it. 

But to return to my story. All the while this waa doing, my part, 
ner and I, who managed the rest of the men on board, had with great 
dexterity brought the ship almost to rights, and having got the guna 
into their places again, the gunner called to me to bid our boat get out 
the way, for he would let fly among them. I called back again to 
him, and bid him not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work 
without him; but bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, 
who was on board, took care of; but the enemy waa eo teirified with 
what they had met with in their first attack, that they would not com© 
on again ; and some of them who were farthest off, seeing the ship 
swim, as it were, upright, began, as we suppose, to see their mistake, 
and give over the enterprise, finding it was not as they expected. Thus 
■we got clear of this merry fight, aud having got some rice, and soma 
joots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on board, two days before^ 
we resolved to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came of 
it ; for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day 
with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dispose 
offer Hi We therefore got all our things on board the same evenings 
and the next morning were ready to sail; in the meantime, lying at 
anchor et some distance from the shore, we were not so much co* 
oemed, being now in a fighting posture, as well as In a sailing posture, 
If ft&y vnemj had presented. The next day, having finished oar wax!;

withia ftoard, tuai. finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her 
leaks, we set eail. We would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for 
we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning 
the Dui-eh ehips that had been tliere ; but we durst not stand in there 
because we had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little 
before ; so we kept on N. E. toward the island of Formosa, as much 
a£*aid of being seen by a "Dutch or English merchant ship, as a Dutch 
or English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algeriae 
man-of-war. 

When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. as if we would go 
to the Manillas or the Philiipine islnnds, and this we did that we might 
not fall into the way of any of the European ships ; and then we 
steered north, till we came to the latitude of 22 deg. 30 min.,by which 
meacs we made the island Formosa directly, where we came to at, 
anchor, in order to get water, and fresh provisions, which the people 
there, who were very courteous and civil in their manners, supplied 
us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all 
their agreements and bargains, which is what we did not find among 
other people, and may be owing to the remains of Christianity which 
was once planted here by a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a 
testimony of what I have often observed, viz. : that the Christian rfi- 
ligion always civilizes the people and reforms their manners, where it 
is received, whether it worJcs saving effects upon them or no. 

From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an 
equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports of China 
where our European ships usually come ; being resolved, if possible, 
not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this country ; where, 
M our circumstances wery, we could not fail of being entiralj 
ruined. 

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved 
to put into the first trading port we should come at ; and standing in 
for the shore, a boat came off two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese 
pilot on board, who knowing us to be a European ship, came to offer 
his service, which, indeed, we were glad of, and took liim on board; 
upon which, without asking us whither wo would go, he dismissed tliS 
boat he came in, aud sent it back. 

I thought it wa"? now so much in our choice to make the old man 
carry us whither he would, that I began to talk to him about carry- 
ing UH to the gulf of Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the 
coast of China. The old man said he knew the gulf of Nanquin very 
vail, but aDuIiuigr. asked ua what wo would do there. I told hijn we 



* BOSTNSON catJsoE. 41 § 

would Bell Oui- cargo and purchase China wares, ealiooes, raw^ silks, 
tea, wrought silks, &c., and so would return by the same eourse we 
came. He told us our best port had been to put in at Macao, where 
ire could not have failed of a market for our opium to our satisfnc- 
tion, and might for our money have purchased all sorts of China goods 
M cheap as we could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was < 
Very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well 
as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and sec the great city of 
Peking, and the famous court of the monarch of China. " Why, then," 
B&ys the old man, "you should go to Ningpo, where, by the river which 
runp into the sea there, you may go up within five leagues of th» 
great canal. This canal is a navigable stream, which goes through 
the heart of that vast empire of China, crosses all the rirers, passes 
some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up 
to the city of Peking, being in length near two hundred and seventy 
leagues." 

" Well," said I, " Senhor Portuguese, but that is not our business 
COW) the great question is, if you can carry us up tothecity of Nanquin, 
from whence we can travel to Peking afterward V Ho said ho could 
do so very well, and that there was a great Dutch ship gone up that 
way just before. This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was 
now our terror, and we had much rather have met the devil, at least 
if he had not come in too frightful a figure : and we depended upon 
it that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no con- 
dition to fight them ; all the ships they trade with into those parts be- 
ing of great burden, and of much greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused, and under some concern, 
when he named a Dutch ship ; and said to me, " Sir, you need be un- 
der no apprehensions of the Dutch ; I suppose they are not now at 
war with your nation !" " No,'' said I, " that's true ; but I know not 
what liberties men may take when they are out of the reach of tha 
laws of their own country." "Why," says he, "you are no pirates; 
what need you fear ? They will not meddle with peaceable mer- 
chants, sure." 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face a6 
that word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by 
nature to circulate it, for it put me into the greatest disorder and con* 
fusion imaginable ; nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but 
the old man easily perceived it. 

** Sir," says he, *' I find you ars m spme disorder ia your thoughts

pead opoa it, I'll do you all the service I can.*' " Why, oenhor," 
said I, '< it is true I am a little unsettled in my resolution at this time, 
whither to go in particular ; and I am something more so for vi-hat 
you said about the pirates. I hope there are no pirates in these seas ; 
yre are but in an ill condition to meet with them, for you see we have 
but a small force, and are but very weakly manned." " 0, sir,'' saye 
be, " don't be conoemed, I do not know that there have been any pi* 
rates in these seas these fifteen years, except one, which was seen, aa 
I hear, in the bay of Siam, about a month since ; but you may be as- 
sured she has gone to the southward; nor was she a ship of any great 
force, or fit for the work ; she was not built for a privateer, but was 
run away with by a reprobate crew that was on board, after tlie cap- 
tain and some of his men had been murdered by the Maylayane, at or 
near the island of Sumatra." " What !" said I, seeming to know noth- 
ing of the matter, " did they murder the captain ?" '• No," said he, ** I 
don't understand that they murdered him ; but as they afterward ran 
away with the ship, it is generally believed that they betrayed him 
into the hands of the Malayans, who did murder him; and perhaps 
they procured them to do it." " "Why, then," said I. " they deserve 
death as if they had done it themselves." "Nay," says the old man, 
" they do deserve it ; and they will certainly have it, if they light 
upon any English or Dutch ship ; for they have all agreed together, 
that if they meet that rogue they'll give him no quarter." "But," 
said I to him, '* you say the pirate is gone out of these seas ; how oaa 
Ihey meet with him then ?" ** Why, that's true," says he, " they do 
•ay BO ; but he was, as I tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river 
Cambodia ; and was discovered there by some Dutchmen who be- 
longed to the ship, and who were lef^ on shore when they ran away 
vithher; and some English and Dutch traders being in the river, 
flxey were within a little of taking him ; nay," said he, "if they forfr- 
most boats had been well eeoonded by the rest, they had certainly ta 
kfiB him; but he, finding only two boats within reach of him, taoked 
about, and fired at those two, and disabled them before the others 
«ame up, and then standing off to sea, the others were not able to fol- 
low, and so ho got away ; but they have all so exact a description of 
the ship, that they will be sure to know her ; and wherever they find 
her they have vowed to give no quarter either to the captain or sea- 
men, but to hang them all up to the yard-arm." " What !" said I, 
" will they execute them right or wrong , hang them first ^nd judge

them back to back, and set them a diving, it is no more than they 
deserve." 

I knew I had my old man fast on board, and that he could do no 
liarm, so that I turned short upon him : " Well now, eenhor," said I, 
" this ia the very reason why I would have you carry us up to Nan- 
quin, and not put back to Macao, or to any other part of the country 
where the English or Dutch ships come ; for be it known to you, sen- 
bor, tliose captains of the English and Dutch ships are a parcel of 
raah, proud, insolent fellows, that neither know what belongs to jua- 
tioo, nor how to behave themselves as the laws of God and nature direct j 
but being proud of their oflSces, and not understanding their power, they 
would act the murderers to punish robbers ; would take upon them 
to insult men falsely accused, and determine them guilty without duo 
inquiry ; and perhaps I may live to bring some of them to aooounfc 
for it, when they may be taught how justice is to be executed ; and 
that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some evidence fnaj 
be had of the crime, and that he is the man. 

"With this I told him that this was the very ship they attaoKed, ani, 
gave him a full account of the skirmish we had with their boats, and 
how foolishly and covfsrdly they behaved. I told him all the story 
of onr buying the ship, and how the Dutchman served us. I told him 
the reasons I had to believe the story of killing the master of the Ma- 
layans was true, as also the running away with the ship ; but it wa« 
all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men had turned pirates, 
and ftiey ought to have been sure it was so before they ventured to 
attack us by surprise, and oblige us to resist them ; adding, that they 
would have the blood of thoee men, whom wo killed there in just d«« 
fwice, to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told ue we were very 
much in the right to go away to the north j and that if he might aA 
vi«ft as, it should be to soil the ship in China, which wo might very 
well do, aad bay or build another in the country ; * and, said h«; 
though you will not get so good a ship, yet you may get on© abla 
enough to carry you and all your goods back to Bengal, or anywhere 
else." I told him I wotdd take his advice when I came to any port 
where I could find a ship for my turn, or got any customer to buy 
this. He replied, I should meet with customers enough for the ship 
at Nacquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me very well to ^ 
back ^&^ 'i ^^^ ^hat he would procure me peopk both to buy one

know the ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measores, b« 

instramental to bring some honest, innocent men into a terrible broil, 
and pei-haj)S to bo murdered in cold blood ; for ■v^•herever they find 
t}e ship, they will prove the guilt upon the men, by proving that this 
Tra8 the ship, and so innocent men may pi-obably be overpowered autj 
iuurdered." " Why," says the old man, " I'll find out a way to pre'' 
rent that also ; for as I know all those commanders you speak of very 
well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will be sure to aei 
them to rights in the thing, and let them know that they have been 
so much in the wrong ; that though the people who were on board a( 
first might run away with the ship, yet it was not true that they had 
turned pirates ; and that, in particular, these were not the men that 
first went off with the ship, but innocently bought her for the trade j 
and I am persuaded they will so far believe me, as at least to act 
more cautiously for the time to come. 

While these things were passing between us, by way of discourse, 
we went forward directly for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days' 
sail came to an anchor at the southwest point of the great gulf of 
Nanquin; where, by the way, I came by accident to understand that 
two Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and that I . should 
certainly fall into their hands. I consulted my partner again in this 
exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was, and would very 
gladly have been safe on shore almost any where ; however, I was not 
in such perplexity neither, but I asked the old pilot if there was no 
creek or harbor which I might put into and pursue my business with 
the Chinese privately, and be in no danger of the enemy. He told 
me, if I would sail to the southward about forty-two leagues, there 
was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission 
usually landed from Macao, on their progress to teach ihe Christian 
religion to the Chinese, and where no European ships over put in ; and 
if I tkought to put in there, I might consider what further course to^ 
take when I was on shore. Ilo confessed, he said, it was not a place 
for merchants, except that at some certain times they had a kind of a 
fair there, when the merchants from Japan came over tiuther to buy 
Ihe Chineso merchandizes. 

We all agreed to go back to this place ; the name of the port, as ho 
called it, T may perhaps spell wi'ong, fur I do not particularly re- 
member it, having lost this, together with the names of many other 
places set down in a little pocket-book, wuich was spoiled by the 
wator by an accident; but this I remember, that the Chinese or 
Japaaese merchants we oorre^poaded with called it \>y a di0ercn6 



KOBINSON CRUSOK. 4M 

name froin that whidh our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounoed 
it as above, Quinchang. 

As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this place, we 
weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shove where we 
were to get fresh water ; on both which occasions the people of the 
•ountry were very civil to us, and brought us abundance of things to 
sell to us, I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some fowlSj 
but nothing without money. 

"We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till fir* 
days, but it was very much to our satisfaction ; and I was joyful, and 
I may eay thankful, when I set my foot on shore, resolring, and my 
partner, too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and effects 
any other way, though not every way to our satisfaction, we would 
never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel more ; and. indeed, I 
must acknowledge, that of all the circumstances of life that ever I had 
any experience of, nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as 
that of being in constant fear. Well does the Scripture say : " The 
fear of man brings a snare ;" it is a life of death, and the mind is so 
entirely oppressed by it^ that it is capable of no relief 

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by heighten- 
\ng every danger, representing the English and Dutch captains to be 
men incapable of hearing reason, or of distinguishing between honest 
men and rogues ; or between a story calculated for our own turn, made 
out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true genuine account of 
our whole voyage, progress, and design ; for we might many ways 
have convinced any reasonable creature that we were not pirates ; the 
goods we had on board, the course we steered, our frankly showing 
ourselves, and entering into such and such ports ; and even our very 
manner, the force we had. the number of men, the few arms, littl» 
ammunition, short pjovisions ; all these would have served to convince 
any men that we were no pirates. The opium and other goods we had 
on board would make it appear the ship had been at Bengal. Th« 
Dutchmen, who. it was said, had the names of all the men that were 
^nthe ship, might easily see that we were a mixtuire of English, Por- 
tuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and 
many other particular circumstances, might have made it evident to 
the understanding of any comma'idfir. whope hands wo might fall into, 
that we were no pirates. But fpnr. that blind, nsek-s passion, worked 
another way, and threw na into the vnpors: it bewldpred our under- 
Btandin^s. and set the imagination at work to form a thousand terribh? 
thinas that oerbaDS misht never haocea We first eutjcosed. as lii 



424 APVENTTEBs or 

deed cTery bodj else had relatew <v aa, that the Beftmen on board th3 
Ungliah and Du<>ch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enrag6(> 
at the name of a pirate, aud especially at our beatisg off their boiitn 
and escaping, that they would not give themselyes leave to iuqnuc 
whether we were pirates or no ; but would execute us off-hand, as we 
call it, without giving us any room for a defence. We reflected that 
ihere really was bo much apparent evidenois before them, th; t they 
tfould scarce inquire after any more ; as, first, that the sliip wns ccr- 
tainly the same, and that some of the seamen among them knew her, 
end had been on board her ; and, secondly, that when we liad iutelli- 
genco at the river of Cambodia that they were coming down to ox. 
amine us, we fought their boats and fled • so that we made no doubf 
but they were as fully satisfied of our being pirates, as we Avere tatis^ 
fled of the contrary ; and, aa I often said, I know not but I ehoulj 
Uave been apt to have ta?ien those circumstances for evidence, if the 
tables were turned, and my case was theira; and have made no scruple 
of cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, or perbap* con 
eidering, what they might have to offer in their defen 

But let that be ho>. it will, these were our apprehensions ; and 
both my partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming o! 
halters and yard-arms, that ia to say, gibbets ; of fighting, and being 
taken ; of killing, and being killed ; aud one night I was in such a 
fury in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I wa*; 
knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck my doubled fist 
against the side of the cabin I lay in, with such a force, aa wounded 
my hand grievously, broke my knncklea, and out and bruised the fleshj. 
K) that it awaked me out of my sleep. 

Another apprehension I had was, the cruel usage we might tnMfc 
with from them if we fell into their hands ; then the story of Amboynfc 
came into my head, and how the Dutch might perhaps torture us, a& 
ihey did our countrymen there, and make some of our men, by ex- 
tremity of torture, confess those crimes they never were guilty of, or 
own themselves and all of us to be pirates, and so they would put us 
to death with a formal appearance of justice ; and that they might be 
tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo, which was worth 
four or five thousand pounds, put altogether. 

These things tormented me and ray partner too, night and day ; nor 
did we consider that the captains of fhips have no authority to act thus ; 
and if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer 
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable for it 
when thov came to thoir own country j tills, I say, gave mo no satis- 



KOBINSON GBtrsos. A%S 

faction ; for if thoy wero ta aol tbus wiik vlb, what adTantege would 
it be to us that tfaey should ^e called to an account for it ? or if w« 
were first to be murdered, wha^ satisfaetion would it be to us to have 
them punished when they oame home 7 

I oannot refrain taking notice hftre what reflections I now had upoa 
the vast variety of my particular cvrcumstancea; bow hard I thought 
St was, that I, who had spent forty years in a life of continual diffi- 
eulties, and was at last come, as it we?e, to the port or haven whioh 
all men drive at, viz., to have rest and plenty, should be a volunteer 
in new sorrows by my own unhappy choice ; and that I, who had 
escaped bo many dangers in my youth, ehoM''d now come to be hanged 
in my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime which I was not 
in the least inclined to, much less guilty of. 

After these thoughts, something of religion would come in ; and I 
would be considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of 
immediate Providence, and I ought to look upo<? it and submit to it 
as such ; that although I was innocent as to men, I was far from 
being innocent as to my Maker ; and I ought to look in and examina 
what other crimes in my life were most obvious to nw, and for which 
Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a reJribution ; and 
that I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck, if it had 
pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me. 

In its turn, natural courage would sometimes takes its place, aad 
then I would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions ; that I 
would not be taken to be barbarously used by a parcel of meroileM 
wretches in cold blood ; that it were much better to have fallen into 
the hands of iJhe savages, though I was sure they would feast opoa 
me when they had taken me, than those who would perhaps glut their 
rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities ; that in the csM 
of the savages I always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp, and 
why should 1 not do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to m«^ 
at least, to think of falling into these men's hands, than ever it was to 
think of being eaten by men ? for the savages, give them their dne^ 
would not eat a man till he was killed and dead, but that theee men. 
had many arte beyond the cruelty of death. Whenever these thoughts 
prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the agi- 
tation of a supposed fight; my blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, 
as if I was engaged, and I always resolved to take no quarter at their 
hands ; but, even at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow op 
the ship and aU that wa« in her, and leave them but lit^e Vdoly t« 
boast of. 



i26 ADVRNTUKBS OF 

The greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these thitiga 
were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was our satis, 
faction when we saw OTireelves on shore ; and my partner told me he 
dreamed he had a very heavy load upon his hack, which he was to 
carry up a hill, and found that he was not ahle to stand longer under 
it : hut that the PortugueRe pilot came and took it off his hack, and 
the hill disappeared, the ground hefore him appearing all smooth and 
plain : and truly it was so ; they were all like men who had a load 
taken off their backs. For my part, I had a weight taken off from 
ray heart that it was not able any longer t^ bear ; and, as I said above, 
Te resolved to go no more to sea in that ship, "When we came on 
ihore. the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a lodging and a 
warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was much the i?ame ; it 
was a little house, or hut, with a larger house adjoining to it, all huili 
with canes, and palisadoed round with lai-ge canes, to keep out pilfer- 
ing thieves, of which, it seems, there were not a few in that country ; 
however, the magistrates allowed ue a little guard, and we had a 
eoldier with a kind of halberd, or half-pike, who stood sentinel at our 
door ; to whom we allowed a pint of rice, and a little piece of money, 
About the value of three-pence, per day, so that our goods were kept 
very safe. 

The fair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had been over some 
time ; however, we found that there wore three or four junks in the 
river, and two Japaners, I mean ships from Japan with goods which 
they had bought in China, and were not gone aw ay, having some 
Japanese merchants on shore. 

The lirst thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was, to get ub 
Rcquaintcd with three missionary Romish priests who were in town, 
and who had been there some time converting the people to Christi. 
anity : but we thought they made but poor work of it, and made them 
but sorry Christians when they had done ; however, that was none of 
our business. One of these was a Frenchmen, whom they called 
Father Sioion ; another was n Portuguese, and the third, a Genoese; 
but Father Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and very agree- 
able company ; the other two were more reserved, seemed rigid and 
austere, and applied seriously to the work they came about, viz., to 
talk with, and insinuate themselves among, the inhabitants, wherever 
they had opportunity. Wo often ate and drank with those men ; and 
though, I must confess, the conversion, as they call it, of the Chinese 
to Christianity is so far from the true conversion required to bring 
tiiathen peqple to the faith of Christ, that it seema to amount t«/ little 



BoamsoN CRUSOE. ^^^ 42T 

tatre than Idtting tliein know the oame of Christ, and ssy eotne prayera 
to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue which they understand 
not, and to cross themselves, and the like; yet it nmet he confessed 
that the religionists, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief 
that these people will be eaved, and that they are the instruments 
of it; and, on this account, they undergo not only the fatigue o£ 
the voyage, and the hazards of living in such places, but often^ 
times death itself, with the most violent torture?, for the sake of this 
work. 

But to return to my story. This French priest, Father Simon, was 
appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the Mission, to go up to 
Peking, the royal seat of the Chinese emperor, and waited only for 
another priest, who was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go 
along with him ; and we scarce ever met together but he was uiviting 
me to go that journey ; telling me how he would show me all the 
glorious things of that mighty empire, and, among the rest, the greatest 
city in the world ; a city, said he, that your London and our Paris 
put together, cannot be equal to. This was the city of Peking, which, 
I confess, is very great, and infinitely full of people : but as 1 looked 
on those things with different eyes from other men, so I shall give my 
opinion of them in a few words, when I come in course of my travels 
to speak more particularly of them. 

But, firet, I come to my friar or missionary. Dining with him one 
day, and being very merry together, I showed some little inclination 
to go with aim ; and he pressed me and my partner very hard, and 
with a great many persuasions, to consent. " Why, Father Simon," 
says my partner, ** should you desire our company so much ? you 
know we are heretics, end you do not love us, nor cannot keep us 
company with any pleasure." "0," says he, "you may perhaps be 
good Catholics in time; my business here is to convert heathens, and 
who knows but I may convert you, too ?" " Very well, Father," said 
I, **60 you w.M preach to us all the way V "I will not be trouble- 
some to you," says he ; " our religion does not divest us of good man- 
ners : besides, we are here like countrymen ; and so we are, compared 
to the place we are in ; and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, 
we may all be Christians at last ; at least, we are all gentlemen, and 
we may converse po, without being uneasy to one another." I liked 
this part of his discourse very well, and it began to put me in mind of 
my priest I had left in the Brazils ; but this Father Simon did not 
come up to his character by a great deal; for though Father Simon 
bad uo £u>peajaAC@ of a, eriaiiul levity in hisa. Qelther,yet he had noi

Aot fund of ChristiaQ xeal, etriet piety, and Bincere affeotioD to 
v^gloa, ^at my other good ecclesiastio had. 

But to leave him a little, though he never left iie, nor eoliciting us 
to go with him, we had something else before us at first, for we had 
ail this while our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and we 
be^as to be rery doubtful what we should do, for we were now in a 
place of very little businesa ; and once I was about to venture to sail 
jbr the river of Kilara, and the city of Nanquin : but Prov>deace 
veemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever, to concern itself io 
«ar affairs ; and I was encouraged, from this very time, to think I 
should one way or other get out of this entangled circumstance, and 
be brought home to my own country again, though I had not the least 
fiew of the manner. Providence, I say, began here to clear up ouv 
way a little; and the first thing that ofTered was. that our old Portu- 
f aese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who inquired what gooda 
we had ; and, in the fij-st place, he bought all our opium, and gave ua 
a very good price for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in small 
pieees of their own coin, and eome in email wedges, of about ten or 
eleven ounces each. While we were dealing with him for our opium, 
it oame into my head that he might perhaps deal for the ship, too, and 
I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him : he sliruggcd up hia 
shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him ; but in a few days 
after be oame to me, with one of the missionary priests for hie in- 
terpreter, and told me had a proposal to make to me, which was this : 
be bad bought a great quantity of goods of us, when he had no thoughts 
of proposals made to him of buying the ship ; and that, therefore, he 
bad not money enough to pay for the ship : but that if I would let 
Ibe same men who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the 
riiip to go to Japan ; and would send them from thence to the Philip- 
pine islands with another loading, which he would pay the freight of 
before they went to Japan, and that at their return he would buy the 
eiup. I began to listen to his proposal, and so eager did my head 
still run upon rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a 
notion of going myself with him, and bo to sail from the Philippine 
islands away to the South Seas : accordingly I asked the Japanese 
merchant if he would not hire us to the Philippine islands, and dis- 
ebarge oe there. He said no, he oould not do that, for then he could 
not have the return of his cargo : but he would discharge us in Japan, 
at the ship's return. Well, still I was for taking him at that propo- 
sal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, persuaded 
»• from it^ represeatbg the dangers, as well of the seas as of the

But to brixi^ this long turn of our affairs to a ooacluBion : the firei 
thing we had to do was, to consult with the oaptaio of the ship, aad 
"olth his men, and know If they were willing to go to Japan : and 
'while I was doing this, the young man whom my nephew had left 
with me as my companion for my travels camd to me, and told at* 
that he thought that voyage proijaised very fair, and that there WM a 
great prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I nader- 
took it; but that if I would not, and would give him leave, he would 
go as a merchant, or how 1 pleased to order him ; that if ever ha 
eame to England, and I was there and alive, he would render me • 
fiiithful account of his suooess^ which would be as much mine M I 
pleased. I was really loath to part with him ; but oonmderinf ibe 
prospect of advantage, which was really considerable, and thAk he 
was a young fellow as likely to do well in it ae any I knew, I !acline4 
to let him go ; but I told him I would consult my partner, aad gite 
him an answer the next day. My partner and I discoursed about It. 
and my partaer made a most generous offer, " You know it ha« been 
an unlucky ship,'' said he, *' and we both resolved not to go to sea b) 
it again : if your steward" ( so he called my man) "will venture ths 
royage, I Trill leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him malio 
tb.e best of it ; and if we live to meet in England, and he meet* with 
success abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of tke 
chip's freight to us ; the other shall be his own." 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young awu^ 
made him such an offer, I could no less than offer him the same ; aa4 
all the chip's company being wilUhg to go with him, wt made 0f99 
/<alf the ship to him in property, and took a writing from him, ob,

Tfhich he brought -vrith him, he went back to the Manillas to the 
Spaniards, where he sold his cargo very well. Here, having got a 
good acquaintance at Manilla, he got bis ship made a free ship; and 
the governor of Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco in America, oa 
tbo coast of Mexico, and gave him a license to land there, and to 
travel to Mexico, and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe with all 
his men. Ho made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and there 
he sold his stiip ; and having there also obtained allowance to travel 
by land to Porto Bello, he found means, some how or other, to get to 
Jamaica, with all his treasure ; and about eight years after, came to 
England exceedingly rich, of which I shall take notice in its place; in 
the meantime, I return to our particular affairs. 

Being now to part with the ship and ship^s company, *. came be- 
fore us, of course, to consider what recompense we should give to the 
two men that gave us such timely notice of the design against us in 
the river Cambodia. The truth was, they had done us a very con- 
siderable service, and deserved well at our hands; though, by the 
way, they were a couple of rogues, too ; for as they believed the story 
of our being pirates, and that we had really run away with the ship, 
they came down to ns not only to betray the design that was formed 
against us, but to go to Bea with us as pirates ; and one of them con- 
fessed, afterward, that nothing else but the hope of going a-roguing 
brought him to do it ; however, the service they did us was not the 
less ; and therefore, as I had promisied to be grateful to them, I first 
ordered the money to be paid them which they said was due to them 
'n board their respective ships ; over and above that I gave each ol 

?m a small sum of money in gold, which contented them very well; 

..^n I made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the gunner being 

now made second mate and purser; the Dutchman I made boatswain; 

GO they were both very well pleased, and proved very serviceable^ 

being both able seamen, and very stout fellows. 

We were now on shore in China ; if I thought myself banished and 
remote from my own country at Bengal, where I had many ways to 
get home for my money, what could I think of myself now, when I 
was got about a thousand leagues farther off from home, and perfectly 
destitute of all manner of prospect of return ? All we had for it was 
this, that in iibout four months' time there was to be another fair at 
the place where we were, and then we might be able to purchase all 
sorts of the manufactures of the country, and withal might possibly 
find some Chinese junks or vessels from Tonquin, that would be to be 
Bold, and would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. ■ Thii I

liked very well, and resolved to wait ; besides, as oar particular per 
eons were not cbnosioua, so if any English or Dutch ships caiue ihither, 
perhaps we mi'i;ht have an opportunity to load our goods, and get a 
passage to some other place in India, nearer home. Upon tliese hopes 
we resolved to continue here ; but, to divert ourselves, we took two 
or three journeya into the country. First, we went ten dayss' journey, 
to the city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing, indeed ; they say it 
has a million of people in it ; it ia regularly built, the streets all ex- 
actly straight, and cross one another in direct lines, which gives the 
figure of it great advantage. But when I com© to compare the 
miserable people of these countries with ours, their fabrics, their 
manner of living, their government, their wealth, and their glory, 
as some call it, I must confess that I scarcely think it worth my 
while to mention them here. It is very observable, that we 
wonder at the grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the 
government, the manufactures, the commerce, and conduct of these 
people ; not that it is to be wondered at, or, indeed, in tho least to be 
regarded, but because, having a true notion of the barbarity of those 
couatries, the rudeness and the ignorance that prevails there, we do 
not expect to find any such thing so far off. Otherwise, what are their 
buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of Europe ? What their 
trad© to tho universal commerce of England, Holland, France, and 
Spain ? What are their cities to ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of 
apparel, rich fui-niture, and infinite variety ? What aro their ports, 
supplied with a few junks and barks, to our navigation, our merchant 
fleets, our large and powerful navies ? Our city of London has more 
trade than half their mighty empire ; on© English, Dutch, or French 
man-of.war of eighty guns, would b© able to fight almost aU tho shipping 
belonging to China; but the greatness of their wealth, their trade, tha 
power of their government, and the strength of their armies, may be a 
little eurprising to us ; because, as I have said, considering them as a 
barbarous nation of pagans, liitle better than savages, we did not e& 
pect such things among them. And this, indeed, is tho advantage, 
with which all their greatness and power is represented to us ; other- 
wise, it 13 in itself nothing at all ; for what I have said of their ships 
maybe said of their armies and troops; all tho forces of their empire, 
though they were to bring two millions of men into tho field together, 
wuuld be able to do nothing but ruin the country, and starvo them* 
selves, if they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or tn fight a 
disciplined army, One good lino of German cuirassiers, or of French

it is true, but they are awkward and uncertain in their going off; and 
titeir powder haa but little strength. Their armies are badly discip. 
Hned, and want skill to attack, or temper to retreat ; and therefore, I 
must confess, it seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard 
our people say such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, and 
trade of the Chinese ; because, as far as I saw, they appeared to be a 
contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant sordid slaves, subjected to a 
government qualified only to rule such a people; and were not its 
dietanoe inconceivably great from Muscovy, and the Muscovite empire, 
hn a manner, as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Czar of 
Muscovy might with ease drive them all out of their country, and 
conquer them in one campaign ; and had the Czar (who is now u grow. 
ing prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, 
and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they say he has 
done ; and if none of the powers of Europe had envied or interrupted 
him, he might by this time have been emperor of China, instead of 
being beaten by the king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not 
one to six in number. As their strength and their grandeur, so their 
savigation, commerce, and husbandry, are very imperfect, compared ts 
the same things in Europe ; also in their knowledge, their learning, 
and in their skill in the sciences, they are either very awkward or 
defective, though they have globes and spheres, and a smattering of 
the mathematics, and think they know more than all the world be- 
tides ; but they know little of the motions of the heavenly bodies ; and 
•o grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common people, that when 
the BOO is eclipsed, they think a great dragon has assaulted it, and is 
going to run away with it ; and they fall clattering with all the drums 
and kettles in the country, to fright the monster away, just as we do 
to hire a swarm of bees.

oomey xo Peking— Bobdnson joiua a Caravan procseding to Moaeow— Sracon* 
trea with the Tartars 

WAS now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China, 
about thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned 
from Nanquin ; I had, indeed, a mind to see the city of Pe. 
king, which I had heard so much of, and Father Simon im- 
portuned me daily to do it. At length, his time of going away being 
»)et, and the other missionary who was to go with him being arrived 
from Macao, it was necessary that we should resolve either to go op 
not; so I referred it wholly to my partner, and left it wholly to bis 
'"ihoice, who at length resolved it in the affirmative; and we prepared 
for our journey. We set out with very good advantage, as to finding 
the way, for we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their Man- 
darins, a kind of viceroy or principal magistrate in the province where 
khey reside, and who take great state upon tbem, traveling with greaii 
attendance, and with great homage from the people, who are Bom&* 
times greatly impoverished by them, being obliged to furnish pro- 
visions for them and all their attendants in their journeys. That 
which I particularly observed, as to our traveling with bis baggage, 
waa this, that though wo received suffloient provisions both for our. 
Bslves and our horses from the country, as belonging to the Mandarin, 
yet we were obliged to pay for everything we had after the market 
price of the country, and the Mandarin's steward collected it duly 
from us ; so that our traveling in ihe retinue of the Mandarin, though 
it was a very great kindness to ui, was not such a mighty fevor inhiia, 
but was a great advantage to him, conaidering there w«¥© about tlurty 
frther people tfaY«M in i^^ sa?^<^ 'giMuer beside us, un<i«r the ^t<»

teotion of his r»tinue ; for the oountry furni&hed all th« |)ro'rifii6fit tot 
fiothing to him, and jet he took our monej for them. 

We were twenty-five days traveling to Peking, through a couatry 
izkfinitely populous, but I think badly cultirated ; the husbandry, the 
economy, and the way of living miserable, though they boast so much 
of the industry of the people ; I say miserable, If compared with their 
own, but not so to these poor wretches, who know no other. The 
pride of the people is infinitely great, and exceeded by nothing fcat 
their poverty, in some parts, which adds to that which I oall their 
misery; and I must needs think the naked savages of Amerioa live 
much more happily than the poorest sort of these, because sr they 
have nothing, so they desire nothing ; whereas these are proud and 
insolent, and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and 
drudges ; their ostentation is inexpressible ; and, if they can, they 
love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the last de- 
gree ridiculous, as well as the contemot of all the world but them< 
selves. 

I must confess, 1 traveled more pleasantly afterward in the deserts 
and wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here ; and yet the roads her« 
are well paved and well kept, and very convenient for travellers ; but 
nothing was more awkward to me than to see such a haughty, im- 
perious, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest simplicity and 
ignorance; and my friend Father Simon and I used to be very merry 
upon these occasions, to see the beggarly pride of these people. For 
example, coming by the house of a country gentleman, as Father 
Sim(^ called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nanqum, we had 
fi.r8t of all the honor to ride with the master of the house about twa 
miles ; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being a mix« 
ture of pomp and poverty. His habit was very proper for a scara- 
Biouch, or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, 
taeseb, and cuts and slashes almost on every side ; it covered a t'^^'oty 
Test, as greasy as a butcher's, and whick testified that his honor must 
be a most exquisite sloven. Hia horse was but a poor, starved, hobbling 
creature, and he had two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor 
creature along ; he had a whip in his hand, and ho belabored tha 
beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail ; and thua 
he rode by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from the ^ity 
to his country seat, about half a league before us. We travelled on 
gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us ; and a* ..d 
stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us, when we came by the 
eo«ntrr B«a* of ftiis R^eat mati, we wvwhim in a little place before h^

3oor e^tmg his repast. It was a kiiid of a garden, but lie ^vas vevy 
easy- to be isccii ; and we were given to undorBtand that the more ve 
looked at hhn the better ho would be pleased. He sat under a tree» 
something like a palmetto, wliich effectually shaded him over the 
head, anc on the south side; but under the tree was also placed a 
large umbrella, which made that part look well enough. lie sat 
lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a heavy, corpulent man, 
and had his meat brought him by two women slaves; he had two 
caorf?, one of which fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the 
dish with one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his worship's 
beard and taffety veft with he other; while the great fat brute 
thought it bpiow him to employ his own hands in any of those fami- 
liar offices, which kings and monarchs would rather do than be troubled 
with the clumsy fingers of their servants. 

I took this time to think what pains men's pride put them to, arid 
bow troublesome a haughty temper, thus ill managed^ must b*? to a 
man of common sense; and leaving the poor wretch to pleas*! himself 
with our looking at him, as if we admired his pomp, though we really 
pitied and contemned him, we pursued our journey; only Father 
Simon had the curiosity to stay to inform hims'iif what dainties the 
country justice had to feed on in all his state, whj'jh he had the honor 
to taste of, and which was, I think, a aiess of boiled rice, with a great 
piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, and 
another plant which they have there, something like our ginger, but 
emelling like musk, andta-stinglikemustard; all this was put together, 
^and a small piece of lean mutton boiled in it, and this was his wor. 
ship's repast; four or five servants more attended at a distance, who, 
v/c supposed, were to eat of the same after their master. 

As for our Mand«u'in with whom we travelled, he was respected b» 
% king, surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended in all his 
appearances with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance ; 
but this I observed, that there was not a horse in his retinuo but that 
our carrier's pack-horses in England seemed to me to look much 
better ; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they were so covered 
with equipage, mantles, trappings, &c., that we could scarce see any. 
thing but their feet and their heads as they went along. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and perplexity that 1 
faave given an account of being over, f had no anxious thought about 
mo, which made thir, journey the pleasanter to me; nor had I any 
ill accident attended me, only in passing or fording a small river my 
howe fell, and made me free of the country, as they call it. that is H 



f^.jj threw m« fn ; tha pkoe was not deop, but It watted tne all fn^ 1 
xnention it. because I spoiled my pooket-book, -wlierein I had6etdo"ma 
the nainea of several people and places which I had occasion to re- 
member, and which, not taking due care o£ the leaves rotted, and the 
words were never after to be read, to my great loss as t» the simee 
of some plaoes I touched at in this journey. 

At length we arrived at Peking; I had nobody with me bnt the 
youth whom my nephaw th9 captain had given me to acteud roe as a 
servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent ; and my partner 
bad nobody with him but one servant, who was a kiosn^an. As for 
Iho Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see tb© court, wo bore hia 
charges for his company, and to use him as an internreter, for he un- 
deritood the language of the country, and cpoke good French, and a 
little English; and, indeed, this old man wat a m.ost useful implement 
to us ererywhere ; for we had not been above a week at Peking, when 
he came laughing, "Ah, Senhor Inglose,' sajs he, '* I have something 
to tell you will make your heart glad !-' " My heart glad !" says I, 
" what can that be ? I don't know an/thing in this country can either 
give me joy or grief, to any great degree." " Yes, yes," said the old 
man, in broken English, " make jju glad, me Borry." " Why," said 
I, *•' will it make you sorry 7* ' Because," said he, " you have brought 
me here twenty-five days' Jaoiaey, and will leave me to go bacli 
alone, and which way shall I get to ray port afterward without ; 
ship, without a horse, without pccune ?'' So he called money, bein^ 
his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make merry with 
In ehort, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and Pov 
lish merchants la the city, preparing to set out on their journey by 
land to Musoovy, within four or five weeks, and he was sure we would 
Itaka ths opportunity to go with them^ and leave him behind to go 
•lack alone. 

I ooufeas I was greatly airprised with this good news, and had 
jwaroe power to speak to !-*:» for some time j but at last I turned to 
him, **How do you know this ?" said I. " Are you sure it is true V* 
" Yos," says ho ; '♦I met this morning in the street an old acquain- 
tance of mine, an Armenian, who is among them ; he o&me last from 
Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly 
knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with 
the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Wolga to Astraean." 
" Well, senhor,-' says I, " do not be uneasy about being left to go 
back alone ; if this be a method for my return to Kngland, it shall b« 
your fault if ycu go back to Macao at all " «Ve then went to oo»«

ftwre 1 He told me be would do jaet as I would ; for he had settled 
all hie affairs so well at Bengal, and left bis effects ia such good 
hands, that as we had made a good royage here, if he could vest it in 
China silks, wrought and raw, such as might be worth the carriage, 
be would be conteut to go to England, and then mak« his voyage 
back to Bengal by the Company's ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if onr Portuguew pilot 
would go with us, we would bear his charge* to Moscow, or to Engv 
land, if he pleased ; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over genert 
ous in that neither, if we had not rewarded him farther, the service 
be had done ua being really worth more than that ; for he had not 
only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a broker to us on 
Bhore ; and his procuring for us the Japan merchant was some h»n, 
dreds of pounds in our pockets. So we consulted together about it, 
and being willing to gratify hira, which was but doing him justice, 
and very willing also to have him with us besides, for he was a most 
necessary man on all occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of 
coined gold, which, aa I compute it, came to about one hundred an^ 
seventy-five pounds sterling, between us, and to bear all bis charges^ 
both for himself and horse, except only a horse to carry his goods. 
Having settled this between ourselves, we called him to let him know 
what we had resolved. I told him he had complained of our being 
to let him go back alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolvecl 
he should not go back at all ; that as we had resolved to go to Eu- 
rope with the caravan, we resolved also he should go with us; and 
that we called hira to know his mind. He shook his head, and said. 
It was a long journey, and he had no pecune to carry him thither, or 
to subsist himself whon he came there. We told him we believed i* 
waa BO, and therefore we had resolved to do something for him tha^ 
should let liim see bow sensible we were ot the service he had dont 
«B, and also how agreeable he was to us ; and then I told him whaf 
we had resolved to give here, which he might lay out as we would 
do our own ; and that aa for his charges, if ho would go with us w# 
would set him safe on shore {lift and casualties excepted), either is 
Muscovy or England, which we could at our own charge, eicept only 
the carriage of his goods. He received the proposal like a man 
transported, and told us he would go with us over the whole world ; 
and 60 vm all prepared for our journey. However, as it was with ae* 
80 it waa with the other merchants ; they had many things to do, and 
instead of being ready in five vreeks, it was fo«p naxHT^ KnA utttQ 
days befoi'e all things were got togttheSiu 



It was ttiG beginning of February, our style, when we set out imm 
Peking. My fju,rtuer aud the old pilot had goue express back to the 
port where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods which we had 
]eft there; and I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some knowl- 
edge of at IS'anquin, and who came to Peking on his own aflfairs. wenf 
to Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about 
two hundred pieces of other very line silks of several eortsii, some 
mixed with gold, aud had all these brought to Peking against my 
partner's return; besides this, we bought a very large quantity of 
raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in these goods 
only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling : which, 
together with tea, and some fine calicoes, and three camels' loads of 
outmogs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, be- 
sides those we rode upon ; which, with two or three spare horses, 
and two horses loaded with provisions, made us, in short, twenty-six 
camels and horses in our retinue. 

The company was very great, and, aa near as I can remember, 
made between three and four hundred horse, and upwards of ono 
hundred and twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all 
eveata ; for as the Eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by tha 
Arabs, so are these by the Tartars ; but they are not altogether aa 
dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous, when they prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several nations ; but there wer« 
above sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though ci 
them some were Livonians; and to our particular satisfaction, five 
of them were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience 
in business, and of very good substance. 

When we had traveled one day's journey, the guides, who we; e five 
in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants, that is to say, aU 
the passengers except the servants, to a great council as they calleO 
it. At this council every one deposited a certain quantity of money, 
to a common stock, for the necessary expense of buying forage on the 
way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfying the 
guides, getting horses, and the like ; and hero they constituted the 
journey, as they called it, viz., they named captains and officers tc 
draw us nil up, and give the word of command, in case of an attack, 
and give every one their turn of comwand; nor was this forming us 
into order any more than what we found needful upon the way, aa 
Rhall be observed. 

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and is 
faU. -of oettera and earth-makers, that is to eay, .people that tem;>er

the earth for the China-ware ; and as I was coming along, our Portu. 
gal pilot, who had always sometliiug or other to say to make us merry- 
came aueerinc to me, and told me he would show me the greatest 
rarity iu aH the country, and that I should have this to say of Chiua, 
after all the ill huirored things I had said of it, that I hud seen oue 
tiiing which was not to be seen in all the world beside. I was very 
importunate to know what it was : at las^t he told me it was a gentle- 
man's house built with China-ware. " Well," says I, * are not the 
materials of their buildings the product of their own country, and so 
it is all China-ware, is it not?" — " No, no,'' says he; '-I mean it is a 
bouse all made of China-ware, such as you call it in England, or, as 
It J8 called iu our country, porcelain." " Well," says 1, '• Buch a 
thing may ba ; how big is it ? Can we carry it in a box upon a 
camel ? If we can, we will buy it." " Upon a camel V says the old 
pilot, holding up both his bands ; ^ why there is a family of thirty 
people lives in it." 

1 was thei*^urious. indeed, to see it ; and when I came to it, it wal 
nothing but this : it was a timber house, or a house built, as they call 
it in England, vrith lath and plixster ; but all this plastering was really 
China-ware, that is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes 
China-ware. The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, 
and looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, 
as the large China-ware iu England is painted, and hard as if it had 
been burned. As to the inside, all the walls instead of wainscot, were 
lined with hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tiles wo 
eall galley-tiles in England, all made of the finest China, and the 
figures exceedingly fine, indeed, with extraordinary variety of colors, 
aiixed with gold ; many tiles making but one figure, but joined so 
artificially, the mortar being made of the same earth, that it was veiy 
hard to sec where the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the 
sajie composition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in 
several parts of England; as bard as stone, and smooth, but coj 
burned and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets, whidx 
were all as it were paved with the same tile : the celling, and all the 
plastering work in the whole house, were of the same earth; and, 
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but of a deep 
ehiaing black. This was a China warehouse, indeed, truly and liter- 
ally to be called so ; and had I not been upon a journey, I could have 
stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They told 
m« there were fountains and fishponfls in the garden, all paved on the 
bottom and sides vrith the fame ; and fine statues set up in rows on ihn 
w^ks, entirelr formed o^ th^ porcelaifi ^strth. d^d h^jsss^ whol?. 



i49 ADVENtURM Ctff 

As tDia is one of the Bingiilftrlties of China, so fhey may he allow«d 
to excel in it ; but I am very euro they excel in their accounts of it; 
for they told me such incredible things of their performance in 
orookery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it 
eould not be true. They told mo, in particular, of one workman that 
made a ship with all its tackle, and masts and sails, in earthen-ware, 
big snough to cari'y fifty men. If they had told me he launched it, 
and made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said something to it, 
indeed ; but as it was, I knew the whole of the story, which was, ia 
short, asking pardon for the word, that the fellow lied : so I smiled, 
aud said nothing to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan, for which the 
leader of it for the day fined me about the value of three shillings ; 
and told me, if it had been three days' journey without the wall, as 
it was three days' within, he must have fined me four times as much, 
and made me ask pardon the next council day : I promised to be more 
orderly ; and, indeed, I found afterward the orders made for keeping 
all together wore absolutely necessary for our common safety. 

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a for- 
tification against the Tartars : and a very great work it is, going over 
hills and mountains in a needless track, where the rocks are impassa- 
ble, and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or 
indeed climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could hmder them. 
They tell us its length is near a thousand English miles, but that the 
country is five himdred in a straight measured line, which the wall 
bounds, without measuring the windings and turnings it takes ; it is 
a-bout four fathoms high, and as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabout, without trespassing our ordera 
^or Bo long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look at it on 
every side, near and far off, I mean that was vritbin my view ; and the 
guide of our caravan, who had been extolling it for the wonder of th« 
world, was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told him it was 
a most excelleat thing to keep out the Tartars; which he happened 
not to understand as I meant it, and so it took for a compliment ; but 
the old pilot laughed : '* 0, Senor Inglese," says hs, •' you speak in 
©olors." " In colors !'' said I ; " what do you mean by that ?" " Why 
you ppeak what looks white this way, and black that way ; gay one 
way and dull another. You tell him it ia a good wall to keep out 
Tartars ; you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to keep out 
Tartars. I understand you^ Secor InglisQ; I understand joa; bat

kor, d© you think it would stand out an army ot our ©ouawy people, 
with a good trala of artillery, or our engineers, with two cojapanics 
of miners ? Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an army 
toight enter in battalia ; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, 
that there should be no sign of it left V " Ay, ay," says he, " I know 
that.'- The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said, and I gava 
him leave to tell him a few days after, for we were then almost out of 
their country, and he was to leave us in a little time after this; but 
■when he knew what I said, he was dumb all the rest of tha way, and 
■we heard no more of his fine etory of the Chinese power and greatness 
while he stayed. 

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something like 
the Plots' wall, so famous in Northumberland, built by the Romansn 
we began to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people rather 
confined to live In fortified towns and cities, as being subject to the 
inroads and depredations of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and 
therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open 
country. And here I began to find the necessity of keeping together 
in a caravan as we traveled, for we saw several troops of Tartars 
roving about ; but when I came to see them distinctly, I wondered 
more that the Chinese empire should be conquered by such contempt, 
ible fellows; for they are a mere horde of wild fellows, keeping no 
order, and understanding no discipline or manner of fight. Theli 
horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing, and fit for nothing; 
and this we found the first day we saw them, which was after we 
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader for the day gave 
leave for about sixteen of ua to go a hunting, as they call it, and what 
was this but hunting of sheep ; however, it may be called hunting too, 
for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw 
aif their kind ; only they will not run a great way, and you are sura 
ftf sport when you begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty 
er forty in a flock, and, like true sheep, keep together when they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet with 
about forty Tartars; whether they were hunting mutton as wo were, 
or whether they looked for another kind of prey, we know not ; but 
as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind of a horn very loud, 
but with a barbarous sound that I had never hoard before, and, by tho 
way, never care to hear again : we all supposed this was to call theix 
friends about them, and so it was ; for in less than ten minutes a troop 
of forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile disitaiiQtj hut om 
H^'^ was QWT $x^% as it happened. 



One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be amo^^ oi^ 
aad aa soon as he heard the borH he told us that we had nothing to do 
bat to charge them immediately, without loss of time ; and drawing 
ua up in a line, he asked if we were resolved. "We told him we were 
ready to follow him; so he rode direc'ly toward them. They stood 
gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn up in no order nor showing 
the face of any order at all ; but as soon aa they saw us advance they 
let fly their arrows, which, however, missed us very happily : it B.3ema 
they mistook not their aim, but their distance ; for their arrows all 
fell a little short of us, but with 80 true an aim, that had we been 
about twenty yards nearer, we must have had ficveral men wounded, 
if not killed. 

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance, we 
fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, following our 
ahot full gallop, to full in among them sword in hand, for so our bold 
Scot that led us directed. He was. indeed, but a merchant, but ha 
behaved with such vigor and bravery on this occasion, and yet with 
such cool courage, too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for 
command. As soon aa we came up to them, we fired our pistols in 
their faces, and then drew j but they fled in the greatest confusion 
imaginable. The only stand any of them made was on our righ^ 
where three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest to come back 
to them, having a kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows 
hanging to their backs. Our brave commander, without asking any 
body to follow him, gallops up close to them, and with his fusee 
knocks one of them off his horse, killed the second with his pistol, 
and the third ran away ; and thus ended our fight; but we had thii 
misfortune attending it, that all our mutton we had in chase got away. 
We had not a man killed or hurt ; but as for the Tartars, there were 
about five of them killed; how many were wounded w© knew not; 
but this we knew, that the other party was so frightened with the 
noiBQ of our guix3> that they made off, and never made any attempt 
tjpon uc. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore the 
Tartars were not so bold as afterward : but in about five days wo 
entered a vast^ great, wild desert, which held us three days and 
nights' march ; and we were obliged to carry our water with ua in 
great leathern bottles, and to encamp all night, just as I have heard 
they do in the desert of Arabia. 

I asked our guides whose dominion this was in ; and they told m« 
t\^9 WM a kind of border, that might be calkd no man's land^ 



being a part of OrTej*.* Karakathay, oe Grand Tartary ; but, hoTvover, 
it was all reckoned as belonging to China, but, that there was no care 
taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it 
was reckoned the worst desert in the whole march, though we wer? 
to go over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which was at first very frightful to me, 
we saw, two or three times, little parties of the Tartars, but they 
seemed to Le upon their own .affairs, and to have no design \ipon usj 
end so, like the man who met the devil, if they bad nothing to say to 
'tis, vfe had nothing to say to them ; we lot them go. Once, however, 
a partyxf them came so near as to stand ;md gaze at us; whether it 
was to consider if they should attack us or not, we knew not ; bu6 
when we were passed at some distance by them, wo made a rear guard 
of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan pass half 
a mile or thereabouts before us : but after awhile they marched 
off; only we found they saluted us with five arrows at their parting, 
one of which wounded a horse, so that it disabled him, and we left 
him, poor creature, in great need of a good farrier : they might shoot 
xnoro arrow?, which might fall short of us, but we saw no more arrows 
or Tartars that time. 

Wo travelled near a month after this, the ways not being so good 
as at first, though still in the dominions of the emperor of China, but 
lay for the most part in villages, some of which were fortified, be- 
cause of the incursions of the Tartars. When we were come to one 
of these towns (it was about two days and a half journey before wa 
were como to the city of Nauni), I wanted to buy a camel, of whi»h 
there are plenty to be sold all the vray upon that road, and horses 
also, such as they are, because so many caravans coming that way, 
they are often wanted. The person that I spoke to to get me & 
camel, would have gone and fetched one fi'-r me ; but L like a fool, 
toust be ofBcious, and go myself along with him ■ the place was about 
two miles out of the village, where it seems they kept the camels and 
horses feeding under a guard. 

I walked it < n foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being very 
desirous of a little variety. When we came to the place, it was a low 
marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled up dry, with- 
out mortar or earth among it, like a park, with a little guard of 
Chinese soldiers at the door. Having bought a camel, and agreed for 
the price, I came away, and the Chinese man that went wth me led 
the camel. Avhen on a sudden came up five Tartars on horseback; 
two of tbpju seized the fellow and took tho camel fi'Om bim, while th9 



444 AUTEanrusuES of 

other three stepped up to me aud my old pilot^ seeing us, as it xrere, 
unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, whioh could but 
ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that came up stcjpped 
ehort upon my drawing my sword, for they are arrant cowards ; but 
a second coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head, which 1 
never felt till afterward, and wondered, when I came to myself, what 
■was the matter, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground ; 
but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, ua- 
looked for, directs deliverances from dangers which to us are unfore- 
seen), had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the 
Tartars either ; if they had, I suppose they would not have attacked 
us ; but cowards are always boldest when there is no danger. The 
old man seeing me down, with a bold heart stepped up to the fellow 
that had struck me, and laying bold of his arm with one hand, and 
pulling him down by main force a little toward him with the other, 
ehot him in the head, and laid him dead upon the spot. He then im- 
mediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I said, and be. 
fore he could come forward again, made a blow at him with a soimi^ 
tar, which he always wore, but missing the man, cut his horse in the 
side of his head, cut one of the ears off. by the root, and a great slice 
down by the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged with the 
woulid, was no more to be governed by his rider, though the fellow 
sat well enough, too, but away he flew, and carried him quite out of 
the pilot's reach and at sojae distance, rising upon his hind legs, he 
threw down the Tartar, and fell upon him. 

In this interval, the poor Chinese came in who had lost the camel, 
but he had no weapon ; however, seeing the Tartar down, and his 
horse fallen upon him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an 
ugly ill-favored weapon he had by bis side, something like a pole* 
axe, but not a pole-axe either, ho wrenched it from him, and made 
shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man had 
the third Tartar to deal with still; and seeing he did not fly, as he ex- 
pected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stand stocks 
Btill, the old man stood still, too, and fell to work with his tackle, to 
eharge his pistol again ; but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol, 
away ho scoured, and left my pilot, my champion I called him after- 
ward, a complete victory. 

By this time I was a little recovered ; for I thought when I first 
began to wake, that I had boon in a sweet sleep ; but, &e I eeid above, 
I wondered where I waa, how I came upon ths grotmd, aod what was 
the matter. But a few moments after, m iseiiee returned, I feh j>au^ 



B0BIN80N CRUSOE. 445 

tiiough I did aot know -where ; so I clapped my hatid to my head, and 
took it away bloody ; then I felt my head abha ; and then, in a mo- 
ment, memory returned, and everything was present to m6 again. I 
jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my sword, but no 
enemies in view; I found a Tartar lie dead, and his horse standing 
very quietly by him ; and, looking farther, I saw my champion and 
'deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming 
back with his hanger in his hand ; the old man, seeing me on my feet, 
came running to me, and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being 
afraid before that I had been killed ; and seeing me bloody, would see 
how I was hurt; but it was not much, only what we call a broken 
head ; neither did I afterward find any great inconvenience from the 
blow, for it was well again in two or three days. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we lost a 
camel and gained a horso ; but that which was lemarkable, when we 
came back to the village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel ; 
I disputed it, and it was brought to a hearing before the Chinese judge 
of the place. To give him his due, he acted with a great deal of 
prudence and unpartiality ; and having heard both sides, he gravely 
asked the Chinese man that went with me to buy the camel, whose 
servant he was ? "I am no servant,'' says he, " but went with the 
stranger." " At whose request ?" said the justice. "At the stranger's 
request," says he. "Why, then," says the justice, " you were the 
stranger's servant for the time; and the camel being delivered to hi? 
servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay for it. 

I confess the thing wae so clear, that I had not a word to say ; but, 
admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence, and a& 
accurate stating of the case, I paid willingly for the camel, and sent 
for another ; but you may observe, I did not go to fetch it myself any 
more, for I had had enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire ; they call it 
fortified, and, so it is, as fortifications go there ; for this I will venture 
to aflSrm, that all the Tartars in Karakathay, which, I believe, are 
some millions, could not batter down the waUs with their bows and 
arrows ; but to call it strongf, if it were attacked with cannon, would 
be to make tho8« who understand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this city, 
when messengers were sent express to every part of the road to tell 
all travellers and oararans to halt till they had a guard sent for tijera ; 
fi>? that an unusual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all, had 
fcppSftfed iu the way, aboat thirty miles beyoad the <jit|r, 



i4$ ADVENTURES <X 

l^iis WM very liad news to travellers ; however, it was carefully 
done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have 
a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers 
cent us from a garrison of the Chinese, on our left, and three hundred 
more from the city of Naum, and with these we advanced boldly ; ihe 
three hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our front, the two 
hundred in oar rear, and our men on each side of our camels, with our 
baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre ; in this order, and well 
prepared for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole ten 
thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared ; but the next day, when 
they did appear, it was quite another thing. 

It was early in the morning, when, marching from a well-situated 
little town, called Cbangu, we had a river to pass, which we were ob- 
liged to ferry ; and had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had 
been the time to have attacked us, when the caravan being over, the 
roar guard was behind ; but they did not appear there. About threa 
hours after, when we were entered upon a desert of about sixteen' 
miles over, behold, by a cleud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy 
was at hand ; and they were at hand, indeed, for they came on upon 
the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so big the day 
before, began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently looked behind 
them, which is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run 
away. My old pilot was of my mind ; and, being near me, called 
out, "Senhor Inglese," says he, "those fellows must be encouraged, 
or they will ruin us all ; for if the Tartars come on, they will never 
Stand it." " I am of your mind,'' said I ; " but what must be done ?" 
"Done!" said he, "let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on 
each wing, and encourage them ; and they will fight like brave fel- 
lows in brave company ; but, without this, they will every roan turn 
his back. Immediately I rode up to our leader, and told him, who 
was exactly of our mind; and accordingly fifty of us marched to tha 
right wing, and fifty to the left, and the rest made a line of rescue; 
and so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make a body 
by themselves, and to guard the camels; only that, if nee'^ were, they 
should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty. 

lu a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they 
were; how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we thought, was 
the least ; a party cf them came on first and viewed our posture, tra- 
versing the ground in the front of our line; and, as we found them 
withiA srua-sh'^t, our leader ordered the two wio^ to advance svi&itj^ 



B0BIK80S CBtTSOE. 447 

and give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done; 
but ttiey weut off, and I suppose back, to give an account of the re- 
ception they were likely to meet with ; and, indeed, that salute cloyed 
their stomachs, for they immediately halted, etood awhile to consider 
of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over their design, and 
fiaid no more to us for that time ; which was very agreeahle to our 
circumstancee, which were but very indifferent for a battle with euch 
a number. 

Two days after we came to tho city of Naun, or Naum ; we thanked 
the governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred 
crowns, or thereabouts, which he gave to the soldiers sent to guard us ; 
and here we rested one day. This is a garrison, indeed, and there 
were nine hundred soldiers kept there ; but the reason of it was, that 
formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do, 
the Muscovites having abandoned that part of the country, which lies 
from this city west for about two hundred miles, as desolate and unfit 
for use ; and more especially being so very remote, and so diflScult to 
Bend troops thither for its defence ; for we had yet above two thousand 
miles to Muscovy, properly so called. 

After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful deserts; 
one of which we were sixteen days passing over ; and which, as I said, 
was to be called no man's land ; and on the 13th of April, we came to 
the frontiers of the Muscovite dominions, I think the first town, or 
fortress, whichever it may be called, that belonged to the Czar of 
Muscovy, was called Arguna, being on the west side of the river Ar- 
guna. 

I could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that I was so soon 
arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country, or. at least, in a courtry 
governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, 
but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be 
end are very devout in their way. It would certainly occur to any 
man who travels the world as I have done, and who had any power 
of reflection, what a blessing it is to be brought into the world where 
the name of God and Redeemer is known, adored and worshipped ; 
and not where the people, given up by Heaven to strong delusions, 
worship the devil, and pi'ostrate themselves to stocks and stones; 
worship monsters, elements, horrid-shaped animals, and statutes or 
images of monsters. Not a town or city we passed through but had 
their pagods, their idols, and their temples, and ignorant people wor- 
shiping even the works of their own hands. Now, wo came where, at 
\iwabt a face of the Chrietian worship appeared; where the knee WM

bow«d to JeBus ; and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian re. 
ligion was owned, and th» name of the true God was called upon and 
adored, and it made my-'soul rejoice to see it. 1 saluted the brave 
Scots merchant I mentioned above with my first acknowledgment of 
thi8 ; and taking him by the hand, I said to him, '•' Blessed be God, 
we are once again among Christians." He smiled, and answered, 
"Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are but an 
ddd sort of Christians ; and but for the name of it, you may see very 
\ittle of the substance for some months farther of our journey." 
" Well," says I, " but still it is better than paganism and worshiping 
of devils." " Why, I will ♦•ell you," says he, " except the Russiaa 
soldier in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon 
the road, all the rest of this country, for above a thousand miles farther, 
28 inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans; and 60, indeed, 
we found it.

E were now launched into tho greatest piece of solid earth 
^ if I understand anything of the surface of the glob«, tha(r 
is to be found in any part of the world ; we had, at least, 
twelve thousand miles to the sea, eastward ; two thousand 
io the bottom of the Baltic sea, westward ; and above three thousand, 
if we left that sea and went on west, to the British and French chan- 
nels ; we had full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian boji, 
Bouth ; and about eight hundred to the Frozen sea, north. Nay, if 
some people may be believed, there might be no sea, northeast, till we 
came round the poles, and conseqaontly into tho northwest, and so had 
a continent of land into America, tho Lord knows where ; though 1 
could give some reasons why I belioved that to be a mistake. 

As we entered into tho Muscovite dominions a good while before vr<^ 
oamo to any considerable towns, we had nothing to observe there but 
^is : first, that all the rivers run to the east; as I understood \\j the 




S0BIN8ON ORCSOfi. 449 

ehftrt^t, whioli BOme \n our oararan had with them, \t was pla\n all 
those rivers ran into the gteat river Yamour, or Amour; which river, 
by the natural course of it, must run into the East sen, or Chinese 
Ooean. The story they tell us, that the mouth of this river is choked 
np with bulrushes of a monstrous growth, viz. : three feet about, and 
twenty or thirty feet high, I must be allowed to say, I believe nothing 
of it J but, as its navigation is of no use, because there is no trade that 
way, the Tartars, to whom it alone belongs, dealing in nothing hut 
cattle, so nobody, that ever I heard of. has been curious enough either 
to go down to the mouth of it in boats, or come up to the mouth of it 
in ships, as far as I can find ; but this is certain, that this river run> 
ning east, in the latitude of about fifty degrees, carries a vast con-, 
course of rivers along with it, and finds aa ocean to empty itself iai 
that latitude ; so we are sure of sea there. 

Some leagues to the north of this river there are several consider- 
able rivers, whose streams run as due north as the Yamour runs east, 
and those are all found to join their waters with the great river Tartar- 
us, named so from the northermost nations of the Mogul Tartars; 
who, as the Chinese say, were the first Tartars in the world ; and 
who, as our geographers allege, are the Gog and Magog mentioned in 
isacred story. These rivers running all northward, as well as all the 
other rivers I am yet to speak of, make it evident that the northern 
ocean bounds the land also on that side ; so that it does not seem ra« 
tional in the least to think that the land can extend itself to join with 
America on that side, or that there is not a communication between 
the northern and eastern ocean ; but of this I shall say no more : it 
was my observation at that time, and therefore I take notice of it in 
this place. 

We now advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderata 
journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Mus-^ 
€©vy has taken to have cities and towns built in as many places a« it 
is possible to place them, where his soldisrs keep garrison, something 
like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotes! 
countrys of their empire; some of which that I had read of were 
placed in Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the lodging 
travelers ; and thus it was here ; for wherever we came, though at 
these towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Kussian 
and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans; sac- 
rificing to idols, and worshiping ihe snn, moon, and stars, or all the 
host of heaven; and not oalyso, bnt were, of all the heathens aad 
pagans that ever I met with, the moat barbaroas, exeept ooly that they 
did not eat men's flesh, as our saya«ee 9( Amrerica did. 



450 «)VBNTUiffiS OF 

Some instances of this we met within the country between Argti^i^ 
where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of Tartars ad 
Russians together, called Nertzinskoi. in which is a continued defcert 
or forest, wLich cost us twenty days to travel over. In a villn^-", 
'jear the last of these places, I had the curiosity to go and see tbt'v 
way of living, which is most brutish and insufl'erable ; they had, ! 
gnppose, a great eacrilice that day ; for there stood out, upon an old 
Btump of a tree, an idol made of wood, frightful as the devil ; atleasl^ 
As anything we can think of to represent the devil can be made ; it 
had a head not bo much as resembling any creature that the world evet 
$ftw ; ears as big as goat's horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a crown 
piece ; a nose like a crooked ram's-horn, and a mouth extended four- 
cornered, like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's 
under bill ; it was dressed up in the filthiest manner that you conld 
Buppose; its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with the wool out. 
ward ; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns growing 
through it ; it was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor 
any other proportion of the parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village ; and 
when I cam»near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen creatures, 
whether men or women I could not tell, for they made no distinction 
by their habits, all lying flat upon the ground round this formidable 
block 0^ shapeless wood ; I saw no motion among them any more than 
if they had all been logs of wood, like the idol, and at first I really 
thought they had been so ; but, when I came a little nearer, they 
started up npon their feet, and raised a howling cry, as if it had been 
BO many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away, as if they were dis- 
pleased at our disturbing them. A little way off from the idol, and 
at the door of a tent or hut, made all of sheep-skins and cow-skinB 
dried, stood three butchers — I thought they were such ; when I came 
nearer to them, I found they had long knives in their hands: and in 
the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed, and one young bul- 
lock or steer. These, it seems, were sacrifices to that senseless logof 
an idol ; the three men were priests belonging to it. and the seven- 
teen prostrated wretches were the yioople who brought the offering 
and were making their prayerfl to that stock. 

I confess. I was more mnvcd nt their i-tupidity and brutish worship 
of a hobgoblin than ever 1 was at anything in my life ; to see God's 
tnosl glorious and best creature, to whom he bad granted so many 
advantages, even by cre;ifinn above the rest of the works of hifl 
bands, vested \uth a reasonable soul, and that soul ador&ed witl\

foculties auu uapacities adapted both to honor his Maker, a^d be 
honored by him, sunk and degenerated to a degree so very stupid 
as to prostrate itself to a frightful nothing, a mere imaginary ob- 
ject, dressed up by themselves, and made terrible to themselves by 
their own contrivance, adorned only with clouts and rags ; and tb?.t 
this should be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought up into belli h 
devotion by the devil himself; who, envying to his Maker the horan^o 
and adoraticn of his creatures, had deluded them into such sordid and 
brutish things as one would think should shock nature itself! 

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection of thoughts ; 
thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes, and there was no room to 
wonder at it, or think it impossible ; all my admiration turned to 
rage, and I rode up to the image or monster, call it what you will, 
and with my sword made a stroke at the bonnet that was on its bead, 
and cut it in two ; and one of our men that was with me took hold of 
the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it; when, behold, amost 
hideous outcry and howling ran through the village, and two or three 
hundred people came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour for 
it, for we saw some had bows and arrows ; but I resolved from that 
Bjonient to visit them again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about four 
wiles off, in order to provide some horses which they wanted, several 
of the horses having teen lamed and jaded with the badness of the 
way. and long march over the last desert ; so we had some leisure 
hei-e to put my design in execution. I communicated my design to 
Ihe Scots merchant of Moscow, of whose courage I had sufiBcient tes» 
timony ; I told him what I had seen, and with what indignation I had 
since thought that human nature could be so degenerate; I told him, 
\f I could get but four or five men well armed, to go with me, I was 
resolved to go and destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them 
see that it had no power to help itself; and conspquently could net , 
be an object of worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that 
offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me : — says he, '* Tour zeal may be good, but what 
do you propfise to yourself by it ?" " Propose !" said I ; "to vindi- 
cate f he honor of God, which is insulted bj' this devil-worship.'' " But 
how will it vindicate the honor of God/*' said he, '-'while the people 
will not be able to know what you mean by it, unless you could 
speak to them and tell them so ? And then they will fight you, and

* dt H bt the night, and then leare them th« reaeoiui and the causes in 
Trrl^g in their own language?" "Writing?'' said he; "why there 
is not a man in five nations of them that knows anything of a letter, 
or how to read a word any way.'^ " Wretched ignorance !"' said I to 
him ; " however, I have a great mind to do it ; perhaps nature may 
iraw inferences from it to them, to let them see bow brutish they are 
to worship such horrid things." " Look you, sir," said he, " if your 
teal prompts you to it so warmly, you must do it ; but, in the next 
place, I would have you consider, these wild nations of people are 
subjected by force to the Czar of Muscovy's dominion, and you do 
this, it is ten to one they will come by thousands to the governor of 
Nertzinskoi, and demand satisfaction ; and if he cannot give them 
satisfaction, it is ten to one but they revolt ; and it will occasion » 
iew war with all the Tartars in the country." 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for awhile, but I 
harped upon the same string still; and all that day I was uneasy to 
put my project in execution. Towards the evening the Scots mer- 
chant met me by accident in our walk about the town, and desired to 
speak with me ; " T believe," said he, " I have put you off your good 
design; I have been a little concerned about it since: for I abhor 
idolatry as much as you can do." "Truly," said I, ''you have put it 
off a little, as to the execution of it, but you have not put it out of 
my thoughts ; and I believe I shall do it before I quit this plaoe, 
though I were to be delivered up to them for satisfaction." " No 
ao," said he : " God forbid they should deliver you up to such a crew 
of monsters ! They shall not do that neither ; that would be mur- 
dering you indeed." "Why," said I : "how would they use me?" 
*U8e you !" said he ; " I'll tell you how they served a poor Russian 
who affronted them in their worship, just as you did, and >vhom they 
took prisoner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that he could 
not run away ; they took him and stripped him stark-naked, and set 
bim upon the top of the idol-monster, and stood all round him, and 
shot aa many arrows into him as would stioK over his whole body ; 
and then they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking iu him, as a 
saorifloe to the idol." "And was this the same idol ?" said I. "Yes," 
said he, '^ the very same." '• Well," said I, " I will tell you a story," 
so I related the story of our men at Madagascar, and how they burnt 
and sacked the village there, and killed man, woman, and child, fot 
their murdering one of our men, just a« it is related before ; aad I 
added, that I tboagbb wo oaght to do so to this village. 

H* Kit6n«d very fttt^titiTely to th« story ; but when I talk«d of

to to that Tillage, eaid he, " you mistake very much ; it was 
not this village, it was almost a hundred miles from this place ; but 
it -was the same idol, for they carry him about in procession all over 
the country." '* Well," said I, " then that idol ought to be punished 
for it ; and it shall," said I, ** if I live this night out." 

In a word, finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me I 
should not go alone, but he would go with me, but he would go first 
and bring a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go also with usri 
" and one," said he, " as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one 
to be against such devilish things as these." In a word, he brought 
me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called Captain Richardson j 
and gave him a full account of what I had seen, and also what I in- 
tended; and he told me readily, he would go with me if it cost him 
his life. So we agreed to go, only we three. I had, indeed, proposed 
to my partner, but he declined it. He said, he was ready to assist me 
to the utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defense ; but this was 
on adventure quite out of his way : so, I say, we resolved upon our 
work, only we three and my man-servant, and to put it in execution 
that night about midnight, with all the secresy imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts, we wore willing to delay it till the 
next night, because, the caravan being to set forward in the morning, 
we supposed the governor could not pretend to give them any satis- 
faction upon us when we were out of his power. The Scots merchant, 
as steady in his resolution for the enterprise, as bold in executing, 
brought mo a Tartar's robe or gown of sheep-skins, and a bonnet, 
with a bow and arrowo, and had provided the same for himself and 
his countryman, that the people, if they saw us, should not determiud 
who we were. ' 

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter 
with aqua vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could get; 
and, having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an hour after 
night we set out upon our expedition. i* 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found that 
the people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their idoL 
The night was cloudy ; yet the moon gave us light enough to see thai 
the idol stood just in the same posture and place that it did before. 
The people seemed to be all at their rest ; only, that in the great hut, 
or tent, as we called it, where we saw the three priests whom we 
mistook for butchers, we saw a light ; and going up close to the door, 
we heard people talking as if there were five or six of them ; wo 
eoQOluded, therefore, that if we eet wildfire to tho idol, th^gs msa 



%l»4 ~ AC^^EhTUBES O. 

would oome out immediately, and win up to ta^ place to rescue h 
firom the destraotioa that we intended for it ; and ^hat to do with 
them we knew not. Once we thought of carrying it away and setting 
fire to it at a distance, but when we came to handle it, we found it too 
bulky for our carriage ; so we were at a loss again. The second 
Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and knocking the 
creatures that were there on the head, when they came out ; but I 
could not join with that ; I was against killing them, if it were pos- 
sible to avoid it "Well, then," says the Scots merchant, " I will tell 
you what we will do: we will try to make them prisoners, tie theii 
Jiands, and make them stand and see their idol destroyed." 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough about us, 
which we used to tie our firelocks altogether with : so we resolved to 
attack these people first, and with as little noise as we could. The 
first thing we did we knocked at the door, when, one of the priests 
coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and 
tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol, where we gagged 
him that he might not make a noise, tied hia feet also together, and 
left him on the ground. 

Two of U8 then waited at the door, expecting that another would 
•ome out, to see what the matter was : but we waited so long till the 
third man came back to us ; and then nobody coming out, we knocked 
again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we served 
them just in the same manner, but were obliged to go all with them, 
and lay them down by the idol some distance from one another; 
when, going back, we found two more were come out to the door, and 
a third stood behind them within the door. We seized the two, and 
immediately tied them, when the third stepping back, and crying out, 
my Scots merchant went in after him, taking out a composition we 
had madrt, that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to it and threw 
it in among them; by that time the other Scotsman and my man, 
taking charge of the two men already bound, and tied together also 
by the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them there to see if 
ttieir idol would relieve them, making haste back to us. 

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much 
■moke that they were almost sufibcated, we then threw a small leather 
bag of another kind which flamed like a caudle, and following it in, 
•we found there were but four people, and, as wo supposed, had been 
about some of their diabolical sacrifices. They appeared, in short, 
frightened to death, at least so as to sit trembling aD<^ "Stupid, and not 
t^U to speak neither, for the Bmoke. 



^ y 1 1 ! KOSmSO^ CKUSOB. 166 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had done tb« others^ 
Itnd all without any noise. I should have eaid we brought them o«t 
of the house, or hut, first ; for indeed we were not able to bear the 
smoke any more than they were. When we had done this, we carried 
them altogether to the idol ; when we came there we fell to work 
with him , and first we daubed him all over, and bis robes also, witfc 
tar, and such other stuff as we had, which was tallow mixed witk 
brimstone : then we stopped his eyes and ears and mouth full of gun* 
powder; then we wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet j 
and then sticking all the combustibles we had brought with us upo« 
him, we looked about to see if we could find anything else to help to 
burn him ; when my Scotsman remembered that by the tent, or hut, 
where the men were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw 
or rushes I do not remember; away he and the other Scotsman ran 
and fetched their arms full of that. When we had done this, we took 
all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and un- 
gagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them before 
their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the pow- 
der in the eyes, and mouth, and ears, of the idol blew up, and, as w« 
could perceive, had split and deformed the shape of it ; and, in a 
word, till we saw it burned into a mere block- or log of wood ; and 
setting dry forage to it, we found it would be soon quite consumed ; 
80 we began to think of going away ; but the Scotsman said, '' No, we 
must not go, for these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves 
into the fire, and burn themselves with the idol.'' So we resolved to 
stay till the forage was burnt down too, and then came away and left 
them. 

After the feat was performed, we appeared in the morning among 
our fellow travellers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for our 
journey ; nor could any man suggest that we had been anywhere but 
in our beds, aa travelers might be supposed to be, to fit themselve* for 
the fatigues of the day's journey. 

But the affair did not end so. The next day came a great number 
of the country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous 
manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for tha» 
insulting their priests, and burning their Cham Chi-Thaungu. The 
people of Nertzinskoi were at first in a great consternation, for 
they said the Tartars were already no less than thirty thousand 
■trong. The Russian governor sent out messages to appease them 
and gave them all the good words imaginable ; assuring them tbM 



456 A^TEWTtJRES Of 

he knew nothing of it, and that there had nofc a booI in h^e gsamaon 
been abroad, eo that it could not be from anybody there; but if 
they could let him know who did it, they should be exemplarily pun- 
ished. They returned haughtily that all the country reverenced 
the great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal 
■would have dared to offer violence to hie image bat some Christian 
raiecreant; and they therefore resolved to denounce war against 
him and all the Russians, who, they said, were miscreants and 
Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach, or to 
have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the czar having 
strictly charged them to treat the conquered country with gentleness 
and civility, gave them still all the good words he could. At last 
he told them there was a caravan gone toward Russia that morning, 
and perhaps it was some of them who had done this injury ; and that 
if they would be satisfied with, he would send after them to inquire 
into it. This seemed to appease them a little ; and accordingly the 
governor sent after us, and gave us a particular account how the 
thing was ; intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had done 
it, they should make their escape ; but that, whether we had done 
it or no, we should make all haste forward that was possible ; and 
that in the meantime, he would keep them in play as long as he 
could. 

This was very friendly in the governor ; however, when it came to 
the caravan there was nobody knew anything of the matter; and as 
for us that were guilty, we were least of all suspected. However, 
the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that the 
governor gave us, and we travelled two days and two nights without 
any considerable stop, and then we lay at a village called Plothus ; 
nor did we make any long stop here, but hastened on toward Jar- 
awena, another of the Czar of Muscovy's colonies, and where we ex- 
pected we should be safe. But upon the second day's march from 
Plothua, by the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, some of 
our people began to be sensible we were pursued. We had entered 
a great desert, and had passed by a great lake called Schaks Oser, 
when we perceived a great body of horse appear on the other side of 
the lake, to the north, we travelling west. We observed they went 
away west, as we did, but had supposed we would have taken that 
eide of the lake, whereas we very happily took the south side j and 
in two days more they disappeared again ; for they, believing we were 
ptUl before them^ pushed on till they came to the river Udda^ a vei^ 



*" ROBINSON CRUSOE. 457 

^at ritfllr when It passea farther north, but ■when we came to it wa 
found it narrow and ferdable. 

The third day, they had either found their mistake, or had intelli- 
gence of us, and came pouring in on U8 toward the dusk of the even- 
ing. W© had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place fof 
our oamp, which was very convenient for the night ; for as we were 
upon a desert, though but at the beginning of it, that was above five 
hundred miles over, we had no town to lodge at, and, indeed, ex- 
pected none but the city of Jarawena, which we had yet two days' 
march to. The desert, however, had some few woods in it on this 
aide, and little rivers, which ran all into the great river Udda ; it war 
in a narrow strait, between little but very thick woods, that w 
pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to be attacked be 
fore morning. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for ; but as it 
was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go about in troops in that desert 
80 the caravans always fortify themselves every night against them, 
as against robbers ; it was therefore no new thing to be pursued 

But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels, a most ad- 
vantageous camp ; for we lay between two woods, with a little rivu- 
let running just before our front, so that we could not be surrounded, 
or attacked in any way but in our front or rear. We took care also 
to make our front as strong as we could, by placing our packs, with 
our camels and horses, all in a line on the inside of the river, and 
felling some trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but the enemy was 
upon us before we had finished our situation. They did not come o» 
us like thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers to us to 
demand the men to be delivered up to them that had abused their 
priests, and burned their god Cham Chi-Thaungu with fire, that they 
might burn them with fire ; and upon this, they said, they would gc 
away, and do us no farther harm, otherwise they -v^-^uld destroy us 
all. Our men looked very blank at this message, and "began to stare 
at one another, to see who looked with the most guilt in their faces ; 
bat, nobody was the word : nobody did it. The leader of the cara- 
ran sent word he was well assured that it was not done by any of 
our oamp ; that we were peaceable merchants, travelling on our busi- 
nesB ; that we had done no harm to them or to any one else ; and 
that, therefore, they must look farther for their enemies who had in- 
jured them, for we were not the people ; so desired tham not to ii» 
txurb us, for if thej did, we should defend ourselyes.

great crowd of them came runuiug dowu m iLo moraijg hy V-e&k of 
day to our camp ; but seeing us in such an uiiaccouiitablo fciluatiyn, 
they durst oome no farther than the brook iu oar irciji, wlieic tl.ty 
stood, and showed us such a number that indeed cerrifitd us very 
much; for those that spoke least of them spoke 01 tea tiicutand. 
Here they stood and looked at us awhile, and then eetfcicg up u groat 
bewl, they let fly a great crowd of arrows among us ; but we were 
■well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under baggage, and 
I do not remember that one of us was hurt. 

Some time after this we saw them move a little to our right, and 
expected them on the rear ; when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of 
Jarawena, in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the 
caravan, said to him '' I'll go send all these people away to Siheilka f 
this was a city four or five days' journey at least to the right, and 
rather behind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on 
horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as it were back to 
Nertzinskoi ; after this, he takes a great circuit about, and cornea di- 
rectly on the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to 
tell them a long story, that the people who had burned the Cham 
Chi-Thaungu were gone to Siheilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as 
he called them, that is to say, Christians ; and that they bad resolved 
to burn the god Schal-Isar, belonging to the Tongueses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and perfectly spoke their 
language, he counterfeited so well that they all took it from him, and 
away they all drove in a most violent hurry to Siheilka, which, it 
eeems, was five days' journey to the north; and in less than three 
kours they were entirely out of our sight, and we never heard any 
more of them, nor whether they went to Siheilka or no. So we passed 
away safely on to Jarawena, where there was ^a garrison of Musco« 
Tites, and there we rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly 
fatigued with the last day's hard march, and with want of rest iu the 
xdght. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us twenty -three 
days' march. We furnished ourselves with some tents here, for the 
better accommodating ourselves in the night; and the leader of the 
caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wagons of the country, for car- 
rying our water and provisions ; and tbeso carriages wore onr defense 
every night, round our little camp : f^o t'i:'t. hifl the T-v 'jt-s oppenred,

able to hurt us. 



/ /ROBINSON ORUSOr. 45% 

W« may well be supposed to want rest again after tnis long jour- 
aey, for in this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and scarce a 
bufih, though we saw abundance of sable-hunters, who are all Tartars 
of the Mogul Tartary, of which this country is a part : and they fre- 
quently attack small caravans, but we saw no numbers of them to- 
gether. 

After wc had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty well 
inhabited; that is to say, we found our towns and castles, settled by 
the Czar of Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect 
the caravans and defend the country against the Tartars, who would 
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty 
has given such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and 
merchants, that if there are any Tartars heard of in the country, de- 
tachments of the gari'isons are always sent to see the travellers safe 
from station to station. And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I 
bad an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots merchant, 
who was acquainted with him, offered us a guard of fifty men, if we 
thought there was any danger, to the next station. 

I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe we 
should find the country better inhabited, and the people more civilized, 
but I found myself mistaken in both ; for we had yet the nation of the 
ToDgiieses to pass through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism 
and barbarity as before, only as they were conquered by the Musco- 
vites, they were not so dangerous ; but for rudeness of manners, and 
idolatry, no people in the world ever went beyond them. They are 
clothed all in the skins of beasts, and their houses are built of the 
same ; you know not a man from a woman, neither by the ruggednesa 
of their countenances nor their clothes ; and in the winter, when th« 
ground is covered with snow, they live underground in vaults, which 
have cavities going from one to another. 

If the Tartars had the'r Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole villa<^6 or 
country, these had idols n every hut and every cave ; besides, they 
worship the stars, the sun, the water, the snow, and, in a word, every 
thing they do not understand, and they understand but very little; so 
that every element, every uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing. I 
met with nothing peculiar to myself in all this country, which I reckon 
waS) from the desert I spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half 
of it being another desert, which took us up twelve days' severe trav- 
eling, without house or tree ; and we were obliged again to carry our 
own proTisious, as well water as bread. After we were out of this 
flfsert, and had travelled two days, we eajae to Janezaj, a Mqfloovite 



490 ADVENTURES OJF 

eity or station on the great river Janezay (Yonisey), which, they told 
us there, parted Europe from Asia. 

Here I observed iguorauce and paganism still prevailed, except in 
the Muscovite garrisons ; all the country between the river Oby and 
the river Janezay is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, 
as the remotest of the Tartars : nay, as any nation, for aught I know, 
in Asia or America. I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite 
governors whom I had an opportunity to converse with, that the poor 
pagans are not much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under the 
Muscovite government ; which they acknowledged was true enough ; 
but that, as they said, was none of their business; that if the czar ex- 
pected to convert his Siberian, Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it should 
be done by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers : and they 
added, with more sincerity than I expected, that they found it was not 
80 much the concern of their monarch to make the people Christians 
as it was to make them subjects. .,.^, „ 

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a wild unculti- 
vated country, barren of people and good management; otherwise it 
is in itself a most pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country. What ln> 
habitants we found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent among 
them from Russia ; for this is the country, I mean on both sides the 
river Oby, whither the Muscovite criminals that are not put to death 
are banished, and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever 
come away. 

I have nothing to say of my particular affairs till I came to To- 
bolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I continued some time on tha 
following occasion. 

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and winter 
began to come on apace ; whereupon my partner and I called a coun- 
eil about our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, ns we 
•were bound for England, and not for Moscow, to consider how to dis^ 
pose of ourselves. They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us 
over the snow in the winter time ; and indeed, they have such things 
that it w»uld be incredible to relate the particulars of by which means 
the Russians travel more in the winter than they can in summer, as 
in these sledges they are able to run night and day. The snow being 
frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which the hills, vales, 
rivers and lakes are all smooth and hard as a stone, and they run upoa 
the surface, without any regard to what is underneath. 

But I had uo occasion to push at a winter journey of this kind; 1 
was bound to En^and, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways : 



BoMksoN cAtrsos^ 40i 

eitliM* X jinst go on as the caravan went, till I came to OK^iosiaw, and 
theu go off west for Narva and tHe Gulf of Finland, and bo to Dantzic, 
•where I might possibly sell my China cargo to good advantage ; or I 
mutt leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, whence I had 
bat eix days by water to Archangel, and thence might be 8»ire 
of shipping either to England, Holland, or HamburglL 

Now, to go any of these journeys in the winter would have been 
preposterous : for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been frozen 
up, and I could not get passage ; and to go by land in those countrie* 
Vfaa far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars j likewise, to go to 
Archangel in October, all the ships would be gone from thence, an<5 
©Ten the merchants who dwell there in summer retire south to Moscow 
in the winter, when the ships are gone, so that I could have nothing 
but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of provisions, and 
must lie in an empty town all the winter ; so that, upon the whole, 1 
thought it much my better way to let the caravan go, and make pro* 
vision to winter where I was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude o! 
about sixty degrees, where I was sure of three things to wear out a 
cold winter with, viz., plenty of provisions, such as the country afibrd* 
ed, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excellent company. 

I was now in a quite different climate from my beloved island, 
where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague j on the contrary, 
I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back, and never made 
any fire but without doors, which was necessary for dressing mj 
food, &c. Now I made me three good vests, with large robes or gowa 
^over them, to hang down to the feet, and button close to the wrists; 
and all these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our way ii) 
England, of making fires in every room in the house in open chimn€y% 
which, when the fire was out, always kept the air in the room cola 
as the climate ; but taking an apartment in a good house in the town, 
1 ordered a chimney to be built like a furnace, in the center of six 
several rooms, like a stove ; the funnel to carry the emoke went up one 
way, the door to come at the fire went in another, and all the rooxm 
were kept equally warm, but no fire seen, just as they heat the bag- 
nios in England. By this means, we had always the same climate 
in all the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved ; and how cold 
soever it was without, it was always warm within j and yet we saw 
no fire, nor were ever incommoded with smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to 
lii««t with good company 1 r , in a counttj «9 Wbarou» as tiu^t oi

tlia most northerly parts of Europe, near the frozeu ocean, ^dtbia feut 
a very few degrees of Nova Zambia. But this being the country 
where the state crimiuala of Muscovy, aa I observed before, are all 
banished, this city was full of noblemen, gentlemen, Boldiaia, and 
^urtiera of Muscovy. Here waa the famous Prince Gall tzen, the 
eld general Robostiski, and several other persons of note, and some 
ladies. By means of my Scots merchant, whom, nevertheless, I parted 
■with here, I made an acquaintance with several of these gentlemen j, 
and from these in the long winter nights in which I stayed here, I re» 
eeived several very agreeable visits. 

It was talking one night with Prince '■'■ ' " ^ One of the banished 
ministers of state belonging to the Gear of Muscovy, that the die* 
course of ray particular case began. He had been telling me abund« 
ance of fine things of the greatness, the magnificence, the dominionsii 
and the absolute power of the emperor of the Russians j I interrupted 
him, and told him I was a greater and more pow^erful prince than 
even the Czar of Muscovy was, though my dominions were not so 
large, or my people so many. The Russian grandee looked a little 
Burprised, and fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what 
1 meant. I told him his wonder would soon cease when I had explained 
myself. First, I told him I had absolute disposal of the lives and 
fortunes of all my subjects; that, notwithstanding my absolute power, 
I had not one person disaffected to my government, or to my person, 
in all my dominions. He shook his head at that, and said there, in- 
deed, I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. I told him that all the lands in 
my kingdom were my own, and all my subjects were not only my 
tenants, but tenants at will ; that they would all fight for me to the 
last drop ; and that never tyrant, for such I acknowledged myself to 
be, was ever bo universally beloved, and yet so horribly feared by his 
rubjects. 

After amusing him with these riddles in government for a while, I 
opened the case, and told him the story at large of my living in the 
island ; and how I managed both myself and the people that were 
under me, just as I have since minuted it down. They were exceed- 
ingly taken with the story, and especially the prince, who told me 
■with a sigh that the true greatness of life was to be mastera of our- 
(selves ; that he would not have exchanged such a state of life aa mine 
to be Czar of Muscovy ; and that he found more felicity in the retire- 
ment he seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found in the 
highest authority he enjoyed in the court of hie master, the osar ; that 
Ibe heigth of kuman wisdom was to bring our tempers dowa H nor

oiroumsuinces, and to make a oalm within, under the weight of the 
greatest storms without. When he cazne first hither, he said he used 
to tear the hair from his head, and the clothes from his back, as others 
had done before him ; but a little time and consideration had made 
him look into himself, as well as round him, to things without ; that 
he found the mind of man, if it was but once brought to reflect upoa 
the state of universal life, and how little this world was concerned ia 
its true felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself, 
fully satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends and desires^ 
with but very little assistance from the world; the air to breathe in, 
food to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and liberty for exercise, in 
order to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the world could 
do for ua ; and though the greatness, the authority, the riches, and 
the pleasures which some enjoyed in the world, had much in them 
that waa agreeable to us, yet all those things chiefly gratified the 
coarsest of our affections, such as our ambition, our particular pride, 
avarice, vanity, and sensuality ; all which, being the mere product of 
the v.'orst part of man, were in themselves crimes, and had in them 
the seeds of all manner of crimes ; but neither were related to, nor 
concerned with, any of those virtues that constituted us wise men, or 
of those graces that distinguished us as Christians; that being now 
deprived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full ex- 
ercise of all those vices, he said he was at leisure to look upon the 
dark side of them, where he found all manner of deformity, and waa 
now convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and 
great, and preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in a 
future etate; and in this, he said, they were more happy in their 
banishment than all their enemies were, who had the full possession 
of all tlie wealth and power they had left behind them. " Nor sir," 
says he, " do I bring my mind to this poUtically, by the necessity of 
my circumstances, which some call miserable ; but, if I know any- 
thing of myself, I would not now go back, though the czar my master 
bhould call me, and reinstate me in all my former grandeur ; I eay, I^ 
would no more go back to it than I beli(»ved my soul, when it shall 
be delivered from this prison of the body, and has had a taste of tha 
glorioas state beyond life, would come back to the jail of flesh and 
blood it is now enclosed in, and leave heaven, to deal in the dirt and 
crime of human affairs." 

Ue spoke this with bo much warmth in his temper, so much '^meet.

OQoe thought myself a kiad of moBarob in mj old st&tioa, of which 
I had given him an account ; but that I thought he waa not only a 
monarch, but a great conqueror ; for that he that has got a victory 
over hie own exorbitant deaires, and the absolute dominion over hint- 
•elf, whose reason entirely governs his will, is certainly greater than 
he that conquers a city. " But. my lord," said I, " shall I take th« 
liberty to ask you a question ?"' " With all my heart,"' says he. '•' If 
the door of your liberty was opened," said I, " would you not tak« 
hold of it to dehver you from this exile ?" '■' Hold," said he, "your 
question is subtle, and requires some serious, just distinctions, to giva 
it a sincere answer ; and I will give it you from the bottom of my 
heart. Nothing that I know of in this world, would move me to de- 
liver myself from this state of banishment, except these two : firct, 
the enjoyment of my relations ; and, secondly, a little warmer climate ; 
hut I protest to you that to go back to the pomp of the court, the 
glory, the power, the huiry of a minister of state ; the wealth, the 
gaiety, and the pleasures of a courtier ; if my master should send 
me word this moment that he restores to me all he banished me from, 
I protest, if I knew myself at all, I would not leave this wilderneBS, 
these deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace at Moscow." 
" But, my lord," said I, " perhaps you not only are banished from 
the pleasures of the court, and from the power, authority, and wealth 
you enjoyed before, but you may be absent too from some of the con- 
veniences of life ; your estate, perhaps, confiscated, and your effects 
plundered ; and the supplies left you here may not be suitable to the 
ordinary demands of life." " Ah," says he, " that is as you suppose 
me to be a lord, or a prince, &c. ; so, indeed, I am; but you are now 
to consider me only as a man, a human creature, not at all distin- 
guished from another ; and so I can suffer no want, unless I should 
he visited with sickness and distempers. However, to put the ques- 
tion out of dispute, you see our manner , we are, in tliia place, fiva 
persona of rank ; we live perfectly retired, aa suited to a state of ban- 
ishment ; we have something rescued from the shipwreck of our fo^. 
tunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting for food ; 
hut the poor soldiers, who are here without that help, live in as much 
plenty as we, who go into the woods and catch sables and foxes ; tha 
laboring of a month will maintain them a year ; and, as the way of 
living is not expensive, so it is oot hard to get sufBcient to ourselvet. 
So that objection is out of doors." 

I have not room to give a full aooount of the most agreeabi* oou- 
Tf!rf«<iHm T ha^. with ^\* truly ^w*t mm; in all whioh h« 8how«4 that 



hb mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so 
wpported by religion, as well as by a vast share of wisdom, that his 
contempt of the world was really as much as he had expressed, and 
that he was alwajs the same to the last, as will appear in the story I 
am going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I thought 
it ; the cold so intense that I could not so much as look abroad wich- 
out being wrapped in furs, and a mask of fur before my face, or ra- 
ther a hood, with only a hole for breath, and two for sight : the little 
daylight we had was, as we reckoned, for three months, not above 
five hours a day, and six at most ; only that snow lying on the ground 
oontinually, and the weather clear, it was never quite dark. Our 
horses were kept, or rather starved, underground, and as for our eer- 
vants, whom we hired here to Icok after ourselves and horses, we 
had, every now and then, their fingers and toes to thaw and take care 
of, lest they should mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close, the 
walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our food was 
•hiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season ; bread good 
«nough, but baked as biscuits ; dried fish of several sorts, and some 
flesh of mutton and of the buffaloes, which is pretty good meat. All 
the stores of provisions for the winter are laid up in summer, and 
well cured : our drink was water, mixed with aqua-vitae instead of 
brandy ; and for a treat, mead instead of wine, which, however, they 
have excellent good. The hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, 
frequently brought us in fine venison, and sometimes bear's flesh, but 
we 'did not much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea, with 
which we treated our friends, as abovo, and we lived very cheerfully 
•nd well, all things considered. 

It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, end the 
weather at least tolerable ; so the other travellers began to prepare 
eledgea to carry them over the enow, and to get things ready to be 
going : but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for Archangel, 
and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no motion ; knowing very 
well that the ships from the south do not set out for that part of the 
world till May or June, and that if I was there by the beginning of 
August, it would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away ; 
and therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others did : in a word, I 
saw a great many people, nay all the travellers, go away before me. 
It seems, every year they go thence to Muscovy for trade, viz., to 
•wsy furs, sad but ae^essaries, whicli they brin^ h^ok "with thetn to

furnisk th»ir ehops : t^lso others went on the same errant, 10 Arohaiv 
gel; but then they all being to come back again, above eight hundred 
miles, went all out before me. 

In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up ; and, 
aa I was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all these people 
were banished by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet, when they 
came there, were left at liberty to go whither they would, why they 
did not then go away to any part of the world, wherever they thought 
fit ; and I began to examine what should hinder thein from making 
■uch an attempt. But my wonder was over when I entered upon that 
lubject with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus : 
* Consider, first, sir," said he, " the place where we are ; and, secondly 
the condition we are in ; especially the generality of the people who 
aare banished hither. We are surrounded with stronger things than 
barg or bolts : on the north side an unnavigable ocean, where ship 
never sailed, and boat never swam ; every other way, wo have above 
a thousand miles to pass through the Czar's own dominions, and by 
ways utterly impassable, except by the roads made the government, 
and through the towns garrisoned by his troops ; so that we could 
•either pass undiscovered by the road nor subsist any other way : so 
&at it is in vain to attempt it." 

I was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they were m & 
prison every jot aa secure as if they had been locked up in a castle 
at Moscow : however, it came into my thoughts that I might cer- 
lainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent 
person j and that, whatever hazard I ran, I would certainly try if I 
could carry him oflF. Upon this I took an occasion; one evenmg, to 
tell him my thoughts. I represented to him that it was very easy 
for Bie to carry him away, there being no guard over him in the 
country; and aa I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and 
that I went in the retinue of a caravan, by which I was not obliged 
to lie in the stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp every 
night where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archan^ 
gel, where I would immediately secure him on board an English ship, 
and carry him safe along with me ; and as to his subsistence, and othei* 
particulars, it should be my care, till he could better supply him- 
self 

He heard rae very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the 
while I spoke ; nay, I could see in his very face that what I said put 
his ipiriis ii«to an exceeding ferment ; his color frequently changed, 
fei? I7?9 J'>*»i^'^, y«^ aad his b§*r<> flMttere<i, that it might b^ ^vei 



perceived in hia countenance ; nor could he immediately answer txtm 
when I had done, and as it were hesitated what he would say to U: 
but after he had paused a little, he embraced me, and said, " How un- 
happy are we, unguarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest 
acts of friendship are made snares unto us, and we are made temp- 
ters of one another ! My dear friend,-' said he, " your offer is so sincere, 
has such kindness in it, i» eo disinterested in itself, and is so calculated 
for my advantage, that I must have very little knowledge of the world 
if I did not wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation I hav« 
upon me to you for it. But did you believe I was sincere in what 
I have often said to you of my contempt of the world ? Did you 
believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had really obtained 
that degree of felicity here that had placed me above all that the 
world could give me 7 Did you believe I was sincere when I told 
you I would not back, if I was recalled even to be all that I oaco 
was in the court, with the favor of the Czar, my master 7 Did you 
believe me, my friend, to be an honest man, or did you believe me to 
be a boasting hypocrite V Here he stopped, as if he would hear what I 
would say ; but, indeed, I soon after perceived that he stopped becauso 
his spu'its were in motion, his great heart was full of struggles, and 
he could not got on. I was, I confess, astonished at the thing as 
well as at the man, and I used some arguments with him to urge him 
to set himself free ; that he ought to look upon this aa a door open- 
ed by Heaven for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence, 
who has the care and disposition of all events, to do himself good 
and to render himself useful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself: " How do you know, dr/' 
eaid he, warmly, " but that, instead of a siuumons fi?om Heaven, it may 
be a feint of another instrument; representing in alluring colors to 
me the show of felicity aa a deliverance, which may in itself be my 
stiare, and tend directly to my ruin 7 Here I am free from th« temp- 
tation of returning to my former miserable greatness ; there I am not 
sure but that all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, 
which I know remain in nature, may revive and take root, and, ia a 
word, again overwhelm me; and then the happy prisoner, whom you 
see now master of his soul's liberty, shall be the miserable «laTe of 
hia own senses, in the full of all pergonal liberty. Dear sir, let me 
remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of life, 
rather than purchase a show of freedom at the expense of the liberty 
of my reason, and at the future happiness 'Vfhich I now bare In lay 
view, but will, then, I fear^ quickly lose sight of, for I ac» bttt fledi^

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood silen^ 
looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I saw. I^e struggle m 
his soul was so great, that though the weather was extremely cold, it 
put him into a most violent sweat, and I foimd he wanted to give rent 
to his mind ; so I said a word or two, that I would leave him to con« 
aider of it, and wait on him again, and then I withdrew to my owu 
apartment. 

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the door of 
my room, and I was going to open the door, but he had opened it and 
came in. " My dear friend," said he, •♦ you had almost overset me^ 
but I am recovered. Do not take it ill that I do not close with youi 
offer ; I assure you that it is cot for want of sense or the kindnfrss of 
it in you; and I came to make the most sincere acknowledgment of 
it to you ; but I hope I have got the victory over myself" *' My 
lord," said I, " I hope you are fully satisfied that you do not resii t the 
call of Heaven." "Sir," said he, "if it had been from Heaveb, the 
same power would have influenced me to have accepted it: Vut I 
hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from Heaven that I declined it ; 
and I have infinite satisfaction in the partmg, that you shall leave me 
an honest man still, though not a free man." 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to him 
of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. He em- 
braced me very passionately, and assured me he was sensible of thatj 
and should always acknowledge it; and with that he offered me a 
very fine present of sables, too much, indeed, for me to accept from a 
man in his circumstance, and I would have avoided them, but h« 
would not be refused. 

The next morning I sent my servant to his lordship with a small 
present of tea, and two pieces of China damask, and four little wedgee 
of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six ounces or there^ 
abouts, but were far short of the value of his sables, which, when 1 
came to England, I found worth near two hundred pounds. He ac» 
cepted the tea, and one piece of the damask, and one of the pieces of 
gold, which had a fine stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I 
found he took for the rarity of it, but would not take any more ; and 
he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me I knew what had passed between

that, since I had made Buch a generoua ofifer td mm, he asked me Tf I 
had kindness enough to offer th© same to another person that h« 
would name to me, in whom he had a great share of concern. I told 
him that I could not say I inclined to do so much for any hut himself, 
for whom I had a particular value, and should have been glad to have 
been the instrument of his deliverance ■ however, if he would pleass 
to name the person to me, I would give him my answer. He told me 
it was his only son, who, though I had not seen him, yet he was in tho 
same condition with himself, and above two hundred miles from 
him, on the other side the Oby ; but that, if I consented, he would 
send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made some 
ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his account; 
and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show my respecft 
to him by my concern for his son ; but these things are too tedious to 
repeat here. He sent away the next day for his son; and in about 
twenty days he came back with the messenger, bringing six or seven 
horses loaded with very rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted 
to a very great value. His servants brought the horses into the town, 
hut left the young lord at a distance till night, when he came incog- 
nito into our apartment, and his father presented him to me, and, in 
short, we concerted the manner of our travelling, and everything 
proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox skins, fine 
ermines, and such other furs as are very rich, i« that city, in exchanga 
' for some of the goods I had brought from China : in particulpjr for 
the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest part hore, and 
the rest afterward at Archangel, for a much better price than I eoul^ 
have got at London ; and my partner, who was sensible of tbo p'rolt^ 
and whose business more particularly than mine was merchii'jdis©, 
was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of the traffic we mad« 
here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place, a city, 
I believe, little heard of in the world ; and, indeed, it is so far out of 
the road of commerce, that I know not how it should be much talked 
of. We were now reduced to a very small caravan, having only 
thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all of them passed for mine, 
though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them : it was most 
natural also that I should take more servants with me than I had be- 
fore ; and the young lord passed for ray steward ; what great man I 
ymwed for myself I kno^ not, neither did it oon(»m me to inqmr<v

Wo had hwe the Tv^rsc and tho largest desert to pass ovet that we 
met with in our whcie journey : I call it the worst, because the way 
was very deep in some places, and very uneven in otliers ; the bet^b 
we had to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartar? 
or robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side the river 
Oby, or at least but very seldom ; but we found it otherwise. 

My young lord had a faithful Muscovite, or rather a Siberian ser- 
Tant, who was perfectly acquainted with the country, and led us by 
private roads, so that we avoided coming into the principal towns 
and cities upon the great road, such as Tumen, Soloy Kamskoi, and 
eeveral others ; because the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there 
are very curious and strict in their observation upon travellers, and 
searching lest any of the banished persons of note should make their 
escape that way into Muscovy ; but, by this moan, as we were kept, 
out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we >\'ero 
obliged to encamp and he in our tents, when we might have had rery 
good accommodation in the cities on the way : this the young lord was 
60 sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we Kinxae 
to several cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, with his servant 
in the woods, and met us always at the appointed places. 

We were just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama, 
which in these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia, and 
the first city on the European side was called Soloy Kamskoi, which 
is as much as to say, the great city on the river Kama ; and here wa 
thought to see some evident alteration in the people ; but we were 
tiiistaken : for as we had a vast desert to pass, which is near seven 
h..ndred miles long in some places, but not above two hundred mileo 
c vvr where we passed it, so, till we camo past that horrible place, w« 
four. A very little difference between that country and the Mogul Tar- 
tai'v ; the people are mostly pagans, and little better than the savages 
of America ; their bouses and towns full of idols, and their way of liv- 
ing vJoUy barbarous, except in the cities, as above, and the villages 
near thorn, when they are Christians, as they call themselves, of th» 
Crcok ;'hurch; but have their religion mingled with so many relics 
©f supc-vsti'ion, that it is scarce to bo known in some places from mere 
sorcery ''ud witchcraft. 

In pa8si;.-.g this forest I thought, indeed, ww raiisi (after all our dan- 
gers were to our imagination escaped, as before) havo been plundered 
and robl)ed, and perhaps murdorod by a troop of thieves; of what

\n aumber ; they came so aear to us as to be within two musket ehotf^, 
and asking no questions surrounded us with their horses, and loolieS 
verj earnestly upon us twiee, at length they placed themselves just «> 
our way ; upon which we drew up in a little line before our camolsv 
being not above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up thus, we 
halted, and sent out the Siberian servant Avho attended his lord, to aec 
who they Avere : his master was the more willing to let him go, be- 
cause he was not a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian troop 
sent out after him. The man came up near them with a flag of truce, 
and called to them, but though ho spoke several of their languages, 
or dialects of languages rather, he could not understand a word they 
said ; however, after some signs to him not to come nearer to them, at 
his peril, the fellow came back no wieer than he went; only that by 
their dress, he said, he believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, 
or of the Circassian hordes, and that there must be more of them upoa. 
the great desert, though he had never beard that any of them wotp 
eeen so far north before. 

About an hour after, they again made a motion to attack us, and 
rode round our little wood to see where they might break in ; but 
finding us always ready to face them, they went off again, and we re- 
solved not to stir for thai night. 

This was small comfort to us ; however, we had no remedy ; there 
•was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance, a little 
grove, and very near the road ; I immediately resolved we should 
advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there ; 
for, first, I considered that the trees would in a great measure cover 
us from their arrows, and, in tho next place, they could not come to 
charge us in a body ; it was, indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who 
p. o posed it, and who had this excellency attending him, that he was 
a'- ivays readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of 
the most danger. We advanced immediately, with what speed we 
could, and gained that little wc^; the Tartars, or thieves, for we 
knew not what to call them, keeping their stand, and not attempting 
to hinder us. When we came thither, we found to our great satisfac- 
tion that it was a swampy piece of ground, and on the one side a very 
great spring of water, which running out in a little brook was, a little 
farther, joined by another of the like size ; and was, in short, the 
source of a considerable river, called afterward the Wirtska; the 
trees which grew about this spri g were not above two hondred, but 
very large, and stood quite thick, so that as sooa as we got iu we saw

While wo stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy soma hotii% 
without perceiving they made any movement, our Portuguese, with 
some help, cut several arms of trees half off, and laid them hanging 
Mresa irom one tree to another, and in a manner fenced us in. About 
two hours before night they came down directly upon us, and though 
we bad not perceived it, we found thfe ' had been joined by some more 
♦f the same, so that they were near fo^ •^core horse ; whereof how- 
ever, we fancied some were women. They came on till they were 
within half-shot of our Itttle wood, when we fired one musket without 
ball, and called to them in the Kussian tongue to know what they 
wanted, and bade them keep off; but they came on with a double fary 
up to the wood side, not imagining we were eo barricaded that they 
could not easily break in. Our old pilot was our captain as well as 
our engineer, and desired us not to fire upon them till they came 
within pistol-shot, that we might be sure to kill ; and that when wo 
did fire, we should be sure to take good aim ; wo bade him give th/j 
word of command, which he delayed so long, that there were some 
of them within two pikes' length of us when we let fly. We aimed 
so true that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others, 
as also several of their horses ; for we had all of us loaded our piece* 
with two or three bullets at least. 

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated immedl* 
ately about one hundred rods from us, in which time we loaded our 
pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance, we sallied out, and 
catched four or five of their horses, whose riders vre supposed wero 
killed; and coming up to their dead, we judged they were Tartars, 
but knew not how they came to make an excursion of such an unusual 
IcngtL 

W© slept little, you may be sure, but spent the most part of tho 
night in strengthening our situation, and barricading the entrances 
inio the wood, and keeping a strict watch. We waited for daylight, 
and when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discovery, indeed ; for 
the enemy, who we thought were discouraged with the reception they 
{DOt with, were now greatly increased, had set up eleven or twelro 
bats or tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us ; and this littls 
oamp they had pitched upon the open plain, about three quarters of 
a mile from us. We were, indeed, surprised at this discovery ; and 
now, I confess, I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had ; tho 
loss of ray effects did not lie so near me, though very considerable,

foaa through, &nd eveu iu sight of our port, whew we expected eafety 
and deliverance. Ae to mj partner, he \ras raging, and declared thut 
to loae his goods would be his ruin, and that he would rather die than 
bo starved ; and he waa for fighting to the last drop. 

The young lord, an gallant aa ever flesh showed itself, was for fight. 
Ing to the last also ; and my old pilot was of the opinion that we 
were able to resist them all in the situation we were then in, and thus 
we spent the day in debates of what we should do ; but towards 
evening we found that the number of our enemies still Increased, and 
we did oot know that by the morning they might be a still greater 
number ; so I began to inquire of those people we had brought from 
Tobolaki, if there were no private ways by which we might avoid them 
in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or get help to guard 
uf) over the desert. The Siberian, who waa servant to the young lord, 
'iold us if we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to 
fisirry ua off in the night, to a way that went north, towards the river 
Petrou, by which he made no question but we might get away, and 
tlie Tartars never the wiser; but, he said, his lord had told hiaa he 
would not retreat, but would rather choose to fight I told him ha 
mistook his lord; for that he waa too wise a man to love fight- 
ing for the sake of it, and that I knew his lord was brave enough by 
what he had shown already j but that hia lord knew better than to 
desire seventeen or eighteen men to fight five hundred unless an ua* 
avoidable necessity forced them to it; and that, if he thought it po8= 
*ible for us to escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to 
Httempt it He answered, if hia lordship gave him such orders he 
would lose hia life if he did not perform it ; we soon brought his 
lord to give that order, though privately, aad we immediately pre- 
pared for the putting it in practice. 

And, first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in our 
little camp, which we kapt burning, and prepared so as to make it^ 
burn all night, that the Tartars might conclude we were etill there ; 
but as soon as it was dark, and we could see the stars (for our guide 
would not Btir before), having all oar horses and camels ready loaded, 
we followed our new guide, who I soon found steered himself by the 
north etar. 

After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be lighter 
Btili ; not that it was quite dark all night, but the moon be^aa to 
rise, eo that, in short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be ; 
but by six o'clock the next morniog we were got above thirty miles,

named Kermazioskoy, where we rested, and heard n«khing ol iltii 
Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours before night we set ©at 
again, aud travelled till eight the next morning, though not quite bo 
hard as before ; aud about seven o'clock we passed a little river, 
called Kirtza, aud came to a good large town inhabited by Rustsians, 
called Ozomoys : there we heard that several troops of Kalmucks had 
been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now completely out of 
danger of them, which was to our great satisfaction. Here we wer« 
©bliged to get some fresh honpes; and having need enough of rest, we 
stayed five days ; and my partner and I agreed to give the honest 
Siberian who brought us thither the value of ten pistoles. 

In five days more we came to Veuslima, upon the river VVirtiogda, 
and running into the Dwina ; we were there, very happily, near the 
end of our travels by land, that river being navigable, in seven days' 
passage to Archangel. From hence we came to Lawrenskoy the 3d 
of July; and providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a 
barge fcr our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived aU 
Bafe at Archangel the 18th ; having been a year five months and three 
days on the journey, including our stay of eight months at Tobolskl 
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the 
ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher come in 
above a month sooner than any of the EngUsh ships ; when, after 
some consideration that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be as 
good a market for our goods as London, we all took freight with him j 
and, having put our goods on board, it was most natural for me to 
put my steward on board to take care of them : by which means my 
young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself, never 
coming on shore again all the time we stayed there ; and tliis he did 
that he might not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow 
merchants would certainly have seen and discovered him. 

We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the same 
year ; and after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived safe in the Elbe 
the 18th of September. Here my partner aud I found a very good 
eale for our goods, as well those of China as the sables, &c., of 
Siberia; and dividing the produce, my share amounted to three 
thousand four hundred and seventy.five pounds seventeen shilUngj 
and threepence, includmg about sis hundred pounds' worth of dia, 
inoads which I purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took leave of us, and went up th« Elbe, ip 
order to go to the court of YiftQua, whftrQ b« r«8olYed to S6«k pro-

To conclude, ha ring stayed near four months at Hamburgh, I carae 
from thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked in the packtit, 
and arrived in I»ondon the 10th of January, 1705, having been absent 
from England ten years and nine months. And here I resolved t© 
prepare for a longer journey than all these, having lived a life of 
infinite variety seventy-two yeara, and learned sufficiently to know tshe 
va^BQ of retirement, and the blending of ending our days in pefto .

that of Shakespeare all other dramatists. It is certainly tlie
