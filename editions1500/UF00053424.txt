_.;._._

1 ANIEL DEFOE, the author of " Robinson Crusoe," had a career
which is, perhaps, one of the most remarkable in English literary
( history. The times in which he lived and worked were, indeed,
' such as produced remarkable careers. He was born in 1661, in
the year after the Restoration. Milton was still alive, and men were still com--
paring closely the Monarchy with the Commonwealth. When the Plague of
London occurred, which he described so ingeniously, if not ingenuously, as an
eye-witness, he was {our years old. He was sixteen whe'n Titus Oates evoked
the Popish scare. He saw Charles II. succeeded by james 11., and took part
at twenty-{our in the rising of the Duke of Monmouth, which ended in the
battle of Sedgemoor and the execution of its leader. He hailed with joy
V"the Glorious Revolution." He took a personal part in arranging the Union
:between England and Scotland, did his very best to inflame the minds of the
:people against the Pretender and the Jacobites, saw the Hanoverian line
_come in, and died a pensioner of George II.

He was the son of a Cripplegate butcher named James Fee, and in his
early years called himself by his patronymic; but wishing apparently to
dignify himself with Norman lineage, he assumed the lordly prefix with as
little compunction as Robinson Crusoe showed in pretending that he was a
governor in his castle, when he wished to catch the mutinecrs, whose coming
enabled him to escape from his island.

James Foe Was a Nonconformist, and desiring for his son the office of
Dissenting Minister, gave him an education with the pulpit in view; but
when the time came for him to take the sacred ofl'ice, Daniel _x'efused a.
position which he regarded as unsuitable to his temper. His education
had not been so academical as to satisfy the exquisite wits of the literary
Coffee House, and, throughout his life he was taunted with being illiterate ;
but it had at least made him desire knowledge, and capable both of acquiring
and imparting it. When he turned from the pulpit to the counting-housc,
he set up as a trader in hosiery; his business led him to an acquaintance
with people who had seen many lands, and almost certainly took him abroad
himself ; he probably visited Spain, and there imbibed that admiration for
the Spanish character which induced him to make the Spaniards on the Island
high types of' humanity ; and very possibly the journey from Lisbon through
' France to London is founded upon reminiscences of his wanderings. But
one thing is certain. . While his business was going to ruin and he was pre-
paring bankruptcy for himself, he was acquiring languages, mastering
geography, and learning the course of the world's trade. He was never for
long together very prosperous. He would bask in the sunshine for a while,
and then we see him flying away from his creditors, and apparently undone for
ever. But in his worst hour he never despaired, and misfortune only showed
of what infinite resources he was master.

His experiences were meanwhile fitting him for the real business of his life.
For, successful as he was as a romancer, story-telling in the elaborate fashion of
modem fiction was taken up only when he was fifty-eight years of age. Defoe
was led to it through the paths of journalism. He was a born journalist.
His early interest in politics is shown by his complicity in the Monmouth
Rebellion; his peculiarly practical education had put facts at his command
not to the hand of the purely literary man ; and he began early in life--how
early we do not know--to write pamphlets upon current events. His first:
great success was a poem in the satiric style of Dryden called, " The True
Born Englishman," which touched the burning question of the day. The
Jacobites' made it a charge against King William that he was a Dutchman,
and asked for an English ruler. In reply, Defoe, in the strongest language,
rated all his countrymen as descendants of a horrid crowd of rambling
thieves and drones, who ransacked kingdoms and dispcopled towns, Picts,
Scots, painted Britons, Norwegian pirates, and red-haired Danes. "These
' are the heroes that despise the Dutch," he exclaimed; and all England
bought the lampoon upon itself, and laughed heartily over it. It hit the
popular taste, and, what was more, it pleased the sovereign. William called
the hosier to his closet ; and the son of a butcher became the mouthpiece of
the King.
Defoe had been an independent man until this moment. He had written
for love of the cause, inspired by conviction. And as, when he was at his
best, he might have given hints to Swift in style, so he might have sustained
the lofty patriotism of Milton himself, and have been eyes to the cleverest
statesmen of that period. But there is every evidence that his connection
with the Court became the means of corruption; and when he was at his
worst, he might have taught Talleyrand the method of plausible dissimulation,
and Pope the art of mystification. So long as "William lived, Defoe's services
were redeemed from the suspicion of being mercenary by his sincerity, but
afterwards, having tasted the delights of Court favour, he became the lacquey
of successive Governments, and what, in William's service, had been a uniform,
was, in the service of his successors, a livery. '

He did not sell himself for hire, however, until he had discovered the perils
of independence, and the chances of being misunderstood. When the contro-
versy was raging about the Act of Toleration, Occasional Conformity, and
other measures touching the rights and liberties of his brethren, the Dissenters,
he produced a pamphlet called "A Short Way with Dissenters," in which,
without stating his own opinion, he argued as a'High Tory that the best
way to get rid of the Separatists was to banish all who went to a meeting-
house, and to hang the preacher. The High Tories were in power. Queen
Anne herself was incensed at its being represented as possible that she would
adopt this policy. Defoe was charged with libel ; and the court condemned
him to prison and the piliory. Until the Government put their construction
upon the pamphlet, the Dissenters, who in that day rather despised literary
artifice, looked askance upon the author and his work. But now the mob
made Defoe a hero. When, on three days at the end of July, 1703, he
appeared in the pillory before the old Royal Exchange, the citizens gathered
round him, and the women bombarded him with flowers, while the men drank
his health. He revenged himself by writing " A Hymn to the Pillory," which
declared that his appearance in it was a scandal. While he was still in prison,
the High Tories lost their places, and Harley and the more moderate men of
the party came into power. Harley released Defoe upon conditions. Defoe
was set at liberty upon the understanding that he was to be henceforth
the bondsman of the Government. This was not his last discovery that
whatever may have been the taste for architecture and blue china in those
days, irony was not appreciated in the reign of the much bcpraised Queen
Anne. He wrote another pamphlet ten years later in the interest of the Pro-
testant Succession,asking " \Vhat if the Pretender should Come ?"and " What
if the'Queen should Die? " Another libel, and another imprisonment ; from
which a'gain he had to pray the Government to release him

Defoe' 5 services to the Government were rendered' In his capacity ofjournalist
' He founded the Reuzew, and he wrote for many papers on both sides; but his
crime was that he professed to his friends to be of one opinion, to the public
to be independent, and to his leaders to be on their side; while all the time'
he was secretly taking Government pay to write, in various pa-peIs, the precise
contrary of the opinions which he was supposed to hold He got on the staff-
of one paper for the express purpose of turning his position to the advantage
of the Government, connived at the prosecution of its proprietor, and gene-'
rally betrayed those who paid him' for his work believing it to be honest--.
while all the time he was receiving State pay to act the traitor. It is not'
witheut some satisfaction that one notes that he was at length discovered,
and that the man whom he had "gulled, " having no remedy 1n law, inflicted
severe chastisement upon him.

As a journalist, Defoe may be said to have been the first descriptive:
reporter, the anticipator of the Society journal, and the inventor of the leading
article. And while he was thus employed he was also engaged in constant
secret service for the Government. He was as astute as he was plausibie.i
When the Government of F rance sought to bribe him, he pocketed the money>>
and told the Queen.

His last days should have been happy. His services to the Government
and his journalism and his novels had brought him prosperity. He had a:
family, and his daughters had married well: his son had been in trouble, but
only for such a journalistic oiTence as the father had committed. Yet trouble'
came, we hardly know how. Defoe fled from his home; not even his son- i-n--
law could get to see him; and he died, solitary and' in hiding, on April 26,1731 '
at Ropemaker's Alley, Moorfields.

There is little doubt that the idea of " Robinson Crusoe" was found in the
adventures of Alexander Selkirk, the Scotch saiIOr who, abandoned on the
island of Juan Fernandez" In November, 1704, was not relieved until Februarv, -'
1709. There 15 just as little doubt that being accustomed to " dress up " his
stories for his newspapers, and being past master of the art of mystification,
the author intended his book to be another attempt upon the crcdulity of the
people. They were unlikely to discover that there was not such an island at
the mouth of the Orinoco, or to measure the improbabilities of the tale. He
took extraordinary pains to give it reality. His carefully circumstantial
detail is probably sometimes used as much as a safeguard against his own11V Tlt' OD UC T 1 01V. .\ v

tripping as in the way of pure artifice; but its effect in heightening the merit
of the story is incalculable. Nevertheless he was found out, even before the
appearance of the Second Part. A slip here and there betrayed him ; and he
had to justify himself to his friends, the Dissenters, who disapproved of"
romances, in a very dull book--though as much fiction as the romance itself--
cxplaining that the story was an allegory.

Nobody cares for the allegory; but the story has become the chief of all
boys' books, and every Englishman loves it. For no fiction perused at a later
day can reproduce the exquisite feeling of fanciful feat caused by reading of
the footprint in the sand ; 01' bring again such admiration as is felt for Man
Friday; or give the delight inspired by Friday's encounter with the bear:
happy memories of days when not only were we, but all the world, was young.

OF

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

US. ,1 '3' ,3.

WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, ofa good family,
though not of that country, my father being a foreigner, of
Bremen, who settled first at Hull: he got a good estate by mer-
chandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York ; from
whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a
very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson
Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now
called,--nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and so my com-
panions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English
regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel
Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards.
What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father
and mother knew what was become of me.

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, my head
began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts: my father, whonvas
very ancient, had given me a competent share of 1carning,as far as house-
education and a country free-school generally go, and designed me for the
2
law'; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my inclina--
tion to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands, of my
father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that thereseemed to be something fatal in that propension of nature,
tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel
against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly
with me upon this subject: he asked me what reasons, more than a mere
wandering inclinationI I had for leaving my father's house and my native
country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my
fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He
told me it was men of desperateiortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior
fortunes on the other, who wen abroad upon adventures, to rise by enter-
prise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the
common road ; and these things were all either too far above me, or too far
below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the
upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the

, best- state in the World, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to
the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of
mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride; luxury, ambition, and envy of
the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge of the happiness of
this state by this one thing, viz, that this was the state of life which all other
people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable con-
sequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in
the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the
wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he
prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner,
not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which
nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread ; that he would
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life
which he had been recommending to me ; and that if I was not very easy
and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder
it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged
his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my
hurt ; and to close all, he told me I had my older brother for an example, toCRUSOE IS DETERJVINED TO GO TO SEA. 3

whom he had used the same persuasions to keep him from going to the Low
Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run
into the army, where he was killed ; and though he said he would not cease
to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
foolish step God would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might be none to
assist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic,
though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I
observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he
spoke of my brother who was killed; and that when he spoke of my having
leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off
the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to
me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be
otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to
settle at home according to my father's desire. But alas! a few days wore
it all ofi"; and, in short, to prevent any of my father's further importunities,
in a few weeks after,I resolved to run quite away from him. However, -I
did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted, but
I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than
ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing
the world, that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to
go through with it, and my father had better give me his consent than force
me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late
to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure if I did
I should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak. to
my father to let me go but one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and
did not like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double
diligence, to recover that time I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would
be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that if I
would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend "I should
never have their consent to it; that for her part, she would not have so
much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say that my
mother was willing when my father was not. Though my mother refused to
move it to my father, yet as I have heard afterwards, she reported all the
discpurse to him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said
to her, with a sigh:
"That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes
abroad, he will be the miserablest wretch that ever was born: I can give no
5 consent'to it."

It was not til_l almost a year after~ this that I broke loose, though, in the
meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so
positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me
to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any'
purpose of making an. eiopement at that time; but, I Say, being there, and.-
one of my companions being about to sail to London 1n his father' s ship, and
promptingme to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring
men, wk, that it should cost me nothing fox: my passage, I consulted neither
father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving
them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's blessing or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill
_ hour God knows, on the Ist of September,1651, I went on board a ship
' 'bound for London. _

Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or
continued longer, than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the
Humber, but the wind began to blow and the waves to rise in a most frightful .
manner; and, as I had never been at sea before,I was most inexpressibly
sick 1n body, and terrified in mind I began now seriously to reflect upon
what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of
Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty ,
all the good counsels of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's
entreaties, came now fresh into my mind, and my conscience, which was not
yet'come to the pitch of hardness to which it has been since, reproached me
' with the breach of my duty to God and my father.

' _ All'this while the storm increased, and the sea, which I had never been
upon before, Wentyvery high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since ; no, nor what I saw a few days after: but it was enough to affect
'me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of the
matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every
time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we-
should never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and
resolutions, that if it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage,GETS 11V 12'le COAIP/IIVY. 5

'if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home
to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived ; that I would
take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station
of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had
been exposed to tempests at sea, or troubles on shore ; and I resolved that I
would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted,
and indeed some time after; but the next (lay the wind was abated, and the
sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it: however, I was very grave
for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed ;
the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning ; and having
little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as
I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very
cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the
day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after.
And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had
enticed me away, comes to me.

" Well, Bob," says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, " how do you do after
it? I warrant you were frighted, wer'n't you, last night, when it blew but a
capful of wind ? "

"A capful d'you call it?" said I ; "'twas a terrible storm."

"A storm, you fool you," replies he ; " do you call that a storm? why, it
was nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think
nothing of such a squall of wind as that ; but you're but a fresh-water sailor,
Bob: come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all that ; d'ye see
what charmingr weather 'tis now ?"

To make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way of all sailors ;
the punch was made, and I was made half-drunk with it; and in that one
night's wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my
past conduct, all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was
returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and appre-
hensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current
of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that
I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection ; and the~

serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes ; but I
shook them off, and roused myself from them, and applying myself to drink
and company, soon mastered the return of those fits--for so Icalled them;
and I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. 'But I was
to have another trial for it still.

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads ; the
wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we
lay, the wind continuing contrary for seven or eight days.

We had not, however, ridden here so long, but we should have'tided it up
the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and, after we had lain four or five
days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good as a
harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the
time'in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in
the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our
top-masts, and make everything snug and close, that-the ship might ride as
easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode
forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor
had come home ; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that
we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end.

. By'this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and now I began to see terror
and amazement in the'faces even of the seamen themselves. The master,
though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and
out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say, several times,

t " Lord, be merciful to us ! we shall be all lost ; we shall. be all undone ! " and the
like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which
was in the steerage, and cannot describe my temper: Icould ill resume the
first penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon, and hardened
myself.against: I thought the bitterness of death had been past ; and that
this would be nothing like the first. But when the master himself came by
me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted.
I got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never
saw: the sea went mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four
' minutes ; when I could look about, I could see nothing but distress round us ;
two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being
deep laden ; and our men cried out, that a ship which rode about a mile aheadE FFE C I S OF A TERRIBLE S T013111. 7

of us was foundercd. Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were
run out of the Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast
standing. The lightships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the
sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away
with only their spritsail out before the wind.

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship
to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but
the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did not, the ship would founder, he
consented, and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood
so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away also,
and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was but
a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little. But
ifI can express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I
was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions,
and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken
at first, than I was at death itself ; and these, added to the terror of the storm,
put me into such a condition, that I can by no words describe it. But the
worst was not come yet ; the storm continued with such fury, that the seamen
themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had .a good
ship, but she was deep laden; and wallowed in the sea, that the seamen every
now and then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage in one
respect thatI did not know what they meant by jbmzder, till I inquired.
However, the storm was so violent that I saw what is not often seen. the
master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom.
In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the
men that had been down on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a leak ;
another said there was four feet of water in the hold. Then all hands were
called to the pump. At that word, my heart, as I thought, died within me,
and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin.
However, the men roused me and told me that I, that was able to do nothing
before, was as well able to pump as another : at which I stirred up and went
to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, were obliged
to slip, and run away to the sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a
gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that meant, thought
the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so
surprised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody
had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me ;
but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his
foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead ; and it was a great while before I
came to myself.

\Ve worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that
the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a port, so the
master continued firing guns for help ; and a lightship, who had ridden it out
just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost
hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on board,
or for the boat -to lie near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over

' the stem with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length which they,
after great labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under
our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us,
after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship, so all agreed to

' let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could ; and

our master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would
make it good to their master ; so partly rowing, and partly driving, our boat
went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as

Winterton Ness.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship before
we saw her sink, and then I understood {or the first time what- was meant by
a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look
up when the seamen told me she was sinking, for from that moment they
rather put me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in, my heart was
as it were dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the oat; to bring
the boat near the shore, we could see (when, our boat mountirig the waves,
we were able to see the shorc) a great many people running along the strand,
to assist us when we should come near, but we made but slow way towards
the shore, nor were we able to reach it, till, being past the lighthouse at
Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the
land broke off a little the violence of the wind : here we got in, and, though
'not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on
.foot to Y armouth. where, as unfortunate men, we were used with greatADVISED A'EVER TO GO TO SEA AGAIN. 9

humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good
quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as we
thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone home, I had been happy, and my
father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fattcd
calf for me ; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth
Roads, it was a great while before he had any assurances that I was not
drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could
resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my
more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know
not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that
hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be
before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly nothing
but some such decreed unavoidable misery attending, and which it was im-
possible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm
reasonings and pcrsuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two
such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the
master's son, was now less forward than I; the first time he spoke to me
after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were
separated in the town to several quarters ; I say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and shaking
his head, he asked me how I did, and telling his father who I was, and how I
had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther abroad; his
father turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone:

"Young man," says he, "you ought never to go to sea any more; you
ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a sea-
faring man."

" \Vhy, sir," said I, " will you go to sea no more ?"

"That is another case," said he ; " it is my calling, and therefore my duty;
but as you made this voyage for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has
given you of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this has all
befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," con-
tinued he, " what are you ; and on what account (lid you go to sea P" '

Upon that I told him some of my story ; at the end of which he burst out
with a strange kind of pz155ion.
" What had I done," says he, " that such an unhappy wretch should come-
into my ship! I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for'
a thousand pounds. "

This indeed was,as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet
agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority
to go. However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorted me to-
go back to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin ; told me I might
see a visible hand of Heaven against me:

"And, young man," said he, "depend upon it, if you do not go back,.
wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappoint-
ments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you."

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no
more; which way he went I know not. Having some money in my pocket,
I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the road, had many
struggles with myself, what course of life I should take, whether I should go-
home or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my

thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how I should he laughed at
among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and:
mother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often
observed, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is,,
especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them' 1n such cases,.
visa, that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not:
ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are
ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed wise men.

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what

' measures to take and what course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance-
continued to going home; and asI stayed awhile, the remembrance of the-
distress I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in
my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the.
thoughts of it, and looked out for a. voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away from my father's house,.
that harried me into the wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune; 1
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf.
to all good advice, and to the entreaties and even command of my father . I
say the same influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate of all
enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to the coast of.'
Africa ; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea."I I'VAS NOIV SET UP FOR A GUINEA TRADER." II

It was my great misfortune, that in all these adventures I did not ship
myself as a sailor; whereby,though I might indeed have worked a little
harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned the duty and office
of a fore-mast man, and in time might have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not for a master: but as it was always my fate to choose for'
the worse, so I did here ; for having money in my pocket, and good clothes
upon my back, I would always gofion board in the habit of a gentleman ; and
so I neither had any business in the ship, or learned to do any.

I first fell acquainted with the master of the ship, who, taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me say I.
had a mind to see the world, told me if I would go the voyage with him I
should be at no expense; I should be his mess-mate and his companion, and
if I could carry anything with me, I should have all the advantage of it that
the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some encouragement.

I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict friendship with this captain,
who was an honest, plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and
carried a small adventure with me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my
friend the captain, I increased very considerably ; for I carried about PS40 in
such toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This PS40 I had
mustered together by the assistance of some of my relations whom I cor-
responded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother, to
contribute so much as that to my first adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in all my
adventures, and which Iowe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the
captain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics
and the rules of navigation, learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some things that
were needful to be understood by a sailor ; for, as he took delight to instruct
me,I tool: delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a
sailor and a merchant ; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-
dust for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, almost
PS300 ; and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have since so
completed my ruin. '

I was now set up for 3. Guinea trader; and my friend, to my great mis-
fortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again,
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his mate in the former
voyage, and had now got the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest
voyage that ever man made; for though I did not carry quite PS100 of my
'new-gained wealth, so that I had PS200 left, which I had lodged with my
friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible misfortunes ;
.and the first was this--our ship making 'her course towards the Canary
. Islahds, or rather between those Islands and the African shore, was surprised
' in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us
with all the sail she could make. We crowded also as much canvas as our
yards would spread, or our masts carry to haVe got clear; but finding the
pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come up with us in a few hours,
we prepared to fight; our ship having twelve guns, and the rogue eighteen.
About three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake,
just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, we
brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broadside
upon him, which made him sheer off again, after returning our fire, and
pouring in also his small shot from near two hundred men which he had ,on
board. However, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He
prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying us on
"board the next time upon'our other quarter, he entered sixty men upon our
decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging.
We plied them with small shot, half--pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and
cleared our deck of them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy part
of our story, our ship being disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were all carried prisoners into Sallee.
:a port belonging to the Moors. '

_The usage I had there wasnot so dreadful as at first I apprehended, nor
was I carried up the country to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover as his proper prize, and made
his slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was per-
fectly overwhelmed ; and now I looked back upon my father's prophetic dis-
course to me, that I should be miserable and have none to relieve me, which
I thought was now so effectually brought to pass, that I could not be worse ;
jhat now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone without
redemption. But, alas! this was but 'a taste of the misery I was to go
through, as will appear in the sequel 0f the story. '

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home to his house, so I was in
hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a Spanish or
Portuguese man-of-war ; and that then I should be set at liberty. But this hopeIIIEDITATES ESCAPE [ROI]! SLA VERY. 13

of mine was soon taken away ; for when he went to sea, he left me on shore to-
look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves about his
house ; and when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to lie
in the cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method I might take
to ePfect it, but found no way that had the least probability in it; nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational; for I had nobody to com-
municate it to that would embark with me ; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman, there but myself; so that for two years, thoughI
often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least prospect
of putting it in practice.

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself, which put the
old thought of making some attempt for my liberty again in my head : my
patron lying at home longer than usual, without fitting out his ship, which, as
I heard, was for want of money, he used, constantly, once or twice a week,
sometimes oftencr, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace, and go
out into the road a-fishing ; and, as he always took me and a young Maresco
with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and I proved very dex-
terous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a
Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth, the Maresco, as they called him, to
catch a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a-fishing in a stark calm morning, a fog
rose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, we lost
sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we laboured all
day, and all the next night ; and when the morning came, we found we had
pulled off to sea instead of pulling in for the shore ; and that we were at least
two leagues from the shore; however, we got well in again, though with a
great deal of labour and some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty
fresh in the morning ; but particularly we were all very hungry.

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more care of him-
self for the future; and having lying by him the long-boat of our English ship
he had taken, he resolved he would not go a-fishing any more without a
compass and some previsions ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who
also was an English slave, to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the middle
of the long--boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to steer,
and hale home the main-shect; and room before for a hand or two to stand
and work the sails ; she sailed with what we call a shouldcr-of-mutton sail ;
and the boom jibcd over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low,
land had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
~with some small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought
:fit to drink ; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing ; and as I was most dex-
terous to catch fish for him, he never went without me. It happened that he
had appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two
or three Moors of some distinction in that place, and for whom he had pro-
vided extraordinarily; and had therefore sent on board the boat over--night a
larger store of provisions than ordinary ; and had ordered me to get ready
:three fusees with powder and shot which were on board his ship; for that
' 'they designed some sport of fowling as well as fishing.

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next morning
with the boat washed clean, her ensign and pendents out, and everything to
accommodate his guests; when by-and-by my patron came on board alone,
.and told me his guests had put off going, from some blisiness that fell out,
.and ordered me, with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and
catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house ; and com-
manded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring it home to his house ;
.all which I prepared to do.

This moment, my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts,
'for now I found I was like to have a little ship at my command; and my
my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, not for fishing business,
but for a voyage; though I knew not, neither did I so much as consider,
whither I should steer ; for anywhere to get out of that place was my desire.

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this Moor, to get
something for our subsistence on board ; for I told him we must not presume
to eat of our patron's bread; he said that was true; so he brought a large
basket of rusks or biscuit of their kind, and three jars of fresh water into the
'boat. I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was evident
by the make were taken out of some English prize, and I conveyed them
into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had been there before
for our master; I conveyed also a great lump of bees-wax into the boat,
which weighed about half a hundred-weight, with a parcel of twine or thread,
a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all of which were of great use to us after-
wards, especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon him,
which he innocently came into also : his name was Ismael, whom they called
Muley, or Moely; so I called to him--" Moely," said I, " our patron's guns
are on board the boat ; can you not get a little powder and shot, it may beESCAPES, AND GETS RID OF THE JIOOR. 15

.we may kill some alcamies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know
'he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."--" Yes," says he, " I'll bring some ;"
.and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which held a pound and a
half of powder, or rather more; and another with shot, that had five or six
pounds, with some bullets, and put all into the boat ; at the same time, I had
found some powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one
-of the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty; pouring what was
in it into another: and thus furnished with everything necdful, we sailed out
of the port to fish. The castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew
who we were, and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile out of
the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish ; the wind blew
from the N.N.E., which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown southerly,
I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to
'Cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone
from that horrid place where I was, and leave the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time and catched nothing. for when I had fish on
my hook, I would not pull them up, that he might not see them, I said to the
Moor, " This will not do ; our master will not be thus served ; we must stand
farther off ; " he, thinking no harm, agreed, and, being in the head of the boat,
set the sails ; and, as I had the helm, I run the boat out near a league farther,
and then brought her to, as if I would fish, when, giving the boy the helm, I
stepped forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped for
something behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm under his twist,
and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose immediately. for he
swam like a cork, and calling to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would
go all over the world with me. He swam so strong after the boat, that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being but little wind ; upon which
I stepped into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, I presented
'it at him, and told him I had done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I
would do him none: "But," said I, " you swim well enough to reach to the
shore, and the sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore, and I will do
you no harm ; but if you come near the boat, I'll shoot you through the head,
for I am resolved to have my liberty :" so he turned himself about, and swam
for the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an
excellent swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, and have
drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When he was
gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, " Xury,
if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you a great man ; but if you will not
stroke your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Mahomet and his father's.
beard, " I must throw you into the sea. too." The boy smiled in my face, and
spoke so innocently, that I could not distrust him, and swore to be faithful to'
me, and go all over the world with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swimming, I stood out directly
to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might think me-
gone towards the Straits' mouth (as indeed any one that had been in their-
wits must have been supposed to do)': for who would have supposed we were
'sailed on to the southward, to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations
of Negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes, and destroy us; where
we could not go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or
' more merciless savages of human kindt

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my course, and
steered- direetly south-and-by-east, bending my course a little towards the
east, that I might keep in with the shore: and having a fair, fresh gale of
wind, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by the next day
at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be
less than 150 miles south of Sallee: quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's.
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw no people.

Yet such was the fright I had taken of the Moors, and the dreadful appre-
hensions I had of falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or go on
shore, or come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair till I had sailed in that
manner five days; and then the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded,
also, that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would now give
over ; so I ventured to make to the coast, andeame to an anchor in the mouth
of a little river, I knew not what, nor where; neither what latitude, what
country, what nation, nor what river. I neither saw, nor desired to see, any
people ; the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this.
creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful
noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we knew not
what kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me
not to go on shore till day. " Well, Xury," said I, " then I won't ; but it may
be that we may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions."
---" Then we give them the shoot gun," says Xury, laughing, " make them run
wey." Such English Xur'y spoke by conversing among us slaves. However,'
I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him a dram (out of ourXURY AND CRUSOE MEET H/ITH DANCERS. I7

patron's case of bottles) to cheer him _up ; after all, Xury's advice was good
and I took it ; we dropped our little anchor and lay still all night ; I say still,
for we slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we
knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and
run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves for the pleasure of
cooling themselves ; and they made such hideous howlings and yellings, that
I never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too ; but we were both
more {righted when we heard one of these mighty creatures come swimming
towards our boat; we could not see him, but we might hear him by his
blowing to be a monstrous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a lion,
and it might be so for aught I know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh the
anchor and row away. " N 0," says I, " Xury ; we can slip our cable, with the
buoy to it, and go off to sea; they cannot follow us far." I had no sooner
said so, but I perceived the creature (whatever it was) within two oars' length,
which something surprised me ; however, I immediately stepped to the cabin--
door, and taking up my gun, fired at him, upon which he immediately turned
about, and swam towards the shore again.

But it is impossible to describe the horrid noises, and hideous cries and
howlings, that were raised, as well upon the edge of the shore as higher within
the country, upon the noise or report of the gun ; a thing I have some reason
to believe those creatures had never heard before. This convinced me that
there was no going on shore for us in the night on that coast, and how to
venture on shore in the day was another question too ; for to have fallen into the
hands of any of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of
the lions and tigers ; at least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other for
water, for we had not a pint left in the boat ; when and where to get to it was
the point. Xury said, if I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he
would find if there was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him why
he would go? why I should not go, and he stay in the boat? The boy
answered with so much affection, as made me love him ever after. Says he,
" If wild mans come, they eat me, you go wey."----" Well, Xury," said 1,; " we
will both go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall eat
neither of us." So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram out
of our patron's case of bottles which I mentioned before ; and we hauled the
boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper, and waded on shore;
carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.

3

)
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the coming of canoes
with savages down the river; but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up
the country, rambled to it ; and byzand-by I saw him come running towards
me. I thought he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild
beast, and I ran forwards towards him to help him ; but when I came nearer
to him, I saw something hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that
he had shot, like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs : however, we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat ; but the great joy that poor
Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild.
mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for water, for a
little higher up the creek where we were we found the water fresh when the
_ tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our jars, and

feasted on the hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having
seen no footsteps of any human creature in that part of the country.

As I had been one voyage this coast before, I knew very well that the
'islands of the Canaries and the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off

from the coast. But as I had no instruments to take an observation to know
what latitude we were in, and not exactly knowing, or at least remembering,
what latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for them, or when to
stand off to sea towards them ; otherwise I might now easily have found
some of these islands. But my hope was, that if I stood along this coast
til] I came to that part where the English traded, I should find some of their
vessels upon their usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was must be that
country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the
Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited; the Negroes having abandoned it, and
gone farther south, for fear of the Moors; and the Moors not thinking it
worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness ; and, indeed, both forsaking
it because of the prodigious numbers of tigers, lions, leopards, and other
furious creatures which harbour there; so that the Moors use it for their
hunting only, where they go like an army, two or three thousand men at
a time: and, indeed, for near a hundred miles together upon this coast, we
saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day, and heard nothing but
howlings and roarings of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice in the day--time, I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe, being
the high top of the Mountain TeneriiTe in the Canaries ; and had a great mind
to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was

\F11VD A LION ASLEEP, AZVD KILL [II 19

forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my little
vessel ; so I resolved to pursue my first design, and keep along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left this
place; and once in particular, being early in the morning, we came to an
anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the tide
beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were
more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me
that we had best go farther off the shore; "for," says he, "look, yonder
lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a terrible
great lion that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of
the hill that hung as it were a little over him. "Xury," says I, "you shall
go on shore and kill him." Xury looked frighted, and said, "Me kill! he
eat me at one mouth;" one mouthful he meant. However, I said no more
to the boy, but bade him lie still, and took our biggest gun, which was
almost musket bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and with
two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets;
and the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with five smaller bullets.
I took the best aim I could with the first piece to have shot him into the
head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above his nose that the slugs
hit his leg about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up, growling
at first, but finding his leg broken, fell down again; and then got up upon
three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I was a little
surprised that I had not hit him on the head ; however, I took up the second
piece immediately, and though he began to move off, fired again, and shot
him into the head, and had the pleasure to see him drop and make but little
noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me
let him go on shore. "\Vell, go," said I : so the boy jumped into the water,
and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and
coming close to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot
him in the head again, which despatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry
to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for
nothing to us. However, Xury said he would have some of him ; so he corpes
on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet. " For what, any P " said I.
"Me cut off his head," said he. However, Xury could not cut off his head,
but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a monstrous great
one.
I bethought myself, however, that perhaps the skin of him might be of some
value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin if I could. So Xury and I
went to work with him; but Xury was much the better workman at it for I
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed, it took us both up the whole day, but at.
last we got oh" the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun
- . effectually dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve
days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to abate very
much, and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged to for fresh
water. My design in this was, to make the River Gambia or Senegal, that is
to say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with
some European ship ; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take,
but to seek for the islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that
all _the ships from Europe, which sailed either to the Coast of Guinea or to

.Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this Cape, or those Islands; and, in a
word; I put the whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I must
meet with some ship, or must perish.
' When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have said,
I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and in two or three places, as we-
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us; we could also>>
perceive they were quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to
have gone on shore to them ; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to
me, "No go, no go." However, I hauled in nearer the shore, that I might
talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a good way. I
observed they had no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a long
slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they could throw them a
great way with good aim. So I kept at a distance, but talked with them by-
signs as well as I could ; and particularly made signs for something to eat;
they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some meat.
Upon this, I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up
into the country, and in less than half an hour came back, and brought with-
them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country ; but we neither knew what the one nor the other was ; however we-
were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next dispute, for I
was not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as much afraid of us ;
but they took a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore and laid
it down, and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board, and;
then came close to us again.JIIEET WITH KINDLY NEGROES. 21'

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them
.amends; but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them
wonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore, came two mighty
creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury from the
mountains towards the sea ; whether it was the male pursuing the female, or
whether they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we
could tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter;
because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the
night, and, in the second place, we found the peopic terribly frighted,
especially the women. The man that had the lance or dart did not fly from
them, but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran directly into the
water, they did not offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged
themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if they had come for their
diversion. At last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I
expected ; but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all possible
expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. As soon as he came fairly
within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly in the head: immediately he
sank down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and down, as if
he was struggling for life, and so indeed he was: he immediately made to the
shore ; but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling
of the water, he died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the
noise and fire of my gun ; some of them were even ready to die for fear, and
fell down as dead with the very terror. But when they saw the creature
dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart and came, and began to search for the creature. I
found him by his blood staining the water: and by the help of a rope, which
I slung round him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore,
and found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted, and fine to an
admirable degree ; and the Negroes held up their hands with admiration, to
think what it was I had killed him with. .

The other creature frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the gun,
'swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from whence they
.came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was. I found quickly the
Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have
them take it as a favour from me; which, when I made signs to them that
they might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to
work with him ; and though they had no knife, yet, with a sharpened piece of
wood, they took off his skin as readily, and much more readily, than we could
have done with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh, which I declined,
making as if I would give it them; but made signs for the skin, which they
gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their provisions,
which, though I did not understand, yet I accepted; then I made signs to
them for some water, and held out one of my jars to them, turning it bottom
upward, to show that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They
called immediately to some of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I supposed, in the sun ;
this they set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars,.
and filled them all three.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and
leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more,
wjthout offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a great
length into the sea, at about a distance of four or five leagues before me, and
the'sea being very calm I kept a. large oFFmg to make this point; at length,
doubling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw plainly land on
the'other side to seaward: then I concluded. as it was most certain indeed,_
that this was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands called, from thence,
Cape de Verd Islands. However, they were at a great distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to do, for if I should be taken with a fresh of

. wind, I might neither reach one or other. '

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin and sat
down, Xury having the helm ; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out, " Master,
master, a ship with a sail ! " and the foolish boy was frighted out of his wits,
thinking it must needs be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, but I
knew we were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the
cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but what she was, 02's., a
Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound to the Coast of Guinea for
Negroes. But, when I observed the course she steered, I was soon convinced
they were bound some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to,
the shore, upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving to-
speak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in
their way, but that they would be gone before I could make any signal to-
them. But after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they,
it seems, saw me by the help of their perspective glasses, and that it was
some European boat, which, as they supposed, must belong to some ship thatA Signal of DiJIrcn.PICKED UP BY A PORTUGUESE SHIP. 23

was lost ; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to them,
for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw ; for they told
me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun. Upon these
signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in about three
hours' time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,
but I understood none of them; but, at last, a Scotch sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that
I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they
bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my goods. f

It was an inexpressible joy to me, as any one would believe, that I was
thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless
condition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I had to the captain of
the ship, as a return {or my deliverance ; but he generously told me he would
take nothing from me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me when
I came to the Brazils. "For," says he, " I have saved your life on no other
terms than I would be glad to be saved myself; and it may, one time or
other, be my lot to be taken up in the same condition. Besides," said he,
" when I carry you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if I
should take from you what you have, you will be starved there, and then I
only take away that life I have given. No, no," says he, "Seignor Inglese"
(Mr. Englishman), "I will carry you thither in charity, and those things will
help to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home again."

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the performance to
a tittle ; for he ordered the seamen, that none should touch anything that I
had: then he took everything into his own possession, and gave me back an
exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even so much as my three
earthen jars. -

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he
would buy it of me for his ship's use, and asked me what I would have for it ?
Itold him he had been so generous to me in everything, that I could not
offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him ; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me 80 pieces of eight
for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any one offered to give more, he
would make it up. He offered me also 60 pieces of eight more for my boy
Xury, which I was loth to take ; not that I was unwilling to let the captain
have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted
me so faithfully in procuring my own. However, when I let him know my

reason, he owned it to be just, and ofi'ered me this medium, that. he would

' give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he turned Christian.
Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing to go to him,I let the captain
have him. '

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in 'the Bay de
Todos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And
now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all conditions of
life ; and what to do next with myself I was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never enough remember:
he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the
leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and
caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered to me; and
what I was willing to sell he bought of me, such as the case of bottles, two of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax--for I had made candles of
the rest: in a word, I made about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo: and
with this stock, I went on shore in the Brazils. .

I had not been long here, before I was recommended to the house of a
good, honest man, like himself, who had an ingenio, as they call it (that is, a
plantation and a sugar-house). I lived with him some time, and acquainted

_.myself; by'that means, with the manner of planting and making of suga'r;
and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they got rich suddenly, I
resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, I. would turn planter among
them, resolving, in the meantime, to find out some way to get my money,
which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this purpose, getting a kind
of letter of naturalization, I purchased as much land that was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement ;
such a one as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to myself to
receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English parents,
whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances asI was. I call him
my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very
sociably together. My stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather

' planted for food than anything else, for about two years. However, we began

to increase, and our land began to come into order; so that the third year
we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of ground ready
for planting canes in the year to come. But we both wanted help ; and now

I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting with my.boy Xury.CR (/5012 EEC 0111155 A PLAxVTER IN BRAZIL I 25

But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great wonder ; I
'was gotten into an employment quite remote to my genius, directly contrary
to the life I delighted in, for which I forsook my father's house; nay, I was
-coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life, which my
father advised me to before; and which, if I resolved to go on with, I might
as well have staid at home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as I
had done ; I had no body to converse with but now and then this neighbour;
no work to be done but by the labour of my hands; and I used to say I
lived just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody
there but himself. -

I was, in some degree, settled in my measures for carrying on the plantation,
before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up at sea, went
back ; when, telling him what little stock I had left behind me in London, he
gave me this friendly and sincere advice. " Scignor Inglesc," says he (for so
he always called me), "if you will give me letters, and a procuration here in
form to me, with orders to the person who has your money in London, to
send your effects to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such
goods as are proper for-this country, I will bring you the produce of them,
God willing, at my return ; but, since human affairs are all subject to changes
.and disasters, I would have you give orders but for one hundred pounds
sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the
first ; so that, if it come safe, you may order the rest the same way; and, if
it miscarry, you may have the other half to have recourse to for your supply."

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not but
be convinced it was the best course I could take ; so I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and a procura-
tion to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my adventures--
my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese captain at sea,
the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition Iwas now in, with all
other necessary directions for my supply ; and when this honest captain came
to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English merchants there, to send
over, not the .order only, but a full account of my story to a merchant at
London, who represented it effectually to her ; whereupon, she not only
delivered the money, but, out of her own pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a
very handsome present for his humanity and charity to me. ,

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English goods,
such as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon, and
he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which, without my
direction (for I was too young in my business to think of them), he had taken
care to have all sorts of tools, iron work, and utensils, necessary for my
plantation, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortunes made, for I was surprised
with the joy of it; and my good steward, the captain, had laid out the five
pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to purchase
and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years' service, and would not
accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being my own produce.

Neither was this all : for my goods being all English manufacture, such as.
cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in the>>
country,I found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so that I
might say, I had more than.four times the value of my first cargo, and was-
now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour--I mean in the advancement of my
plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and an.

European servant also--I mean another besides that which the captain
brought me from Lisbon '

Having lived almost four years in the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and
prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned the language,.
but had contracted acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as.
well as among the merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and in my
discoufses among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two'
voyages to the coast of Guinea; the manner of trading with the Negroes.
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles, such as.
beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, not only gold
dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but Negroes, {or the service of the>>
Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened very attentively to my discourses on these heads, but
especially to that part which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade at that time, not far entered into.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my
acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them came-
to me next morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon
what I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to make a.
secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that
they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea ; that they had all planta-
tions as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as servants ; that.AGREES TO GO TO GUINEA FOR JVIL'GROES. 27

as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because they could not
publicly sell the Negroes when they came home, so they desired to make but
one voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and divide them among
their own plantations ; and, in a word, the question was, whether I would go
their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the coast of
Guinea; and they offered me that I should have my equal share of the
Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must he confessed, had it been made to any one-
that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and with a good stock
upon it; but for me, that was thus entered and established, and had nothing"
to do but to go on as I had begun for three or four years more, and to have
sent for the other hundred pounds from England, and who in that time, and
with that little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth three or four
thousand pounds sterling, and that increasing too ; for me to think of such a
voyage was the most preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances
could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the
offer than I could restrain my first rambling designs when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with all my
heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, ifI miscarried. This
they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so ; and
I made a formal will disposing of my plantation and effects in case of my
death, making the captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my
universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had directed in-
my will, one-half of the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England.

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects, and to keep up
my plantation; had I used half as much prudence to have looked into my
own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have done and
not to have done,I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its hazai'ds.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather
than my reason; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement, by my partners in the voyage,
I went on board in an evil hour, the Ist of September, 1659, being the same
day eight years that I went from my father and mother at Hull.
Our ship was about 120 tons burden, carried six guns, and fourteen men,
besides the master, his boy, and myself ; we had on board no large cargo of
goods, except of such toys as were fit {or our trade with the N egroes, such as'
beads, bits of glass, shells, and other trifles, especially little looking--glasses,
knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the northward
upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast when
we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems,
was the manner of their course in those days. We had very good weather,
tonly excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came to the
height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping further off at sea, we
.lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de
.Noronha, holding our course NE. by N., and leaving those isles on the east.
In this course we passed the line in about twelve days' time, and were, by
our last observation, in 7 degrees 22' northern latitude, when a violent
tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It blew in such a
terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive;
and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury of
the winds directed. ~ .

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our men die
of the calenture, and one man and the boy washed overboard. About the
twelfth day, the weather abating a little; the master made an observation as
well as he could, and found that he was in about 11deg north latitude, but that
he was 22deg of longitude difi'erence west from Cape St. Augustino ; so that he
found he was upon the coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond
the river Amazon; towards that of the river Oroonoque, commonly called the
Great River ; and began to consult with me what. course he should take, for
the ship was leaky, and very much disabled, and he was going directly back
'to the coast of Brazil.

I was positively against that ; and looking over the charts of the sea-coasts
of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
:have recourse to, till we came within the circle of the Caribbee Islands, and
therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping off at sea,
to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily perform,
as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail ; whereas we could not possibly make
our voyage to the coast of Africa without some assistance both to our ship
and to ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by W., inTHE SHIP STRIKES UPON THE SAIVD. 29

order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief; but our
voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of 12 (leg. 18
min. a second storm came upon us, which carried us away with the same
impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all human
commerce, that, had all our lives been saved as to the sea, we were rather in
danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning to our country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early in-
the morning cried out, " Land ! " and we had no sooner run out of the cabin
to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were, than the
ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner, that we expected we should all have
perished immediately; and we were immediately driven into our close-
quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to describe
or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances : we knew nothing
where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven, whether an island
or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we could not so much as hope
to have the ship hold many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the
winds, by a kind of miracle, should turn immediately about. In a word, we
sat looking upon one another, and expecting death every moment, and every
man, acting accordingly, as preparing for another world ; for there was little
or nothing more for us to do in this : that which was our present comfort, and
all the comfort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did not
break yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate.

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship
having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her
getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing to do-
but to think of saving our lives as well as we could. "'0 had a boat at our-
stern, just before the storm, but she was first stavcd by dashingr against the
ship's rudder, and, in the next place, she broke away, and either sunk, or was
driven oft" to sea; so there was no hope from her; we had another boat on
board, but how to get her off into the sea. was a doubtful thing ; however, there
was no time to debate, for we fancied the ship would break in pieces every-
minute, and some told us she was actually broken already. .

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat, and with the
help of the rest of the men, they got her slung over the ship's side; and getting
all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's.
mercy and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated considerably, yet
'the sea. we'nt dreadfully high upon the shore, and might be well called den
wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed ; for we all saw plainly, that the
-sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should be inevitably
drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if we had, could we have
.done anything with it ; so we worked at the oar towards'the land, though with
heavy hearts, like men going to execution ; for we all knew that when the
boat came nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by the
breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in the most

earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we hastened
~our destruction with our own. hands, pulling as well as we could towards

land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we knew

not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of expecta- -
'tion was if we might find some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, where
'by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of the
land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was nothing of this
.appeared ; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked more
frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed or rather driven about a league and a half, as we
-reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astem of us, and
plainly bade us expect the coup de grdce. In a word, it took us with such a
fury, that it overset the boat at once; and separating us, as well from the boat -
.asfrom one another, gave us not time to say, " O God i " for we were all
swallowed up in a moment. '

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I sunk
into the water ; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven me, or
rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent itself,
went back, and left me upon the land almostldry, but half dead with the
water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that,
.seeing myself nearer the main land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and
-endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as I could, before another
'wave should return and take me up again. But I soon found it was impossible
toavoid it ; for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as
furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength to contend with : my
business was to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water, if I could :CRUSOE IS I/VASHED ASIIORE. 3x

and so, by swimming, to preserve my breathing and pilot myself towards the
shore, if possible: my greatest concern now being, that the sea, as it would
carry me a great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry me
back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty
feet: deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty force
and swiftncss towards the shore a very great way; but I held my breath, and
assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was ready to burst
with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate
relief. I found my head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water;
and though it was not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was covered again
with water a good while, but not so long but I held it out; and, finding the
water had spent itself and began to return, I struck forward against the
return of the waves, and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a few
moments to recover breath and till the waters went from me, and then took
to my heels and ran, with what strength I had, further towards the shore.
But neither would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came
pouring in after me again ; and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and
carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well-near been fatal to me; for the sea
having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a
piece of a rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless, and indeed
helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath, as it were, quite out of my body ; and had it returned again
immediately,I must have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little
before the return of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the
\vater,I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath,
if possible, till the wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high as
at first, being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then
fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave,
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away;
and the next run I took, I got to the main land, where, to my great comfort,
I cIambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass; free
from danger and quite out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God
that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was, some minutes before,
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express, to the life,
what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may'
say, out of the very grave.

" For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first."

I walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as
I may say,Wrapt up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a thousand
gestures and motions, which I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my com-
rades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved but
myself ; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of them,
except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not fellows.

I cast my eyes to the strandedvessel, when, the breach and froth of the
sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off ; and considered,
" Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore!"

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I
began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was
next to be done: and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I
had a dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,
nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I see any
prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I had
no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to
defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for
theirs ; in a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a
little tobacco in a box ; this was all my provisions ; and this threw me into
terrible agonies of mind, that for a while, I ran about like a madman. Night
coming upon me, I began, with a heavy heart, to consider what would be my
lot if there were any ravenous beasts' in that country, as at night they always
come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time, was to get up into

' a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I
resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I should die,
for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from the shore,
to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did to my great
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent
hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myself so that if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cut me a

_ short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging, and

having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortablyTIJE DA Y AFTER THE STORM. 33

as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and found myself the
most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on such an occasion.

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated,
so that the sea did not rage and swell as before ; but that which surprised me
most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where she
lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock
which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dashing me
against it. This being within about a mile from the shore where I was, and
the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself on board, that at
least I might save some necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment in thc tree,I looked about me
again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the
sea had tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my right hand; I
walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her ; but found a neck
or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about half a mile broad ;
so I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
where I hoped to find something for my present subsistence.

A little after noon, I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far out
that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here I found a
fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently, that if we had kept on board,
we had been all safe, that is to say, we 'had all got safe on shore, and I had
not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and com-
pany as I now was; this forced tears to my eyes again; but as there was
little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so I pulled off
my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and took the water; but
when I came to the ship, my difficulty was still greater to know how to get
on board, for, as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second
time I spied a small piece of rcpe, which I wondered I did not see at first,
hang down by the fore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold
ofit, and by the help of that rope got up into the forecastle of the ship ; here
I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold,
but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that
her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the water ;
by this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that part was "dry ;
for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see what was spoiled
and what was free; and first, I found that all the ship's provisions were dry
and untouched by the water, and being very well disposed to eat, I went to

4
the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about
other things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the great
cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of
to spirit me for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to
furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary
to me. .

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this
extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and two or
three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast or two in the ship : I resolved
to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard as I could
manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they might not
drive away. When this was done, I went down the ship's side, and pulling
them to me, I tied four of them together at both ends, as well as I could, in
the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon them
crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to
bear any great weight, the pieces being too light; soI went to work, and
with a carpenter's saw I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains, but the hope of fur-
nishing myself with necessaries, encouraged me to go beyond what I should
have been able to have done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight ; my next
care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from
the surf of the sea: but I was not long considering this, I first laid all the
planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well what I
most wanted, I first got three of - the seamen's chests, which I had broken
open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the first of these I
filled with provisions, via, bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried
goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little remainder of European
.corn), which had been laid by for some {owls which we brought to sea with
us, but the fowls were killed ; there had been some barley and wheat together,
but, to' my great disappointment, I found aftenvards that the rats had eaten
or spoiled it all ; as for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to
. our skipper, in which were some cordial waters ; and, in all, about five or six
gallons of rack; these I stowed by themselves,there being no need to put
them into the chest, not no room for them. While I was doing this, I found
the tide began to flow, though very calm ; and I had the mortification to see
my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on the shore, upon the sand,
swim away; as for my breeches, which were only linen and open-knee'd, IIVITHA RAFT BRINGS THINGS PS180le THE SHIP. 35

swam on board in them and my stockings ; however this set me on rum-
maging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted
for present use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon--as, first,
tools to work with on shore; and it was after long searching that I found out
the carpenter's chest, which was, indeed, a very useful prize to me, and much
more valuable than a ship-load of gold would have been at that time. I got
it down to my raft, whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I
knew in general what it contained.

My next care was {or some ammunition and arms: there were two very
good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols ; these I secured first,
with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords.
I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them, two of
them dry and good, the third had taken water ; those two I got to my raft,
with the arms ; and now I thought myself pretty well freightetl, and began to
think how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor
rudder; and the least cap-full of wind would have overset all my navigation.

I had three encouragements: Ist, a smooth, calm sea; 2ndly, the tide rising
and setting in to the shore; 3rdly, what little wind there was blew me towards
the land : and having found two or three broken oars belonging to the boat--
and, besides the tools which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and
a hammer, and with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft
went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the place where
I had landed before, by which I perceived that there was some inclraft of the
water, and consequently, I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I
might make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was, there appeared before me a little opening of the
land, and I found a strong current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft
as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream: but here I had like
to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think, verily, would
have broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground
at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it
wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards the end that
was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by setting my
back against the chests, to keep them in their places, but could not thrust
off the raft with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the posture I was
in ; but holding up the chests with all my might, stood in that manner near
half an hour, in which time the rising of the water brought me a little more
ilpon a level; and, a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated again,
and I thrust her off with the oar I had, into the channel, and then driving up- a
higher, I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on

both sides, and a strong current of tide running up. I looked on both sides,.
for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high

up the river, hoping, in time, to see some ship at sea, and therefore resolved

to place myself as near the coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which,
with great pain and dilficulty,I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as
that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in ; but here I
had liked to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again ; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say, sloping, there was no place to land, but where
one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink
lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again ; all that I could do,.
was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like
an anchor. to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground,

[which I expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as I
found water enough, for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her on '
upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her, by sticking-
my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side, near one end, and one on
the other side, near the other end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away,.
and left my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

' My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper place for my'

' habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure them from whatever might-
happen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the continent or on an
island ; whether inhabited or not inhabited ; whether in danger of wild beasts

'or not. There was a. hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep-
and. high, and which seemed to overtop some other hills, which lay as in a
ridge from it, northward. I took out one of the fowling-- -pieces, and one of the-
pistols, and a horn of powder; and thus armed, I travelled for discovery up to
the top of that hill, where, after I had with great labour and difficulty got to
the top, I saw my fate, to my great affliction, 21219., that I was in an island
environed every way by the sea, no land to be seen except some rocks, Which
lay a great way off; and two small islands, less than this, which lay about
three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good reason
to believe, uninhabited except by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw none ;.

. yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not their kinds ; neither when I killedCRUSOE MAKES A SECOND RAF' 3,

'them could I tell what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, I
shot at a great bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great
wood; I believe it was the first gun that had been fired there since the
creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, than from all parts of the
wood there arose an innumerable number of {owls of many sorts, making a
confused screaming and crying, and every one according to his usual note,
but not one of them of any kind that I knew; as for the creature I killed, I
took it to be a kind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no
talons or claws more than common ; its flesh was carrion, and fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and fell to work to
bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the rest of that day ; what to do
with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to
lie down on the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me,
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could,I barricaded myself round with the chests and
boards that I had brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that night's
lodging; as for food, I yet saw not which way to supply myself, except that I
.had seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot
the fowl.

I now began to consider that I might yet get a great many things out of
the ship which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to land, and I resolved to
make another voyage on board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that
the first storm that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved
>>to set all other things apart till I had got everything out of the ship that I
could get. Then I called a council--that is to say, in my thoughts--whether I
should take back the raft; but this appeared impracticable: so I resolved to go
.as before when the tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I
went from my hut, having nothing on but a chequered shirt, a pair of linen
drawers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft ; and, having
'had experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldly, nor loaded it so
hard, but yet I brought away several things very useful to me; as, first, in the
-carpenter's stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great
screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing
called a grindstone ; all these I secured, together with several things belonging
.to the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels of musket-
.bullets, seven muskcts, another fowling--piece, with some small quantity of
powder more ; a large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet-lead;
but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.

' Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes I could find, and a spare
fore-top sail, hammock, and some bedding; and with this I loaded my second
raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehensions during my absence from the land, that at-
least my provisions might be devoured on shore: but when I came back, I
found no sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a wild cat, upon
one of the chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away a little distance,.
and then stood still ; she sat very composed and unconcerned, and looked full.
in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me. I presented my'
gun at her, but, as she did not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned
at it, nor did she offer to stir away ; upon which I tossed her a bit of
biscuit, though, by the way,I was not very free of it, for my store was not.
great : however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled at it, and
ate it, and looked, as if pleased, for more ; but I thanked her, and could spare
no more; so she marched ofl'.

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain to open the-
barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels (for they were too heavy,.
being large casks), I went to work to make me a little tent, with the sail,'
and some poles which I cut for that purpose ; and into this tent I brought
everything that I knew would spoil either with rain or sun, and I piled all
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from.
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with some boards.
within, and an empty chest set up on end without; and spreading one of the.-
beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my head, and my gun at
length by me, I went to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night,
for I was very weary and heavy; for the night before I had slept little, and
had laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all those things from the ship,
as to get them on shore.

'I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that ever was laid up, I
believe, for one man: but I was not satisfied still, for while the ship sat-
upright in that posture, I thought I ought to get everything out of her that
I could: so every day at low water I went on board, and brought away-
something or other; but particularly the third time I went, I brought away
as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twine-
I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails uponSTRIPPING THE STRANDED SHII'. 39

occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder: in a word, I brought away all the
sails first and last ; only that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as
much at a time as I could, for they were no more useful to be sails, but as
mere canvas only. -

But that which comforted me more still was that, last of all, after I had made
five or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more to expect
from the ship that was worth my meddling with ; I say, after all this, I found
a great hogshead of bread, three large runlets of rum, or spirits, and a box of
sugar, and a barrel of fine flour: this was surprising to me, because I had
given over expecting any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the
water. I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up, parcel
by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out ; and, in a word, I got all this
safe on shore also.

The next day I made another voyage, and now, having plundered the ship
of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the cables ; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables and a
hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could get ; and having cut down
the sprit-sail yard, and the mizen-yard, and everything I could, to make a
large raft, I loaded it with all these heavy goods, and came away; but my
good luck began now to leave me; for this raft was so unwieldly, and so
overladen, that, after I had entered the little cove where I had landed the
rest of my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other,
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for myself, it
was no great harm, for I was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was a
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would have been of
great use to me: however, when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces of
cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with infinite labour; for I was fain
to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very much. After this,
I went every day on board, and brought away what I could get.

I had been now I 3 days on shore, and had been II times on board the
ship, in which time I had brought away all that one pair of hands could well
be supposed capable to bring ; though I believe verily, had the calm weather
held, I should have brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but
preparing the twelfth time to go on board, I found the wind began to rise:
however, at low water I went on board, and though I thought I had
rummaged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing more could be found, yet
I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or dozen of good knives
. and forks: in another I found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some gold and some silver,
- I smiled to myself at the sight of this money:"O drug!" said I, aloudI
"what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off
the ground: one of those knives is worth all this heap: I have no manner of
use for thee--even remain where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature
whose life is not worth saving." However, upon second thoughts, I took it
away, and wrapping all this in a piece of canvas, I began to think of making
_a'nother'raft; but while I was preparing this,I found the sky overcast, and
the wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from
the shore. It occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft
v with the wind off shore; and that it was my business to be gone before the
tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all ;
'aCCOrdingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam across the channel
' which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty
enough,-partly with the weight of the things I had about me, and partly the
roughness-of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite
' high water it blew a storm. _

But'I had got home to my little tent, where I lay, with all my wealth about
me, very secure. It blew very hard all that night, and in the morning, when
I looked out, behold no more ship was to be seen ! I was a little surprised,
but recovered myself- with the satisfactory_reflection, via, that I had lost no
time, nor abated any diligence, to get everything out of her that could be
useful to me ; and that, indeed, there was little left in her that I was able to

' bring away, if I had had more time.

I'now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of anything out of her,
except what might drive on shore from her wreck; as, indeed, divers pieces
of her afterwards did ; but those things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing myself against
either savages (if any should appear), or wild beasts, if any were in the island ;
and I had many thoughts of the method how to do this, and what kind of
dWelling to make ; whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent
upon the earth; and, in short, I resolved upon both, of the manner and des-
cription of which, it may not be improper to give an account.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement, because it was
upon a low, moorish ground, near the sea, and I believed would not be whole-
some, and more particularly because there was no fresh water near it; so I
resolved to find a more healthy and convenient spot of ground.Mane} 2': ml mall]: to Me solitary.SELECTS A DWELLING--PLACE. 4]:

I consulted several things in my situation, which I found would be proper
:for me : Ist, health and fresh water, I just now mentioned ; 2ndly, shelter from
.the heat of the sun ; 3rdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether man or
beast ; 4thly, a view to the sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, I might-not
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish
-all my expectation yet. '

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on the side of a
rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was steep as a house-side, so
that nothing could come down upon me from the top ; on the side of the rock
'there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a'
cave ; but there was not really any cave, or way into the rock at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I resolved to pitch
my tent : this plain was not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice as
long, and lay like a green before my door, and, at the end of it descended
irregularly every way down into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was on
the N .N.W. side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat every day,
till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which, in those countries,
is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent I drew a half-circle before the hollow place, which
took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and twenty yards
in its diameter, from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into the
ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened on the top; the two rows
did not stand above six inches from one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, and laid them
in rows, one upon another, within the circle, between these two rows of stakes,
up to the top, placing other stakes in the inside, leaning against them, about
two feet and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong
that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it; this cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring them
to the place, and drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be, not by a door, but by a short
ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after
me; and so I was completely fenced in and fortified, as I thought, from all
the world, and consequently, slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done; though as it appeared afterwards, there was no need of all
this caution from the enemies that I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all my riches,
all my provisions, ammunition, and stores, of which you have the account-
above; and I made a large tent, which, to preserve me from the rains,
that' in one part of the year are very violent there, I made double, One
smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it ; and covered the uppermost
with a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails. And now I lay no

\ more for a while in the bed which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock>>
which Was indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and everything that would spoil by'
the wet; and having thus enclosed all my goods,I made up the entrance, which
till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock, and bringing-
all the earth and stones that I dug down out through my tent,I laid them
up within my fence, in the nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground
within about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind my'
tent, which served me like a cellar to my house. '

It cost me much labour and many days before all these things were brought
to perfection ; and, therefore, I must go back to some other things which took:
up some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened, after I had laid my'
scheme for the setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm Of rain
[falling from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning happened, and
after that, a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the effect of it. I was not
so much surprised with the lightning, as I was with a thought which darted.
into my. mind as swift as the lightning itself--"O my powder ! " My very-
heart sank within me when I thought, that, at one blast, all my powdei' might;
be destroyed ; on which, not my defence only, but the providing my food, as.
I thought, entirely depended : I was nothing near so anxious about my own
danger, though had the powder took fire, I had never known who had hurt me.

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm was over, I
laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, and applied myself to-
make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and to keep it a little and a
little in a parcel, in the hope that whatever-might come, it might not all take
fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make-
one part fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight ; and I think
my powder, which in all was about 240 pounds weight, was divided in not
less than a hundred parcels: as to the barrel that had been wet, I did not
apprehend any danger from that ; so I placed it in my new cave, which in my
fancy, I called my kitchen ; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among;DISCOVERS GOATS ON THE ISLAND. 43.

the rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once at least every-
day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill anything
fit for food ; and, as near as I could, to acquaint myself with what the island
produced. The first time I went out, I presently discovered that there were
goats in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was
attended with this misfortune to me, 11222., that they were so shy, so subtle,.
and so swift of foot, that it was the most difficult thing in the world to come at
them ; but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I might now and
then shoot one, as it soon happened; for after I had found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed if they saw me in the
valleys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
fright ; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they
took no notice of me ; from whence I concluded, that by the position of their-
optics, their sight was so directed downward, that they did not readily see-
objects that were above them ; so afterwards, I took this method,--I always
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently a fair
mark. The first shot I made among these creatures, I killed a she-goat,.
which had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved me
heartily ; for when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her, till I came-
and took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one with me, upon
my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my enclosure ; upon which, I laid
down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in.
hopes to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill it, and
eat it myself; these two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I ate sparingly,
and saved my provisions (my bread especially) as much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely necessary to provide
a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn ; and what I did for that, and also
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences I made, I shall give a full
account of in its place.

And now being to enter into a melancholy relation of a scene of silent life
such, perhaps, as was never heard of in the world before, I shall take it from
its beginning, and continue it in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th
of September, when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this
horrid island, when the sun, being to us in its autumnal equinox, was almost

just over my head: for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude 9 deg. 22 min. north of the line.
~' After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into my thoughts
that I should be losing my reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
_ ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days; but to prevent this,I cut
with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters, and making it into a great
cross, I set up on the shore where I first landed, " I came on shore here on
the 30th of September, 1659." Upon the sides of this square post I out
every day a notch with my knife, and every seventh notch was as long again
as the rest, and every first day of the month, as long again as that long one;
and thus I kept my calendar, 'or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place, we are to observe that among the many things which I
brought out of the ship, in the several voyages which, as above mentioned, I
made to it, I got several things of less value, but not at all less useful to me,
which I omitted setting down before ; as, in particular, pens, ink, and paper;
several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping;
three or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives,
- charts, and books of navigation; all which I huddled together, whether I
might want them 01; no: also, I found three very good Bibles, which came to
me in my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among my things ;
sorne Portuguese books also ; and, among them, two or three Popish prayer--
books, and several other books, all which I carefully secured. And I must
.not forget, that we had in the ship a dog, and two cats, of whose eminent
history I may have occasion to say something in its place ; for I carried both
the cats with me ; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself,
and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and was a trusty servant to me many years ; I wanted nothing that he could
fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to me. I only wanted to
have him talk to me, but that would not do. As I observed before, I found
pens, ink, and paper, and I husbandcd them to the utmost ; and I shall show
:that while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but after that was gone I
could not, for I could not make any ink by any means that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all
that I had amassed together ; and of these, ink was one, as also a spade, pick-
axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth ; needles, pins, and thread : as for
Ilinen, I soon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily ; and it was near
.a whole year before I had entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded my
habitation ; the piles or stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were
a long time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more, by far, inIMPARTIALL Y CONSIDERS HIS C 0NDIT101V.

bringing home ; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing
home one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground ; for
which purpose,I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought
myself of one of the iron crows; which, however, though I found it, made
driving those posts or piles very laborious and tedious work. But what need,
I have been concerned at the tediousness of anything I had to do. seeing I
had time enough to do it in ? nor had I any other employment, if that had
been over, at least that I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek'
for food, which I did, more or less, every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the circumstances I
was reduced to; and I drew up the state of my affairs in writing, not so-
much to leave them to any that were to come after me, for I was likely to
have but few heirs, as to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon them,
and afflicting my mind: and as my reason began now' to master my
despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the
good against the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my case
from worse; and I stated very impartially, like debtor and creditor, the
comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered, thus :--

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony that there was scarce
any condition in the world so miserable, but there was something negative or
something positive to be thankful for in it.

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, and given
over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship--I say, giving over these
'things, I began to apply myself to make things as easy to me as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side of
a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of post and cables; but I might now
rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, about
two feet thick on the outside; and after some time (I think it was a year and
.a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it
'with boughs of trees. and such things as I could get, to keep out the rain;
which I found at some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and
into the cave which I had made behind me; but I must observe, too, that at
first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order, so they
took up all my place, I had no room to turn myself: so I set myself to enlarge
my cave and work farther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock, which
yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and so when I found I was
pretty safe as to_beasts of prey, I worked sideways, to the right hand, into the
rock ; and then, turning to the fight againtworked quite out, and made me a
door to come out on the outside of my pale or fortification. This gave me
not only egress and regress, as it were a back way to my tent and to my
storehouse, but gave me room to store my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I

. found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these I was
not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world ; I could not write or
eat, or do several things, with so much pleasure without a table. So I went
'to work; and here I must needs observe, that by making the most rational
judgment of things, every man may be, in time, master of every mechanic art.
I had never handled a tool in my life ; and yet, in time, by labour, application,
and contrivance, I found, at last, that I wanted nothing but I could have
made it, especially if I had had tools , however, I made abundance of things,
even without tools; and some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet,
which perhaps were never made that way before, and that with infinite labour;
for example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree,
.set it on an edge before me, and hcw it flat on either side with my axe, till I
had brought it to be thin as a plank, and then club it smooth with my adze.CRUSOE'S yo URNAL. 47

It is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole tree;
'but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for the pro-
digious deal of time and labour which it took me up to make a plank or
board : but my time or labour was little worth, and so it was aswell employed
one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above, in the first
place; and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my
raft from the ship ; but when I had wrought out some boards as above, I
made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another all
along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work on ; and,
in a word, to separate everything at large into their places, that I might come
easily at them, I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns
and all things that would hang up: so that, had my cave been to be seen, it
looked like a general magazine of all necessary things ; and I had everything
so ready at my hands, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods
in such order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of every day's employment;
for, indeed, at first, I was in too much hurry, and not only hurry as to labour,
but in too much discomposure of mind ; and my journal would have been full
of many dull things.

Some days after this, and after I'had been on board the ship, and got
all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a
little mountain, and looking out to sea, in hopes of seeing a ship ; then fancy
at a vast distance I spied a sail, please myself with the hopes of it, and then
after looking steadily, till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down and
weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and having settled
my household stuff and habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my journal ; of which I shall
here give you the copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over
again) as long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I was forced to leave
it off.

THE JOURNAL,

September 30, 1659--1, poor, miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship'-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing, came on shore on this dismal,
unfortunate island, which I called " The Island of Despair ;" all the rest of
the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost dead.

All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting myself at the dismal circum-
stances I was brought to ; via, I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, nor-

'p1ace- to fly to; and, in despair of any relief, saw nothing but death before me,
either that I should be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or-
starved to death for want of food. At the approach of night I slept in a tree ,.-
for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly, though it rained all night.

October I.---In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, the ship had floated
with the high tide, and was driven on shore again much nearer the island ;,
'whi'ch, as it was some comfort, on one hand--for seeing her set upright, and.
not broken to pieces, I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board, and
get some food and necessaries out of her for my relief--so, on the other hand,
it renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had
all stayed on board, might have saved the ship, or, at least, that they would
not have been all drowned, as they were ; and that, had the men been saved,
we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship to have
carried us to some other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in
perplexing myself ,on these things ; but, at length, seeing the ship almost dry,
I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board. This day
also it continued raining, though with no wind at all.

. From the Ist of October to the 24th.--All these days entirely spent in many_
several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore
every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain also' 1n the days, though with some
intervals of fair weather; but it seems this was the rainy season.

Oct 20 .--I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon it; but, being
in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of them
when the tide was out.

Oct. 25.--It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of wind ; during-
which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder than
before, and was no more to be seen, except the wreck of her, and that only at:
low'water. I spent this day in covering and securing the goods which I had.
saved, that the rain might not spoil them. ~

Oct. e6.------I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out a place to fix
my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself from any attack in the-
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards night, I fixed upon a proper
place, under a rock, and marked out a semicircle for my encampment ; which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification, made of double
piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.

From the 26th to 30th, I worked very hard in carrying all my goods to my-
new habitation, though some part of the time it rained exceedingly hard.
The 3Ist, in the morning, I went out into the island with my gun, to see
for some food, and discover the country ; when I killed a she-goat, and her kid
followed me home, which I afterwards killed also, because it would not feed.

November I.--I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for the first
night; making it as large as I could, with stakes driven in to swing my
hammock upon.

Nov. 2.--I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of timber which
made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.

Nov. 3.---I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like ducks, which
were very good food. In the afternoon went to work to make me a table.

Nov. 4--This morning I began to order my times of work, of going out
with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion; via, every morning I
walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not rain; then
employed myself to work till about eleven o'clock; then ate what I had to
live on; and from twelve till two I lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessively hot; and then, in the evening, to work again. The working part
of this day and of the next were wholly employed in making my table, for
I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and necessity made me
a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I believe they would do any one
else.

Nov. 5,--This day went abroad with my gun and my dog, and killed a
wild cat; her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for nothing; every creature
that I killed I took off the skins and preserved them. Coming back by the
sea-shore, I saw many sorts of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but
was surprised, and almost frighted with two or three seals, which, while Iwas
gazing at them, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea, and
escaped me for that time.

Nov. 6.--After my morning walk, I went to work with my table again, and
finished it, though not to my liking; nor was it long before I Ieamed to
mend it.

Now. 7.--Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th,
and part of the 12th (for the nth was Sunday), I took wholly up to make me
a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please
me; and even in the making I pulled it in pieces several times.

Note, I soon neglected my keeping Sundays; for, omitting my mark for
them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. I3.--This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly, and cooled

S
the earth ; but it was accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frightened me dreadfully, {or fear of my powder. As soon as it was over, I
resolved to separate my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger. _

Nov. 14, 15, 16.--These three days I spent in making little square chests,
or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two pounds at most, of
powder; and so, putting the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure and
remote from one another as possible. On one of these three days, I killed a
large bird that was good to eat, but I "knew not what to call it. .

Now. I 7.--This day I began to dig behind my tent into the rock, to make
room for my further convenience. Note, Three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work; 11:22., a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheelbarrow, or basket; so I
desisted from my work, and began to consider how to supply that want, and
m_ake-me some tools ; as for the pickaxe, I made use of the iron crows, which
were proper enough, though heavy: but the next thing was a shovel, or spade;
this was so absolutely necessary, that, indeed, I could do nothing effectually
without it ;. but what kind of one to make I knew not.

-Nov. 18.---The next day, in searching the woods, I found a tree of that
wood, or like it, which, in the Brazils, they call the iron-tree, for its exceeding
hardness; of this, with great labour, and almost spoiling my axe, I cut a
piece and brought it home, too, with difl'iculty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy. The excessive hardness of the wood, and my having no other way,
made me a long while upon this machine, for I worked it effectually by little
and little into the form of a shovel or spade ; the handle exactly shaped like
ours in England, only that the board part having no iron shod upon it at
the boctom, it would not last me so long; however, it served well enough for
the uses which I had occasion to put it to ; but never was a shovel, I believe,
made after that fashion, or so long in making. -

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket, or wheelbarrow. A basketI
could not make by any means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend 'to make wicker-ware, at least, none yet found out; and as to a
wheelbarrow, I fancied I could make all but the wheel; but that I had
no notion of, neither did I know how to go about it; besides I had no
possible way to make the iron g'udgeons for the spindle or axis of the
wheel to run in; so I gave it over, and so, for carrying away the earth
which I dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the
labourers carry mortar in when they serve the bricklayers. This was not
so difficult to me as the making the shovel ; and yet this and the shovel, andAT WORK IMPROVING HIS CAVE. 5!

the attempt which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow. took me up no less
than four days--I mean always excepting my morningr walk with my gun
which I seldom failed, and very seldom failed, also, bringing home something
fit to eat.

Nov. 23.--My other work having now stood still, because of my making
these tools, when they were finished, I went on, and working every day, as
my strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days entirely in widening
and deepening my cave, that it might hold my goods commodiously. Note,
During all this time, I worked to make this room or cave spacious enough
to accommodate me as a warehouse, or magazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and
a cellar ; as for my lodging I kept to the tent ; except that sometimes, in the
wet season of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry;
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my pale with long
poles, in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with.
flags and large leaves of trees, like a thatch.

December Io.--I began now to think my cave or vault finished, when on a
sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down
from the top and one side; so much that, in short, it frighted me, and not
without reason too, for if I had been under it, I had never wanted a
~gravedigger. I had now a great deal of work to do over again, for I
had the loose earth to carry out; and, which was of more importance, I had
the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no more would come down.

Dec. IL--This day I went to work with it, and got two shores or posts
'pitched upright to the top, with two pieces of board across over each post;
this I finished the next day , and setting more posts up with boards, in about
a week more I had the roof secured, and the posts, standing in rows, served
me for partitions to part off the house.

Dec. I 7 --From this day to the 20th I placed shelves, and knocked up nails
-on the posts, to hang everything up that could_ be hung up ; and now I began
to be in some order within doors.

Dec. 20.--Now I carried everything into the cave, and began to furnish my
house, and set up some pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me ; also, I made me another
table.

Dec. 24--Much rain all night and all day. No stirring out.

Dec. 2 5.--Rain all day.

Dec. 26.--No rain, and the earth much cooler than before and pleasanter.

Der. 27.--Killed a young goat, and lamed another so that I caught it and
led it home in a string; when I had it home, I bound and splintered up its
leg, which was broke. N.B.--I took such care of it that it lived, and the leg'
grew well and as strong as ever ; but, by my nursing it so long, it grew tame,
and fed upon the little green at my door, and would not go away; this was.
the first time that I entertained a thought of breeding up some tame creatures,.
that I might have food when my powder and shot was all spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 3o, 3I.--Great heats and no breeze, so that there was no stirring
abroad, except in the evening, for food ; this time I spent in putting all my
things in order within doors.

jam'twy L--Very hot still ; but I went abroad early and late with my gun,
and lay still in the middle of the day. This evening, going farther into the-
valleys which lay'towards the centre of the island, I_ found there were plenty
of goats, though exceedingly shy, and hard to come at; however, I resolved
to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.

fan. 2.4--Accordingly, the next day I went out with my dog, and set him
upon the goats ; but I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog,
and he knew his danger too well, for he would not come near them.

fan. 3.----I began my fence, or wall; which, being still jealous of my being
attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very thick and strong.

N.B.--This wall being described before, it is sufiicient to observe that I was-
no less time than from the 3rd of January'to the 14th of April working,
finishing,- and perfecting this wall, though it was no more than about twenty-
four yards in length, being a half-circle, from one place in the rock to another
place, about eight yards from it, the door of the cave being in the centre
behind it.

All this time I worked very hard,the 'rains hindering me many days, nay,
sometimes weeks together ; but I thought I should never be perfectly'secure
till this wall was finished; and it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour
cverything was done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods, and
driving them into the ground ; for I made them much bigger than I need to-
have done.

When this wall was finished, and the outside double-fenced, with a turf
wall :aised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if any people were to come
on shore there, they would not perceive anything like a habitation; and it
was very well I did so, as may be observed hereafter, upon a very remarkable
occasron.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game every day when
the rain permitted me, and made frequent discoveries in these walks of some-
thing or other to my advantage; particularly, I found a kind of wild pigeons,
which build, not as wood- -pigeons in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in
the holes of the rocks ; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed
them up tame, and did so ; but when they grew older they flew away, which
perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give them;
however, I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones, which were
very good meat. And now, in the managing my household affairs, Ihfound
myself wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was impossible {or
me to make ; as, indeed, with some of them it was: for instance, I could never
make a cask to be hooped; I had a small runlet or two, as I observed before;
but I could never arrive at the capacity of making one by them, though I
spent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or join the
staves so true to one another as to make them hold water; so I gave that also
over. In the next place, I was at a great loss {or candles ; so that as soon as
ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go
to bed. I_1'emembcrcd the lump of bees-wax with which I made candles in
my African adventure; but I had none of that now ; the only remedy I had
was, that when I had killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish
made of clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some
toakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me light, though not a clear steady
light like a candle. In the middle of all my labours it happened that, rum-
maging my things, I found a little bag, which had been filled with corn for
the feeding of poultry, not for. this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the
ship came from Lisbon. The little remainder of corn that had been in the
bag was all devoured by the rats, and I saw nothing in it but husks and dust;
.and being willing to have the bag for some other use (I think it was to put
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use), I
:shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortification under the
rock.

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that I threw this
.stufl' away, taking no notice, and not so much as remembering that I had
thrown anything there, when, about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some
.few stalks of something green shooting out of the ground. which I fancied
might be some plant I had not seen ; but I was perfectly astonished, when,
.after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect green barley, of the same kind as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of my thoughts
on this occasion. I had hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed,I had very few notions of religion in my head, nor had entertained:
any sense of anything that had befallen me, otherwise than as chance, or, as.
we lightly say, what pleases God, without so much as inquiring into the end
of Providence in these things, or His order in governing events for the world ;,
but after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not proper
I for corn, and especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me
strangely, and I began to suggest that God had miraculously caused His.
grain to 'grow without any help of seed sown, and that it was so directed
purely for my sustenance on that wild, miserable place.

And this was the more strange to me, because I saw near it still, all along;
by the side of the rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks
of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was.
ashore there. I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my support, but, not doubting that there was more in the place, I went all
over that part of the island where I had been before, peering in every corner,,'
and under every rock, to see for more of it, but I could not find any ; at last

'it occurred to my thoughts, that I shook a bag of chicken's meat out in that
place; and then the wonder began to cease ; and Imust confess, my religious.
thankfulness to God's providence began to abate, too, upon the discovering;
that all this was nothing but what was common; though I ought to have been
as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had been
miraculous ; for it was really the work of Providence to me, that should order'
or appoint that ten or twelve grains of corn should remain unspoiled, when.
the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from heaven ; as
3150, that I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in the
shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately: whereas, if I had thrown it
anywhere else, at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their season,.
which was about the end of June; and, laying up every corn, I resolved to
sow them all again, hoping, in time, to have some quantity, sufficient to
supply ine with bread. But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow
myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, for I";
lost all that I sowed the first season, by not observing the proper time; for I
sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least.
not as it would have done ; of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice,.
which I preserved with the same care and for the same use, or to the same
purpese--to make me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it.2n . a .K;

without baking, though I did that also after some time. But to return to my
journal.

I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my wall done;
and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door,
but over the wall, by a ladder, that there might be no sign on the outside of
my habitation.

April 16.--I finished the ladder; so I went up the ladder to the top. and
then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside. This was a complete
enclosure to me; for within I had mom enough, and nothing could come at
me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost all my
labour. overthrown at once, and myself killed. The case was thus:--As I
was busy in the inside, behind my tent, just at the entrance into my cave, I
was terribly frighted with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed ; for, all on
a sudden, I found the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave,
and from the edge of the hill over my head, and two of the posts I had set
up in the cave cracked in a frightful mannerz'I was heartily scared, but
thought nothing of what was really the cause, only thinking that the top of
my cave was fallen in, as some of it had done before: and for fear I should be
buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not thinking myself safe there
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill, Which I expected
might roll down upon me; I was no sooner stepped down upon the firm
ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood
on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance, with three such shocks
as would have overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to
have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock which stood
about half a mile from me next the sea fell down, with such a terrible noise
as I never heard in all my life, I perceived also the very sea was put into
violent motion by it ; and I believe the shocks were stronger under the water
than on the island.

I was so much amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the like, nor
discourscd with any one that had. that I was like one dead or stupefied ; and
the motion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was tossed at
sea ; butthe noise of the falling of the rock awaked me, and rousing me from
the stupefied condition I was in, filled me with horror; and I thought of
nothing but the hill falling upon my tent and all my household goods, and
burying all at once ; and this sunk my very soul within me a second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some time, I began
to take courage ; and yet I had not heart enough to go over my wall again,
for fear of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground greatly cast down
and dis'consolate, not knowing what to do ; all this while, I had not the least
serious religious thought ; nothing but the common " Lord have mercy upon
me ! " and when it was over, that went away too.

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy, as if it would
rain. .Soon after that, the wind-arose by little and little, so that in less than
half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane, the sea was all on a sudden
covered over with foam and froth ; the shore was covered with the breach of
the water; the trees were torn up by the roots; and a terrible storm it was.
This held about three hours, and then began to abate; in two hours more it
was quite calm, and began to rain very hard.

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and dejected;
when" on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequences of the earthquake, the earthquake itself was spent and over,
and I might venture into my cave again. With this thought, my spirits
began to revive ; and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went .in and sat
down in my tent. But the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to be
beaten down with it ; and I was forced to go into my cave, though very much
afraid lest it should fall on my head.

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz" to cut a hole through my
new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have
flooded my cave. After I had been in my cave for some time, and found still
no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed.
And now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little store, and took a small sup of rum ; which, however, I did then and
always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great part of the next day, so that I
could not stir abroad ; but my mind being more composed, I began to think
of what I had best do; concluding, that if the island was subject to these
earthquakes, there would be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of
building a little hut in an open place, which I might surround with a wall, as
I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild beasts or men ; for I
concluded if I stayed where I was, I should certainly, one time or other, be
buried alive.

With these thoughts, I resolved to remove my tent from the place where it
stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill ; and which, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon my tent ; and I spent theRESOL VES T0 REIIIOVE IIIS HABITATIOJV 57

two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how
to remove my habitation.

The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never slept in quiet ;
and yet the apprehension of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal
to it ; but still, when I looked about, and saw how everything was put in order,
how pleasantly concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very
loth to remove. In the mean time, it occurred to me that it would require a
vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented to venture
where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself, and had secured it so as to
remove to it. So with this resolution I composed myself for a time, and
resolved that I would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles
and cables,.&c., in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it, when it was
finished ; but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished, and
fit to remove. This was the zxst.

April 22,--Thc next morning I began to consider of means to put this
resolve into execution ; but I was at a great loss about my tools. I had three
large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for trafiic
with the Indians); but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard wood,
they were all full of notches, and dull ; and though I had a grindstone, I could
not turn it and grind my tools too. This cost me as much thought as a
statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, or a judge
upon the life and death of a man. At length,I contrived a wheel with a
string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty.

Aprz'128,29.--These two whole days I took up in grinding my tools, my
machine for turning my grindstone performing very well..

April 3o.--Having perceived my bread had been low a great while, now I
took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy.

[Play I.---In the morning, looking towards the seaside, the tide being low, I
saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary, and it looked like a
ocask ; when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the
wreck of the ship, which were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and
looking towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the
water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which was driven on shore,
.and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder; but it had taken water, and the
powder was cakcd as hard as a stone: however, I rolled it farther on shore

for the present, and went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck
'of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed; the fore-
castle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up at least six feet, and
the stem, which was broke 1n pieces and parted from the rest by the force of
the sea, soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and
cast on one Slde, and the sand was thrown so high on that side next her stern
that whereas there was a great place of water before, so that I could not come-
within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now walk-
quite up to her when the tide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but-
soon concluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this violence-
the ship was more broke open than formerly, so many things came daily on
shore which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled by
degrees to the land.

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing my habita-
tion, and I busied myself mightily, that day especially, in searching whether
I could make any way into the ship ; but I found nothing was to be expected
of that kind, for all the inside of the ship was choked up with sand. However,
as I had learned not to despair of anything, I resolved to pull everything to
pieces that I could of the ship, concluding that everything I could get from
her would be of some use or other to me.

May 3.--I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam through, which I
thought held some of the upper part or quarter-deck together, and when I
had cut it through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could from the side

. which layhighest; but the tide comingin, Iwas obliged to give over for that time.

May 4.---I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of, till I
was weary of my sport ; when, just going to leave 03', I caught a young
dolphin. I had made. me a long line of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks;
yet I frequently caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat ; all which I
dried in the sun, and ate them dry.

May 5.--Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder, and brought '
three great fir planks ofl" from the decks, which I tied together, and made to
float on shore when the tide of flood came on.

May 6.--Worked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of her, and other
pieces of iron-work. Worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts of giving it over.

May 7.-----Went to the wreck again, but not with an intent to work, but.
found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down, the beams being cut ;
that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside of the hold
lay so open that I could see into it, but almost full of water and sand.AGAIZV AT WORK ON THE lVlffiCK. 59-

May 8.--Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to wrench up the-
deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or sand ; I wrenched open two-
planks, and brought them on shore also with the tide ; I left the iron crow in
the wreck for next day.

May 9.--VVent to the wreck, and with the crow made way into the body of"
the wreck, and felt several casks, and loosened them with the crow, but could
not break them up ; I felt also a roll of English lead, and could stir it; but it
was too heavy to remove.

May IO--I4.--Went every day to the wreck ; and got a great many pieces-
of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred-weight of iron.

'May 15,--1 carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a piece off the
roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the other ;
but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I could not make any blow
to drive the hatchet.

May 16.--It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck appeared more
broken by the force of the water; but I stayed so long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented my going to the wreck that day.

May 17.--I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at a great distance,'
near two miles ofi" me, but resolved to see what they were, and found it was a,
piece of the lead, but two heavy for me to bring away.

May 24.--Every day, to this day, I worked on the wreck; and with hard
labour I loosened some things so much with the crow, that the first blowing
tide several casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests ; but the wind
blowing from the shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber,
and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork in it; but the salt water and the
sand had spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the I 5th of June,
except the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during this
part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready
when it was ebbed out ; and by this time I had got timber and plank and iron-- 4
work enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how; and also I got,
at several times and in several pieces, near 100 weight of the sheet-lead.

jzme 16,--Going down to the sea-side, I found a large tortoise, or turtle; this
was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only my misfortune, not any defect
of the place, or scarcity ; for had I happened to be on the other side of'
the island, I might have had hundreds of them every day, as I found
afterwards. .

june x7.--I spent in cooking the turtle. I found in her threescore eggs;
and her flesh was to me, at that time, the most savoury and pleasant that ever
I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed
in this horrid place.

june I8.--Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought, at this time, the
rain felt cold, and Iwas something chilly , which I knew was not usual in
that latitude.

fume 19.--Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been cold.

june 20. --No rest all night; violent pains in my head, and feverish.

fune 21. --Very ill; frighted almost to death with the apprehensions of my
.said condition--to be sick, and no help. Frayed to God for the first time
since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what I said, or why, my thoughts
being all confused.

fun: 122,--A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions of sickness.

lune 2 3.--Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a violent headache.

- June 24--Much better.

june 2 5.--An ague very violent: the fit held me seven hours ; cold fit, and
hot, with faint sweats after it.

fun: 26.--Better; and having no victuals to eat, took my gun, but found
myself very weak. However, I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty
got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate. I would fain have stewed it,
and made some broth, but had no pot.

jun: 27.--The ague again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and neither
ate nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God
.again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I
.knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, "Lord, look upon me! Lord,
pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me ! " I suppose I did nothing else for two
or three hours ; till, the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far
in the night. When I awoke I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and
exceeding thirsty. However,as I' had no water in my habitation,I was forced
to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In this second sleep, I had this
terrible dream.

I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where
I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and thatI saw a man descend
from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground.
He was all over as bright as a flame, so that Icould but just bear to look
towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible
for words to describe. When he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I
thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake, andCRUSOE'S TERRIBLE DREAIII. 61'

all the air looked, to my apprehension, as if it had been filled with flashes of
fire.

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards.
me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me ; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me--or I heard a voice so-
terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it. All that I can say I
understood was this: " Seeing all these things have not brought thee to
repentance, now thou shalt die ; " at which words, I thought he lifted up the-
spear that was in his hand to kill me.

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I should be able
to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible vision. Nor is it any more
possible to describe the impression that remained upon my mind when I
awaked, and found it was but a dream.

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge. What I had received by the good"
instruction of my father was then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for-
eight years, of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation with none
but such as were, like myself, wicked and profane to the last degree. In the
relating what is already past of my story, this will be the more easily believed,
when I shall add, that through all the variety of miseries that had to this day'
befallen me, I never had so much as one thought of it being the hand of God,
or that it was a just punishment for my sin ; my rebellious behaviour against
my father--or my present sins, which were great--or so much as a punish-
ment for the general course of my wicked life. I only said to myself often,
that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always miserable. But now,
when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the miseries of death came
to place itself before me ; when my spirits began to sink under the burden of '
a strong distemper, and nature was exhausted with the violence of the fever ;
conscience, that had slept so long, began to awake, and I' began to reproach
myself with my past life. " Now," said I aloud, " my dear father's words are
come to pass; God's justice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or
hear me. I rejected the voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me in
a posture or station of life wherein I might have been happy and easy ; but
I would neither see it myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it from my
parents. I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn
under the consequences of it. I refused their help and assistance, who would
have lifted me in the world, and would have made everything easy to me ;
and now I have difficulties to struggle with too great for even nature itself to-
support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, no advice." Then I cried
out, " Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress."
This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for many
gyears.
' jam 28.--Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I had had, and
:the fit being entirely off; I got up; and though the fright and terror of my
dream was very great, yet I considered that the fit of the ague would return
.again the next day, and now was my time to get something to refresh and
support myself when I should be ill ; and the first thing I did, I filled a large
.square case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed ;
. and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put about a
quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them together. Then I got me a
piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little.
.I walked about, but was very weak, and wi'thal very sad and heavy--hearted
under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper
the next day; at night I made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which
I roasted in the ashes, and ate, as we call it, in the shell, and this was the first
.bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to, even as I could remember, in
my whole life. After I had eaten, I tried to walk, but found myself so weak
that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without that) ; so I
went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground looking out upon the
:sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth. As I sat here
some such thoughts as these occurred to me :--What is this earth and sea, of
' which Ihave seen so much? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and
.all the other 'creatures, wild and tame, human and brutal ? Whence are we?
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who formed the earth and sea,
.the air and sky; and who is that? Then it followed most naturally, it is God
that has made all. Well, but then, it came on strangely, if God has made all
these things, He guides and governs them all, and all things that concern
=them ; for the power'that could make all things must certainly have power to
guide and direct them. If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of His
works, either without His knowledge or appointment.
Ancl if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows that I am here,
.and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing happens without His
. appointment, He has appointed all this to befall me. Immediately it
. followed--Why has God done this to me P My conscience presently checked
.me in that inquiry, as if I had blasphemed, and methought it spoke to me
like a voice--"Wretch! dost t/wu ask what thou hast done? Look back
upon a dreadful misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done? Ask,
'why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? Why wert thou notFINDS A CURE FOR BODYAND SOUL. 63

the Sallee man-of-war ; devoured by the wild beasts on the coast of Africa ;
or drowned HERE, when all the crew perished but thyself ? Dost t/wu ask,
What have I done P " I was struck dumb with these reflections, as one
astonished, and had not a word to say--no, not to answer to myself, but rose
'up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as
if I had been going to bed ; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had
no inclination to sleep ; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for
it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehension of the return of my distemper
terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought that the Brazilians take no
'physic but their tobacco for almost all distempers, and I had a piece of a roll
of tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that
was green, and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this chest I found a cure
both for soul and body. I opened the chest, and found what I looked for, via,
'the tobacco ; and,,as the few books I had saved lay there too, I took out one
of the Bibles whichI mentioned before, and which to this time I had not
found leisure or inclination to look into; I say, I took it out, and brought
both that and the tobacco with me to the table. What use to make of the
tobacco I knew not, in my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no:
'but I tried several experiments with it, as if I resolved it should hit one way
or other: I first took a piece of leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which,
indeed, at first almost stupefied my brain, the tobacco being green and
:strong, and that I had not been much used to it; then I took some and
steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of it when
I lay down ; and, lastly, I burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose
close over the smoke of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as
'the virtue of it, and I held almost to suffocation. In the interval of this
'operation, I took up the Bible, and began to read ; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time ; only,
having opened the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were
'these, "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
shalt glorify me." The words were very apt to my case, and made some im-
pression upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not so much
as they did afterwards ; for, as for being delivered, the word had no sound, as
'I may say, to me ; the thing was so remote, so impossible in my apprehension
-of things, that I began to say, as the children of Israel did when they were
promised flesh to eat, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness?" so I
began to say, "Can God Himself deliver me from this place?" And as it was.
not for many years that any hopes appeared, this prevailed very often upon
my thoughts; but however the words made a very great impression upon
me, and I mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco-
had, as I said, dozed my head so much that I inclined to sleep ; so I left my-
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want anything in the night, and went:
to bed ; but, before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all my life--I
kneeled down, and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called
upon Him if) the day of trouble He would deliver me. After my broken and
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped the>>
tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that I could scarcely
get it down. Immediately upon this I went to bed, and I found presently it
flew up into my head violently ; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no-
fnore till, by the sun, it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon
the next day; nay, to this hour I am partly of opinion that Islept all the>>
next day and night, and till almost three the day after ; for otherwise, I
know not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days of the-
week, as it appeared some years after I had done; for if I had lost it by'
crossing and recrossing the Line, I should have lost more than a day ; but in
my account it was lost, and I never knew which way. Be that, however, one
way or other, when I awaked I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my-
spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up I was stronger than I'was the day
before, and my stomach better, for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no' fit
-the next day, but continued much altered for the better. This was the 29th..
The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went abroad with my gun, but'
did not care to travel too far: Ikilled a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand goose, and brought them home, but was not very forward to eat them ;
so I eat some more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening-
] renewed the medicine, which I had supposed did me good the day before,
21133., the tobacco steeped in rum ; only I did not take so much as before, nor'
did Lchew any of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke ; however, I was-
not so well.the next day, which was the'first of July, as I hoped I should
have been ; for I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.
jub' 2.--I renewed the medicine all the three ways; and dosed myself"
with it as at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.
' [uly 3.---I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not recover my full
strength for some weeks after. While I was thus gathering strength my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this scripture, " I will deliver thee ;" and theHE PRA YS, AND READS HIS BIBLE. 65

mpossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever
expecting it : but as I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred
to my mind that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the main
affliction, that Idisregarded the deliverance Ihad received, and I was as it
were made to ask myself such questions as these; 21213.: Have I not been
delivered, and wonderfully too, from sickness--from the most distressed con-
dition that could be, and that was so frightful to me ? and what notice had I
taken of it ? Had I done my part? God had delivered me, but I had not
glorified Him--that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that as
a deliverance ; and how could I expect greater deliverance? This touched
my heart very much; and immediately I knelt down, and gave God thanks
aloud for my recovery from my sickness.

[uly 4.--In the morning, I took the Bible; and, beginning at the New
Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a
while every morning and every night; not tying myself to the number of
chapters, but long as my thoughts should engage me ; it was not long after I
set seriously to this work but I found my heart more deeply and sincerely
affected with the wickedness of my past life; the impression of my dream
revived ; and the words, "All these things have not brought thee to repent-
ance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give
me repentance, when it happened, providentially, the very day that, reading
the Scripture, I came to these words : " He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour,
to give repentance and to give remission." I threw down the book; and
with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of
joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus, thou son of David! Jesus, thou exalted Prince
and Saviour! give me repentance!" This was the first time I could say, in
the true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed
with a sense of my condition and a true Scripture view of hope, founded on
the encouragement of the Word of God; and from this time, I may say, I
began to have hope that God would hear me.

From the 4th of July to the 14th I was chiefly employed in walking about
with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that was
gathering up his strength after a fit of sickness; for it is hardly to be
imagined how low I was, and to what weakness I was reduced. The appli-
cation which I made use of was perfectly new, and perhaps which had never
cured an ague before ; neither can I recommend it to any one to practise, by
this experiment : and though it did carry off the fit, yet it rather contributed

to weakening me ; for I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for
6
some time. I learned from it also this, in particular, that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that could be.

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months; all possibility
of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken from me;
and I. firmly believed that no human shape had ever set foot upon that
place. Having now secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I

, had a great desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to see
what other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.

It Was on the 15th of July that I began to take a more particular survey of
the island itself. I went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought my
rafts on shore. I found, after I came about two miles up, that the tide did
not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of running
water, very fresh and good ; but this being the dry season, there was hardly
any water in some parts of it--at least, not enough to run in any stream, so as
it could be perceived. On the banks of this brook, I found many pleasant
savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the
rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, as might be
supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of tobacco, green, and
growing. to a great- and very strong stalk. There were divers other plants,
which I had no notion of or understanding about, that might, perhaps, have
virtues of their own, which I could not find out. I searched for the cassava
root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of, but I could
find none. ' I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw
several sugar-canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation, imperfect. I con-
tented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back, musing
with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and goodness of
any of the fruits or 'plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no
conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was in the
Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field; at least, very little that
might serve me to any purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and, after going
something farther than I had gone the day before, I found the brook and
savannahs began to cease, and the country become more woody than before.
In this part I found different fruits, and particularlyI found melons upon the
ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the trees ; the vines had spread,
indeed, over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now in their prime,
very ripe and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was exceedingly
glad'of them ; but I was warned by my experience to eat sparingly of them,Fruit m (11C/ Island.
remembering that when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there, by throwing them into
fevers ; but I found an excellent use for these grapes ; that was, to cure or dry
'them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I
thought would be, as indeed they were, wholesome and agreeable to eat when
no grapes could be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habitation, which,
by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from home. In the
night I took my first contrivance, and got up in a tree, where I slept well ;
and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling nearly four
miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north,
with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me.

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the country seemed
'to descend to the west ; and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of
the side of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the
country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being in a
constant verdure or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garden.

I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a
secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts) to
think that this was all my own ; that I was King and Lord of all this country
indefeasibly, and had a right of possession ; and, if I could convey it, I might
have it in inheritance as completely as any Lord of a Manor in England. I
saw here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange, and lemon, and citron-trees ; but
all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then. However, the
green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very whole-
.some ; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very
wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now I had business
enough to gather and carry home ; and I resolved to lay up a store as well of
grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I
knew was approaching. In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and
lemons in another place ; and taking a few of each with me, I travelled home-
wards; resolving to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could
make, to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days in this
journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my cave); but before
I got thither the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit and the weight
of the Juice having broken them and bruised them, they were good for little
-or nothing: as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small
bags to bring home my harvest. But I was surprised, when coming to my
heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, to find
them all spread about, trodden to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some-
there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were-
some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this ; but what they were I

. knew not. However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps, and.
no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be destroyed,
and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight, I took-
another course; for I gathered a large quantity of' the grapes, and hung them
upon the out branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun ;'
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I could well stand'
under.

When I came home from this journey,'I contemplated with great pleasure
the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation ; the-
security from storms on that side, the water, and the wood: and concluded
that I had fixed upon a place to fix my abode, which was by far the worst
part of the country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as where now I was situ-
ated, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of the island.

-' This thought ran long'in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for some-
time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me ; but when I came to a nearer-
view of it, I considered that I was now by the sea-side, where it was at least
possible that something might happen to my advantage, and, that the same-
ill-fate that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy wretches to
the same place; and though it was scarce probable that any such thing should
ever happen, yet to inclose myself among the hills and woods in the centre of'
the island was to anticipate my bondage, and to render such an affair not
only improbable, but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any
means to remove. However, I was so enamoured of this place,'that I spent
much of my time there for the whole of the remaining part of the month of '
July ; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I
built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong
fence, being a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled
between with brushwood ; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights together; always going over it with a ladder as before; so that I

fancied now I had my country ho'use and my sea~coast house; and this work
took me up to the beginning of August.THE RAINY SEASON. 69

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, but the
rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation ; for though I
made me a tent like the other with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well,
,yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind
me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said,I had finished my bower, and
began to enjoy myself. The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung
up perfectly dried, and indeed excellent raisins of the sun ; so I began to take
them down from the trees, and it was very happy that I did so, for the rains
which followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of my
winter food ; for I had above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner
had I taken them all down, and carried most of them home to my cave, but
it began to rain; and from hence, which was the 14th of August, it rained,
more or less, every day till the middle of October ; and sometimes so violently,
that I could not stir out of my cave for several days.

In this season, I was much surprised with the increase of my family; I had
been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as I
thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her, till, to my aston-
ishment, she came home about the end of August, with three kittens. This
was the more strange to me, because, though I had killed a wild 'cat, as I
called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a different kind from our
European cats ; yet the young cats were the same kind of house-breed as the
old one ; from these three cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats,
that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them
from my house as much as possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could not
stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement, I
began to be straitened for food: but venturing out twice, I one day killed a
goat; and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus :--I ate a bunch of raisins
(or my breakfast ; a piece of the goat's flesh, or of the tuttle, for my dinner,
broiled (for, to my great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew anything),
and two or three of the turtle's eggs for my supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or
three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards one
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door or way out, which
came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out this way. But I
was not perfectly easy at lying so open ; for, as I had managed myself before,
. I was in a perfect enclosure ; whereas now,I thOught I lay exposed; and
. yet I could not perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest,
creature that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.

- Sept. 30.--I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing. ,I

cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three hundred
and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart for
religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious.
humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging his righteousjudgments
upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ; and
' not having tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, even till the going-
dowh of the sun, I then eat a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to
bed, finishing the day as I began it. I had all this time observed no Sabbath-
day; for, as at first Ilhad no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after
'some time, omitted to distinguish the weeks by making a longer notch than
"ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what any of the
;-days were; but now, having cast up the days as above, I found Ihad been
there a year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for
a. Sabbath ; though I foimd at the end of my account I had lost a day or two
in my reckoning A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I
contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most
remarkable events of my life.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,
and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but I
bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to relate was
one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of . barley and rice, which I
had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and I believe
there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of barley ; and now I
thought it a proper time to sow it, after the rains, the sun beingin its southern
position, going from me. Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground as well as.
I could with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed my
grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts that I would
not sow it all at first because I did not know when was the proper time for
it, so I sowed about two- thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of
what I sowed this time came to anything: {or the dry months following, the
earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist
its growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had come again, andEXPEII'IJIIENTS IVITH BARLE Y AND RICE SEED. 71

then it grew as if it had been but newly sown. Finding my first seed did not
grow, which I easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of ground near
my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months of March and April to
water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop ; but having
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had, I had but a
small quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of
each kind. But by this experiment I was made master of my business, and
knew exactly when the proper season was to sow, and that I might expect
two seed times, and two harvests every year.

While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use to
me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began to
settle, which was about the month of November,I made a visit up the country
to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I found all
things just as I left them. The double hedge that I had made was not only
firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some trees that grew
thereabouts, were all shot out and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow-tree usually shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could not
tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and
yet very well pleased, to see the young trees grow : and I pruned them, and
led them up to grow as much alike as I could. It is scarce credible how beauti-
ful a figure they grew into in three years ; so that though the hedge made a
circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might
now call them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to
lodge under all the dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more
stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semicircle round my wall (I mean
that of my first dwelling), which I did ; and placing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they grew
presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards
served {or a defence also, as I shall observe in its order. _

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, not
into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the dry
seasons, which were generally thus:

The half of February, the whole of March, and the half of April--rainy, the
sun being then on or near the equinox. The half of April, the whole of May,
June, and July, and the half of August--dry, the sun being then to the north
of the Line. The half of August, the whole of September, and the half of
October--rainy, the sun being then come back. The half of October, the
whole of N ovember, December, and January, and the half of February--dry, the
sun being then to the south of the Line. The rainy season sometimes held
longer or shorter as the winds happened to blow, but this was the general
observation I made. After I had found, by experience, the ill consequences
of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as
much as possible during the wet months.

In this timeI found much employment, and very suitable also to the time,
~for I found great occasion for many things .which I had no way to furnish
myself with but by hard labour and constant application ; particularly I tried
many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle-that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent
"advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in
standing at a basket-maker's, in the town where my father lived, to see them
"make their wicker--ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to
'help, and a great observer of the manner in which they worked those things,
and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means so full knowledge of
the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the materials, when it came into
my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew,
might possibly be as tough as the sallows, willows, and osiers in England, and
I resolved to try.

Accordingly, the next day I went to my country house, as I called it, and
cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to
cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them ;
these I sat up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they were fit for
use, I carried them to my cave ; and here, during the next season, I employed
myself in making, as well as.I could, a great many baskets, both to carry
earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had occasion; and though I did
not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them suficiently serviceable for
my purpose ; and thus, afterwards, I took care never to be without them ; and
as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more, especially strong deep baskets to
place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity
of it. ' .

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it, I
bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels
to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full
of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others which
were case-bottles, square, for the holding of water, spirits, &c. I had not so
much as a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle, which I saved out of
the ship, and which was too big for such uses as I desired it for, 7/1232, to make
broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The second thing I fain would have
had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible to me to make one ; however,
I found a contrivance for that, too, at last. I employed myself in planting
my second rows of stakes or piles and in this wickemvorking all the summer
-or dry season, when another business took me up more time than it could be
imagined I could spare.

I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and

that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I' built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the island. I
now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that side; so, taking ,
my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual, with two biscuit cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch
for my store, I began my journey. When I had passed the vale where my
bower stood, as above, I came within view of the sea to the west, and it being
a very clear day, I fairly descried land, whether an island or continent I could
not tell ; but it lay very high, extending from the W. to the W.S.W. at a very
great distance;' by my guess, it could not be less than fifteen or twenty
leagues off.
<<-. I could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than that I
knew it 'must be part of America, and, as I concluded by all my observations,
must be near the Spanish dominions. After some thought. I considered that
if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see
some vessel pass or repass one way or other ; but if not, then it was the
savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, where are found the
worst of savages ; for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder
and devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.

With these considerations,I walked very leisurely forward. I found that
side of the island whereI now was much pleasanter than mine, the open or
savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very fine
woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught one, if
possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did,
after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked it down with a
.stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home; but it was some years
before I could make him speak. However, at last,I taught him to call me
by my name very familiarly , but the accident that followed, though it be a.
trifle, will be very diverting 1n its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey. I found in the low grounds
' hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy myself to eat them, though.
I killed several; but I had no need to be venturous; forI had no want of
food, and of that which was very good, too, especially these three sorts, 11:22.,
goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, which, added to my grapes, Leadenhall-
market could not have furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the
company: and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause'
for thankfulness that I was not driven to any extremities for food ; but had
rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day,or
thereabouts ; but I took so many turns and returns to see what discoveries I
could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I resolved to sit
down all night ; and then either reposed' myself in a tree, or surrounded
myself with a row of stakes set upright in the ground, either from one
tree to another, or so as no wild creature could come at me without waking
me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had taken
up my lot on the worst side of the island; for here, indeed, the shore was
covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side I had found but
three in a ye'ar and a half. Here was also an infinite number of {owls of
many kinds, some which I had not seen before, and many of them very good
meat, but such as I knew not the names of, except those called penguins. I
could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my powder
and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she--goat, if I could, which I
could better feed on ; and though there were many goats here, more than on
my side the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner
than when I was on the hills.

, I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine ; but yet
I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my habitation
it became natural to me, and Iseemed all the while I was here to be as it
were upon a. journey, and from home. However, I travelled along the shore
of the sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then setting up
a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home again;
and the next journey I took should be on the other side of the island east
from my dwelling, and so round till I came to my post again ; of which in its:
place.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could easily
keep all the island so much in my view, that I could not miss finding my first.
dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself mistaken, for, being'
come about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very large
valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with wood, that I
could not see which was my way by any direction but that of the sun, nor
even then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun at that time of the
day.

It happened, to my further misfortune, that the weather proved hazy for
three or four days while I was in the valley ; and not being able to see the
sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was obliged to find the-
sea-side, look for my post, and come back the same way as I went: and then,.
by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and
my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it ; and I,
running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I
had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often been musing'
whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of '
tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and shot should be all:
spent. I made a collar for this little creature, and with a string, which I
made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me, I led him along,
though with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and there I inclosed.
him and left him, for I was very impatient to be at home, from whence I had
been absent above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old
hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed ; this little wandering journey, with-
out a settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own
house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me compared to
that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I resolved I
would never go a great way from it again, while it should be my lot to stay
on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long
journey: during which, most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair
of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to
be well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid which I
had penned in within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it home,
or give it some food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left it, for
indeed it could not get out, but was almost starved for Want of food. I went
and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as- I could find, and
threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did before, to lead it away; but
it was so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it, for it
followed me like a dog; and, as I continually fed it, the creature became so
loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it would never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the
30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the anniversary
of my landing on the island, having now been there two years, and no more
prospect of being delivered than the first day I came there.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life I
now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked life I led
.all the past part of my days ; my very desires altered, my afl'ections changed
their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new, from what they were at my
first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for viewing the country,
the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the woods, the
mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner, locked up with the
eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without
redemption. In the midst of the greatest composure of my mind, this would
break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring my hands and weep like
a child. Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my work, and I would
immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two
together ; and this was still worse to me, for if I could burst out into tears, or
vent myself by'words, it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted itself,
would abate. '

-But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily read the
'Word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state; and
'began to conclude in my mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was probable I should ever have
.been in any other state in the world; and with this thought I was going to
give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I know not what it was,
but something shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the
words. " How canst thou become such a hypocrite," said I, even audibly, "to
:pretend to be thankful for a condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour
:10 be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?"HIS DAILY EAIPLOYMENTS. 77'

So I stopped there, but though I could not say I thanked God for being
there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by whatever
afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for-
my wickedness, and repent. I never opened the Bible, or shut it, but my
very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend in England, without
any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and for assisting me after-
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

Thus, and" 1n this disposition of mind, I began my third year , and though
I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my
works this year as the first; yet in general it may be observed that I was
very seldom idle, but having regularly divided my time according to the
several daily employments that were before me, such as, first, my duty to
God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time
for, thrice every day ; secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, which
generally took me up three hours in every morning, when it did not rain;
thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking, what I had killed or
caught for my supply : these took up great part of the day. Also, it is to be
considered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the
violence of the heat was too great to stir out ; so that about four hours in the
evening was all the time I could be supposed to work in, with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, and' went to
work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added the exceeding
laboriousness of my work; the many hours which for want of tools, want of
help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time. For example,
I was full two and forty days in making a board for a long shelf, which I
wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, with their tools and a saw-pit,
would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day. My case was
this : it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down, because my board
was to bc a broad one. This tree I was three days in cutting down, and two
more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber.
With inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into-
chips till it began to be light enough to move; then I turned it, and made-
one side of it smooth and flat as a board from end to end; then, turning that
side downward, cut the other side till I brought the plank to be about three
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labour of
my hands' 1n such a piece of work; but labour and patience carried me through
that, and many other things. I only observe this 1n particular, to show the
6

:reason why so much of' my time went away with so little work, 22:12., that what

might be a little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour and

' :required a prodigious time to do alone, and by hand. But notwithstanding
this, with patience and labour I got through everything that my circumstances
.made necessary to me to do.

I was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop
of barley and rice. The ground I had manured and dug up for them was
.not great ; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of
half a peck, for I. had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season ; but
now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger
of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarcely possible
to keep from it; as, first, the goats, and wild creatures which I called hares,
which, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as
it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

This I saw no remedy for but by making an inclosure about it with a
hedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more,because it required
a great deal of speed, as the creatures daily spoiled my com. However, as
'my arable land was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced
in about three weeks' time; and shooting some of the creatures in the day
time, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a stake at the
gate, where he would stand and bafk all night long ; so in a little time, the
enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began
to ripen apace.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so the
birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear ; for, going along
by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls,
-of I know not how many sorts; which stood, as it were, watching till I should

' be gone. I immediately let fly among them, for I always had my gun with
me. I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I
had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.

This touched'me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would
devour all my hopes ; that I should never be able to raise a crop at all ; and

' what to do I could not tell: however, I 'resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went
.among it, to see what damage was already done, and found they had spoiled
a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too green for them, the loss was not
so great but that the remainder was likely to be a good crop, if it could be
saved.HAR VESTING. 79

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see
the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the event proved it to be so ; for as I walked off; as if I
was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, than they dropped down one by
one into the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not have patience
to stay till more came on, knowing that every grain that they eat now was, as
it might be said, a peck--loaf to me in the consequence ; but coming up to the
hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them. This was what I wished for ;
:so I took them up, and served them as we serve notorious thieves in England,
-vz'z., hanged them in chains for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine
that this should have such an effect as it had ; for the fowls would not only
'not come at the com, but forsook all that part of the island, and I could never
-.see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there. This I was
very glad of, you may be sure. and about the latter end of December, which
was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my com.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I could
do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of the broadswords, or
-cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship. However, as my
crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down ; in short, I reaped
'it my way, for I cut nothing of? but the ears, and carried it away in a great
basket which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands; and at the
end of all my harvesting, I found that out of my half-peck of seed I had near
two bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half of barley ; that is to say,
by my guess, for I had no measure at that time

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that, in
'time, it would please God to supply me with bread; and yet here I was
perplexed again, for I neither knew how-to grind, or make meal of my corn,
-or indeed, how to clean it and part it ; nor, if made into meal, how to make
'bread of it ; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to- bake it. These
things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store, and to
.secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crop, but to
preserve it all for seed against the next season, and, in the mean time, to
employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish this great work of
providing myself with corn and bread.

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It is a little
wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought much upon; 21212., the
strange multitude of little things necessary in the providing, producing, curing,
dressing, making, and finishing this one article of bread. I, that was reduced
to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily discouragement, and was
made more sensible of it every hour, even after I had got the first handful of
s'eed-com, which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a.
surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth --no spade or shovel to dig it"
Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed before,
but this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a great
many days to make it, yet for want of iron, it not only Wbl'e out soon, but
made my work the harder, and made it be performed much worse. However,
this I bore with, and was content to work it out with patience, and bear with
the badness, of the performance. When the corn was sowed, I had no harrow,
but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree
over it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than rake or harrow it.
When it was growing, and grown, I have observed already how many things
I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home, thresh
it, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves
to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it ; but
all these things I did without; and yet the com was an inestimable comfort
and advantage to me too ; but this made everything laborious and tedious to
me ; but that there was no help for; neither was my time so much loss to me,
because, as I had divided it, a certain part of it was every day appointed to
these works; and as I resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a
greater quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself wholly,
by labour. and invention, to furnish myself'with utensils proper for the per-
forming all the operations necessary for the making the corn, when I had it,.
fit for my use.

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow
above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's work at least to-
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed, and
very heavy, and required double labour to work with it; however, I went
through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground, as near
my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced' them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had set before,
which I knew it would grow ; so that, in a year's time, I knew I should have-
a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair. This work was not
so little as to take me up less than three months, because a great part of that
time was the wet season, when I could not go abroad. Within-doors, that is,
when it rained, and I could not go out, I found employment on the followingHE MAKES SOME EARTHEN VESSELS. 8!

occasions--always observing, that all the while I was at work, I diverted
myself with talking to my parrot, and teaching him to speak ; and I quickly
taught him to know his own name, and at last to speak it out pretty loud,
"Poll," which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by any
mouth but my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to my
work.

For now, as I said, I had a great employment upon my hands. I had long
studied, by some means or other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which,
indeed, I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them; however,
considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could find out any
such clay, I might botch up some such pot as might, being dried in the sun,
be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold anything
that was dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in the
preparing corn, meal, &c., which was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make
some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars, to hold what should
be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how many
awkward ways I took to raise this paste, what odd, misshapen ugly things I
made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being
stifl'enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent
heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell to pieces with
only removing, as well before as after they were dried ; and, in a word, how,
after having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it,' to bring it
home, and work it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly things, I'
cannot call them jars, in about two months' labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them very
gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, which I had
made on purpose for them, that they might not break ; and as between the
pot and the basket there was a little room to spare. I stuffed it full of the rice
and barley straw ; and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought
would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made
several smaller things with better success ; such as little round pots, flat
dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and anything my hand turned to; and the heat
of the sun baked them strangely hard. But all this would not answer my
end, which was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the
firc--which none of these could do. It happened after some time, making a
pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after I had

7
done with it, I found a broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the
fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to
see it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if
they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some pots.
I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing them with
lead, though I had some lead to do it with ; but I placed three large pipkins,
and two or three pots, in a pile, one upon another, and placed my firewood all
round it with a great heap of embers under them. I plied the fire with fresh
fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red.
hot quite through, and observed that they did not crack at all: when I saw
them clear red, I let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I
found one of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand
which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat, and would
have run into-glass if I had gone on ; so I slacked my fire gradually till the
pots began to abate of the red colour; and, watching them all night, that I
might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I
will not say handsome, pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as
could'be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with the running of the
sand After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of
earthenware for my use; but as to the shapes of them, they were very
indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of making them but
.as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would make pics that never
learned to raise paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I
found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire ; and I had hardly
patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one on the fire again, with
some water in it to boil me some meat, which it did admirably well; and
with a piece of a kid,I made some very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal,
and several other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would have
had it.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn
in ; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving at that perfection of
art with one pair of hands. To supply this want, I was at a great loss ; for,
of all the trades in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter,
as for any whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent
many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit
for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what was in the solid rock,An klaud Kiln.DIFFICULYIES IN THE WAY OF BREAD--MAKING. 83

and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the
island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which
neither would bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn
without filling it with sand ; so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for
.a stone,I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood,
which I found indeed much easier; and getting one as big as I had strength
to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my aim and hatchet,
and then, with the help of fire and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it,
.as the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After this, I made a great heavy
pestle, or heater, of the wood called the iron wood ; and this I prepared and
laid by, against I had my next crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to
grind, or rather pound, my corn or meal, to make my bread.

My next difliculty was to make a sieve, or searce. to dress my meal, and
part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see it possible
I could have any bread. This was a most difi'icult thing to think on, {or to
'be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to make it with; I mean no
fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through. And here I was at a full
'stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do; linen I had none
left, but what was mere rags ; I had goat's-hair, but neithefiknew how to
weave it or spin it ; and had I known how, here were no tools to work it with.
All the remedy that I found for this was, that at last I did remember I had,
among the seamen's clothes which were saved out of the ship, some neck-
cloths of calico or muslin ; and with some pieces of these I made three small
sieves proper enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for some years;
how I did afterwards, I shall show in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should
make bread when I came to have corn ; for, first, I had no yeast. As
to that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself
much about it. But for an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I
'found out an experiment for that also, which was this : I made some earthen
vessels very broad, but not deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter, and
not above nine inches deep; theseI burned in the fire, as I had done the
others, and laid them by: and when I wanted to bake, I made a great fire
upon the hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles, of my own baking
and burning also ; but I should not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into embers, or live coals, I
drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there I
let them lie till the hearth was very hot ; then, sweeping away all the embers
I set down my loaf or loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot upen.
them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in and add
to the heat; and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my'
barley-loaves, and became, in little time, a good pastry-cook into the bargain ;
for I made myself several cakes and puddings of the rice; indeed I made no,
pics, neither had I anything to put into them, supposing I had, except the
flesh either of {owls or goats.

It need' not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of the
third year of my abode here ; for, it is to be observed, that in the intervals of'
these things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage; for I reaped
my corn in its season, and carried it home, as well as I could, and laid it up
in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out, for I had no floor
to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. _

And now, indeed, my stock of corn inEreasing, I really wanted to build my'
barns bigger; Iwanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of the corn
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty bushels, and'
of the rice as much or more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use it
freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great while; also I resoliIed to see-
what quantity would be suflficient for me a whole year, and to sow but once a
year. Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were-
much more than I' could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a quantity'
Would fully 'provide me with bread, &c.

i All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran;
many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other side-
of the island ; and I was not without secret wishes that I was on shore there.
fancying that, seeing the main-land, and an inhabited country, I might find
some way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps find some means'
of escape.

' But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such a condition,.
and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I might
have 'reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers of Africa. That if I'
once came into their power, I should run a hazard more than a thousand to-
one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the
people of the Carribbean Coasts were Cannibals, or Man-eaters ; and I knew
by the latitude that I could not be far off from that shore. That suppose
they were not Cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as many Europeans who
had fallen into their hands had been served, even when they had been ten cr'HE TR I'S T0 RIGHT THE SHIP'S BOAT. 85

twenty together ; much more I that was but one, and could make little or no
defence. All these things,I say, whichI ought to have considered well of,
.and did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my appre-
rsions at first; but my head ran mightily upon the thought of getting over to
'the shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with the shoulder--of-
mutton sail, with which I sailed over a thousand miles on the coast of Africa;
but this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look at our ship's boat,
which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
'when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she did at first, but not
quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the winds, almost bottom
upwards against the high ridge of a beachy, rough sand, but no w'ater about
her as before. If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to have launched
"her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might have
:gone back into the Brazils with her easy enough; but I might have easily
foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright upon her bottom,
than I could remove the island ; however I went to the woods, and cut levers
-and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do ;
suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her down, I might easily repair
the damage she had received, and she would be a 'very good boat, and I might
;go to sea in her very easily.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I think,
three or four weeks about it; at last, finding it impossible to heave it up with
my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to undermine it, and so
to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in
the fall. But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to
get under it, much less to move it forwards towards the water; so I was
forced to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my
desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than decreased, as the
:means for it seemed impossible.

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was possible to make
myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates make, even
without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk of a great tree.
'This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely
'with my thoughts of making it. and with my having much more convenience
for it than any of the Negroes or Indians ; but not at all considering the
particular inconveniences which I lay under more than the Indians did, wish,
want of hands to move it, when it was made, into the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did, who.
had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but that the
difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I put a stop
to my inquiries into it, by this foolish answer which I gave myself : " Let me
first make it ; I warrant I will find some way or other to get it along when it
is done." '

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy
prevailed, and to work I went and felled a cedar tree; I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple of
Jerusalem ; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next the
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet;
after which it lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. It was
not without infinite labour that I felled this tree ; I was twenty days hacking
and hewing it at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches and
limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed
through with my axe and hatchet, with inexpressible labour; after this it cost
me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the
bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost me
near three months more to clear the inside, and work it out so as to make an
exact boat of it; this I did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel,
and by the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome
periagua, and big enough to have carried six and twenty men,and consequently-
big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted with it;
the boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua that.
was made of one tree, in my life ; many a weary stroke it had cost, you may
be sure, and had I gotten it into the water, I make no question but .I.
should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed,
that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me ; though they cost me
infinite labour too; it lay about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the creek.
Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of
the earth, and so make a declivity: this I began, and it cost me a prodigious
deal of pains, but who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view ?
'But when this was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was still
much at one, for I could no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat."1 FINISHED A'IY FOURTH YEAR IN THIS PLACE." 87

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal,
to bring the water up to thecanoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down
to the water. Well, I began this work, and when I-began to enter into it,
and calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be
thrown out, I found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but my
own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I should have gone through
with it; for the shore lay high; so that at the upper end it must have been
at least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with great reluctance, I gave
this attempt over also. '

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of be-
ginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and kept
my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as ever
before ; for, by a constant study and serious application to the Word of God,
and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different knowledge from what
I had before ; I entertained different notions of things.

The nature and experience of things dictated to me upon just reflection,
that all the good things of this world are no farther good to us, than they are
for our use; and that whatever we may heap up indeed to give others, we
enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous griping
miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if he
had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do-
with. I had no room for desire, except it was of things which I had not, and-
they were but trifles, though indeed of great use to me. I had a parcel of
money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling. Alas! there
the nasty, sorry, useless stufi' lay; I had no manner of business for it ; and I
often thought within myself, that I would have given a handful of it for a
gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind my corn; nay,I would
have given it all for sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England,
or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink. As it was, I had not
the least advantage by it, or benefit from it ; but there it lay in a drawer, and
grew mouldy with the damp of the cave, in the wet season ; and if I had had
the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same case; and they had been
of no manner of value to me, because of no use.

At the same time, I learned to look more upon the bright side of my con-
dition, and less upon the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather
than what I wanted; and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that
I cannot express them; and which I take notice of here to put those dis-
contented people in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has
given them, because they see and covet something that He has not given
them. All our discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring
from the want of thankfulness for what we have.

I had now been here so long, that many things which I had brought on
shore for my help were either quite gone,'or very much wasted and near
spent. My- ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little,
which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so pale, it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper ; as long as it lasted I made use
of it, to minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened to me ; and first, by casting up times past, I remembered that there
was a strange concurrence of days in the various providences which befell me,
and which, if I had ,been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or
fortunate, I might have had reason to have llooked upon with a great deal of
curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away from my father

and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day after-
wards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave. The same
day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of the ship in Yarmouth
Roads, that same day a year afterwards,I made my escape from Sallee. The
same day of. the year I was born.on, viz, the 30th of September, that same
day I had my life so miraculously saved twenty-six years after, when I was
cast on shore in this island, so that my wicked life and my solitary life began
both on a day.
' The next thing to my ink's being wasted was that of. my bread--I mean
the biscuit which I had brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to the
last degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day for above a year;
and yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got any com of
my own.

My. clothes, too, began to decay mightily; as to linen I had none a good
while, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests of the other
seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times I could bear no
other clothes on but a shirt ; and it was a very great help to me that I had,
among all the men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. There
were also several thick watch-coats of the seamen which were left indeed, but

~ they were too hot to wear; and though it is true that the weather was so

violently hot that there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quiteMAKES CLOTHES 0F SKINS. 89

naked--no, though I had been inclined to it, which I was not ;--nor could I
abide the thought of it, though I was all alone. The reason why I could not
:go naked was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked
as with some clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin;
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and whistling under
the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it; no more could I ever bring
myself to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat; the heat of
the sun, beating with such violence as it does in that place, would give me
the headache presently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or
a hat on, so that I could not bear it ; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would
presently go away.

Upon these views, I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,
which I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoasts I
had, and my business was now to try if I could not make jackets out of the
great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such other materials as I had ;
so I set to work, a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a-botching, for I made most
piteous work of it. However, I made shift to make two or three new waist-'
coats, which I hoped wohld serve me a great while; as for breeches or
drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I had
killed, I mean {our-footed ones, and I had them hung up, stretched out, with
sticks in the sun ; by which means some of them were so dry and hard that
they were fit for little, but others, it seems, were very useful. The first thing
I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside, to
shoot off the rain ; and this I performed so well, that after this I made me a
suit of clothes wholly of these skins ; that is to say, a waistcoat, and breeches
open at the knees, and both loose, for they were rather wanted to keep me
cool, than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge that they were
wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor ;
however, they were such as I made very good shift with, and when I was
abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat and cap being outer-- '
most, I was kept very dry.

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella ; I
was indeed in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one. I had
.seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the great heats,
and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being nearer the
equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
.thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of pains at it,
and was a great while before I could make anything likely to hold: nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one
to my mind ; but at last I made one that answered indifi'erently well; the
main difficulty I found was to make it let down. I could make it to spread ;
but if it did not let down too, and draw in, it would not be portable for me:
any way but just over my head, which would not do. However, at last, as I
said, I made one to answer; I covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that
it cast off the rain like a pent-house, and kept of? the sun so effectually, that.
I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I
could before in the coolest; and when I had no need of it, could close it, and.
carry it under my arm.

I cannot say that, after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing happened.
to me. I lived on in the same course as before; the chief things I was
employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and
curing my raisins, of both which I always kept up just enough to have-
sufficient stock of one year's provisions beforehand ; I say, besides this yearly
labour, and my daily labour of going out with my gun, I had to make a.
canoe. which at last I finished: 50, that, by digging a c'anal to it of six feet.
wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a mile. As
for the first, which wasso vastly big, as I made it without considering before-
hand, as I ought to have done, how I should be able to launch it, so, never
being able to bring it into the water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to
let it lie where it was as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time '.
indeed, the next time, though I could not get a tree proper for it, and was
in a place where I could not get the water to it at any less distance than, as.
I have said, near half a. mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last, I never
gave it over ; and though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged'
my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last. '

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was not
at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the first;
I mean of venturing over to the term fgmza, where it was above forty miles
broad ; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it : but as I had a boat, my next design
was to make a cruise round the island ; for as I had been on the other side in
one place, crossing, as I have already described it, over the land, so the
discoveries I made in that little journey made me very eager to see other
parts of_ the coast ; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing
round the island.SETS OUT ON A VOYAGE ROUND THE ISLAND. 91'

For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and considera--
tion, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail to it out of some of"
the pieces of the ship's sail which lay in store, and of which I had a great
stock by me. Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found
she would sail very well ; then I made little lockers, or boxes, at either end of'
my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, &c., into, to be kept
dry, either from rain or the spray of the sea ; and a little, long, hollow place
I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to'
hang down over it, to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stem, like a mast, to stand over
my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I
every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never went far out
nor far from the little creek; but, at last, being eager to view the circum-
ference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accordingly I
victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of loaves (cakes I
should rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot full of parched rice
(a food I ate a great deal of), a little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
and shot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I
mentioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I took, one'
to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign. or my captivity,.
that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected ;
for though the island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east:
side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues into the-
sea, some above water, some under it ; and beyond, a shoal of sand, lying dry
half a league more, so that Iwas obliged to go a great way out to sea to-
doublc the point.

When first I discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise, and
come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea :.
and, above all, doubting how I should get back again: so I came to an.
anchor ; for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken.
grappling which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a.
hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent of it
and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill, I perceived a strong and most furious
current, which ran to the east, and even came close to the point ; I took the,-
more notice of it, because I saw there might be some danger, that when I.

p' .

'92 ROBINSON CR USOE.

came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and not be
able to make the island again: and, indeed, had I not got first up upon this
hill, I believe it would have been so ; for there was the same current on the
other side the island, only that it set of? at a farther distance, and I- saw there
was a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out of
the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at
ESE, and that being just contrary to the said current, made a great breach
of the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe for me to keep too close to
the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of the stream.

The third day; in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the sea
'was' calm, and I ventured : but I am a warning to all rash and ignorant
Pilots ; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my boat's
length from' the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a
current like the sluice of a mill: it carried my boat along with it with such
violence that all I could do could not keep her so much as on the edge of it;
but I found it hurxied me farther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
my left hand. There was no wind stirring to help me, and all I could do
with my paddles signified nothing: and now I began to give myself over for
lost; for as the current was on both sides of the island, I knew in a few
Jeagues' distance they must join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone;
nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it ; so that I had no prospect before
me but of perishing, not by the sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving
from hunger. I had, indeed, found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I
could lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh
water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots; but what was all this to being
driven [into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no main
land or island, for a thousand leagues at least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even
the most miserable condition of mankind worse. Now I looked back upon
my desolate, solitary island, as the most pleasant place in the world, and all
the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again. I stretched
out my hands to it, with eager wishes: "0 happy desert! " said I, "I shall
never see thee more. 0 miserable creaturelwhither am I going!" Then I
reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and that I had repined at my
solitary condition ; and now what would I give to be on shore there again !
T hus, we never see the true state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by
' .its contraries, not know how to value what- we enjoy, but by the want of it.ATSEA WITHOUTA COMPASS. 93

It is scarcely possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being driven

from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide-
ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it'
again. However, I worked hard till indeed my strength was almost exhausted,
and kept my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards the side of the-
current which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could ; when about noon as the
sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,_
springing up from 5.513. This cheered my heart a little, and especially-
when, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this.
time, I had got at a frightful distance from the island, and had the least

cloudy or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way too; for-
I had no compass on board, and should never have known how to have steered

towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather con-

tinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my sail,

standing away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away, I
saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current was.
near ; for where the current was so strong the water was foul ; but perceiving
the water clear, I found the current abate, and presently I found to the east; .
at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks: these rocks I found
caused the current to part again, and as the main stress of it ran away more
southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other returned by the-
repulse of the rocks, and made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the-
north-west, with a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the
ladder. or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who have:
been in such like .extremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy was,
and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy, and the wind also.
freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before the
wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot. This eddy carried me about-
a league in my way back again directly towards the island. but about two
leagues more to the northward than the current which carried me away at-
first ; so that when I came near the island, I found myself open to the-
northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the island, opposite to
that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way by the help of '
this current or eddy,I found it was spent, and served me no farther. However"
I found that being between two great currents. viz, that on the south side.
which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay about a league
-on the other side ; I say, between these two, in the wake of the island, I found
the water at least still, and running no way ; and having still a breeze of wind
fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the island, though not making such
fresh way as I did before. _

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within a league of the island
'I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster, stretching out
as is described before, to the southward, and casting off the current more
southerly, had of course made another eddy t6 the north, and this I found
~very strong, but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was due
'w'est, but almost full north. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across
this ed_dy, slanting north-west; and in about an hour came within about a
mile of the shore, where it being smooth water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore,I fell on my knees, and gave God thanks for my
deliveranceyand refreshing myself with such things as I had,-I brought my
'boat close to the shore; in a little cove that I had spied under some trees, and
'laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage; .

I was now at a great'loss which way to get home with my boat: I had run
:90 much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting it by
'the way I went out ; and what might be at the other side (I mean the west
.side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures: so I only
resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the shore, and to
see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to
have her again, if I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabout, coasting
the' shore, I came to a very good inlet or, bay about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very
convenient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a
little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my
boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been before,
when I travelled on foot to that shore ; so taking nothing out of my boat but
-my gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot,I began my march. The
way was' comfortable enough after such a, voyage as I had been upon, and I
reached my old bower in the evening, where I found everything standing as I
left it; for I always kept it in good order, it being, as I said before, my country-
house. I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs,
for I was very weary, and fell asleep ; but judge you, if you can, that read myCRUSOE AND HIS PARROT. 95

story, what a surprise I must be in when I was awaked out of my sleep by a
'voice, calling me by my name several times, " Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe :
poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe ? Where are you ?
'Where have you been?" I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling as it is called, the first part of the day, and with walking
the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly; but dozing between sleeping
and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but as the voice
continued to repeat, " Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe," at last I began to wake
more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started up in the
utmost consternation ; but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll
sitting on the top of the hedge; and immediately knew that it was he that
spoke to me ; for just in such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him,
.and teach him ; and he had learned it so perfectly that he would sit upon my
finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe !
Where are you ? Where have you been P I-Iow came you here P " and such
things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could
'be nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself. First, I
'was amazed how the creature got thither; and then, how he should just keep
about the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well satisfied it_ could be
nobody but honest Poll, I got over it ; and holding out my hand, and calling
him by his name, " Poll," the sociable creature came to me, and sat upon my
'thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me, " Poor Robin Crusoe!
and how did I come here? and where had I been ?" just as if he had been
'overjoyed to see me again ; and so I carried him home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough
'to do for many days to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I
would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of the
island ; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about ; so I contented
myself to be without any boat, though it had been the product of so many
months' labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea. In
'this government of my temper, I remained near a year, and lived a very
.sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being very
much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning myself
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really very happily in all
things, except that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my
:necessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I should, upon
occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering how few-
tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware, and.
contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
easier and better;because I made things round and shapeable which before-
were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain of'
my own performance, or more joyful for anything I found out, than for my'
being able to make a tobacco-pipe. And though it was a very ugly, clumsy
thing when it was done, and only burned red, like other earthenware, yet as it:
was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted
with it;for I had been always used to smoke; and there were pipes in the-
ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing that there was tobacco in the-
island ; and afterwards, when I searched the ship again, I could not come at
any pipes at all.

In my wicker-ware, also, I improved much, and made abundance of necessary
baskets, as well as my invention showed me ; though not very handsome. yet
they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things up in, or
fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could hang"
it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and. cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a
basket; and the like by a turtle, I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a
piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in a.
basket, and leave the rest behind me. Also, large deep baskets were the
receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon as it 'was dry, and
cured, and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably, and this was a,
want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider what I must do when I should have no more powder ; that is to say,
how I should kill any goats. I had, as is observed in the third year of my
being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was in hopes of'
getting a he-goat: but I could not by any means bring it to pass, till my kid
grew,an old goat ; and I could never find in my heart to kill her, till she died
at last of mere age.

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have said,
my ammunition growing low,I set myself to study some art to trap and snare-
the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and par-
ticularly, I wanted a she-goat and her young. To this purpose I made snares-
to hamper them ; and I do believe they were more than once taken in them,'
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always found themI CATCH SOME GOATS. 97

broken, and my bait devoured. At length, I resolved to try a pitfall, so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats used
to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles of my own making too, with a
great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears of barley and dry rice,
without setting the trap, and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone
in and eaten up the corn, for I could see the marks of their feet. At length,
I set three traps in one night, and going the next morning, I found them all
standing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging;
however, I altered my traps, and, not to trouble you with particulars, going
one morning to see my traps, I found in one of them a large old he--goat, and
in one of the others, three kids, a male and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce, I
durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to say, to bring him away alive,
which was what I wanted. I could have killed him, but that was not my
business, nor would it answer my end. So I even let him out, and he ran
away as if he had been frighted out of his wits: but I had forgot then what I
learned afterwards, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had let him stay there
three or four days without food, and then have carried him some water to
drink, and then a little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids,
for they are mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time: then I
went to the three kids, and, taking them one by one, I tied them with strings
together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.

- It was a good while before they would feed, but throwing them some sweet
corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame: and now I found that if I
expected to supply myself with goats' flesh, when I had no powder or shot
left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when, perhaps, I might have
them about my house like a flock of sheep. But then it occurred to me
that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild
when they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some inclosed
piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep them in so
effectually, that those within might not break out, or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet, as I saw there
was an absolute necessity for doing._it, my first work was to 'find out a proper
piece of ground, 12127., where there was likely to be herbage for them to eat,
water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such inclosures will think I had very little con-

trivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these, being a plain
8
open piece of meadow land, or savannah (as our people call it in the western
colonies) which had two or three rills of fresh water in it, and at one end was
very woody: Isay, they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell them I
began'by inclosing this piece of ground in such a manner, that ,my hedge or
pale must have been at least .two miles about. Nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass, for it was ten miles about, I was like to have time
enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in
so much compass as if they had had the whole island, and then I should- have
so much room to chase them in that I should never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when this
thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and for the first
beginning, I resolved to inclose a piece of about 150 yards in length, and 100
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as many as I should have in any
reasonable time, so, as my flock increased,I could add more ground to my
inclosur'e.

This'was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage. I
' was about three months hedging in the first piece, and, till I had done it, I
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to feed as near
me as possible to make them familiar; and very often I would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand ;
so that, after my inclosure was finished, and I let them loose, they would
follow me up and down, bleating after me for a handful of com.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of
about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years more I had three-and-forty,
besides several that I took and killed for my food. After that, I inclosed five
- several pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into,
to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one piece of ground into another.

But this was not all : for now I not only had goat's flesh to feed on when I
pleased, but milk too, a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I did not so
much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,- was really an
agreeable surprise. For now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of food to every
creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it ; so I, that had never
milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or cheese made, very readily
and handily, though after a great many essays and miscarriages, made both
butter and cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards. How mercifully
can our Creator treat His creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can He sweeten the bit-
terest providences, and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons and prisons !
What a table was here spread for me in the wilderness, where I saw nothing
at first but to perish for hunger!

It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little family sit
-down to dinner; there was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
fisland ; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command. I could
hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all my
subjects. Then, to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended by my
-servants ; Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the only person permitted
to talk to me. My dog, who was now grown old and crazy, sat always at my
right hand ; and two cats, one on one side of the table, and one on the other,
expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of especial favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for they
'were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by my
'own hand ; but these were two which I had preserved tame ; whereas the rest
'ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last, for they
would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I was
obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they left me.
With this attendance, and in this plentiful manner I lived ; neither could I be
-said to want anything but society; and of that, some time after this, I was
'like to have too much. '

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my boat,
'though very 10th to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimesI sat
'contriving ways to get her about the island, and at other times I sat myself
-down contented enough without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down to the point of the island, where, as I have said, in my last
'ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set,
that I might see what I had to do : this inclination increased upon me every
day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by land, following the edge of
'the shore. I did so ; but had any one in England met such a man as I was,
'it must either have frighted him, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as I
'frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of
my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such a dress.
Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows :--

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a flap hanging
down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain off from
cunning into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these climates as the rain
mpon the flesh under the clothes. I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the
skirts coming down to about the middle of my thighs, and a pair of open-
kneed breeches of the same; the breeches were made of the skin of an old
he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side, that, like pan-
taloons, it reached to the'middle of my legs ; stockings and shoes I had none,
but had made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call them, like-
buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spatter-dashes ; but'
of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

' I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I drew together with two-
thongs of the same, instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog on either side
of this. Instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and a hatchet, one'
on one side, one on the other. I had another belt not so broad, and fastened
in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder, and at the end of it, under
my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's skin too, in one of which
hung my powder, in the other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, on-
my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy, ugly, goat's-skin
umbrella, but which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me
next to my gun ; as for my face, the colour of it, was really not so mulatto-
like as one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living--withim
nineteen degrees of the equinox. My beard I had once suffered to grow till
it was about a quarter of a yard long ; but as I had both scissors and razors.
sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip, which
I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had seen
worn by some Turks at Sallee, for the Moors did not wear such, though the-
Turks did ; of these moustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long-
enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape
monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed for frightful.

But all this is by the bye ; for, as to my figure, I had so few to observe me,'
that it was no manner of consequence. In this kind of figure I went my new
journey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore,.
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon
the rocks; and having no boat now to take care of, I went over the land a
nearer way to the same height that I was upon before ; when, looking
forward to the points of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to-
double with my boat, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet, no
rippling, no motion, no current, any more there than in any other places. I
was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some time in
the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned it ;
but I was Dresently convinced how it was, via, that the tide of ebb settingFull Dress.IVY PLANTATIONS AND DWELLINGS. 10!

from the west, and joining with the current of waters from some great river
-on the shore, must be the occasion of this current, and that, according as the
wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north, this current came
near or went farther from the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I
went up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw
the current again as before, only that it ran farther off, being near half a
league from the shore ; whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and
hurried me and my canoe along with it, which at another time it would not
have done.

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe the
ebbing and flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about
'the island again; but when I began to think of putting it in practice, I had
.such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in,
'that I could not think of it again with any patience, but, on the contrary, I
took up another resolution, which was more safe, though more laborious--and
this was, that I would build, or rather make, me another periagua or canoe,
and so have one for one side of the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations in
the island; one my little fortification or tent, with the wall about it, under
'the rock,- with the cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into
several apartments, or caves, one within another. One of these, which was
the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall or fortification,
that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up
with the large earthern pots, of which I have given an account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels each,
where I laid up my stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the ear,
>>cut ofi' short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my hand. As for
my wall, made as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles grew all like
trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so very much, that
there was not the least appearance, to any one's view, of any habitation
:behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and upon
lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its season ; and when-
ever I had occasion for more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat. and I had now a tolerable plantation

here also; for, first,I had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept in
tepair ; that is to say, I kept the hedge, which encircled it in, constantly fitted
up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in the inside; I kept the
trees, which at first were no more than stakes, but were now grown very firm
and tall, always cut, so that they might spread and grow thick and wild, and
make the more agreeable shade, which they did efi'ectually to my mind. In
the' middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail
spread over poles, set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair
or renewing ; and under this I had made me a squab or couch, with the skins
of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on
them, such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved ; and a great
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent.
from my seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this, I had my inclosures for my cattle, that is to say, my
goats ; and as I had taken' an inconceivable-deal of pains to fence and inclose:
this ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the goats should'
break through, that I never left of? till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the-
outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that
it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put a hand!
through between them, which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all.
did in the next rainy season, made the inclosure strong like a wall, indeed'
stronger than any wall. This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that:
I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my com>>
fortable support. . -

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally depended!
on for my winter stOre of raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet; and indeed!
they were not agreeable only, but medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and.
refreshing to the last degree. .

As this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the place
where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all things about, or
belonging to her, in very good order; sometimes I went out in her to divert

_ myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, scarcely ever above a.
stone's cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out
of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any other accident. But

a now I'come to a new scene of my life.

It happened one day, about noon,going towards my boat, I was exceedingly

. surprised with the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very

plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I hacl
seen an apparition ; I listened, I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor
see anything; I went up to a rising ground, to look farther; I went up the
shore, and down the shore, but it was all one, I could see no other impression
but that one. I went to it again to see if there were any more, and to observe
if it might not be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for there was
exactly the print of a foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot; how it came
thither I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine. But after innumerable
fluttering thoughts, like a man perfectly confused and out of myself, I came
home to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but
terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps,
mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying- every stump at a distance to be
a man; nor is it possible to describe how many various shapes afi'righted
imagination represented things to me in; how many wild ideas were found
every moment in my fancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimseys came
into my thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), I fled into
it like one pursued ; whether I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, or
went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called a door,I cannot remember;
no, nor could I remember the next morning; for never frightened hare fled to
cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat.

I slept none that night ; the farther I was from the occasion of my fright,
the greater my apprehensions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of all creatures in
fear ; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that
I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was now
a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and reason
joined in with me in this supposition; for how should any other thing in
human shape come into the place? Where was the vessel that brought them?
What marks were there of any other footstep? And how was it possible a
man should come there? But then, to think that Satan should take human
shape upon him in such a place, where there could be no manner of occasion
for it, but to leave the print of his foot behind him, and that even for no
purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it ; this was an amusement
the other way ; I considered that the devil might have found out abundance .
of other ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a foot. That
as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he would never have been so
simple as to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether
I should ever see it or not. and in the sand, too, which the first surge of the
sea, upon a high wind, would have defaced entirely: all this seemed incon-
sistent with the thing itself, and with all the notions we usually entertain of
the subtilty of the devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all appre-
hensions of its being the devil ; and I pi'esentlyeoncluded then, that it must
be some more dangerous creature; that it must be some of the savages of the
main land over against me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and
either driven by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the island ; and
had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being as 10th, perhaps.
to have stayed in this desolate island, as I would have been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thankful in my
thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that
they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded that some
inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me.
Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having found out
my boat, and that there were people here ; and that, if so, I should certainly
have them come again in greater numbers, and devour me ; that if it should
happen that they should not find me, yet they would find my inclosure,
destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I should
'perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence in
God, which was founded upon such wonderful~experience as I had had of His
goodness ; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not preserve,
by His power, the provision which He had made for me by His goodness. I
reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any more com one
year than would just serve me till the next season, as if no accident could
intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon the ground; and
this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the future to have two or
three years' corn beforehand; so that, whatever might come, I might not
perish for want of bread.

One.morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my
danger from the appearances of savages, I found it discomposed me very
much; upon which these words of the Scripture came into my thoughts:
" Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me." Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not
only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray earnestly to God
for deliverance : when I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening
_it to read, the first words presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord. and be
of good cheer, and He shall strengthen thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord."
It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me. In answer, I thankfully
laid down the book, and was no more sad.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it came
into my thoughts one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of my own,
and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I came on shore
from my boat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to persuade myself
it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my own foot; and why
might I not come that way from the boat, as well as I was going that way to
the boat P

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again; for I had not
stirred out of my castle for three days and nights; so that I began to starve
for provision ; {or I had little or nothing within doors but some barley-cakes
.and water. Then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked too, which
usually was my evening diversion ; and the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of it ; and, indeed, it almost spoiled some of them,
and almost dried up their milk. Heartening myself, therefore, with the belief
that this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet, and that I might
be truly said to start at my own shadow, I began to go abroad again, and
went to my country house to milk my flock ; but to see with what fear I went
forward, how often I looked behind me, how I was ready, every now and then,
to lay down my basket, and run for my life, it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most
terribly frightened; and so, indeed, I had.

However, I went down thus two or three days, and having seen nothing, I
began to be a little bolder, and to think there was really nothing in it but my
own imagination ; but I could not persuade myself fully of this till I should
go down to the shore again, and see this print of a. foot, and measure it by
.my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured
it was my own foot : but when I came to the plaee, first, it appeared evidently
'to me, that when I laid up my boat,I could not possibly be on shore any-
where thereabout. Secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own
foot,I found my foot not so large by a great deal ; both these things filled my
head with new imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the highest
degree, so that I shook with cold like one in an ague ; and I went home again.
'filled with the belief that some man or men had been on shore there ; or, in
:shdrt, that the island was inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was
aware; and what course to take for my security I knew not.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the morning
I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been,'as it were,
_ tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much better
composed than I had ever been before; and now I began to think 'sedately;
and, upon 'the utmost debate with myself, I concluded that this island (which
was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main land than
as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might imagine; that
although there were no stated inhabitants who'lived on the spot, yet that
there might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who, either with design,
or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might come to
this place. That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with
the least shadow or'figure of any people yet; and that, if at any time they
should be driven here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever
they could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix here upon any occasion to-
this time. That the most I could suggest any danger from was, from any
casual accidental landing of straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their wills ; so they made
no stay here, but went off again with all possible speed, seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of the tides and daylight
back again ; and that, therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some
safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon the spot. '
Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to bring
a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond 'where my
. fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering this, therefore, I
resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a
distance from my wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees about
twelve years before, of which I made mention : these trees having been planted
- so thick before, they wanted but few piles to be driven between them, that
they might be thicker and stronger, and my Wall would be soon finished. 50
that I had now~a dou'ble wall ; and my outer wall was thickened with pieces
of timber, old cables, and everything I could think of, to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at. In
the inside of this,I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, with continually
bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and
walking upon it ; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the
muskets,of which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship ;
these I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them
like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes' time;THE OUTER PVALL C 0MPLE TED. 107'

this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never thought
myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great
ength every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which I
found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that I believe
I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space
between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and
they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to approach.
my outer wall.

Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove, and in five or six years' time-
I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and strong'
that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no men, of what kind soever,.
could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a habitation.
As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out (for I left no'
avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was.
low, and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that; so-
when the two ladders were taken down, no man living could come down to:
me without doing himself mischief, and if they had come down, they were'
still on the outside of my outer wall. Thus I took all the measures humam
prudence could suggest for my own preservation; and it will be seen, at
length, that they were not altogether without just reason ; though I foresaw
nothing at that time more than my mere fear suggested to me.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other afi'airs ; for
I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were not
only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be sufficient for'
me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also without the fatigue of
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loth to lose the advantage of them,
and to have them all to nurse up over again.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the
island ; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart
could wish for ; it was a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once
before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the
island. Here I found a clear 'piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded
with woods that it was almost an inclosure by nature; at least, it did not want
near so much labour to make it so, as the other piece of ground I had worked
so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground ; and, in less than a.
month's time, I had so fenced it round, that my flock, or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed to
he, were well enough secured in it. So, without any further delay, I removed
'ten young she-goats, and two he-goats, to this piece; and, when they were
"there, I continued to perfect the fence, till I had made it as secure as the
other, which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by
a great deal.

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my apprehension on
:account of the print of a man's foot which I had seen ; for, as yet, I never saw
.any human creature come near the island, and I had now lived two years under
these uneasinesses, which, indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it
"was before ; as may be well imagined by any who may know what it is to live

'in the constant snare of the fear of man.
' After I had thus secured one part of my little living stock, I went about
the whole island, searching for another private place to make such another
deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of the island than I had
-ever done yet, and" looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at
a great distance; I had found a perspective glass or two in one of the sea-
'men's chest, which I saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me; and
this was so remote that I could not tell what to make of it, though I looked
at it till my eyes were not able to hold to look any longer : whether it was a
boat or not, I do not know, but as I descended from the hill I could see no
more of it, so I gave it over; onlyI resolved to go no more out without a
perspective glass in my pocket. When I was come down the hill to the end
of the island, where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced
that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange thing in the
'island as I imagined; and, but that it was a special providence that I was cast
upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should easily have
known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from the main,
'when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that side
-of the 'island for harbour: likewise, as they often met and fought in their
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners. would bring them over to this
- .shore, where, according to their dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they
would kill and eat them ; of which hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the
'S.W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind, at seeing the shore spread

' with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and particularly,SIGNS OF CANNIBALISM 109

I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the
earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage wretches had sat down to
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no-
notions of any danger to myself from it {or a long while : all my apprehensions
were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and
the horror of the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard of"
it often, yet I never had so near a view of before : in short, I turned away my
face from the horrid spectacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at the>>
point of fainting, when nature discharged the disorder from my stomach ; and
having vomited with uncommon violence, I was a little relieved, but could not
bear to stay in the place a moment ; so I got me up the hill again with all the-
speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood still awhile, as.
amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost afi'ection'of'
my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast
my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished from such dread-
ful creatures as these.

In this frame of thankfulness, I went home to my castle, and began to be
much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was before:
{or I observed that these wretches never came to this island in search of what
they could get ; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, anything
here; and having often, no doubt, been up to the covered, woody part of it,_
without finding anything to their purpose. I knew I had been here now
almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human creature
there before ; and I might be eighteen years more as entirely concealed as I
was now, if I did not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of'
occasion to do ; it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed
where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make
myself known to. Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman custom of their
devouring and eating one another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and
kept close within my own circle, for almost two years after this. When I say
my own circle, I mean by it my three plantations, 11212., my castle, my country-
seat, which I called my bower, and my inclosure in the woods: nor did I look
after this for any other use than as an inclosure for my goats ; for the aversion
which nature gave me to these hellish \vretches was such, that I was as fearful
of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. I did not so much as go to look
after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of making another ; for
I could not think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat
round the island to me, lest I should meet with some of these creatures at sea;
in which case, if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what
would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of being
discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about them ; and
I began- to live just in the same composed manner as before, only with this
difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I
-did before lest I should happen to be seen by any of them ; and I was more
cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them, being on the island, should happen
'to hear it; it was, therefore, a good providence to me that I had furnished
myself with a tame breed of goats, and that I needed not to hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch any of them after this,
It was by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two years after
this, I believe I never fired my gun off once, though I never went out without
it; and as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried them out
with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt; I also
furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made
me a belt to hang it on also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to
Iook at when I went abroad, if you add to the former description of myself,
the particular of two pistols, and a great broadsword hanging at my side in a
belt, but without a scabbard.

As in my present condition there were not really many things which I
wanted, so, indeed, I'thought that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation, had taken
off the edge of my invention for my own conveniences ; and I had dropped a

. 'good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and that was to try if
I could not make some of my barley into malt, and then to try and brew my-
self some beer. This was really a whimsical thought, and I reproved myself
often for the simplicity of it: for I presently saw there would be the want of
several things necessary to the making my beer, that it would be impossible
for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that, as
I have observed already, I could never compass: no, though I spent not only
many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to no purpose. In
'the next place, I had no hops to make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no
copper or kettle to make it boil ; and yet with all these things wanting, I
verily believe, had not the {rights and terrors I was in about the savages inter-DESIGNS AGAINST THE SA VAGES. n!

vened, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too ; for I seldom
gave anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had it in my head
to begin it. But my invention now ran quite another way; for, night and
day, I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these monsters
in their cruel, bloody entertainment; and, if possible, save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy.

' Sometimes I contrived in my thoughts to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which'when
they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all that was
near it; but as in the first place I should be very loth to waste so much
powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity of one barrel;
so neither could I be sure of its going off, at any certain time, when it might
surprise them, and at best, that it would do little more than just blow the
fire about their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake
the place; so I laid it aside, and then proposed, that I would place myself in
ambush, in some convenient place, with my three guns, all double loaded;
and in the middle of their bloody ceremony, let fly at them, when I should
be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shoot ; and then falling
in upon them with my three pistols, and my sword, I made no doubt but that
if there was twenty I should kill them all. This fancy pleased my thoughts
for some weeks, and I was so full of it, that I often dreamed of it ; and
sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep,

At length I found a place in the side of the hill, where I was satisfied I
might securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then,
even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen
into some thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely; and there-I might sit and observe all their bloody
doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so close together
-as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss my shot, or that I
could fail wounding three or four of them at the first shot.

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination put
it into practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top of the
hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three miles, or more, to
to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or
standing over towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard duty.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also I kept
up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a
suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing twenty or thirty
naked savages, for an ofi'ence which I had not at all entered into any'
discussion of in my thoughts. But when I began to be weary of the fruitless
excursion which I had made so long and so far every morning in vain, so-
my opinion of the action itself began to alter; and I began, withcooler and
calmer thoughts, to consider what I was going to engage in ; what authority'
or call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner upon these men as crimi-.
nals, whom Heaven had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpunished,.
to go on, and to'be, as it were, the executioners of His judgments one upon
another; how far these people were offenders against me, and what right I
had to engage in the quarrel of that blood which they shed promiscuously'
one upon another.

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was certainly
.in the wrong ; that these people were not murderers, in the sense that I had
before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians
were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle; or
more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole' troops of men to the
' sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their arms, and.
submitted. '

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of full stopfi
and I began, by little and little, to be off my design, and to conclude I had
taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the savages; and that it
was not my business to meddle with them, unless they first attacked me;
and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent; but that, if I were
discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty. '

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this ; and so far was
I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in all that
time I never once went up the hill to see whether there were any of them in
sight, or to know whether any of them had been on shore there or not, that
I might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be
provoked by any advantage that might present itself, to fall upon them. Only
this IBM; 1 went and removed my boat, which I had on the other side of
the island, and carried it down to the east end of the whole island, where
I ran it into a little cove, which I found under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by reason of the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not,_
come with their boats upon any account whatever. With my boat I carried
away everything that I had left there belonging to her, though not necessary
for the bare going thither, 712121, a mast and sail which I had made for her,
and a thing like an anchor, but which indeed could not be called either-ANOTHER CA VE DISCO VERED. ' n3

anchor or grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its kind;
all, these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow for
discovery, or appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon
the island. Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than
ever, and seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment,
to milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as it
was quite on the other part of the island, was out of danger; for certain it is
that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came
with any thoughts of finding anything here, and consequently never wandered
off from the coast, and I doubt not but they might have been several
times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me cautious, as
well as before. Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon the thoughts
of what my condition would have been, if I had chopped upon them and been
discovered before that, when naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and
that loaded often only with small shot, I walked everywhere, peeping and
peering about the island to see what I could get ; what a surprise should I
have been in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had, instead
of that, seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me, and, by
the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my escaping them. '

I had the care of my safety more now upon my hands than that of my
food. I dared not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the
noise I might make should be heard : much less would I fire a gun for the
same reason: and, above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire,
lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray
me. For this reason, I removed that part of my business which required fire,
such as burning of 'pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in the woods ;
where, after I had been some time, I found to my unspeakable consolation a
mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where, I dare
say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to
venture in.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by
mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe all
such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick branches of
trees to make charcoal ; and before I go on I must observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was thus: I was afraid of making a smoke about
my habitation, as I said before ; and yet I could not live there without baking
my bread, cooking my meat, &c. ; so I contrived to burn some wood here, as
I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark or dry coal ; and

9
then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform the
other services for which fire was wanting, without danger of smoke.

While I was cutting down some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very
thick branch of low brushwood or underwood, there was a kind of hollow
place : I was curious to look into it ; and getting with difliculty into the mouth
of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand
upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but I must confess to you that
I made more haste out than I- did in, when looking farther into the place,
which was perfectly dark,I saw two broad shining eyes of some creature,
whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars; the dim
light from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the reflection.

However, after'some pause, I recovered myself, and began to call myself a
thousand fools, and tell myself that he that was afraid to see the devil was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone ; and that I durst to believe
there was nothing in this-cave that was more frightful than myself; upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand, and in I rushed again,
with the stick flaming in my hand: I had not gone three steps in, before I
was almost as much frighted as I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh,
like that of a man in some pain, and it was followed by a broken noise, as of
words half expressed, and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was
indeed struck with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I
had had a hat on my head, I will not answer {or it that my hair might not
have lifted it off. - But still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and en--
couraging myself a little with considering that the power and presence of God
was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by
the light of the firebyand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on
the ground a monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his will, as we say,
and gasping for life, and dying, indeed, of mere old age. '

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he assayed to get up,
but was not able to raise himself ; and I thought with myself he might even lie
there {for if he had frighted me,so he would certainly fright any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when
I found the cave was but very small, that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no hands
having ever been employed in making it but those of mere N ature. I
observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in
further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands andM Y IVA GAZINE. I IS

knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not; so, having no candle, I
gave it over for that time, but resolved to go again the next day provided
'with candles and a tindcr-box, which I had made of the lock of one of the
muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my
own making ; for I made very good candles now of goat's tallow; and going
into this low place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours, as I have said,_almost
.ten yards; which I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that I
-knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I was got
through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near twenty
feet ; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare say, as it
was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave ; the walls reflected
-a hundred thousand lights to me from my two candles; what it was in the
rock--whether diamonds or any other precious stones, or gold--which I
rather supposed it to bc--I knew not.

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, of its kind,
though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small
loose gravel upon it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to
'be seen, neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof ; the only -
difficulty in it was the entrance--which, however, as it was a place of security,
.and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought was a convenience ; so that I was
'really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, to bring
some of those things which I was most anxious about to this place; par-
ticularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare
arms, via, two fowling-pieccs, for I had three in all ; and three muskets, for
of them I had eight in all ; so I kept in my castle only five, which stood ready
-mounted like pieces of cannon on my outmost fence, and were ready also to
take out upon any expedition.

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition I happened to open the
barrel of powder which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet, and
I found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the
.powder on every side, which, caking and growing hard, had preserved the
inside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of very good
powder in the centre of the cask. This was a very agreeable discovery to me
:at that time ; so I carried all away thither, never keeping above two or three
pounds of powder with me in my castle, {or fear of a surprise of any kind ; I
;also carried thither all the lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to live in
, .
caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them ; for I persuaded
myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages were to hunt me, they
could never find me out ; or if they did, they would not venture to attack me-
here. The old goat whom I found expiring died in the mouth of the cave the-
next day after I made this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig a.
great hole there, and throw him in and cover him with earth, than to drag;
him out ; so I interred him there, to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and was;
so naturalized to the place and the manner of living, that, could I but have
enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to disturb me,.
I could have been content to have capitulated for spending the rest of my-
time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the-
old goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions and amuse-~
ments, which made the time pass a great deal more pleasantly with me than.
it did before; as first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before, to speak; and'
he did it so familiarly, and talked so articulately and plain, that it was very-
pleasant to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-twenty years ;
how long he might have lived afterwards I know not, though Iknow they-
have a notion in the Brazils that they live a hundred years. My dog was a.
very pleasant and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of
my time, and then died of mere old age ; as for my cats, they multiplied, as I
have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of them at
first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had ; but, at length, when the
two old ones I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually-
driving themlfrom me, and letting them have no provision with me, they all
ran wild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame,.
and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were
part of my family. Besides these I always kept two or three household kids
about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more
parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call " Robin Crusoe," but none
like My first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had
done with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name I knew not,
that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings ; and the little stakes which
I had planted before my castle-wall being now grown up to a good thick

'grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees, and bred there, which was
very agreeable to me ; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well con-
tented with the life I led, if I could have been secured from the dread of
savges. But it was otherwise directed.
It was now the month of December, as I said before, in my twenty-third
year ; and this, being the southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was the
particular time of my harvest, and required my being pretty much abroad in
the fields ; when, going out early in the morning, even before it was thorough
daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a
distance from me of about two miles, toward that part of the island where I
had observed some savages had been ; and not, as before, on the other side,
but, to my great affliction, it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my
grove, not dating to go out, lest I might be surprised ; and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in rambling
through the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of my im-
provements, they would immediately conclude that there were people in the'
place, and would then never give over till they had found me out. In this
extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me,
and made all things without look as wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence; I

~ loaded all my cannon, as I called them ; that is to say my muskets, which
were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to
[defend myself to the last gasp, not forgetting seriously to commend myself'to
the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians. In this posture I continued about two hours, and
began to be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.
After sitting awhile longer, and musing what I should do in this case, I was
not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer ;' so setting up my ladder to
the side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I observed before, and
then pulling the ladder up after me, I set it up again and mounted the top of
'the hill ; and pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose,
I laid me down flat on the ground, and began to look for the place.

I presently found there were no less than nine naked savages, sitting round
.a small fire they had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that,
the weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their'
barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether
.alive or dead I could not tell.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore ;
.and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to~wait for the return of the flood
10 go away again ; it is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me
into, especially seeing them come on my side of the island, and so near me
too; but when Iob'served their coming must be always with the current of
the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfies}:
' that I might go abroad with safety all the time of the tide of flood, if they-

were not on shore before: and having made this observation, I went abroad;
about my harvest work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved ; for, as soon as the tide made to the westward,
I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away. I should.
have observed, that {or an hour or more before they went off they were,-
dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by my glass ;
I could not perceive, by my'nicest observation, but that they were stark.
naked, and had not the least covering upon them ; but whether they were men.-
or women I could not distinguish

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my
shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great sword by my side
without a scabbxad, and, with all the speed I was able to make,I went away to>>
the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all ; and as soon as I.
got thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I could not go quickly,
being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes:
more of the savages at that place; and looking out farther, I saw they were~
all at sea together, making over for the main. This was a dreadful sight to
me, especially as, going down to the shore, I could see the marks of horror
which the dismal work they had been about had left behind it, wk, the blood,
the bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies eaten and devoured by those-
wretches with merriment and sport: I was so filled with indignation at the.
sight, that I now began to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let them be who or how many soever. It seemed evident to me that
the visits which they made thus to this island were not very frequent ; for it
was above fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there again ;-.
that is to say, I neither saw them, nor any footsteps or signals of them in alL
that time ; {or as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to game abroad,
at least not so far ; yet all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reason of the-
constant apprehensions I was in of their coming upon me by surprise: from
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering.

I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind, expecting;
that I should one day or other fall into the hands of these merciless creatures ;
and if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not without looking around:
me with the greatest care and caution imaginable. And now I found, to my
great comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame flock or herd ofA SIGNAL 0F DISTRESS. 119

goats ; for I durst not upon any account fire my gun, especially near that side
of the island where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages ; and
if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come again with
perhaps two or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, and then I
knew what to expect. However, I wore out a year and three months more
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I
shall soon observe. It is true they might have been there once or twice ; but
either they made no stay, or at least I did not see them ; but in the month
of May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had
a very strange encounter with them ; of which in its place.

It was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as my
poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the post still ; I
say, it was on the sixteenth of May that it blew a very great storm of wind
all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it
was after it. I know not what was the particular occasion of it; but as I
was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my
present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired
at sea. This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature from any
I had met with before ; for the notions this put into my thoughts were quite
of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste imaginable; and, in a
trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me, and mounting it the second time, got to the top of the hill the very
moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a second gun, which, accordingly,
in about half a minute, I heard, and by the sound, knew that it was from that
part of the sea where I was driven down the current in my boat. I imme-
diately considered that this must be some ship in distress, and that they had
some comrade, or some other ship in company, and fired these for signals of
distress, and to obtain help; I had the presence of mind, at that minute, to
think, that though I could not help them, it might be they might help me;
so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and, making a
good, handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The wood was dry, and
blazed freely ; and, though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly out;
that I was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see
it, and no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, Iheard
another gun, and after that several others, all from the same quarter. I plied
my fire ail night long, till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of the
island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glasses,
the distance was so great, and the weather still something hazy also ; at least
it was so out at sea.I ' '

' I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did not
move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor;- and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand, and ran
towards the south side of the island, to the rocks where I had formerly been
carried away by the current, and getting up there, the weather by this time
being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a
ship, cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I found when
I was out in my boat ; and which rocks, as they checked ,the violence of the
stream, and made a kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my
recovering from the most desperately hopeless condition that ever I had been
in in all my life.

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction ; {or it seems
these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the night, the wind
blowing hard at E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily
suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured to have
saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat; but their firing off
guns for help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with
many thoughts.

In the condition I was in,I could do no more than look on upon the misery
'of the poor men, and pity them, which had still this good effect upon my side,
that it gave me' more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so
happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate condition ; and that
of two ships' companies who were new cast away upon this part of the world,
not one life should be spared but mine. Such were my earnest wishings, that
but one man had been saved--" 0 Mat it Itaa' been but one! " that I believe I

' repeated the words, " 0 Mat it lma' been but one .' " a thousand times ; and the
desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my hands would
clin'ch'together, and my fingers press the palms of my hands, that if I had had
any soft thing in my hand, it would have crushed it involuntarily ; and my
teeth in my head would strike together, and set against one another so strong,
that for some time I could not part them again.

But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine, or both, forbade it ; for till
the last year of my being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship or no ; and had only the affliction some days after to see the
corpse of a drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the island which wasPREPARING TO VISIT THE IVRECK. 121

next the shipwreck: he had on no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of
open-knccd linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; but nothing to direct me so
much as to guess what nation he was of. He had nothing in his pocket but
two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe ; the last was to me of ten times more
value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this
wreck; not doubting but I might find something on board that might be
useful to me ; but that did not altogether press me so much as the possibility
'that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose life I might not
only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle, prepared
everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water,
a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a great deal of that
left), and a basket full of raisins; and thus, loading myself with everything
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out of her and got her
afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again for more. My
second cargo was a great bagful of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head
for shade, another large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
.small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk,
and a cheese : all which with great labour and sweat I brought to my boat ;
and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling
the canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the island on
that side N.E. And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to
venture oi- not to venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran con-
stantly on both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very terrible
to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my
heart began to fail me ; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those
currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of sight
of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale
of wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give over my
enterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I
stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and
anxious, between fear and desire about my voyage ; when, as I was musing, I
could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on ; upon which,
my going was for so many hours impracticable. Upon this, presently it
occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I could
find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay when the
flood came in, that I might judge whether if I was driven one way out, I
might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same rapidness of
the currents ; this thought was no sooner in my head than I cast my eye upon
a little hill, which sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence
- I had a clear view of the currents or sets of the tides, and which way I was to
guide myself in my return ; here I found that as the current of the ebb set out
close by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood set in close
by the shore of the north side, and that I had nothing to do but to keep to-
the north side of the island in my return, and I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved, the next morning, to set out
with the first of the tide ; and, repos'ing myself for the night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out; I made'first a little.
out to sea, full north, till I-began to feel the benefit of the current, which set.-
eastward, and which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not so. hurry me
as.the current on the south side had done before, so as to take from me all
government of the. boat; but having a strong steerage with my paddle, I
went, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and in less than twohours I came
up to it. It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, which, by its building,
was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in between two rocks ; all the stern and
quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her forecastle which
' stuck in the rocks had run on with great violence,her mainmast and foremast
were brought by the board ; that isto say. broken short off ; but her bowspril:
was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm ; when I came close to her,
,a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing' me coming, yelped and cried; and as
soon as I called him, jumped into the sea to come to me, and I took him into
the boat, but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst; I gave him a
cake of my bread, and he ate it like a ravenous wolf, that had been starving a.
fortnight in the snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water, with
which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself. 'After this I
went on board ; but the first sight I met with was two men drowned in the
cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about one another :
I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a;
storm, the sea broke so high and so continually over her, that the men were
not able-to bear it, and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the
water, as much as if they had been under water. Besides the dog, there was
nothing left in the ship that had life ; nor any goods, that I could see, but
what were spoiled by the'water. There were some casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the waterTHE WRECK VISITED. 1 2 3.

being ebbed out, I could see ; but they were too big to meddle with : I saw
several chests, which, I believe, belonged to some of the seamen ; and I got
two of them into the boat, without examining what was in them. Had the'
stem of the ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off; I am persuaded I
might have made a good voyage; for, by what I found in these two chests, I
had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board ; and if I
may guess from the course she steered, she must have been bound from
Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond.
the Brazils to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain ;:
she had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to
anybody ; and what became of her people I then knew not. .

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about twenty
gallons, which I got into my boat with much difl'iculty; there were several
muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about four pounds of
powder in it 2' as for the muskets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them,
but took the powder-horn; I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted
extremely; as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate,
and a gridiron; and with this cargo and the dog, I came away, the tide:
beginning to make home again : and the same evening, about an hour within
night, I reached the island again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. I
reposed that night in the boat; and in the morningI resolved to harbour
what I had gotten in my new cave, not carry it home to my castle. After
refreshing myself,I got all my cargo on shore, and began to examine the
particulars : the cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as.
we had at the Brazils ; and, in a word, not at all good ; but when I came to
open the chests, I found several things of great use to me: for example, I
found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
cordial waters, fine and very good; the bottles held about three pints each,
and were tipped with silver ; I found two pots of very good succades, or
sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the salt-water had not hurt them ;
and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled; I found some very
good shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about a dozen and a half of
linen white handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths ; the former were also very
welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my face in a hot day ; besides
this, when I came to the till in the chest, I found there threegreat bags of
pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and in one of
them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or
wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh near a pound. The other
chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little value ; but, by the circum-
stances, it must have belonged to the gunner's mate, though there was no
powder in it, except two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept,
I suppose, for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion ; upon the whole, I
got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for, as to the money,
I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet,
and I would have given it all for three or {our pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet
for many years ; I had, indeed, gotten two pairs of shoes now, which I took
off the feetof the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found
two pair more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to me ; but they
were not like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what
we call pumps than shoes ; I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of
eight, in reals, but no gold: I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the
other, which seemed to belong to some officer.

Well, however, I lugged the money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I
had done that before which I brought from our own ship ; but it was great
pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to my share, for
I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times over with money,
which if I had ever escaped to England would have lain here safe enough till
I might have come again and fetched it.

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured them, I went
'back to my boat,' and towed or paddled her along the shore to her old
harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old habits.-
tion, where I found everything safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself,'
live after my old fashion, and take care of my family afiairs ; and for a while
I lived easy enough ; only that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any time I did stir
with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the island, where I was
pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and where I could go without so
many precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition as I always
carried with me if I went the other way.

I am now to be supposed retired in my castle, after my late voyage to the
wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, and my condition restored
to what it was before ; I had more wealth than I had before, but was not at
all the richer; for Ihad nomore use for it than the Indians of Peru had
before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the four-and-twentiethA SLEEPLESS NIGHT. :25

year of my first setting foot in this island of solitariness ; I was lying in my
bed or hammock awake, very well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no
uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could
by no means close my eyes ; that is, so as to sleep ; no, not a wink all night
long. It is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that
whirled through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this
night's time: I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by
abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of that
part of my life since I came to this island.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time taken up in
considering the nature of those wretched creatures, the savages, and how it
came to pass in the world that the wise Governor of all things should give up.
any of his creatures to such inhumanity--nay, to something so much below
even brutality itself--as to devour its own kind: but, as this ended in some
(at that time) fruitless speculations, it occurred to me to inquire, what part of
the world these wretches lived in? how far off the coast was from whence
they came? what they ventured over so far from home for? what kind of
boats they had ? and why I might not order myself and my business so, that
I might be able to go over thither, as they were to come to me?

I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I should do with
myself when I went thither ; what would become of me if I fell into the hands
of these savages ; or how I should escape them if they attacked me ; but my
mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my boat to the
main land. I looked upon my present condition as the most miserable that
could possibly be; that I was not able to throw myself into anything but
death, that could be called worse ; and if I r'eached the shore of the main, I
might perhaps meet with relief} or I might coast along, as I did on the
African shore, till I came to some 'inhabited country, and where I might find
some relief ; and, after all, perhaps I might fall in with some Christian ship
that might take me in ; and if the worst came to the worst, I could but die,
which would put an end to all these miseries at once. All this was the fruit'
of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made desperate, as it were, by the
long continuance of my troubles, and the disappointments I had met in the
wreck I had been on board of, and where I had been so near obtaining what
I so earnestly longed for--somebody to speak to, and to learn some know
ledge from them of the place where I was, and of the probable means of my
deliverance. I was agitated wholly by these thoughts; all my calm of mind
in my resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue of the dispositions of
Heaven, Seemed to be suspended ; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my
thoughts to anything but to the project of a voyage to the main, which came
upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of desire, that it was not to
be resisted. .

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more, with such
violence that it set my- very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as if I
had been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fervour of my mind about
it, Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thoughts of
it, threw me into a sound sleep. One would have thought I should have
dreamed of it, but I did not, nor of anything relating to it ; but I dreamed
that as I was going out in the morning as usual, from my castle, I saw upon
the shore two canoes and eleven savages, coming to land, and that they
brought with them another savage; whom they were going to kill, in order to
eat him ; when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill jumped
away, and ran for his life ; and I thought, in my sleep, that he came running
into my little thick grove before my fortification, to hide himself; and that I,
'seeing him alone, and not perceiving that the others sought him that way,
showed myself to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him :_ that he
kneeled down to me,seeming to pray me to assist him ; upon which I showed
him my ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my cave, and he became
my servant; and that as soon as I had gotten this man, I said to myself,
" Now I may certainly venture to the main land, for this fellow will serve me
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for provisions, and
whither not to go for fear of being devoured; what places to venture into,
and what to escape." I waked with this thought ; and was under such inex-
pressible impressions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my dream, that
the disappointments which I felt upon coming to myself, and finding that it
was no more than a dream, were equally extravagant the other way, and
threw me into a very great dejection of spirit.

Upon this, however,I made this conclusion : that my only way to go about
to attempt an escape was, to endeavour to get a savage into my possession ;
and, if possible, it should be one of their prisoners,whom they had condemned
to be eaten, and should bring hither to kill. But these thoughts still were
attended with this difficulty: that it was impossible to effect this without
attacking a whole caravan of them, and killing them all; and this was not
only a very desperate attempt, and might miscarry; but, on the other hand, I
had greatly scrupled the lawfulness of it to me; and my heart trembled at
the thoughts of shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance.A SA VAGE FEAST. :27

However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after great
perplexities about it, the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length
mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages
into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to
do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on ; but as I could pitch
.upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch,
to see them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event, taking
such measures as the opportunity should present, let what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the scout as often

' as possible, and indeed so often, that I was heartily tired of it; for it was
above a year and a half that I waited, and for great part of that time went out
to the west end, and to the south-west corner of the island almost every day,
to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was very discouraging, and
began to trouble me much, though I cannot say that it did in this case wear
off the edge of my desire to the thing ; but the longer it seemed to be
delayed, the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first so careful
to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen by them, as I was
now eager to be upon them. -

About a year and a half after I had entertained these notions, and by long
musing had, as it were, resolved them all into nothing, {or want of an occasion
to put them into execution, I was surprised one morning by seeing no less
than five canoes all on shore together on my side the island, and the people
who belonged to them all landed and out of my sight. ' The number of them
broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing that they always
came four or six, or sometimes more in a boat, I could not tell what to think
of it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-
handcd; so lay still in my castle,' perplexed and discomforted; however, I
put myself into all the same postures for an attack that I had formerly pro-
vided, and was just as ready for action if anything had presented. Having
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made any noise, at length, being
very impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambcred up to
the top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual ; standing so, however, that my
head did not appear above the bill, so that they could not perceive me by any
means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective glass, that they were
no less than thirty in number; that they had a fire kindled, and that they
had meat dressed ; how they had cooked it, I knew not, or what it was ; but
they were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous gestures and
figures, their own way, round the fire.
While' I was thus looking on them, I perceived, by my perspective, two
miserable wretches'dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them imme-
diately fall; being knocked down, I suppose with a club, or wooden sword,
for that was their way, and two or three others were at work immediately,
cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was left standing"
by himself, till they should be ready for him. In that very moment, this poor
wretch seeing himself a little at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life,
and he started away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the
sands, directly towards me, I mean, towards that part of the coast where my
habitation was. I was dreadfully frighted, I must acknowledge, when I
perceived him run my way; and especially when, as I thought, I saw him
pursued by the whole body ; and now I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my grove : but I
could not depend, by any means, upon my dream for the rest, that the
other savages would not pursue him thither, and find him there. However, I
kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when I found that there was
not above three men that followed him, and still more was I encouraged,
when I found that he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained
ground on them, so that, if he could but hold out for half an hour, I saw
easily he would fairly get away from them all. '

There was between them and my castle, the creek, which I mentioned often
at the first part of my story, where I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and
this I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be
taken there ; but when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of
it, though the tide was then up; but, plunging in, swam through in about
thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran with exceeding strength and
swiftness; when the three pursuers came to the creek,I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on the other
side, he looked at the others, but went no farther. and soon after went softly
'back; _which, as it happened, was very well [or him in the end. I observed
that the two who swam were yet more' than twice as long swimming over the
creek as the fellow was that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon
my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was the time to get me a
servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant ; and that I was- plainly called
by Providence to save this poor creature's life; I immediately ran down the
ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were both
at the foot of the ladders, as I observed before, and getting up again with the1 RESCUE A SA VAGE. 129

same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed towards the sea; and having a
very short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way between the
pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him"that fled, who, looking back,
was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as at them ; but I beckoned with
my hand to him to come back; and, in the mean time, I slowly advanced
towards the two that followed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I
knocked him down with the stock of my piece; I was 10th to fire because I
would not have the rest hear; though, at that distance, it would not have
been easily heard, and being out of sight of the smoke, too, they would not
have known what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow down, the other
who pursued him stopped, as if he had been frighted, and I advanced
towards him : but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had a bow and
arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me : so I was then necessitated to shoot
at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage
who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen and killed,
as he thought, yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece, that
he stood stock still, and neither came forward nor went backward, though he
seemed rather inclined still to fly than to come on. I hallooed again to him,
and made signs to come forward, which be easily understood, and 'came a
little way, then stopped again, and then a little farther, and stopped again, and
I could then perceive that he stccd tumbling, as if he had been taken
prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned
to him again to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that
I could think of, and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down every ten or
twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for my saving his life. I smiled at
him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer; at
length, he Icame close to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and, taking me by the foot, set
my foot upon his head; this, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
'slave for ever. I took him up and made much of him, and encouraged him
all I could. But there was more work to do yet ; for I perceived the savage
whom I had knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and
began to come to himself : so I pointed to him, and showed him the savage,
that he was not dead ; upon this he spoke scme-words to me, and though I
could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to hear; for
they were the first sound ofa man '5 mice that I had heard ,my own excepted,
for above twenty--five years. But there was no time for such rcl'cct: ons now; .

the savage who was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon
10
the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid ; but when I
saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him:
upon this, my savage, for so I called him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side; so I did. He no
sooner had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so
cleverly that no executioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better ;
which I thought very strange for one who, I hail reason to believe, never saw
a sword in his life before, except their own wooden swords: however, it seems,
as I learned afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy,
and the wood is so hard, that they will even cut ofl' heads with them, ay, and
arms, and that at one blow too. When he had done this, he comes laughing
to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword again, and- with abund--
ance of gestures which I did not understand, laid it down, with the head of
the savage that he had killed, just before me. But that which astonished him
most was to know how I killed the other Indian so far off; so, pointing to
him, he made signs to me to let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well
as I could ; when he came to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him,
_ turned him first on one side, then on the other,looked at the wound the bullet
had made, which it seems was -just in his breast, where it had made a hole,
and no great quantity of blood had followed ; but he had bled inwardly, for -
he was quite dead. He took up his bow and arrows, and came back, so I
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him that
more might come after them. Upon this he made signs to me that he should
bury them with sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they
followed ; and so I made signs to him again to do so. He fell to work ; and
in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands, big enough to
bury the first in, and then dragged him into it, and covered him ; and did so
by the other also ; I believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an hour.
Then calling him away, I carried him, not to my castle, but quite away to my
cave, on the farther part of the island : so I did not let my dreamfcome to pass in
that part, that he came into my grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread and
a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was indeed
in great distress for, from his running: and having refreshed him, I made
signs for him to go and lie down to sleep, showing him a place where I had
laid some rice--straw, and a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon myself
sometimes ; so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with straight strong
limbs, not too large, tall and well shaped ; and, as I reckon, about twenty-six.4 Savage Exrrulimu-r." FRIDA Y." - :3:

years of age. He had a very good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect,
but seemed to have something very manly in his face ; and yet he had all the
sweetness and softness of a European in his countenance too, especially when
"he smiled. His hair was long and black, not curled like wool ; his forehead
'very high and large ; and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes.
'The colour of the skin was not quite black, but very tawny ; and yet not an
'ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other
'natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive-colour, that had
in it something very agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His face-
was round and plump ; his nose small, not flat like the Negroes, a very good
'mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and as white as ivory. After he
"had slumbered rather than slept, about half an hour, he awoke again, and
came out of the cave to me ; for I had been milking my goats, which I had
in the inclosure just by : when he espied me, he came running to me, laying
himself down again upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble,
thankful disposition, making a great many antic gestures to show it; at last
,he lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other
'foot upon his head, as he had done before ; and after this, made all the signs
'to me of subjection, servitude, and submission imaginable, to' let me know
how he would serve me so long as he lived. I understood him in many
things, and let him know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time
I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and, first, I let'him
'know his name should be FRIDAY, which was the day I saved his life: I
~called him so for the memory of the time; I likewise taught him to say
Master ; and then let him know that was to be my name : I likewise taught
him to say Yes and No, and to know the meaning of them ; I gave him some
milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my
'bread in it ; and I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which he quickly
complied with, and made signs that it was very good for him. I kept there
with him all night; but, as soon as it was day,I beckoned to him to come
with me, and let him know I would give him some clothes; at which he
seemed very glad, for he was stark naked. As we went by the place where
'he had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the place, and showed me
the marks that he had made to find them again, making signs to me that we
-should dig them up again and eat them. At this, I appeared very angry,
expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it,
and beckoned with my hand to him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great submission. I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his
enemies were gone ; and pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the
place where they had been, but no appearance of them or their canoes; so
that it was plain they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind
them, without any search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery"; but having now more courage,.
and consequently more curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, which I found
he could use very dexterously, making him carry one gun for me, and I two-
for myself ; and away we marched to the place where these creatures had'
been; for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them. When
I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my heart sunk
within me, at the horror of the spectacle; indeed, it was a dreadful sight, at.
least it was so to me, though Friday made nothing of it. The place was:
Covered with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, and great pieces
of flesh left here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched ; and, in short,

' all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making there, after a
victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of
three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies ; and
Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they brought over four
prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten up, and that he,
pointing to himself, was the fourth; that there had been a great battle
between them and their next king, of whose subjects, it seems, he had been
one ;' and that they had taken a great number of prisoners, all which were
carried to several places, by those who had taken them in the fight, in order
'to feast upon them, as was done here by these wretches upon those they
brought hither.

I caused F riday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and whatever remained,
and lay them together in a heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn
them all to ashes. I found Friday had still a hankering stomach after some
of the flesh, and was still a cannibal in his nature ; but I discovered so much
abhorrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, that
he durst not discover it ; {or I had, by some means, let him know that I
would kill him if he offered it.

When he had done this, we came back to our castle; and there I fell to
work for my man F riday ; and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,.
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I mentioned, which I found in the
wreck, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well; then I made
him a jerkin of goat's skin, as well as my skill would allow, and I was nowFRIDAY'S QUARTERS. I33

grown a tolerably good tailor; and I gave him a cap which I had made of
a hare's skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was
~clothed, for the present, tolerably well; and was mighty well pleased to see
himself almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he went awkwardly
in these clothes at first: wearing the drawers was very awkward to him, and
'the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms;
but a little easing them where he complained they hurt him, and using himself
.to them, at length he took to them very well. I

The next day, after I came home to my hutch with him, I began to con-

-.sider wh2re I should lodge him ; and that I might do well for him and yet be
perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for him in the vacant place between
'my two fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first ;
.and as there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal
framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, a
little within the entrance; and, causing the door to open in the inside, I
barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders, too ; so that Friday could no
way come at me in the inside of my innermost wall, without making so much
noise in getting over that it must needs awaken me; for my first wall had
.now a complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning
up to the side of the hill; which was again laid across with smaller sticks,
instead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the rice-straw,
which was strong, like reeds ; and at the hole or place which was left to go in
.or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it had been
attempted on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have fallen
-down and made a great noise; and as to weapons,I took them all into my
:side every night. But I needed none of all this precaution: for never man
had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me ; without
passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly obliging and engaging; his very
.affections were tied to me like those of a child to a father ; and I daresay he
would have sacrificed his life to save mine, upon any occasion whatsoever;
'the many testimonies he gave me of this put it out of doubt, and soon convinced
me that I needed to use no precautions for my safety on his account.

I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my business to teach him
everything that was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful ; but
especially to make him speak, and understand me when I spoke ; and he was
'the aptest scholar that ever was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleased when he could but understand me, or make me under-
stand him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. Now my life began
to be so easy that I began to say to myself, that could I but have been safe-
fl'nim more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from the place where
ived.

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I thought that, in-
order to bring Friday'ofl' from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish
of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other flesh; so I took him
out with me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a.
kid out. of my own flock, and bring itlhome and dress it; but as I was going,
I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids sitting by her.
I caught hold of Friday. "Hold," said I, "stand still ;" and made signs to-
him not to stir. Immediately,I presented my piece, shot, and killed one oi"
the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance, indeed, seen me kill the
savage, his enemy, but did not know, nor could not imagine how it was done,.
was sensibly surprised; trembled, and shook, and looked so amazed that I
thought he would have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had shot at, or
perceiveI had killed it, but ripped up his waiscoat, to feel whether he was
not wounded, and, as I found presently, thought I was resolved to kill him :2
for he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees, said a great:

many things I did not understand ; but I could easily see the meaning was,_
to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm, and'
taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I'
had killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did : and while he-
was wondering, and looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my'
gun again, and by-and-by, I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree
within 'shot; so, to let Friday understand a little what I would do,I called'
him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been a hawk ; I say, pointing to the parrot, and to my gun,_
and'to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I would make it fall, I
made him understand that I would shoot and kill. that bird ; accordingly, I
fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood'
like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found'.
he was the more amazed, because he did not see me put anything into the
gun ; but thought that there must be some wonderful fund of death and'
destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or anything near or far
off ; and the astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear of?
for a long time ; and, I believe,if I would have let him,he would have worshipped
me and my gun ; as for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it forCIVILISING A SA VA CE. 135

several days after; but would speak to it and talk to it, as if it had answered
him, when he was by himself ; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to
desire it not to kill him. Well; after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but
stayed some time ; or the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered away a
good distance from the place where she fell : however, he found her, took her
up, and brought her to me; and as I had perceived his ignorance about the
gun before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again, and not to let him
see me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark that might present ;
but nothing more offered at that time; so I brought home the kid, and the
same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could ; and having
a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some
very good broth ; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some to my man,
who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but that which was strangest
to him was to see me eat salt with it. He, made a sign to me that the salt
was not good to eat ; and putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to
nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh
water after it: on the other hand, I took some meat into my mouth without
salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had
done at the salt ; but it would not do ; he would never care for salt with meat
or in his broth ; at least, not for a great while, and then but a very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth,I was resolved to feast
him the next day by roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it
before the fire on a string, as I had seen many people do in England, setting
two poles up, one on each side of the fire, and one across the top, and tying
the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn continually. This Friday
admired very much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so many
ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but understand him:
and at last he told me, as well as he could, he would never eat man's flesh any
more, which I was very glad to hear.

The next day, I set him to work beating some com out, and sifting it in
the manner I used to do, as I observed before; and he soon understood how
to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the meaning of it was,
and that it was to make bread of ; for after that, I let him see me make my
bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time, Friday was able to do all the work
for me, as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed instead of one, I
must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn .
than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece of land, and began the
fence in the same manner as before, in which Friday worked not only very
willingly and very hard, but did it very cheerfully. And I told him what it
was for; that it was for com to make more bread, because he was now with
me, and that I might have enough for him and myself too. He appeared very
sensible of that part, and let me know that he thought I had much more

labour upon me on his account thanI had for myself; and that he would
work the harder for-me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the lifeI led in this place. Friday
began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of almost everything I
had occasion to call for, and of every place I had to send him to, and talk a
great deal to me: so that, in short,I began now to have some use for my
tongue again, which, indeed,I had very little occasion for before, that is to
say about speech. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular
satisfaction in the fellow himself: his simple, unfeigned honesty appeared to
me more and more every day, and I began really to love the creature ; and on
his side, I believe he loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love
anything before. >>

I had'a mind once to try if he had any inclination for his own country
again; and having taught him English so well that he could answer me
almost any questions, I asked him 'whether the nation that he belonged to
never conquered in battle? At which he smiled, and said, "Yes, yes, we
always fight the better;" that is, he meant, always get the better in fight ; and
so we began the following discourse. " You always fight the better," said I ;
" how came you to be taken prisoner, then, Friday ? "

Friday.--My nation beat much for all that.

Masterc--How beat? If your nation beat them, how came you to be
taken ?

Frz'day.--They more many than my nation, in the place where me was;
they take one, two, three, and me: my nation over--beat them in the yonder
placefwhere me no was ; there my nation take one, two, great thousand.

Masten--But why did not your side recover you from the hands of your
enemies then P

Friday.--They- run, one, two, three, and me, and make go in the canoe ;
my nation have no canoe that time.

Masten--Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with 'the men they
take; do they carry them away and eat them, as these did ?

' Friday.--Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Jlfaxler.--W'here do they carry them ?

Frialyi.--Go to other place, where they think.

xWastcr.--Do they come hither?

Fria'ay.--Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else place.

Master.--Have you been here with them P

Frz'a'ay.--Yes, I been here (points to the NW. side of the island, which it
seems was their side).

By this, I understood that my man Friday had formerly been among the
savages who used to come on shore on the farther part of the island. oh the
same man-eating occasions that he was now brought for: and, some time
after, when I took the courage to carry him to that side, being the same I
formerly mentioned, he presently knew the place, and told me he was there
once, when they ate up twenty men, two women, and one child. He could not
tell twenty in English, but he numbered them, by laying so many stones in a
row, and pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows ; that after this
discourse I had with him, I asked him how far it was from our island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost ; he told me there was no
danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that after a little way out to sea, there was a
current and wind, always one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon.
This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, as going out or
coming in ; but I afterwards understood it was occasioned by the great draft
and reflux of the mighty river Orinoco ; in the mouth or gulf of which river,
as I found afterwards, our island lay; and this land which I perceived to be
W. and N .W. was the great island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth
of the river. I asked Friday a thousand questions about the country, the
inhabitants, the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he told me all he
knew, with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of the
several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other name than Caribs :
from whence I easily understood that these were the Caribbees, which our
maps place on the part of America which reaches from the mouth of the river
Orinoco to Guinea, and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up a
great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, which
must be west from their country, there dwelt white bearded men, like me, and
pointed to my great whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they had.
killed mud; mam, that was his word : by all which I understood he meant the
Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread over the whole
country, and were remembered by all the nations from father to son.138 'Rozmvsozv CR (15015.

I inquired if he could tell me howI might go from this island, and get
among those white men. He told me, " Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe."
I could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he
meant by "two canoe," till at last with great difficulty, I found he meant it must:
be in a large boat, as big as two canoes. This part of Friday's discourse I
began to relish very well, and from this time I entertained some hopes that,
one time or other, I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this
place,_angl that this poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and that he
began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting in the wish to
lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I asked him
one time who made him. The poor creature did not understand me at all,
but thought I had asked who was his father: but I took it by another handle,
.and asked him, who made the sea', the ground we walked on, and the hills
and woods. He told me, " It was old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all."
He could describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old,
" much older," he said, " than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars."
I asked him then, if this old person had made all things, why did not all
things worship him? He looked very grave, and, with a perfect look of
innocence, said, "All things say 0 to him." I asked him, if the people who
die in his country went away anywhere? He said, "Yes, they all went to
Benamuckee." Then I asked him whether those they eat Up went thither too.
He said, " Yes."

From these things, I began to instruct him in the knowledge of the true
God. I told him that the great Maker of all things lived up there, pointing
up towards heaven : that He governs the world by the same power and provi~
dence by which He made it ; that He was omnipotent, and could do everything-
for us, give everything to us, take everything from us; and thus, by degrees,
I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention, and received with
pleasure the notion of ~ Jesus Christ being sent to redeem us, and of the
manner of making our prayers to God, and His being able to hear us, even in
heaven. He told me one day, that if our God could hear us, up beyond the
sun, he must needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but a
little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up to the great mountains
where he dwelt to speak to him. I asked him if ever he went thither to speak
to him. He said, "No; they never went that were young men; none went
thither but the old men," whom he called their Oowokakee, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy ; and that they went to say 0
(so he called saying prayers), and then came back and told them what
Benamuckee said.

I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man Friday; and told him that
the pretence of their old men going up to the mountains to say 0 to their
god Benamuckee was a cheat; and their bringing word from thence what he
said was much more so; that if they met with any answer, 01' spake with any
one there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I entered into a long'
discourse with him about the devil, the origin of him, his rebellion against
God, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark'
parts of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and the
many stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he-
had a secret access to our passions and to our affections, and to adapt his
snares to our inclinations, so as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and
run upon our own destruction by our own choice. '

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge in all the methods I took'
. for this poor creature's instruction, and must acknowledge, what I believe all;
that act upon the same principlewill find, that in laying things open to him,
I really informed and instructed myself in many things that either I did not
know, or had not fully considered before, so that, whether this poor wild
wretch was the better for me or no, I had great reason to be thankful that
ever he came to me ; my grief sat lighter upon'me ; my habitation grew comm
fortable to me beyond measure: and when I reflected that in this solitary
life which I had been confined to, I had not only been moved myself to look
up to heaven, and to seek the hand that had brought me there, but was now
made to be an instrument, under Providence, to save the life, and, for aught I

knew, the soul of a poor savage.
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my time; and the

conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was such as
made the three years which we lived there together perfectly and completely
happy, if any such thing as complete happiness can be found in a sublunary
state. The savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I.

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and that he could
understand almost all I said to him, and speak pretty fluently, though in
broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own history, or at least so
much of it as related to my coming to this place; how I had lived there, and
how long. I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of gunpowder
and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was
wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a belt, with a frog hanging to it,
such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of a hanger,
I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in some cases,
but much more useful upon other Occasions.

I described to him the countries of Europe, particularly England, which I
came from ; how we lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one
another, and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world. I gave him an
account of the wreck which I had been on board of, and showed him, as near
as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces before,
and gone.

I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and
which I could not stir with my whole strength then; but was now fallen
almost all to 'pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood musing a great
while, and said nothing. I asked him what it was he studied upon. At last
says he, "Me see such boat like come to place at my nation." I did not
understand him for a good while; but, at last, when I had examined further
into it, I understood by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on shore
upon the country where he lived : that is, as he explained it, was driven thither
'by stress of weather. I presently imagined that some European ship must
have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get loose and
drive ashore; but was so dull.that I never once thought of men making their
escape from a wreck thither, much less whence they might come: so I only
inquired after a.description of the boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought me better to
"understand him when he added with some warmth, " We save the white mans
"from drown." Then I presently asked if there were any white mans, as he
called them, in the boat. "Yes," he said; " the boat full of white mans." I
asked him how many. He told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him
then what became of them. He told me, "They live, they dwell at ,my
nation."

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently imagined that these
might'be the men belonging to the ship that was cast away in the sight of
my island, as I now called it; and who after the ship was struck on the rock
and they saw her inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were
landed upon that wild sho're among the savages. Upon this I inquired of him
more critically what was become of them. He assured me they lived still
there ; that they had been there about four years ; that the savages left them
alone, and gave them vietuals to live on. I asked him how it came to pass
they did not kill them and eat them. He said, " No, they make brotherSUSI'ICIOUS. I4]

with them ; " that is, as I understood him, a truce ; and then he added, " They
no eat mans but when make the war fight;" that is to say, they never eat
any men but such as come to fight with them, and are taken in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that being upon the top of the
hill, at the east side of the island, whence, as I have said, I had, in a clear
day, discovered the main or continent of America, Friday, the weather being
very serene, looks very earnestly towards the main land, and, in a kind of
surprise, falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter. "0 joy!" says he;
"0 glad! there see my country, there my nation ! " I observed an extraordi--
nary sense of pleasure appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his
countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his
own country again ; and this observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me, which made me, at first, not so easy about my new man Friday as I
was before; and I made no doubt but that, if Friday could get back to his
own nation again, he would not only forget all his religion, but all his obliga-
tions to me, and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an account
of me, and come back. perhaps, with a hundred or two of them, and make a
feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those of
his enemies, when they were taken in war. .

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which I was very
sorry afterwards; however, as my jealousy increased, and held me some weeks,
I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as before :
in which I was certainly wrong too; the honest, grateful creature having no
thought about it, but what consisted with the best principles, both as a
religious Christian, and as a grateful friend.

Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every day
pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which I
suspected were in him ; but I found everything he said was so honest and so
innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of
all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in
the least perceive that I was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of
deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being hazy at sea, so
that we could not see the continent, I called to him, and said, " F riday, do you
not wish yourself in your own country, your own nation?"--"Yes," he said, ' I be
much 0 glad to be at my own nation."--" What would you do there P " said I :
" would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again, and be a savage, as you
were before?" He looked full of concern, and shaking his head, said, " N o,
110, Friday tell them to live good ; tell them to pray God; tell them to eat
com-bread, cattle-flesh, milk ; no eat man again."--" Why then," said I to
him, " they will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then said, "No, they
no kill me, they willing love learn." He meant by this, they would be willing
'to learn. He added, they learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat. Then I asked him if he would go back to them. He smiled at that,
and told me that he could not swim so far. I told him, I would make a canoe
for him. . He told me he would go, if I would- go with him. " I go i" says I ;
"why, they will eat me if I come there."--" No, no," says he, " me make they
no eat you ;. me make they much love you." He meant, he would tell them
Show I had killed his enemies, and saved his life, and so he would make them
love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to seven-
teen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came on shore there
in distress. , '
' From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and see if I could
possibly join with those bearded men, who I made no doubt were Spaniards
and Portuguese ; not doubting but, if I could, we might find some method to
escape from thence, being upon the continent, and a good company together,
better than I could from an island forty miles off the shore, alone, and without
.'help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, by way of discourse,
and told him I would give him a boat to go back to his own nation ; and, ac-
cordingly, I carried him to my frigate, which lay on the other side of the
island, and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in water), I
brought it out, showed it him, and we both went into it. I found he was a
most dexterous fellow at managing it, and would make it go almost as swift
again as I could. So when he was in, I said to him, " Well, now, Friday, shall
'we go to your nation ?" He looked very dull at my saying so ; which it
seems was because he thought the boat was too small to go so far. I then
told him I had a bigger; so the next day I went to the place where the first
boat lay which I had made, and which I Could not get into the water ; he said
that was big enough ; but then, as I had taken no care of it, and it had lain
'two or three and twenty years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it
was rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, and would
carry "much enough vittle, drink, bread "--this was his way of talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design of going over
with him to the continent, that I told him we would go and make one as big
as that, and he should go home in it. He answered not one'word, but lookedFRIDA Y FA I THF (IL. I 43

very grave and sad. I asked him what was the mattet: with him. He asked
me again, "Why you angry mad with Friday ?----\vhat me done ? " I asked
him what he meant. I told him I was not angry with him at all. " No
angry ! " says he, repeating the words several times ; " why send F riday home
away to my nation ? "--" Why," says I, "Friday, did not you say you wished
you were there ? "---" Yes, yes," says he, " wish we both there ; no wish Friday
there, no Master there." In a word, he would not think of going there without
me. " I go there, Friday !" says I, " what shall I do there?" He turned very
quick upon me at this. " You do great deal much good," says he ; " you teach
wild mans be good, sober, tame mans ; you tell them know God, pray God,

and live new life."--"Alas, Friday!" says I, "thou knowest not what thou
sayest ; I am but an ignorant man myself."--"Yes, yes," says he, " you teachee
me good, you teachee them good." " No, no, Friday," says I, " you shall go

without me; leave me here to live by myself, asI did before." He looked
confused again at that word ; and running to one of the hatchets he used to
wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it to me. " What must I do with this ?"
says I to him. " You take kill Friday," says he. " What must I kill you
for?" said I again. He returns very quick--"What you send Friday away
for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday away." _ This he spoke so earnestly
that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word,I so plainly discovered the
utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, that I told him
then, and often after, that I would never send him away from me, if he was
willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled affection to me,
and that nothing could part him from me, so I found all the foundation of his
desire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent affection to the people,
and his hopes of my doing them good ; a thing which, as I had no notion of
myself, so I had not the least thought or intention, or desire of undertaking it ;
but still I found a sttonginclination to attempting my escape as above, founded
on the supposition gathered from the former discourse, that there were seven-
teen bearded men there; and therefore, without any more delay, I went to
work with Friday to find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a large
'pcriagua, or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There were trees enough in the
island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas or canoes, but even of good
large vessels; but the main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the
water that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I com-
mitted at first. At last, Friday pitched upon a tree ; for I found he knew
much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it. F riday was for burn-
ing the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it into a boat ; but I showed
him how to cut it with tools, which, after I had showed him how to use, he did
very handily; and in about a month's hard labour, we finished it and made it
very handsome; especially, when, with our axes, which I showed him how to
handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. After
this, however, it cost us near a fortnight' s time to get her along, as it were inch
by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was in, she would
have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it amazed me to see
with what dexterity and how swift' my man Friday could manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along; so I asked him if he would go, and if we might
venture over in her. " Yes," he said, " we venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind. " However, I had a further design that he knew nothing of,
. and that was, to make a mast and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable.

As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight
young cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and which there were
plenty of in the island; and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave

I him directions how to shape and order it; but as to the sail, that was my par-
ticular care ; I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails enough ; but
as I had had them now six and twenty years by me, and had not been very
careful to preserve them, not imagining that I should ever have this kind of
use for them, I did not doubt but that they were all rotten ; and, indeed, most
of them were so ; however, I found two pieces, which appeared pretty good,
and with these I went to work ; and with a great deal of pains, and awkward
stitching (you may be sure), for want of needles, I at length made a three-
comered ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail,
to go with a boom at bottom, and'a little short sprit at the top, such as usually
cur ships' long-boats sail with, and such 2151 best knew how to manage;
because it was such a one as I had to the boat in which I made my escape
from Barbary.

I was near two months performing this last work, via, rigging and fitting
my mast and sails ; for I finished them very complete, making a small stay,
and a sail, or foresail to it, to assist if we should turn to windward; and,
which was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to steer with ;
and though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness, and
even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so much pains to do it, that
at last I brought it to pass ; though, considering the many dull contrivances
I had for it that failed, I think it cost me as much labour as making the boat.THE BOA T FINISHED. 14 5

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to what belonged
to the navigation of my boat; for, though he knew very well how to paddle a
canoe, he knew nothing of what belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the
more amazed when he saw me work the boat to and again in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail jibed, and filled this way or that way, as the course
we sailed changed. However, with a little use, I made all these things fami-
liar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except that as to the compass I
could make him understand very little of that ; on the other hand, as there
was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in' those
parts, there was the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always
to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy season, and then
nobody cared to stir abroad either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity in this
place; though the three last years thatI had this creature with me ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite of another kind
than in all the rest of my time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here
with the same thankfulness to God for His mercies as at first: and if I had
such cause for acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, having such
additional testimonies of the care of Providence over me, and the great
hopes I had of being effectually and speedily delivered ; for I 'had an invin-
cible impression upon my thoughts that my deliverance was at hand, and that
I should not be another year in this place. I went on, however, with my hus-
bandry; digging, planting, and fencing, as usual. Igathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing as before.

The rainy season was, in the mean time. upon me, when Ikept more within
doors than at other times. We had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I said in the beginning, I'
landed my rafts from the ship ; and hauling her up to the shore at high-water
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold her,
and just deep enough to give her water enough to float in ; and then, when
the tide was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the water
out ;-and so she lay dry as to the tide from the sea ; and to keep the rain 05',
we laid a great many boughs of trees, so thick that she was as well thatched
as a house ; and thus we waited for the months of November and December,
in which I designed to make my adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of my design
returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage; and
the first thing I did was to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, being the

u
store for our voyage; and intended in a week or a'fortnight's time, to open
the dock, and launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon something
of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and
see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we generally got once
a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been
.long gone when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and
before I had time to speak to him, he cries out to me, " 0 Master! 0 Master!
0 sorrow! O bad!"---"What's the matter, Friday?" says I. "O yonder
there," says he, "one, two, three canoes; one, two, three!" By this way of
speaking, I concluded there were six ; but on inquiry I found there were but
three. f'Well, Friday," says I, " do not be frighted." So I heartened him up
as-well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared,
for nothing ran in his head but that they were come to look for him, and
would cut' him in pieces and eat him ; and the poor fellow trembled so that
I scarcely knew what to do with him; Icomforted him as well as I could,
and told him I was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me
as well as him.' " But," says 'I, " F riday, we must resolve to fight them. Can
you fight, FridayP"--"Me shoot," says he, " but there come many great
number."--"No matter for that," said I again; " our guns will fright them
that we do not kill." 50 I asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him,
he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him. He said,
"Me die, when you bid die, Master." So I went and fetched a good dram
'of rum and'gave him ; for I had been so good a husband of my rum, that I
'had a great deal left. When he had drunk it, I made him take the two
fowling-pieces, which we always carried, and load them with large swan-shot,
as big as small pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded them
with two slugs, and five small bullets each; and my two pistols I loaded with
a brace of bullets each: I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side,
and gave Friday his hatchet.

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective-glass, and went
up to the side of the hill, to see what I could discover ; and I found quickly
by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and
three canoes; and that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant
banquet upon these three human bodies; a barbarous feast, indeed, but
nothing more than, as I had observed, was usual with them. I observed
also, that they had landed, not where they had done when Friday made his
escape, but nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and where a thickA CANNIBAL BANQUEZ 147

'wood came almost close down to the sea; this, with the abhorrcnce of the.
inhuman errand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation
that I came down again to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go down
to them, and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He
had now got over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised with the
-dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and told me, as before, he would
die when I bid die

In this fit of fury I divided the arms, which I had charged, as before,
'between us; Igave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
upon his shoulder, and I took one pistol and three guns myself; and in this
posture we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullets; and as to orders, I
charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir or shoot, or do anything
'till I bid him, and in the mean time not to speak a word; in this posture I
fetched a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the
~creek as to get into the wood, so that I could come within shot of them
before I should be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy
*to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning, I began to
abate my resolution: I do not mean that I entertained any fear of their
number, for, as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I was
.superior to them; nay, though I had been alone. But it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less what necessity, I was in to go
.and dip my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done nor
intended me any wrong? These things were so warmly pressed upon my
'thoughts all the way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and place
myself near them that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would
-act then as God should direct; but that unless something offered that was
more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and, with all. possible wariness and
silence, Friday following closely at my heels, I marched till I came to the
skirt of the wood on the side which was next to them, only that one corner
-of the wood lay between me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade
hi.n go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there plainly what
'they were doing. He did so, and came immediately back to me, and told
me that they might be plainly viewed there--that they were all about their
.fire eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound
upon the sand allittle from them, whom he said they would kill next; and

i this fired the very soul within me. He told me it was not one of their nation,.
but one of the bearded men he told me of, that came to their country in their'
boat. .I was filled with horror at the very naming of the white bearded man ;.
and going to the tree, I saw plainly by my glass a white man, who lay upon
the beach. of the sea with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things like
rushes, and that he was a European, and had clothes on.

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about fifty yards
nearer to them than the place where I Was, which, by going a. little way'
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and that then I should be:
within half a-shot of-them; so I withheld my passion, though I was indeed'.
enraged to the highest degree; and going back about twenty paces, I got
behind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree, and
then came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view of them, at the-
distance of about eighty yards. '

I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of the dreadful wretches sat
upon the ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the other two
to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to their'
fire, and they were stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned
to F riday. " Now, Friday," said I, " do as I bid thee." Friday said he
would. "Then, Friday," says I, " do exactly as you see me do; fail in
nothing." So I set down 'one of the muskets and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his, and with the other musket I took my
aim at the savages, bidding him do the like; then asking him if he was ready,.
,he said "Yes." "Then fire," and at the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side that he shot
he killed two of them, and wounded three more; and on my side I killed
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful conster-
nation: and all of them that were not hurt jumped upon their'feet, but did.
hot immediately know which way to run, or which way to look, for they knew
not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon
me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did; so, as soon as the
first shot was made, I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece,.
and Friday did the like; he saw me cock and present; he did the same again:
"Are you ready, Friday?" said_ I. "Yes," says he. " Let fly, then," says I,.
"in the name of God !" and with that I fired again among the amazed
'wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaded with what
I'call swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only two drop ; but soThe Remmi Spaniard.
many were wounded, that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody, and most of them miserably wounded ; whereof three
more fell quickly after, though not q'uite dead.

"Now, Friday," says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and taking up
the musket which was yet loaded, " follow me," which he did with a great deal
of courage; upon which I rushed out of the wood and showed myself, and
Friday close at my feet; as soon as I perceived that they saw me, I shouted
as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too, and running as fast as I could, >>
'which by the way was not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made
directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying upon the beach or
:shore, between the place where they sat and the sea; the two butchers who
.were just going to work with him had left him at the surprise of our first fire,
:and fled in a terrible fright to the sea--side, and had jumped into a canoe, and
.three more of the rest made the same way. I turned to Friday, and bade
him step forwards and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and
running about forty yards, to be nearer them, he shot at them ; and I thought
.he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall of a heap into the boat, though
'I saw two of them up again quickly; however, he killed two of them, and
'wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had
'been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them,I pulled out my knife and cut the
flags that bound the poor victim ; and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him
:up, and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he was. He answered in
Latin, " Christianus ;" but was so weak and faint that he could scarce stand
'or speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it himeaking signs
'that he should drink, which he did ; and I gave him a piece of.bread, which
he ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was, and he said " Espagnole ;"
.and being a little recovered, let me know, by all the signs he could possibly
:make, how much he was in my debt for his deliverance. " Se'ignior," said I,
with as much Spanish as I could make up, " we will talk afterwards, but we
:must fight now : if you have any strength left, take this pistol and sword, and
lay about you." He took them very thankfully ; and no sooner had he the
:arms in his hands, but, as if they had put new vigour into him, he flew upon
Zhis murderers like a fury, and had cut two of them in pieces in an instant;
{or the truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures
'were so much frighted with the noise of our pieces that they fell down for
.mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt their own
\escape, than their flesh had to resist our shot: and that was the case of those
five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as three of them fell with the-hurt
they received, so the other two fell with the fright. -

I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, being willing to keep'my'
charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so I
called to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired,..
and fetch the arms which lay there that had been discharged, which he did
with great swiftness ; and then giving him my musket, I sat down myself to--
load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they wanted. While
I was loading these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement between the
Spaniard and one of the savages, who made at him with one of their great.
wooden swords, the weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not_-
prevented it. The .Spaniard, who was as bold and brave as could be-
imagined, though weak, had fought the Indian a good while, and had cut two
great wounds on his head ; but the savage being a stout, lusty fellow, closing; '
in with him, had thrown him down, being faint, and was wringing my sword.
out of his hand_; when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting the.-
sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and
killed him upon the spot, before I, who was running to help him, could come:
near him.

Friday, being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying wretches with no>>
weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; and with that he despatched those three

- could come up with z and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him;
.one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the savages, and,
wounded them both ; but, as he was not able to run, they both got from him-
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of them, but the
other was too nimble for him ; and though he was wounded, yet plunged into>>
the sea, and swam with all his might off to those two who were left in the-
canoe ; which three in the canoe, with one wounded, that we knew not.
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our hands, of one and twenty.
The account of the whole is as follows:--three killed at our first shot from
the tree ; two killed at the next shot ; two killed by Friday in the boat ; two-
killed by Friday of those at first wounded; one killed by Friday in the wood ;.
three killed by the Spaniard; four killed, being found dropped here and there,.
of the wounds, or killed by F riday in his chase of them ; four escaped in the,-
boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead--twenty-one in all.

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun-shot, anci
though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit any-FRIDAY RESCUES HIS FA THER. 151'

of them. Friday would fain have had me take one of their canoes, and pursue
them; and, indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the
news home to their people, they should come back perhaps with two or three
hundred of the canoes, and devour us by mere multitude; so I consented to
pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes,I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to find
another poor creature lie there, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was,
for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what was the
matter; for he had not been able to look up over the side of the boat, he was
tied so hard neck and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really but
little life in him.

. I immediately cut the twisted flags or rushes, which they had bound him
with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand or speak, but
groaned most piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was only unbound in
order to be killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and
tell him of his deliverance; and pulling;r out my bottle, made him give the
poor wretch a dram ; which, with'the news of his being delivered, revived
him, and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday came to hear him speak,
and look in his face, it would have moved any one to tears to have seen how
Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed,
jumped about, danced, sung ; then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own
face and head; and then sung and jumped about again like a distracted
creature. It was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell
me-what was the matter ; but when he came a little to himself, he told me
that it was his father.

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see what ecstasy and
filial affection had worked in this poor savage at the sight of his father, and of
his being delivered. from death ; nor, indeed, can I describe half the ex-
travagances of his affection after this ; for he went into the boat, and out of
the boat, a great many times : when he went into him, he would sit down by
him, open his breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom for many
minutes together, to nourish it; then he took his arms and ankles, which were
numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his
hands ; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of.my
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of good.

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the other savages,
who were now almost out of sight ; and it was happy {or us that we did not,
for it blew so hard within two hours after, and before they could be got a
quarter-of their way, and continued blowing so hard all the night, and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that I could not suppose their
boat could liVe, or that they ever reached their own coast.

But to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father, that 'I could not
find in my heart to take him off for some time; but after I thought he could
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping and laughing,
and pleased to the highest extreme. Then I asked him if he had given his
father any bread. He shook his head, and said, " None ; ugly dog eat all up
self." So I gave him a cake of bread, out of a little pouch I carried on
purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself ; but he would not taste it, but
carried it to his father. I had in my pocket, also, two or three bunches of
raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner
given his father these raisins, but I'saw him come out of the boat, and run
away as if he had been bewitched (for he was the swiftest fellow on his feet
that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate that he was out of sight, as it
were, in an instant; and though I called, and hallooed out too, after him, it

'.was all one; away he went; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come
back again, though not so fast as he went; and, as he came nearer, I found
his pace slacker because he had something in his hand. When he came up
to me, I found he had been quite home for an earthen jug or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water, and that he had got two more cakes or loaves of
bread. The bread he gave me, but the water he carried to his father; how-
ever, as I was _very thirsty too, 1 took a little of it ; this water revived his father
'more than all the rum or spirits I had given him, {or he was fainting with
thirst. ~
' When his father had drunk, I called to him to know if there was any water
left. He said, " Yes ; " and I bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was
-in as much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the cakes that Friday
brought to the Spaniard, too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place under the shade of a tree ; and whose limbs were
also very stiff, and very much swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied
with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming to him with the water, he sat
up and drank, and took the bread and began to eat, I went to him and gave
him a handful of raisins ; he looked up in my face with all the tokens of
gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance; but was so
weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, that he could
not stand upon his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but was really
not able, his ankles were so swelled and so painful to him ; so I bade him sitMY NEWSUByECTS. 153

still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had
(lone his father's.

I observed the poor affectionate creature, every two minutes, or perhaps
less, all the while he was here, turn his head about, to see if his father was in
the same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at last he found he
was not to be seen; at which he started up, and, without speaking a word,
flew with that swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive his feet to
touch the ground as he went : but when he came, he only found he had lain
himself down to ease his limbs. So Friday came back to me presently, and
then I spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, if he could, and lead
him to the boat, and then he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him; but Friday, a lusty young fellow,'took the Spaniard upon
his back, and carried him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon the
side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the inside of it; and then lifting
'him quite in, he set him close to his father; and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk,
though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he brought them both safe into our
creek, and leaving them in the boat, ran away to fetch the other canoe. ' As'
he passed me I spoke to him, and asked him whither he went. He told me,
" Go fetch more boat ; " so away he went like the wind, for sure never man or-

- horse ran like him ; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon
as I got to it by land. 50 he waited me over, and then went to help our new
guests out of the boat, which he did ; but they were neither of them able to
walk; so that poor Friday knew not what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling to Friday to bid
them sit down on the bank while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand-
barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them both up together upon
'it between us; but when we got them to the outside of our wall, or fortifica-
tion, we were at a worse loss than before, for it was impossible to get them
over, and I was resolved not to break it down; so I set to work again, and
Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made a very handsome tent, covered
'with old sails, and above that with boughs of trees, being in the space without
our outward fence, and between that and the grove of young wood which I
'had planted ; and here we made two beds of such things as I had--of good
'rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover them,
on each bed.

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich in subjects;
and it was a merry reflection, which I frequently made, how like a king Iwwwx--m

154 R OBINS 01V CR USOE.

looked. First of all, the whole country was my own property, so that I had
an undoubted right of dominion; secondly, my people were perfectly sub-
'Je'cted; _I was absolute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to me,
and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for it, for
me; it was remarkable, too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three
different religions. My man Friday was a Protestant, his father was a Pagan
and a cannibal, and the Spaniard was a Papist. However, I allowed liberty
of conscience throughout my dominions. '

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and given them
shelter, and a place to rest- them upon, ,I began .to think of making some pro--
vision for them ; and the first thing I did, I ordered Friday to take'a yearling
goat, betwixt-a kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed; when
I cut off the hinder--quarter, and chopping it into' small pieces, I set Friday to
work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good dish, I assure you,

of flesh and broth (having put some barley and rice also into thebroth), and
as I cooked it 'without doors (for I made no fire within my inner wall), so I
carried it all into the new tent, and having set a table there for them, I sat
doWn, and ate my own dinner also with them, and, as Well as I could, cheered
them and encouraged them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and, indeed, to the Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language
of the savages pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to take one of the
canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other fire-arms, which, for want of
time,-we had left upon the place of battle ; and the next day, I ordered him
to go and bury the dead bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and
would presently be offensive ; and I also ordered him to bury the horrid
remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not think of doing myself;
nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that way; all which he punctually
performed, and defaced the very appearances of the savages being there; so
- that when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two new subjects ;
and first, I set Friday to inquire of his father what he thought of the escape-
of the savages in that canoe, and whether we might expect a return of them,
with a power too great for us to resist. His first opinion was, that the
savages in the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night they
went off, but must, of necessity, be drowned, or driven south to those other
7 shores, where they were as sure to be devoured as they were to be drowned ifTHE SPAIVIAA'D'S STORY. 155

they were cast away; but, as to what they would do if they came safe on
shore, he said he knew not ; but, it was his opinion, that they were so dread-
fully frightcd with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire,
that he believed they would tell the people they were all killed_by thunder-
and lightning. not by the hand of man; and that the two which appeared
vim, Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits, or furies, come down to destroy
them, and not men with weapons. This, he said he knew; because he heard
them all cry out so, in their language, one to another; for it was impossible
for them to conceive that a man could dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill
at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now. And this_old
savage was in the right, for, as I understood since, by other hands, the savages.
never attempted to go over to the island afterwards, they were so terrified
with the accounts given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the'
sea), that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would be de---
stroyed with fire from the gods. This, however, I knew not, and therefore
was under continual apprehensions for a good while, and kept always.
upon my guard, with all my army; for, as there were now four of us, I would.
have ventured upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field, at any
time. '

In a little time, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear of their coming
wore off, and I began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main.
into consideration, being likewise assured by Friday's father that I might:
depend upon good 'usage from their nation, on his account, if I would go.
But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious discourse with
the Spaniard, and when I understood that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast away and made their
escape to that side,1ived there at peace, indeed, with the savages, but were
very sore put to it for necessaries, and, indeed, for life. I asked him all the
particulars of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship, bound from
_ the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna,being directed to leave their loading
there, which was chiefly hides and silver,-and to bring back what European
goods they could meet with there ; that they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another wreck ; that five of their own men were
drowned when first the ship was lost, and that these escaped through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast,where
they expected to have been devoured every moment. He told me they had .
some arms with them, but they were perfectly useless, for that they had
neither powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having spoiled all their
' powder, but a little,'which they used at first landing, to provide themselves
with some food. v

. I asked him what he thought would become of them there, and if they had
formed any design of making their escape. He said they had many consul-
tations about it; but that having neither vessel, nor tools to build one, nor
provisions of any kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair. I
asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal from me, which
might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done. I told him with freedom, I feared mostly their treachery and ill-
usage of me, if I put my life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent
virtue in the nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings by the
obligations they had received, so much as they did. by the advantages they
expected. I told him it would be very hard that I should be the instrument
of their deliverance, and that they should afterwards make me their prisoner
in New Spain, where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what
.necessity, or what accident soever brought him thither ; and that I had rather

be delivered up to the savages, and be devoured alive, than fall into the merci- '

-Iess-c1aws of the priests, and be carried into the Inquisition. I added that,
otherwise, I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many
hands,-build a barque large enough to carry us all away, either to the Brazils
southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast northward; but that if, in
tequital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands, carry me by
force among their own people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them,
and make my case worse than it was before.

> He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuity, that their con-
dition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that should con-
tribute to their deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them, with
.th'e old man, and discourse with them about it, and return again, and bring
me their answer; . that he would make conditions with them upon their
solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my direction, as their
commander and captain; and they should swear upon the holy sacraments
-.and gospel to be true to me, and go to such-Christian country as I should
agree to, and no other; and to be directed _wholly and absolutely by my
orders, till they were landed safely in such country as I intended; and that
.he would bring a contract from them, under their hands, for that purpose.
"Then he told me he would first swear to me himself, that he would never stir
from me as long as he lived, till I gave him order ; and that he would takeHUSBANDRY. 15 7

my side to the last drop of his blood, if there should happen the least breach
of faith among his countrymen. He told me they were all of them very civil,
honest men, and they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having -
neither weapons nor clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of
the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and
that he was sure, if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die
by me.

Upon these assurances,I resolved to venture to relieve them, if possible,
and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat. But
when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard himself started
an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied with it ;
and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least half
a year. The case was thus: he had been with us now about a month, during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assist-
ance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn-
and rice I had laid up ; which, though it was more than sufficient for myself,
yet it was not sufl-icient, without good husbandry, for my family, now it was
increased to four; but much less would it be sufl'icient if his countrymen, who
were, as he said, sixteen, still alive, should come over; and, least of all, would
it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to
any of the Christian colonies of America. So he told me he thought it would
be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate some more
land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we should wait another
harvest, that we might have a supply of corn for his countrymen, when they
should come ; for want might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to
think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another.

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not
but be very well pleased at his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his
fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the wooden tools we
were furnished with permitted ;' and, in about a month's time, by the end of
which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed up, as
we sowed two and twenty bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice,
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave
ourselves barely sufficient for our own food for the six months that we had to
expect our crop; that is to say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside

for sowing ; for it is not to 'be supposed it is six months in the ground in that
country. ' I
Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient to put us out
of fear of the-savages, if they had' come, unless their number had been very
great. we went freely all over the island, whenever 'we found occasion ; and as
we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at
least for me, to have the means of it out of mine; to this purpose, I marked
out several trees, which I thought fit for our woxk, and I set Friday and his '-
father to cut them down; and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom. I im-
parted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and direct their work ; I showed
them with what indefatigable pains I had heaved a large tree into single
planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they made about a dozen large
planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five feet .long, and from two
inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour it took up, any one may
imagine. '

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats as .
much as I could; and for. this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go
out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our turns),
and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the rest;
for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our
flock; but, above all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I caused
such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I believe, had we
been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured, we could have filled
sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread, was a great part of our
{ood--very good living, too, I assure you, for it is exceedingly nourishing food.-

It was 'now' harVest, and our crop in good order ; it was not the most
plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it ~was enough to
~ answer our end. When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of
corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, 71225., great baskets, in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and
often blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this kind of
work; but I saw no need of it. And now, having a full supplypf food for
all the 'guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main,
to see what he could do with those he had left behind him there. I gave him
a strict charge in writing not to bring any men who would not first swear, in
the presence of himself and the old savage, that they would in no way injure,
fight with, or attack the person they should find in the island, who was so
kind as to send for them in order to their deliverance ; but that they would
stand by him and defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they
went, would be entirely under and subjected to his command ; and that thisMY AAIBASSADOR'S DEPARTURE. L :59

should be put in'writing, and signed with their hands : how we were to have
this done, when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which
we never aleed. Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage,
the father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be
said 'to have come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners
to be devoured by the savages. I gave each 'of them a musket, with a fire-
lock on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be
very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon irrgent
occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me, in view of
my deliverance, for now 27 years and some days. I gave them provisions
of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for many days, and
sufficient for all the Spaniards for about eight days' time; and wishing them
a good voyage, I saw them go. They went away, with a fair gale, on the day
that the moon was at full, by my account in the month of October ; but as for
an exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be sure
I was right; though, as it proved, when I afterwards examined my account,
I und I had kept a true reckoning of years. .

t was no less than eight days I waited for them, when a strange and'
unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard
pf in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, "Master, Master, they are

'come, they are come!" I jumped up, and, regardless of danger; I went, as
Soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way,
was by this time grown to be a very thick wood ; I say, regardless of danger,
I went without my arms, which was not my custom to do : but I was surprised,
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league
and a half distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder-of-mutton sail,
as they call it, and 'the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in: also I
observed presently, that they did not come from that side which the shore lay
on, but from the southernmost end of the island. Upon this I called Friday
in, and bade him lie close, for these were not the people we looked for, and
that we might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies. In the
next place, I went in to fetch my perspective-glass, to see what I could make
of them; and, having taken the ladder out, I climbed up_to the top of the

hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my
view'the plainer, without being discovered. '
Ihad scarce set my foot upon the hill, when my eye plainly discofiered a.
ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues'and a half distance from me,
SSE, but not above a league and a half from the shore. By my obstrvation,
it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appeared to be an '
English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in ; though the joy of seeing a ship,
and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen,
and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe ; but yet I had some '
secret doubts hung about me--I cannot tell from whence they came--bidding
me keep ixpon my guard; for that I had better continue as I was, than fall
into the hands of thieves and murderers. _

-I.saw the boat draw hear the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust
in at, for the convenience of landing; however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but
ran their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me; which
was very happy for me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my
door, as I may say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and
perhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they were on shore, I was
fully satisfied they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or tw.I
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven men,
whereof three of them I found were unarmed, and, as I thought, bound ; and
when the first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they took those
three out of the boat, as prisoners. One of the three I could perceive using
the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind'
of extravagance ; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands some:
times, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what the meaning of it
should be. Friday called out to me in English, as well as he could, "0
Master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as savage mans."---" Why,"
said I, :' Friday; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed ; but you may be
sure they will not eat them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood
trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up
his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to strike one of
the poor men ; and I expected to see him {all every moment ;' at which all
the-blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I wished heartily now
for the Spaniard, and the savage that was gone with him, or that I had anyENGLISH V151 TORS. 16 r

way to have come undiscovered, within shot of them, that I might have
secured the three men, for I saw no fire-arms they had among them; but it
fell out to my mind another way. After I had observed the outrageous usage
of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows run scattering
about the island, as if they wanted to see the country. I observed that the
three other men had liberty to go also where they pleased; but they sat
down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked like men in despair.

It was just at high water when these people came on shore; and while they
rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly
stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away,-
leaving their boat aground. They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drunk a little too much brandy, fell asleep; how-
ever, one of them waking a little sooner than the other, and finding the boat
too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed out for the rest, who were stragg-
ling about; upon which they all soon came to the boat: but it was past all
their strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that
side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand. In this condition, like
true seamen, who are, perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they strolled about the country again; and I
heard one of them say aloud to another, calling them off from the boat,
" Why, let her alone, Jack, can't you ? she'll float next tide ; " by which I was
fully confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were. All this
while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my castle any
farther than to my place of observation, near the top of the hill: and very
glad I was to think how well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten
hours before the boat could float again, and by that time it would be
dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions, and to hear their
discourse, if they had any.

In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, though with
more caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of enemy than I had at
first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made.an excellent marksman with
his gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and
I gave him three muskets; my figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my
formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked
sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design not to have made any attempt till it was dark; but about
two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that they were all gone
straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid down to sleep; the three

poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get any sleep, were,
however, sat down under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a
mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon this I
resolved to discover myself to them, and learn something of their condition.
Immediately I marched as above, my'man Friday at a good distance behind
. me,as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring at spectre~ .
like figure as I did. I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then,
before any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What are
ye, gentlemen ?" They started up at the noise, but were ten times more
confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made. They
made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly from
me, when I spoke to them in English.

" Gentlemen," said I, "do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may have
a friend near, when you did not expect it."

"He must-be sent directly from Heaven, then," said one of them very
gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me; "for our
condition is past the help of man}?

"All help is from Heaven, sir," said I : " but can you put a stranger in the
way to help you ? for you seem to be in some great distress. I saw you when
you landed; and when you seemed to make application to 'the brutes that
came with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you."

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking
like one astonished, returned--

"Am I talking to God, or man ? Is it a real man, or an angel ?"

" Be in no fear about that, sir," said I ; " if God had sent an angel to relieve
you, he would have come better clothed, and armed after another manner than.
you see me in ; pray lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and
disposed to assist you ; you see I have one servant only; we have arms and
ammunition ; tell us freely, can we serve you? What is your case P "

" Our case, sir," said he, " is too long to tell you, while our murderers are so
near us; but, in short, sir, I was commander of that ship: my men have
mutinied against me; they have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me,
and. at last, have set me on shore in this desolate place, with these two men
with me--one my mate, the other a passenger; where we expected to perish,
believing the place to be uninhabited, and know not what to think of it."

".Where are those brutes, your enemies," said I ; " do you know where they
are gone ? " ' . .

"There they lie, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; " my heartTHE M U TINEERS. I 63

'trembles for fear they have seen us, and heard you speak ; if they have, they
'will certainly murder us all."

" Have they any fire-arms ? " said I.

"They had only two pieces," he answered, " one of which they left in the boat."

" Well, then," said I, " leave the rest to me; I see they are all asleep; it is
(an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them prisoners ?"

He told me there were two desperate villains among them that it was scarce
:safe to show any mercy to ; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest
'would return to their duty. I asked him which they were. He told me he
could not at that distance distinguish them, but he would obey my orders in
-everything I would direct.

" Well, " says I, " let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake,
:and we will resolve further."

So they willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us from them.

" Look you, sir,' 'said I, "if I venture upon your deliverance, are you willing
'to make two conditions with me ?" He anticipated my proposals by telling
'me that both he and the ship, if recovered,should be wholly directed and com-
'manded by me in everything; and if the ship was not recovered, he would
'live and die with me in what part of the world soever I would send him ; and
'the two other men said the same.

"Well," says I, " my conditions are but two: first--that while you stay in
'this island with me, you will not pretend to any authority here ; and 'if I put
.arms in your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do

no prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the mean time be governed
'by my orders; secondly--that if the ship is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and my man to England passage free."

He gave me all the assurance that the invention or faith of man could
devise, that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and,
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions as
long as he lived. "Well, then," said I, "here are three muskets for you, with
'powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done." He
showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able, but offered to be
wholly guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing anything ,
1but the best method I could think of was to fire on them at once as they lay,
.and if any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we might
save them, and so put it wholly upon God' 5 providence to direct the shot. He
'said, very modestly, that he was loth to kill them, if he could help it ; but that
ithose two were incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny
in the ship, and if' they escaped, we should be undone still, for they would go
on board and brihg the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. "Well,
then," says I, " necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way to save
our lives." However, seeing him still cautious of shedding blood, I told him
they should go themselves, and manage as they found convenient.

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon after
we saw two'of them on their feet. I asked if either of them were the men-
who, he had said, were the heads of the mutiny. He said, "No."--"Well,,
then," said I, " you may-let them escape ; and Providence seems to have
awakened them on purpose to save themselves. Now," says I, " if the rest.
escape you, it is your'fault." Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him,.
with each a piece in his hand. .The two men who were with him going first
made some noise, at which one of the seamen, who was awake, turned aboutr
and seeing them coming, cried out to the rest ; but it was too late then, for'
the moment he cried out they fired, I mean the two men, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men they
knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and the other very much
wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and called eagerly
for help to the other; but the captain stepping up to him, told him it was too
late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his villany, and with
thatword knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so that he never'
spoke more: there were three more in the company, and one of them was
slightly wounded ; by this time I was come; and when they saw their danger,
and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told.
them he would spare their lives if they would give him an assurance of their
abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear to be
faithful to him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the protestations of their
sincerity that could be desired ; and he was willing to believe them, and spare
their lives, which I was not against ; only that I obliged him to keep them
bound hand and foot while they were upon the island.

While this was doing; I sent Friday with the captain's mate to the boat,
with orders to secure her, and bring away the cars and sail, which they did ;.
and byrand-by three straggling men, that were (happily for them) parted from
the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing the captain, who

was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound
also, and so our victory was complete.
It now remained that the captain and Ishould inquire into one another's
circumstances. I began first, and told him my whole history, which he heard
with an attention even to amazement, and particularly at the wonderful man-
ner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition; and, indeed, as
my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply ; but when
he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to have been pre-
served there on purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his face, and he
-could not speak a work more. After this communication was at an end, I
~carried him and his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where
I came out, wk, at the top of the house; where I refreshed him with such
provision as I had, and showed them all the contrivances I had made during
my long, long inhabiting that place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing ; but above
all, the captain admired my fortifications ; and how perfectly I had concealed
my retreat with a grove of trees, which, having been now planted nearly
:twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in England, was become
a little wood, and so thick that it was impassable in any part of it but at that
one side where I had reserved my little winding passage into it: this I told
him was my castle and my residence; but thatI had a seat in the country,
.as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show
him that, too, another time; but at present our business was to consider how
'to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to that, but told me he was
perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were still six and
twenty hands on board, who, having entered into a cursed conspiracy, by
'which they had all forfeited their lives to the law, would be hardened in it now
.by desperation; and would carry it on, knowing that if they were subdued
:they would be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England, or to
.any of the English colonies; and that, therefore, there would be no attacking
'them with so small a number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it was a very
rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on
:speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their surprise;
.as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us: upon this, it presently
'occurred to me that in a little while the ship's crew, wondering what was
become of their comrades and of the boat, would certainly come on shore in
(their other boat to look for them, and that then, perhaps, they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed to be rational. Upon this,
J1 told him the first thing we had to do was to stave the boat, which lay upon
the beach, so that they might not carry her off; and taking everything out of'
. her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit to,swim ; accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and whatever else'-
we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a feW'
biscuit-cakes,'a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece of canvas-
(the sugar was five or six pounds) ; all which was very welcome to me,.
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for many years..

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail, and,
rudder of the boat were carried before),we knocked a great hole in her bottom,.
that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry
off the boat. Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we could be able-
to recover the ship , but my view was, that if they went away without the
boat, I did not much question to make her again fit to carry us to the Leeward'
Islands, and call upon our friends the Spaniards in my way.

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main strength,
heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide w0uld not float her of
at high-water mark; and besides, had broken a hole 1n her bottom too big to
be quickly stopped, and were sat down musing what we should do, we heard:
the ship fire agun, and make a waft with her ancient, as a signal for the boat.
to come on board : but no boat stirred; and they fired several times, making'
other signals for the boat. At last, when all their signals and firing proved:
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my-
glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as.
they approached, that'there were no less than ten men in her, and that they-
had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of."
them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the tide.-
having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rode up under shore,.
to come to the same place where the other had landed, and where the boat:
lay. By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the captain knew
the persons and characters of all the men in the boat, of whom, he said, there--
were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy-
by the rest, being overpowered and frightened. But that as for the boat>>
swain, who it seems was the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they'
were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no doubt made desperate.-
in their new enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be-
too powerful for us. I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circum--
stances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost every conditionPREPARING FOR ACTION. 167

that could be was better than that which we were supposed to be in, we ought
to expect that the consequences, whether death or life, would be sure to be a
deliverance. I asked him what he thought of the circumstance of my life, and
whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for.

"And where, sir," said I, " is your belief of my being preserved here on
purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little while ago? For my
part," said I, " there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it."

" What is that?" says he.

"Why," said I, " it is that, as you say, there are three or four honest fellows
among them, which should be spared; had they been all of the wicked part
of the crew, I should have thought God's providence had singled them out to
deliver them into your hands; for depend upon it, every man that comes
ashore is our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us."

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it
greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business : we had, upon '
the first appearance of the boats coming from the ship, considered of separating
our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured them effectually.

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent
with F riday, and one of the three delivered men, to my cave, where they were
remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding
their way out of the woods, if they could have delivered themselves; here they
left them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised them, if they'con-
tinued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or two; but that if
they attempted their escape, they should be put to death without mercy.
They promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were
very thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light
left them ; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for their
comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them at the
entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned, '
indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other two
were taken into my service, upon the captain's recommendation, and upon
their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and the three
honest men we were seven men, well armed ; and I made no doubt we should
be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering that
the captain had said there were three or four honest men among' them also.
As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, they ran their
boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after them ;
which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat
at an anchor some distance from the shore, with some hands in her, to guard
her, and so we should not be able to seize the boat. Being on shore, the first
thing they did, they ran all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they
were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in
her, and a great hole in her bottom. After they had mused awhile upon this,
they set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if
they could inake their companions hear; but all was to no purpose. Then they
came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms, which, indeed,
we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring: but it was aLl one; those in
the cave, we were sure, could not hear ; and those in our keeping, though they
heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer to them. They were so
astonished at the surprise of this. that as they told us afterwards, they resolved
to go all on board again to their ship, and let them' know that the men were
all murdered, and the long-boat staved ; accordingly, they immediately launched
their boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, believing
they would go on board the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
over fer lest, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in hopes we
should have recovered ; but he was quickly as much frighted the other
way.

They had not been long put ofi' with the boat, when we perceived them all
.coming on shore again ; but with this new measure in their conduct, which it
seems they consulted together upon, visa, to leave three men in the boat, and
the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows.

This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at a loss what to
do, as our seizing those seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if
we let the boat escape, because they would row away to the ship, and then
the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail, and so our recovering
the ship would be lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present: the seven men came on shore, and
the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good distance from the
shore, and came to an anchor to .wait for them ; so that it was impossible for
us to come at them in the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation lay;
and we could see them plainly, though they could not perceive us : we should

'have been very glad if they would have come nearer to us, so that we might
have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we might
come abroad. But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they
could see a great way into the valleys and woods, which lay towards the
north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed
till they were weary : and not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore,
nor far from one another, they sat down together, under a tree to consider it:
had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them
had done, they had done the job {or us; but they were too full of appre-
hensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell what
the danger was they had to fear.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of
theirs, visa, that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to
make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon them just at the
juncture when their pieces ivere all discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal, provided
it was done while we were near enough to come up to them before they could
load their pieces again. But this event did not happen; and we lay still a
long time, very irresolutc what course to take; at length, I told them there
would be nothing done, in my opinion, till night; and then, if they did not;
return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the
shore, and so might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on
shore. We waited a great while, though very impatient for their removing ;
and were very uneasy, when, after a long consultation, we saw them all start
up, and march down towards the sea: it seems they had such dreadful appre-
hensions of the danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the
ship again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their
intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be as it
really was, that they had given over their search, and were going back again ;
and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the
apprehensions of it: but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them
back again, and which answered my end to a tittle. I ordered Friday and
the captain's mate to go over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was rescued, and so soon as
they came to a little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, I bade them
halloo out, as loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard
them; that as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they should
return it again ; and then, keepingr out of sight, take a round, always answer-
ing when the others hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among
the woods as possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I
directed them.

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed ;
and they presently heard them, and, answering, ran along the shore westward,
towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the creek, where,
the water being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to come
up and set them over ; as, indeed, I expected. When they had set themselves:
over, I observed that the boat being gone a good way into the creek, and, as
it were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of the three men out oF
her, to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened her
to astump of a little tree on the shore. This was what I wished for; and
immediately leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I took
the rest with me; and, crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the
two men before they were aware--one of them lying on the shore, and the
other being in the boat ; the fellow on shore was between sleeping and
waking, and going to start up; the captain, who was foremost, 'ran in upon
him, and knocked'him down ; and then called out to him in the boat to yield,
or he was a dead man. There needed very few arguments to persuade a.
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down ; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three who were not so
hearty in the muti'ny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded
not only to yield, but afterwards to join very sincerely with us. In the mean
time Friday and the captain's mate so well managed their business with the'
rest, that they drew them, by hallooing and answering. from one hill to another,
and from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left.
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to their boat before-
it was dark ; and. indeed, they were heartily tired themselves also, by the
time they came back to us. -

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall
upon them, so as to make sure work with them. It was several hours after
Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat ; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those
behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and complain how
lame and tired they were, and not able to go any faster: which was very
welcome news to us. At length they came up to the boat ; but it is impossible
to express their confusion when they found the boat aground in the creek, the
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone; we could hear them call one to
another in the most lamentable manner, telling one another they were gotTHE RUSE SUCCESSFUL. 171'

into an enchanted island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they'
should all be murdered, or else there were devils and spirits in it, and they
should be all carried away and devoured. They hallooed again, and called
their two comrades by their names a great many times; but no answer. After
some time, we could see them by the little light there was,run about, wringing"
their hands like men in despair; and sometimes they would go and sit down
in the boat to rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk about again,,
and so the same thing over again. My men would fain have had me give-
them leave to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take-
them at some advantage, so as to spare them, and kill as few of them as I
could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men,,
knowing the others were very well armed. I resolved to wait, to see if they-
did not separate; and therefore, to make sure of them,I drew my ambus-
cade nearer; and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their'
hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not be
discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly, before they offered:
to fire.

They had not been long in that posture, when the boatswain, who was:
the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most
dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them, with two
more of the crew. The captain was so eager at having this principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come so--
near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before: but when
they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at
them. The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man was shot in-
the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till an hour or two after;
and the third ran for it. At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced'
with my whole army, which was now eight men ; via, myself, generalissimo ;-
Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two men, and the three
prisoners of war whom we had trusted with arms. We came upon them,,
indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see our number; and I 'made the
man they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name,.
to try if I could bring them to a parley, and so perhaps might reduce them to
terms; which fell out just as we desired : for, indeed, it was easy to think, as
their condition then was, they would be very willing to capitulate. So he-
calls out as loud as he could to one of them, "Tom Smith! Tom Smith !"'
.Tom Smith answered immediately, " Is that Robinson ?" for it seems he knew
the voice. The other answered, "Ay, ay ; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw
down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men this moment."--" Who
must we yield to? Where are they?" says Smith again. " Here they are,"
says he ; "here's our captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you
these two hours; the boatswain is killed, Will Fry is wounded, and I am a
prisoner; and if you do not yield you are all lost."-----"Will they give us
quarter then?" says Tom Smith, " and we will. yield."--"I'll go and ask, if
you promise to yield," said Robinson: so he asked the captain. And the
captain himself then calls out, " You, Smith, you know my voice ; if you lay
_-down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but
Will Atkins."

Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, " F or God's sake, captain, give me quarter;
what have I done ?. They have all been as bad as I" (which, by the way,
was not true ; for, it seems, this Will Atkins was the first man that laid hold
of the captain, when they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying
,his hands, and giving him injurious language) : however, the captain told him
he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the Governor's mercy:
'by which he meant me, for they all called me Governor. In a word, they all
laid down their arms, and begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound them all ; and then my great
army of fifty then. which, with those three, were in all but eight, came up and
seized upon them, and upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one
more out of sight, for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship ; and

as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated
with them upon the villainy of their practices with him, and at length upon
the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must bring them
to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. They all
appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives. As for that, he told
them they were not his prisoners, but the commander's of the island ; that
"they thought they had set him on shore in a barren, uninhabited island ; but
it had pleased God so to direct them, that it was inhabited, and that the
.Governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them all there, if he
pleased; but, as he had given them all quarter, he supposed he would send
them to England, to be dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins,
'whom he was commanded by the Governor to advise to prepare for death ;
for that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect ;.
Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede with the Governor
for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God's sake, that they might
not be sent to England.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was come, and that
it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in getting
possession of the ship ; so I retired in the dark from them, that they might
not see what kind of 3 Governor they had, and called the captain to me ; when
Icalled, as at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again,
and say to the captain, " Captain, the commander calls for you ;" and
presently the captain replied, " Tell his Excellency I am just a-coming."'
This more perfectly amused them, and they all believed that the commander
was just by, with his fifty men. Upon the captain coming to me, I told him
my project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved
to put it in execution the next morning. But, in order to execute it with.
more art, and to be secure of success, I told him we must divide the prisoners,
and that he should go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them,
and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay : this was committed
to Friday and the two men who came on shore with the captain. They
conveyed them to the cave as to a prison ; and it was, indeed, a dismal place,
especially to men in their condition. The others I ordered to my bower, as I
called it, of which I have given a full description; and as it was fenced in,
and they were pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were
upon their behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a parley
with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought they
might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the ship. He talked to
them of the injury done him, of the condition they were brought to; and that
though the Governor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present
action, yet that if they were sent to England, to be sure they would all be
hanged in chains; but that if they would join in so just an attempt as to
recover the ship, he would have the Governor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men
in their condition ; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised,
with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the last
drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all
over the world ; that they would own him as a father to them as long as they
lived. " Well," says the captain, "I must go and tell the Governor what you
say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it." So he brought me
an account of the temper he found them in, and that he verily believed they
would be faithful. However, that we might be very secure, I told him he
should go batik again and choose out five of them, and tell them, they might
:see he did not want men, that he would take out five of them to be his
' assistants, and that the Governor would keep the other two and the three that
'weresent prisoners to the castle (my cave), as hostages for the' fidelity of
<<those five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five
hostages should be hanged in chains alive upon the shore. This looked

severe, and convinced them that the Governor was in earnest ; however, they
had no way left them but to accept it; and it was now the business of the
prisoners, as much. as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their
- ~duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: I, the captain, his
mate, and passenger: 2, the two prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having
"their character from the captain,1 had given their liberty, and trusted them
'with arms: 3, the other two that I had kept till now in my apartment
'pinioned, but, on the captain's motion, had now released: 4, the single man
"talien in theboat: 5, these five released at last ; so that there were thirteen
in all, besides five, we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on board
'the ship ; but as for me and my man Friday I did not think it was proper for
'us' to stir, having seven men left behind ; and it was employment enough for.
us to keep them asunder, and supply them with victuals. As to the five in
"the cave, I resolved to keep' them fast; but Friday went in twice a day to
them, to supply them with necessaries; and I made the other two carry
- provisions to a certain distance, where Friday was to take them.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who
'told them I was the person the Governor had ordered to 'look after them; and
'that it was the Governofs pleasure they should not stir anywhere but by my
direction ; that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle, and be laid
in irons; so that as we 'never sufi'ered them to see me as Governor, I now
.appearedas another person, and spoke of the Governor, the garrison, the
castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain'had now no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two boats,
stop the breach of one, and man them. He made his passenger captain of
one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five more, went in the
, other; and they contrived their business very well, for they came up to the

.ship about midnight. As soon as they came within call of the ship, he made
Robinson hail them, and tell them he had brought off the men and the boat,Deliveramt.DELIVERAZVCE. ' I75

but that it was a long time before they had found them, and the like; holding
'them in chat till they came to the ship's side; when the captain and mate
entering first, with their arms immediately knocked down the second mate
:and carpenter with the butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully
seconded by their men; they secured all the rest that were upon the main
and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches. to keep them down that
were below, when the other boat and their men, entering the forechains,
secured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the
-cook-room, making three men they found there prisoners. When this was
done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three men,
to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who, having
taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had got fire-arms
in their hands ; and when the mate, with a crow, split open the door, the new
captain and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded the mate with a
musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the men, but
killed nobody. The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round-
house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new captain through
the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out again behind one of
'his ears, so that he never spoke a word more: upon which the rest yielded,
.and the ship was taken effectually, without any more lives being lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be
fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to' give me notice of his
success ; which, you may be sure,I was very glad to hear, having sat watching
upon the shore for it till nearly two of the clock in the morning. Having
'thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been a day of
great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was surprised with the noise of
:a gun ; and presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name,
"Governor! Governor!" and presently I knew the captain'svoice; when,
climbing to the top of the hill, there he stood, and, pointing to the ship, he
embraced me in his arms. " My dear friend and deliverer," says he, " there's
your ship; for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that belong to her." I
-cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode, within little more than half a
mile of the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were
masters of her, and, the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just
against the mouth of the little creek; and, the tide being up, the captain had
brought the pinnace in near the place where I had first landed my rafts, and
.so landed just at my door. I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise;
for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy,
and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At
. first, {Or some time, I was not able to answer him one word ; but as he had
taken'me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to the
ground. He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle out of"
his pocket and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose
for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the ground; and though it brought
me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could speak a word to him.
All this time the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under
any surprise as I was ; and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to
compose and bring me to myself ; but such was the flood of joy in my breast,
that it put all my spirits into confusion : at last_ it broke out into tears, and,
in a little while after, I recovered my speech. I then took my turn, and
embraced him as my deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him I looked
upon him as a man sent by Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole tran--
saction seemed to be a chain of wonders ; that such things as these were the
testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and
an evidence that the eye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest
comer of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven ; and what heart
could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner
provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition, but
from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed P

' When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some
little refreshments such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretchcs that
had been so long his masters had not plundered him of. Upon this, he called
aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore that were for the
Governor ; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had been one, not that I was
to be carried along with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the island
still, and they were to go without me. First, he had brought me a case of
bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira wine (the
bottles' held two quarts apiece), two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag of peas, and'
about a hundredweight of biscuit. He brought me also a box of sugar, a box
of flour, a bag full of'lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of
other things : but besides these, and what was a thousand times more useful
to me, he brought me six new clean shirts, six very good ncckcloths, two pair
of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good
suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word, he
clothed me from head to foot. It was a very kind and agreeable present, as
any one may imagine, to one in my circumstances; but never was anything
in the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me
to wear such clothes at first putting on.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were brought
into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done with the
prisoners we had ; for it was worth considering whether we might venture to
take them away with us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be'
incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain said he knew
they were such rogues that there was no obliging them, and if he did carry
them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to justice
at the first English colony he could come at; and Ifound that the captain
himself was very anxious about it. Upon this, I told him that, if he desired
it, I durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own
request that he should leave them upon the island.

" I should be very glad of that," says the captain, " with all my heart."

" Well," says I, " I will send for them up, and talk with them for you."

So Icaused Friday and the two hostages, for they were now discharged,
their comrades having performed their promise; I say, I caused them to go
to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower,
and keep them there till I came. After some time, I came thither dressed in
my new habit ; and now I was called Governor again. Being all met, and the
captain with me,I caused all the men to be brought before me, and I told
them I had got a full account of their villanous behaviour to the captain, but
that they were fallen into the pit which they had dug for others. They might
see by-and-by that their new captain had received the reward of his villainy ;
for that they would see him hanging at the yard-arm ; as to them, I wanted
to know what they had to say why I should not execute them as pirates,
taken in the fact, as by my commission they could not doubt I had authority
to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to
say but this, that when they were taken, the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy: but I told them I knew not
what mercy to show them ; for as for myself,I had resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go for England;
and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England, other than as_
prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny, and running away with the ship;
the consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the gallows ; so

I3
that I could not tell what was best for them, unless they had a mind to take
their fate in the island ; if they desired that, I did not care, as I had liberty
to leave it. They seemed very thankful for it, and said they would much
rather venture to stay there than to be carried to England to be hanged : so I
left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he durst
not leave them there : upon this, I seemed a little angry with the captain, and
told him they were my prisoners, not his ; and that seeing I had offered them
so much favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if he did not think
fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty, as I found them; and if he
did not like it, he might takethem again if he could catch them. Upon this,
they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade
them retire into the woods, to the place whence they came, and I would leave
them some fire-arms, some ammunition, and some directions how they should
live very well, if they thought fit. Upon this I prepared to go on board the
and desired-him to go on board in the meantime, and keep all right in the
ship; but told the captain I would stay that night to prepare my things,
ship, and send the boat on shore next day for me; ordering him, at all events,
to cause the new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that
these men might see him. .

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,
and entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances. I
told them I thought they had made a right choice ; that if the captain had
carried them away, they would certainly be hanged. I showed them the new
captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had nothing
less to expect.

' When they had all declared their willingness to stay,I then told them I
would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the way
of making it easy to them : accordingly, I gave them the whole history of the
place, and of my coming to it ; showed them my fortifications, the way I
made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grap'es ; and, in a word, all that
was necessary to make them easy. I told them the story also of the sixteen
Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom I left a letter, and made them
promise to treat them in common with themselves.

_ I left them my fire-arms, wk, five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and three
swords. I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after the first
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a description of
the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, and to
make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them every part of my own
:story; and told themI should prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-seeds, which I told them I
would have been very glad of. Also, I gave them the bag of peas which the
-captain had brought me to eat, and bade them to be sure to sow and increase
them.

I left them the next day, and went on board the ship. We prepared im-
mediately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The next morning early, two
of the five men came swimming to the ship's side, and, making the most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship for
God's sake, for they should be murdered, and begged the captain to take
them on board,though he hanged them immediately. Upon this, the captain
pretended to have no power without me; but after some difficulty, and after
solemn promises of amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some
'time after, soundly whipped and pickled ; after which they proved very
honest and quiet fellows.

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up, with
the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my intercession,
caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they took, and were very
thankful for; I also encoilraged them, by telling them that if it lay in my
'power to send any vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.

When Itook leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the great
'goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and my parrot ; also, I forgot not to
take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so long useless,
that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver till it
'had been a little rubbed and handled, as also the money I found in the wreck
-of the Spanish ship.

And thus I left the island, the 19th of' December, as I found by the ship's
.account, in the year 1686. after I had been upon it eight and twenty years,
two months, and nineteen days ; being delivered from this second captivity
the same day of the month that I first made my escape in the long-boat from
among the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the nth of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years
.absent.

When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as if
I had never been known there. My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I
had left in trust with my money, was alive, but had had great misfortunes in
:the world ; was become a widow the second time, and very low in the world.
I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would give her
no trouble ; but, on the contrary, in gratitude to her former care and faithful-
ness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would afiord, which at that time-
would indeed allow me to do. but little for her: but I assured her Iwould
never forget her former kindness to me; nor did I forget her when I had
sufficient to help her. . I went down afterwards into Yorkshire ; but my father
was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct ; except that I found two
' sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers : and as I had been long;
ago given over for dead, there had been no provision made for me, so that, in
a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and that little money I had'
would not-do much for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not expect; and this-
was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the-
same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very handsome account'
to thefowners, of the manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and the-
ship. they invited me to meet them and some other merchants concerned, and:
all together made meta very handsome compliment upon the subject, and a.
present of almost PS200 sterling.

. After reflection, I resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at
some information of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was.
become of myipartner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past
given me over for dead. With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where I

arrived in April following; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly
in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all occasions-
When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my particular satis-

faction, my old friend, the captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea off"
the shore of Africa. He was now grown old, and had left off going to sea,
having put his son,who was far from a young man, into his ship, and who still

used the Brazil trade. The old man did not know me; and indeed I hardly

knew him. But Iisoon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told him

who I Was. '

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I

' inquired, you may be sure,after my plantation and my partner. The old man
told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but that he
could assure me, that when .he came away my partner was living; but the
trustees, whom Ihad joined with him to take eognizance of my part, were
both dead ; that, however, he believed I would have a very good account of"
the improvement'of the plantation; for that, upon the general belief of my-1!! Y BRA Zl LIA 1V AFFAIRS. I 8 I

being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of the
produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who had appro-
priated it, in case I never came to claim it, one--third to the king, and two-
'thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of
the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith: but that,
if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance, it would be restored ;
-only that the improvement, or annual production, being distributed to
-charitable uses, could not be restored : but he assured me that the steward of
the king's revenue from lands, and the proveditore, or steward of the monastery,
'had taken great care all along that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner,
:gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of which they had duly
received my moiety. My partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying
'his part of it; and the king's third of my part, which was, it seems, granted
:away to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to above two
hundred moidores a year; as to my being restored to a quiet possession of it,
there was no question to be made of that, my partner being alive to witness
:my title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of the country.
.Also he told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest
people, and very wealthy ; and he believed I would not only have their
.assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a very considerable
:sum of money in their hands for my account, being the produce of the farm
while their fathers held the trust, and before it was given up, as above; which
'as he remembered, was for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and_uneasy at this account, and inquired
'of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should thus dispose
tof my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and had made him, the
Portuguese captain, my universal heir.

He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being
.dead, he could not act as executor, until some certain account should come of
my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so
remote; that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his claim ; and
<<could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he would have
.acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so they call the
--sugar-house), and have given his son, who was now at the Brazils, orders to
-do it.

After a few days' further conference with this ancient friend, he brought me
an account of the first six years' income of my fplantation, signed by my
partner and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered in goods, 21123.,
tobacco in roll, and. sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the
consequence of a sugar-work ; and I found by this account, that every year
the income considerably increased; but thedisbursements being large, the
sum at first was sm'all : however, the old man let me see that he was debtor
to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of"
sugar, and fifteen double rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship; be
having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after
my leaving the place. The good man then began to complain of his misfor-
tunes, and how he had been obliged to make use of my money to rec0ver his.
losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. " However, my old friend," says
he, " you shall not want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son
returns, you shall be fully satisfied." Upon this he pulls out an old pouch,
and gives me two hundred Portuguese moidores in gold ; and giving me the-
writings of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of-
which he was quarter--part owner, and his son another, he put them both into
my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to-
be able to bear this ; and remembering what he had done {or me, how he hack V
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all occasions, and',
particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain
weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him if his circum-
stances admitted him to spare so much money at that time, and if it would.
not straiten him. He told me he could not say but it might straitcn him a.
little ; but, however, it was my money,'and I might want it more than he.

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly'
. refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the-
moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them : then I
returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of the plantation
I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I afterwards did) ; and that.
as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not take it by any
means; but that if I wanted the money, I found he was honest enough to-
pay me; and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave me reason to-
expect, I would never have a penny more from him.

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a.
method to make my claim to my plantation. I told him I thought to go.
over to it myself. He said I might do so if I pleased ; but that, if I did not,_
there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate.-
the profits to my use ; and as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just readyMY PROPERTY RESTORED TO ME. 183

to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a public register, with
his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, and that I was the same
person who took up the land for the planting the said plantation at first
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration affixed, he
directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his
acquaintance at the place; and then proposed my staying with him till 31'
account came of the return.

Never was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this
procuration ; for in less than seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went to sea, in
which were the following particular letters and papers enclosed.

F irst, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm or planta-
tion ; the balance appeared to be one thousand one hundred and seventy-four
moidores in my favour. Secondly, there was the account of four years more,
while they kept the effects in their hands, before the government claimed the
administration, as being the efl'ects of a person not to be found, which they
called civil death ; and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increas-
ing, amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes,
being about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores. Thirdly, there
was the Prior of St. Augustine's account, who had received the profits for
above fourteen years ; but not beihg to account {or what was disposed of by
the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight hundred and scventy-two
moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged to my account: as to the
king's part, that refunded nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very affectionately
upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved, and
what it produced a year; with the particulars of the number of squares or
acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it;
and making two and twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so
many A 212 Maria: to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me
very passionately to come over and take possession of my own; and, in the
meantime, to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects, if I did
not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that
of his family; and sent me as a present, seven fine leopards' skins, which he
had, it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent
thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me
also five chests of excellent sweatmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold
uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my two
merchant~trustees shipped me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than the
beginning. It is impossible to express the flutterings of my very heart when
'I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come all in fleets, the
same ships which brought my letters brought my goods : and the effects were
safe in the River before the letters came to my hand. In a word, I turned
pale, and grew sick ; and, had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial,
I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature, and I had died gpon
the spot. Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours, till a
physician being sent for, and something of the real cause of my illness being
known, he ordered me to be let blood, after which I had relief, and grew well:
but I verily believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to
the spirits, I should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above 5000 pounds sterling in money,
and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of above a thousand
pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in England : and, in' a word, I was
in a condition which I scarce knew how to understand, or how to compose
myself for the enjoyment of it. The first thing I did was to recompense my
original benefactor, my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me
in my distress, kind to me in my' beginning, and honest to me at the end. I
showed him all that was sent to me; I told him that, next to the providence
of Heaven, which' disposed all things, it was owing to him ; and that it now
lay on me to reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold. So I first .

returned to him the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent for
' a notary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge from the
four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me
in the fullest and firmest manner possible ; after which I caused a procuration
to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the annual profits of my
plantation ; and appointing my partner to actount to him, and make
the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and by a clause in the
end, made a grant of 100 moidores a year to him during his life, out of the
effects, and 50 moidores a year to his son after him, {or his life. And thus I
requitt'ed my old man.

'I was now to consider which way to steer my course next; and indeed I
had more care upon my head now than I had in my silent state of life in the
island, where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my business wasREMEMBERING OLD FRIENDS 185

how to secure it. I determined to go back to England myself, and take my
effects with me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and therefore,
.as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had been
my former benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow whose husband
had been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
steward and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon
to write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, but to find
her out, and carry her, in money, a hundred pounds from me, and to talk
with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived,
have a further supply. At the same time, I sent my two sisters in the
country a hundred pounds each, they being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circumstances; one having been married and left a widow, and
the other having a husband not so kind to her as he should be. But, among
all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I
durst commit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and
leave things safe behind me; and this greatly perplexed me.

Having settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my effects into
good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go to England.
I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to
go to England by sea at that time ; and though I could give no reason for it,
yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that though I had once shipped
my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but

wo or three times.

It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of the
reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts in
cases of such moment : two of the ships which I had singled out to go in, I
mean more particularly singled out than any other, having put my things on
board one of them, and in the other having agreed with the captain; I say
two of these ships miscarried ; viz" one was taken by the Algerines, and the
other was cast away on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned
except three ; so that in either of those vessels I had been made miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot pressed me
earnestly not to go by sea, but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross
over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe
journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid,
and so all the way by land through France. I resolvedto travel all the way
by land, which, as I was not in haste, and did not value the charge, was by
much the pleasanter way: and to make it more so, my old captain brought
an English gentleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to
travel with me ; after which. we picked up two more English merchants also,
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only ; so that in
all there were six of us, and five servants; the two merchants and'the two
Portuguese contenting themselves with one servant between two, to save the
charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant,
besides my man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup--
plying the place of a servant on the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company being very well
mounted and armed, we made a little troop. whereof they did me the honour
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as because I had ~
two servants, and, indeed, was the originator of the whole journey.

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us strangers to Spain, were
willing to stay some time to' see the court of Spain, and what was worth.
observing ; but, it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened away, and
set out from Madrid about the middle of October ; but when we came to the
edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with the
account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of the mountains,
that several travellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna, after having
attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed ; and to me, that
had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could scarce
bear any clothes on, the cold' was insufferable: nor, indeed, was it more
painful than surprising, to come but ten days before out of Old Castile, where
the weather was not only warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind
from the Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so severely cold, as to be intoler-
able, and to endanger benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the mountains all covered

' with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his 1ife.To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna, it continued
snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people said winter was
come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult before, were now
quite impassable; there was no going without being in danger of being buried
alive every step. We stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when
(seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was
the severest winter all over Europe that had been known in the memory of
man), I proposed that we should go away to Fontarabia, and there takeEN ROUTE FOR ENGLAND. 187

shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little voyage. But, while we were
considering this, there came in four French gentlemen, who, having been
stopped on the F rench side of the passes, as we were on the Spanish, found
out a guide, who, traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had
brought them over the mountains by such ways that they were not much
incommoded with the snow. We sent for this guide, who told us he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided
we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts ; for, he said,
in these great snows, it was frequent for some wolves to show themselves at
the foot of the mountains, being made ravenous for want of food. We told
him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if he would
insure us from a kind of two--legged wolves, which, we were told, we were in
most danger from, especially on the French side of the mountains. He satis-
fied us that there was no danger of that kind in the way that we were to go ;
so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other gentlemen, with
their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to
go, and were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide, on the 15th of
November; and, indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,
about twenty miles ; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was
pleasant, and no snow to be "seen; but, on a sudden, turning to his left, he
approached the mountains another way; and though it is true the hills and
precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and
led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the height of the
mountains without being much encumbered with the snow; and all on a.
sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of Languedoc and
Cascony, all green and flourishing.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day
and night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we should
soon be' past it all : we found, indeed, that we began to descend every day,
and to come more north than before ; and so, depending upon our guide, we
went on.

It was about two hours before night, when, our guide being something
before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear, from_ a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood. Two of the wolves
flew upon the guide, and' had he been half a mile before us, he would have
been devoured before we could have helped him ; one of them fastened Upon
his horse, and the other attacked the man with such violence, that he had not
time or presence of mind enough to draw his pistol ; but hallooed and cried
out most lustily. My nian Friday being next me, I bade him ride up, and see
what was the matter. As soon as F riday came in sight of the man, he
hallooed out as loud as the other, "0 Master! 0 Master ! " but like a bold
fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that
attacked him in the head. - ' '

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed, it
alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of F riday's pistol, we heard on
both sides the most dismal howlings of wolves; and the noise redoubled by
the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps, indeed, there was not such a few as that we
had no cause for apprehensions. However, as Friday had killed this wolf,
the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately, and fled,
having happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had
stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt; the man, indeed,
was most hurt'; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in the arm,
and the other time a little above his knee; and he was just as it were tumbling
down by the disorder of the horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf.

But never Was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner,
as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all (though
at first we were surprised and afraid for him) the greatest diversion imagi-
nable; as the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallbp as the
wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two particular qualities, which
generally are the rule of his actions ; first, as to men, who are not his proper
prey (he does not usually attempt them, except they first attack him, unless
he be excessively hungry, which it is probable might now be the case, the
ground being covered with snow), if you do not meddle with him, he will not
meddle with you ; but then ybu must take care to be very civil to him, and
give him. the road, for he is a very nice gentleman ; he will not go a step out
of his way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look
another way and keep going on; for sometimes if you stop and stand still,
and look steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront; but if you throw or
toss anything at him, and it hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as big
as your finger, he thinks himself abused, and sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honour ;--that is his
first quality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he will never leave you,
night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he
overtakes you. .

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came up to him, he
was helping him off his horse; for the man was both hurt and frighted, when
on a sudden we espied the bear coming out of the wood, and a monstrous
one it was, the biggest by far that ever I saw. We were all a little surprised
when we saw him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and
courage in the fellow's countenance.

" O, O, O ! " says Friday, three times, pointing to him; "0 Master! you
give me te leave, me shakee te hand with him ; me makee you good laugh."

I was surprised to see the fellow so well pleased. " You fool," says I, " he
will eat you up."--" Eatee me up! eatee me up !" says Friday, twice over again :
" me eatee him up: me make you good laugh; you all stay here, me show
you good laugh." So down he sits, and gets off his boots in a moment, and
puts on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear), and which
he had in his pocketlgives my other servant his horse, and with his gun away
he flew like a swift wind.

The bear was walking softly on, and ofi'ered to meddle with nobody, till
Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the bear could understand him,
" Hark ye, hark ye," says F riday, " me speakee wit you."

We followed at a distance, for now being down on the Gascony side of the
mountains, we were entering a vast forest, whete the country was plain and
pretty open, though it had many trees in it scattered here and there. Friday,
who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up with him quickly, and
takes up a great stone, and throws it at him, and hit him just on the head ;
but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it against a wall; but it
answered Friday's end, for the rogue was so void of fear that he did it purely
to make the bear follow him, and show us some laugh, as he called it. As
soon as the bear felt the blow, and saw him, he turns about, and comes after
him, taking very long strides, and shufiling on at a strange rate, so as he
would put a horse at a middling gallop: away runs Friday, and takes his
course as if he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once
upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was angry at him heartily
for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going about his own
business another way; and especially I was angry that he had turned the
bear upon us and then run away; and I called out, " You dog! is this your
making us laugh? Come away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the
creature." He hears me, and cries out, " No shoot, no shoot; stand still, you
get much laugh :" and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the bear's one,
he turned on a suddenon one side of us, and seeing a great oak tree fit for
his, purpose, he beckoned to us to follow; and doubling his pace, he got
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or
six yards from the bottom of the tree. The bear soon came to the tree, and
we followed at a distance: The first thing he he did, stopped at the gun,
smelled to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing
like a cat, though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I '
thought it, of 'my man, and could not for my life see anything to laugh at
yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode near to him.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the small end of a
large branch, and the bear got about half way to him. As soon as the bear
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was weaker, " Ha!" says he
to us, "now you see me teachee the bear dancez" so he falls a jumping and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and
began to look behind him, to see how he should get back ; then, indeed, we
did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with him by a great deal ;
when seeing him stand still, he called out to him again, as if he had supposed
the bear could 'speak English, "What, you come no further? pray you coine
further ; " so he left jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he
understood what he said, did come a little further; then he fell a jumping
again, and the bear stopped- again. We thought now was a good time to
knock him in'the head, and called to Friday to stand 'still, and we would
shoot the bear: but he cried out earnestly. " O pray! O pray! no shoot, me
shoot by and_ then;" he would have said by and by. However, to shorten
the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so ticklish, that we
had laughing enough, but still could not imagine what the fellow would do:
for first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we found
the hear was too cunning for. that too; for he would not go out far enough
to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great broad claws and feet, so
that we could not imagine what would be the end of it, and what the- jest
would be at last. But Friday put us out of doubt quickly: for seeing the
bear cling fast to'the bough, and that he would not be persuaded to come
any farther, "Well, well," says F riday, " you no come further, me go, me go;
you no come to me, me come to you;" and upon this he goes out to the
smallest end of the bough, where it would bend with his weight, and gently
lets himself down by it, sliding down the bough till he came near enough to
jump down. on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and standsATTACKED BY THE WOLVES. I9!

still. "Well," said I to him, "Friday, what will you do now? Why don't
you shoot him ?"--" No shoot," says Friday, " no yet; me shoot now, me no
kill; me stay, give you one more laugh:" and, indeed, so he did; for when
'the bear saw his enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he stood,
'but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every step, and coming
backward till he got into the body of the tree; then, with the same
hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping it with his claws,
and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely; at this juncture, and just
before he could set his hind foot on the ground, Friday stepped up close to
him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a
stone. Then the rogue turned about to see if we did not laugh; and when
he saw we were pleased, by our looks, he began to laugh very loud. " So we
'kills bear in my country," says Friday; " So you kill them P" says I ; "why,

you have no guns."--"No," says he, " no gun, but shoot great much long
arrow."

This was good diversion to us; but we were still in a wild place, and our
guide very much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling of
wolves ran much in my head; and, indeed except the noise I once heard on
the shore of Africa, of which I have said something aiready,I never heard
anything that filled me with so much horror. _

These things, and the approach of night, called us off, or else, as Friday
would have had us, we should certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous
creature off, which was worth saving.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep and dangerous
as on the mountains, and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were
come down into the forest and plain country, pressed by hunger, to seek {or
food, and had done a great deal of mischief in the villages,where they surprised
the country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and some
people too. We had one dangerous place to pass, and our guide told us, if
there were more wolves in the country we should find them there ; and this
was a small plain surrounded with woods on every side, and a long narrow
defile, or lane, which we were to pass to get through the wood, and then we
should come to the village where we were to lodge. We kept our arms
ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw no more wolves till we came
through that wood, which was near half a league, and entered the plain; as
soon as we came into the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us.
The first object we met was a dead horse; that is to say, a poor horse which
the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at work; we could not
say eating him, but picking his bones rather; for they had eaten up all the
flesh before. We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither did
they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at them, but I would
not sufl'er him by any means; for I found we were like to have more business
upon our hands than we were aware of. We were not half gone over the
- plain, but we began to hear the wolves howl in the woods on our left in a.
frightful manner; arid presently after we saw about a hundred coming on
directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as regularly
towards us as an army drawn up by experienced officers. I scarce knew
in what manner to receive them, but found to draw ourselves in a close
line was the only way; so we formed in a moment; but that we might not
have too much interval, I ordered that only every other man should fire, and
that the others, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a second
volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon us; and then that
those who had fired at first, should not pretend to load.their fusils again,
but stand ready, every one with a pistol, for we were all armed with a fusee
and a pair of pistols each man ; so we were, by this method, able to fire six
volleys, half of us at a time. However, at present we had no necessity; for
upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified as well
with the noise as with the fire.' Four of them being shot in the head,
dropped; several others were wounded, and went bleeding oil; as we could
see by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not immediately retreat;
whereupon, remembering that I had been told that the fiercest creatures
were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all the company to halloo as
loud as they could, and I found the notion not altogether mistaken ; for upon
our shout they began to retire and tum about; I then ordered a second volley
'to be fired in their .rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went
to the woods. This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again ; and that we
might lose no time, we kept going; but we had but little more than loaded
our fusees, and put ourselves in readiness, when we heard a terrible noise in
the satire wood on our left, only that it was farther onward, the same way we
were to go.

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, which made
it worse on our side; but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive that
it was the' howling and yelling'of those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden,
we perceived three troops of wolves, one on our left, one behind us, and one
in our front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them: however, as
they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as we couldBE 51E GED. '93

'make our horses go, which, the way being very rough, was only a good hard
trot ; and in this manner we came in view of the entrance of a wood, through
which we were to pass, at the farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly
surprised, when coming near the lane or pass, we saw a confused number of
wolves standing just at the entrance. On a sudden, at another opening of
the wood, we heard the noise of a gun, and looking that way, out rushed a.
horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen
or seventeen wolves after him full speed: indeed, the horse had the heels of
them ; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted
not but they would get up with him at last : no question but they did.

Here we had a most horrible sight ; for, riding up to the entrance where the
horse came out, we found the carcases of another horse and of two men,
devoured by the ravenous creatures, and one of the men was no doubt the
same whom we heard fire the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off;
but as to the man, his head and the upper part of his body were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to take; but the
creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in hopes of
prey; and I verily believe there were three hundred of them. '

It happened, very much to our advantage, that at the entrance into the
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large timber-trees, which had
been cut down the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage ; I
drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line
behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping that tree before
us for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle,or three fronts, inclosing our horses
in the centre. We did so, and it was well we did; for never was a more
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place; they came on
us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece of timber, which, as
I said, was our breastwork, as if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and
this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our
horses behind us, which was the prey they aimed at. I ordered our men to
fire as before, every other man: and they took their aim so sure that they
killed several of the wolves at the first volley; but there was a necessity to
keep a continual firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on
those before.

When we had fired a second volley of our fusils, we thought they stopped
a little, and I hoped they would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for
others came forward again; so we fired two volleys of our pistols; and I
believe in these four firings we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and

I4
-1amed twice as many, yet they came on again. I was 10th to spend our shot
too hastily; so I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was better .
employed, for, with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusil
-and his own while we were engaged,----but, as I said, I called my other man,
and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece
of timber, and let it beja large train; he did so, and had but just time to get
away, when the wolves came up to it, and some got upon it, when I, snapping
tan uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; and those that were
upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them fell, or rather
jumped in among us with the force and fright of the fire : we despatched these
in an instant, and the rest were so frightened with the light, which the night
L--for it was now very near dark--made more terrible, that they drew back a
little. .Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired ofi'" 1n one volley, and
.after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves turned tai_,l and we sallied
immediately upon near twenty lame ones that we found struggling on the
'ground, and fell to cutting them with our swords, which answered our expec-
tation, for the crying and howling they made were better understood by their
fellows; so that they all fled and left us.

We had', first and last, killed about threescore of them, and had it been
daylight, we had killed many more. The field of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again, for we had still near a league to go; we heard the
ravenous creatures how] and yell in the woods as we went several times, and
sometimes we fancied we saw some of them; but the snow dazzling our eyes,
we were not certain ; so in about an hour more we came to the town where
we were to lodge, which. we found in-a terrible fright and all in arms: for it
seems that the night before, the wolves and some bears had broken into the
village, and put them in a terrible fright, and they were obliged to keep guard
night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their cattle, and indeed
their people.

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs swelled so much with
the ran'kling of his two wounds, that he could go no farther; so we were
obliged to take a.new guide here, and go to Toulouse, where we found a warm
climate, a fruitful, pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, nor anything like
them; but when we told our story at Toulouse, they told us it was nothing
but what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the mountains,
especially when the snow lay on the ground; but they inquired much what
kind of guide we had got, that would venture to bring us that way in such a
severe season; and told_us it was surprising we were not all devoured. Whey1 SELL MY PZANTA TION. x95

\ve told them how we placed ourselves and the horses in the middle, they
blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had been all
destroyed, for it was the sight of the horses which made the wolves so furious,
seeing their prey ; whereas'had we been content to have sat still on horseback,
and fired as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses so much for their
own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise; and, withal, they told us
that at last, if we had stood all together, and left our horses, they would have
been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have come 011' safe,
especially having our fire-arms in our hands, being so many in number. For
my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for, seeing above three
hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having
nothing to shelter us or retreat to, I gave myself over for lost; and, as it was,
I believe I shall never care to cross those mountains again; I think I would
'much rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I was sure to meet with
a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage through France;
nothing but what other travellers have given an account of with much more
advantage than I can. I travelled from Toulouse to Paris, and without any
considerable stay came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover the 14th of January,
after having had a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little time all my
new-discovered estate safe about me, the bills of exchange which I brought
with me having been very currently paid.

My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my good ancient widow, who,
in gratitude for the money I had sent her, thought no pains too much nor
care too great to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely with everything,
that I was perfectly easy as to the security of my effects.

And now I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find means for it, to
dispose of my plantation. To this purposeI wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who in return gave me notice that he could easily dispose of it there, but that,
if I thought fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants,
the survivors of my trustees, who lived in Brazil, he did not doubt but I should
make 4000 or 5000 pieces of eight the more of it. Accordingly I agreed, gave
him orders to offer it to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ship being then returned, he sent me an account that they had
accepted the ofl"ei; and had remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to Lisbon, to pay
for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the form which they sent from
Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange for
thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight for the estate, reserving the-
payment of one hundred moidores a year to him (the old man) during his life,
and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for his life, which I had promised
them, and which the plantation was to make good as a rent-charge. And

' thus I have given the first part of a life of fortune and adventure--a life of"
Providence's chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will be seldom.
able to show the like of--beginning foolishly, but closing much more happily
than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as to hope for.

Any one would think that in this state of complicated good fortune, I was-
past running any more hazards, and so, indeed, I had been, if other circum--
Stances h'ad concurred: but I was inured to a wandering life, had no family,
hor many relations ; nor, however rich, had I contracted fresh acquaintance ;

i and though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep that
country out of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the wing again ;.
especially I could not resist the strong inclination I had to see my island.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly dissuaded me from it, and so far' prevailed.
with me, that for almost seven years she prevented my running abroad, during
which time I took my two nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into
my care ; the eldest, having something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman,
and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate after my deceasc;
_The other I placed with the captain of a ship; and after five years, finding
him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into a good ship,
and sent him to sea ; and this young fellow afterwards drew me in,-as old as
.'I was, to further adventures myself. V

In the meantime, I in part settled myself here; for, first of all, I married,
and that not either to my disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three;
children, two sons and one daughter; but my wife dying, and my nephew
coming home with good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go-
abroadh and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his shipas.
'a private trader to the East Indies; this was in the year 1694.

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island--saw my successors-
the Spaniards,--had the whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left
there,--how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards,--how they afterwards.
agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and how at last the Spaniards were
.obliged to use violence with them,--how they were subjected to the Spaniards,.
--how honestly the Spaniards used them ; a history, if it were entered into,.
'as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own part,--particularly, a150,,
as to theixfibattlcs with the Caribbeans, who landed several times upon the

island, and as to the improvement they made upon the island itself--and how

five of them made an attempt upon the mainland, and brought away eleven

men and five women prisoners, by which, at my coming, I found about twenty
. young children on the island.

Here I stayed about twenty days,--left them supplies of all necessarythings,
and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which
I had brought from England with me,--w'z., a carpenter and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them, reserved to myself the
property of the whole, but gave them such parts respectively as they agreed
-on ; and having settled all things with them, and engaged them not to leave
the place, I left them there.

F rom thence I touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a bark, which I
lbought there, with more people to the island ; and in it,besides other supplies,
I sent seven women, being such as'I found proper for service, or for wives to
fsuch as would take them. As to the Englishmen, I promised to send them
some women from England, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they would
.apply themselves to planting,--which I afterwards performed. The fellows
proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered, and had their
properties set apart for them. I sent them, also, from the Brazils, five cows,
.Some sheep, and some hogs, which when I came again were considerably
increased. .

But all these things, with an account how three hundred Caribbees came
._and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how-they fought with
'that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them killed ;
but, at last, a storm destroying their enemies' canoes, they famished or de-
stroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of their
plantation, and still lived upon the island: all these things, with some very
surprising incidents in some new adventures of my own, for ten years more, I
may, perhaps, give a further account of hereafter.
