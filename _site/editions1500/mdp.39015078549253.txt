PREFACE.
^pHEsuccess the former Part of this Work,
has met with in the world, has yet been no
other than is acknowledged to be due to the fur-
prising variety os the subject, and to the agree-
able manner os the performance.
All the endeavours of envious people to re-
proach it with being a Romance, to search itfor
errors in geography, inconsistency in the rela-
tion, and contradictions in thefact, have proved
-abortive, and as impotent as malicious.
The just application of every incident, the reli-
gious and useful inferences drawn from evety
part, are so many testimonies to the good design
of making it public, and must legitimate all the
part that may be called invention or parable in
the story.
The Second Part, if the Editor's opinion may
pass, is (contrary to the usage of Second
Parts) every way as entertaining as the Firfl;
contains asflrange andsurprising incidents, and,
as great a variety of them; nor is the appli-
cation less serious or suitable; and doubtless will,
to the sober as well as ingenious reader, be every
way asproftabU and diverting; and this makes
A 2 the
the abridging this Work, as scandalous, as it is
knavish and ridiculous; feeing, to shorten the
book, that they may seem to reduce the value,
they Jlrip it of all those reflections, as well reli-
gious as moral, which are not only the greatefl
beauties of the Work, hut are calculated for
the infinite advantage of the Reader.
By this, they leave the Work naked of its
brightest ornaments; and yet they would (at the
fame time they pretend that the author has sup-
ply'd his jlory out of his invention) take from it
the improvement, which alone recommends that
invention to wife and good men.
The injury these men do toihe Proprietors
of Works, is a practice all honefl men abhor;
and they believe they may challenge them to shew
the difference between that and robbing on the
Highway, or breaking open a house.
If they cannotshew any difference in the crime,
they will find it hard to shew why thereshould be
any difference in the punishment.
THE
ADVENTURES
O F
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
THAT homely proverb, used on so many occasion*
in England, viz. That what is bred in the bone
will not go out of the flesh, was never more verisied than
in the story of my LIFE. Any one would think, that
after thirty-sive years affliction, and a variety of unhappy
circumstances, which sew men, if ever any, went through
besore, and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment
in the sulness of all things; grown old, and when, if
ever, it might be allowed me to have had experience of
every state of middle lise, and to know which was most
adapted to make a man completely happy; I say, after
all . this, any one would have thought, that the native
propensity of rambling, which I gave an account of
in my sirst setting out into the world, to have been so
predominant in my thoughts, should be worn out, the
volatile part be sully evacuated, or at least condensed,
and 1 might at 61 years of age have been a little in-
clined to stay at home, and have done venturing lise
and fortune any more.
Nay, sarther, the common motive of foreign adven-
tures was taken away in me; for I had no fortune to
make, I had nothing to seek: if I had gain'd ten thou-
A 3 sand

sand pounds, 1 had been no richer; for I had already
sufficient for me, and for these I had to leave it to; and
that I had, was visibly increasing; for having no great
family, I could not spend the income of what I had,
unless I would set up for an expensive way of living, such
as a great samily, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the
like, which were things I had no notion of, or inclination
to; so that I had nothing indeed to do, but to sit still,
and sully enjoy the little I had got, and see it increase
d aily upon my hands.
Yet all these things had no esfect upon, me, or at least
not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronical dis-
temper; particularly the desire of seeing my new plan-
tation in the island, and the colony I left there, run in
my head continually. I dreamed of it all night, and my
imagination ran upon it all day; it was uppermost in all
my thoughts, and roy sancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep', in short,
nothing could remove it out of my mind: It even trok?
so violently into all my discourses, tbat it made my con-
versation tiresome; for-1 could talk of nothing else; all
my discourse ran into it, even to impertinence i and I
few it myself.
I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that:
all the stir people make in the world about ghosts, and
apparitions, is owing to the strength of imagination, and
the powersul operation of sancy in their minds; that
there is no such thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost
walking, and the like: The people's poring affectionately
upon the past conversation of their deceased friends, so
realizes it to them, that they are capable of sancying.upon
some extraordinary circumstances, that they fee them,
talk to them, and are answered by them ; when, in truth,
there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, and
they really know nothing os the matter.
f or my part, I know not to this hour, whether
there are any such things as real apparitions, spectre?,
or walking of people after they are dead, or whethei
there is an)' thing in the slories they tell us of that kind,
mere t! an the product of vapours, sick minds, and
wandering sancies: But this I know, that my Imagina-
R O B I !* S 0 N C K'V S O E. t 7
tlon worked me up to such a height, and brought me
into such excess of vapours, or what else I may call it, that
I actually supposed' myself oftentimes upon the spot, at
my old castle behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard, Fri-
day's sather, and the reprobate sailors, whom I lest upon
the island : nay, I sancied I talked with them, and looked
at them so steadily, tho' I was broad awake, as at persons
just besore me; and this I did, till I often frightened
myself with the images my sancy represented to me.
One time in my sleep, I had the villany of the throe
pirate sailors so lively related to me by the sirst; Spaniard
and Friday's sather, that it was surprising; they told me
how they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spa-
niards, and that they set sire to the provisions they had
laid up, on purpose to distress and starve them; things
that 1 had never heard of, and that yet were all of them
true in sact: and'it was so warm in my imagination, and
so realized to me, that to the hour I saw them, I could
not be persuaded but that it was, or would be true ; also
how I resented it, when the Spaniards complained to me;
and howl brought them to justice, tried them besore ms,
and ordered them all three to be hanged. What there
was really in this, shall be seen in its place: for however
I came to form such things in my dream, and what se-
cret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say,
very much of it true. I own that this dream had nothing
in it literally and specisically true; but the general part
was so true, the base and villanous behaviour of these
three hardened rogues was such, and had been so
much worse than all I can describe, that the dream
bad too much similitude of the sact ; and as I would
afterwards have punished them severely, so if I had
hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and
should have been justisied both by the laws of Gad
and man.
But to return to my story: in 'this kind os' temper I
had lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my
lise, no pleasant hours, no agreeable - diversion, but
what had something or other of this in it; so that my
wise, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told
me very seriously one night, that she believed there was
some secret powersul. impulse of Providence upon me,
A.4. which
which had determined me to go thither again; and that
she sound nothing hindered mv going, but my being en-
gaged to a wise and children. She told me, that it was
true, she could not think of parting with me; but as she
was assured, that if she was dead, it would be the sirst
thing I would do; so, as it seemed to her, that the thing
was determined above,she would not be the only obstruc-
tion: for, if 1 thought sit, and resolved to go—Here
she found me very in'ent upon her words, and that I
looked very earnestly at her; so that it a little disor-
dered her, and she stopped. I asked her why she did
not go on, and say out what she was going to say.
But lperceived her heart was too sull, and some tears
stood m her eyes. Speak out, my dear, says 1: are you
willing I should go? No, says slie, very assectionately, I
am sar from willing: but if you are resolved to go, says
Jhe, rather than I will be the only hindrance, I will go
wish you; for though I think it a preposterous thing sor
one of your years, and in your condition, yet if it must
be, said she again, weeping, I won't leave you; for if
it be of heaven, you must do it, there is no relisting it;
and if Heaven makes it your duty to go, he will also
make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of
me, that I may not obstruct it.
This affectionate behaviour of my wise, brought me a
little out of the vapours, and I began to consider what I
was doing: I corrected my wandering sancy, and be-
gan to argue with myself sedately, what business I had,
after threescore years, and after such a lise of tedious suf-
ferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a
manner, J say, what business had I to rush into new ha-
zards, and put myself upon adventures, sit only foryouth
and poverty to run into r
With those thoughts, I considered my new engagements,
that I had a wise, one child born, and my wise then great
with child of another ; that I had all the world could give
me, and had no need to seek hazards for gain; that 1
was declining in years, and ought to think rather of
leaving what I had gained, than of seeking to increase
it; that as to what my wife had said, of its being an
impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to
go, I had uo notion of that; so, after many of these co-
gitations.
Robinson Crusoe. 9
gitations, I struggled with the power of my imagi-
nation, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe people
may always do in like cases, if they will; and, in a
word, I conquered it; composed myself with such ar-
guments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pre-
sent condition surnished me plentisully with ; and parti-
cularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to divert
myself with other things, and to engage in some business
that might effectually tie me up from any more excur-
sions of this kind; for I found the thing returned upon
me chiefly when I was idle, had nothing to do, or any
thing of moment immediately besore me.
To this purpose I bought a little sarm in the county of
Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had
a little convenient house upon it, and the land about it I
found was capable of great improvement, and that it waa
many ways suited to my inclination, which delighted ia
cultivating, managing, planting, and improving of
land ; and particularly, being an inland county, I was re-
moved from conversing among ships, sailors, and things
relating to the remote parts of the world.
In a word, I went down to my sarm, settled my sa-
mily, bought me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and, setting seriously to work,
became in one half year a mere country gentleman ;.
my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my
servants, cultivating the ground, inclosing, planting,
&c. and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable lise
that nature was capable of directing, or that a man, al-
ways bred to misfortunes, was capable of being retreat-
eJ to..
I sarmed upon my own. land, I had no rent to pay.
was limited by no articles -y I could pull up, or cut
down, as I pleased: what I planted was for myself;
and what I improved was for my samily ;. and having
thus lest off the thoughts of wandering, I had not th:
kast discomfort in any part of my lise, as to this world-.
Now I thought, indeed, that I enjoyed that middls
state of lise, which my sather so earnestly recommend-
ed to me: a kind of heavenly lise, something lika
what is described by the poet upon the subject of a count-
try lise: $
A 5 Frt>
Free from vicet, free from care,
Age has no fains, and youth no snare.
But, in the middle of all this selicity, one blow from'
unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once, and not only
m ade a breach upon me inevitable and incurable; but
drove me, by its consequence, upon a deep relapse into
the wandering disposition, which, as I may say, being
born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold of me,
and, like the returns of a violent distemper, came on with
an irresistible force upon me; so that nothing could make
any more impression upon me. This blow was the loss of,
my wise.
It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my
Wjfe, to give a character of her particular virtues, and
make my court to the sex by the slattery of a suneral ser-
mon. She was, in a sew words, the stay of all my af-
fairs, the centre of all my enterprises; the engine, that
by her prudence reduced me to that happy compass I was
in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that
fluttered in my head, as above; and did more to guide
niy rambling genius, than a mother's tears, a sather's
instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own reason-
ing powers, could do. I was happy in listening to her
tears, and in being moved by her intreaties, and to the
last degree desolate and dislocated in the world by the
loss ot her.
When she was gone, the world looked aukwardly
round me; I was as much a stranger in it, in my
thoughts, as I was in the Brasils, when I sirst went on-
shore there; and as much alone, except as to the assist-
ance cf servants, as I was in my island. I knew neither
what to tlo, or what not to do. 1 saw the world busy
round me, one part labouring for bread, and the other
squandering it in vile excesses, or empty pleasures;
,equally miserable, because the end they proposed still
fled from them; for the men of pleasure every day sur-
feited of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow
and repentance; and the men of labour spent their
strength in daily strugglings for bread, to maintain the
vital strength they laboured with; so living in a daily
circulation
Ffo bViTs o k' C r o j o 8 T- n
circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and working
but to live; as if daily bread were the only end of a
wearisome lise, and a wearisome lise the only occasion of
daily bread.
This put me in mind of the lise I lived in my king-
dom, the islaad; where I sussered no more corn to grow,
because I did not wint it; and bred no more goats, be-
cause I had no more use for them : where the money lay in
the drawer till it grew mildewed, and had scarce the sa-
vour to be looked upon in 20 years.
All these things, had I improved them as I ought to
have done, and as reason and religion had dictated to
me, would have taught me to search surther than human
enjoyments for a sull selicity, and that there was some-
thing which certainly was the reason and end of Jise, su-
perior to all these things, which was either to be posses-
sed, or at least hoped for on this side the grave.
But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship with-
out a pilot, that could only run besore the wind; my
thoughts run all away again into the old assair; my
head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign ad-
ventures ; and all the pleasing innocent amusements of my
sarm, and my garden, my cattle and my samily, which
besore entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, had no
relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or food
to one that has no taste: in a word, I resolved to leave off
housekeeping, let my sarm, and return to London; and
in a sew months after I did so.
When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as be-
sore; I had no relish to the place, n» employment in it,
nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person,
of whom it may be said, he is persectly useless in God's
creation, and it is not one sarthing matter to the rest of
his kind whether he be dead or alive. This also was the
thing, which of all circumstances of lise was the most
my aversion who had been all my days used to an active
lise; and I would often say to myself: A state of idle-
ness is the very dregs of lise; and indeed I thought I was
much more suitably employed, when I was twenty-six
days making a deal-board.
It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when
my nephew, whom, as I have observed besore, I had
, A' A 6 brought
brought up to the sea, and had made him commander os
a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Bilboa,
aeing the sirst he had made: he came to me, and told
me, that some merchants of his acquaintance had been
proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the East-
sndies, and to China, as private traders: and now, uncle,
fays he, if you will go to sea with me, I'll engage to land
•ou upon your old habitation in the island, for we are to
:ouch at the Brasils.
Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a suture
!tate, and of the existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of
things, which we form in our minds, persectly reserved,
and not communicated to any in the world.
My nephew knew nothing how sar my distemper of
,slandering was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of
s\ hat he had in his thoughts to say; when, that very
morning besore he came to me, I had, in a great deal of
consusion of thought, and revolving every part of my
circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, viz.
that I would go to Liibon, and consult with my old sea-
captain; and so, if it was rational and practicable, I
would go and see the island again, and see what was be-
come of my people there. I had pleased myself also with
the thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inha-
bitants from hence, getting a patent for the possession,
and I know not what -y when, tn the middle of all this,
in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his project of
carrying me thither, in his way to the East-Indies.
I paused a while at his words* and looking steadily at
him, What devil, said I, sent you on this unlucky er-
rand? My nephew startled, as if he had been frighted
at sirst; but perceiving I was not much displeased with
the proposal, he recovered himself: I hope it may not be
an unlucky proposal, Sir, says he; I dare say you would
be pleased to see your new colony there, where you once
reigned with more selicity than most of your brother
monarchs in the world.
In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my tem-
per, that is to say, with the prepossession I was under,
and of which I have said so much, that I told him in
few words, if he agreed with the merchants, I would
go with htm: but I told him I would not promise to go
any sarther than my own island. Why Sir, says he, you
don't want to be lest there again, I hope? Why, said I,
can you not take me up again in your return? He told
me it would not be possible to do so; that the merchants
would never allow him to come that way with a loaden
ship of such value, it being a month's sail out bf his way,
and might be three or four: besides, Sir, if I should mis-
carry, said he, and not return at all, then you would be
just reduced to the condition you were in besore.
This was very rational; but we both found out a
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed floop on
board the ship, which, being taken in pieces, and
shipped on board the ship, might, by. the help of some
carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, be set up
again in the island, and sinished, sit to go to. sea in a sev*
days.
I was not long resolving;. for indeed the importuni*
ties of my nephew joined in so effectually with my in-
clination, that nothing could oppose me: on the other
hand, my wise being dead, I had nobody that concern-
ed themselves so much for me, as to persuade me one
way or other, except my ancient good friend the wi-
dow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my
years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazard-
of a long voyage; and, above all, my young children:
but it. was all to no purpose, I had an irresistible desire*
to the voyage; and I told her, I thought there was
something so uncommon in the impressions I had upon
my mind for. the voyage, that it would be a kind of
resisting Providence, if I should attempt to stay at home;
after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined
with me, not only in, making provision far my voyage,
but also in settling my samily-affairs in my absence, and
providing for the education of my children.
In order to this I made my will, and settled the
estate I had in. such a manner to my children, and
placed it in such hands, that I was persectly easy, and
satissied they would have justice done them, whatever
might besal me; and for their education, I lest it
wholly to my widow, with a sufficient maintenance, to
herself for her care: all which she richly deserved; for
on
no mother could have taken more care in their education,
or understood it better; and as she lived till I came home,
I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of
January, 1694-5', an<* ^> w'tn mv raan Friday, went
on board in the Downs the 8th, having, besides that
sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable
cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony,,
which, if I did not sind in good condition, I resolved to
Xeave so.
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I pur-
posed to place there as inhabitants, or, as least, to set on
work there, upon my own account, while I staid, and
either to leave them there, or carry them forward, as they
should appear willing; particularly I carried two carpen-
ters, a smith, and a very handy ingenious sellow, who
v*-as not only a cooper by trade, but was also a general-
mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, and-
hand-mills to grind corn ; was a good turner, and a good
pot-maker; he also made any thing that was proper to
make of earth, or wood; in a word, we called him our
J ack of all trades.
- With these I carried a taylor, who had offered himself
to go passenger to the East-Indies with my nephew, but
afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation, and
proved a most necessary handy sellow as could be desired,
in many other businesses besides that of his trade; for, as
J observed formerly, necessity arms us for all employ-
ments.
My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not
kept an account of particulars, consisted of a sufficient
quantity of linen, and some thin English stuffs for clothing,
the Spaniards that I expected to sind there; and enough
of them, as by my calculation might comfortably supply
them for seven years; if I remember right, the materials
which I carried for clothing them, with gloves, hats,
shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could want
for wearing, amounted to above zool. including some
beds, bedding, and houshold stuff, particularly kitchen
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c. besides near
jcol. more in iron-work, nails, tools of every kind,
staples,
staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could
think of.
I carried also a hundred spare arms, musquets and
susils, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity of
shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two
pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not what
time, and what extremities, I was providing for, I car-
fied an hundred barrels of powder, besides swords and
eutlasses, and the iron part of some pikes and halberts,
so that, in short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of
stores; and I made my nephew carry two small quarter-
deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave be-
hind, if there was occasion, that when they came there,
we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts of ene--
mies: and indeed I at sirst thought there would be need
enough of it all, and much more, if we hoped to main-
tain our possession of the island, as shall be seen in the
course of the story.
I had not such bad luck in this voyage, as I had
been used to meet with ; and theresore shall have the less
occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps may be
impatient to hear how matters went with my colony ; yet
some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad weather hap-
pened, on this sirst setting out, which made the voyage
longer than I expected it at sirst; and I, who had never
made but one voyage, viz. my sirst voyage to Guinea, in
which I might be said to come back again; as the voyage
was at sirst designed, began to think the same ill sate still
attended me; and that I was born to be never contented
with my owri shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at'
sea.
Contrary winds sirst put us to the northward, and we
were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we
lay windbound two and thitty days; but we had this sa-
tissaction with the disaster, that provisions were here ex-
ceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that while we
lay here, we neves touched the ship's stores, but rather ad-
ded to them; here also I took several hogs, and two cows
wiih their calves, which I resolved, if lhad a good pas-
sage, to put ashore in my island; but we found occasion
to dispose otherwise of them.
We
We set out the jth of February from Ireland, and had'
a very sair gale of wind for some days; as I remem-
ber, it might be about the 20th of February, in the even-
ing, late, when the mate, having the watch, came into
the round house, and told us, he saw a slash of sire, and
heard a gun sired; and while he was telling us of it, a
boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard another.
This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where
for a while we heard nothing; but in a sew minutes we
saw a very great light, and found that there was some
very terrible sire at a distance; immediately we had re-
course to our reckonings, in which we all agreed, that
there could be no land that way, in which the sire
shewed itself, no, not for 500 leagues; for it appeared
at W. N.W, Upon this we concluded it must be some
Chip on sire at lea; ami as by our hearing the noise
of guns just besore, we concluded it could not be sar
off, we stood directly towards it, and were presently sa-
tissied we should discover it, because the sarther we sail-
ed, the greater the light appeared, tho' the weather being
hazy, we could not perceive any thing but the light
for a while: in about half an hour's sailing, the wind
ueing sair for us, though not much of it, and the weather
bearing up a little, we could plainly discern, that it was
1 great ship on sire in the middle of the sea. I was most
ensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all ac-
juainted with the persons engaged in it: I presently re-
flected my former circumstances, in what condition I
i'as in when taken up by the Portuguese captain; and
iow much more deplorable the circumstances of the poor
reatures belonging to the ship must be, if they had no
ither ship in company with them : upon this, I immedi-
ately ordered, that sive guns should be sired, one soon
fter another, that, if possible, we might give notice to
hem, that there was help for them at hand, and that
hey might endeavour to save themselves in their boat;
or though we could see the slame in the ship, yet they,
t being night, could see nothing of us.
We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the
lurriing ship drove, waiting for day-light; when, on a
udden, to our great terror, though we had reason to
xpect it, the ship blew up in the air, and immediately
sunk:
sunk: this was terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight,
for the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, must be
either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost distress
in their boats in the middle of the ocean, which, at pre-
sent, by reason it was dark, I could not see: however, te
direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung
out in all the parts of the ship where we could, and which
we had lanthorns for, and kept siring guns all the night
long; letting them know by this, that there was a ship
not sar osf.
About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered the
ship's boats, by the help of our perspective-glasses; and
found there were two of them, both thronged with
people, and deep in the water; we perceived they rowed,
the wind being against them ; that they saw our ship, and
did the utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know
we saw them; and hung a waft out, as a signal for them
to come on board; and then made more Tail, standing
directly to them. In a little more than half an hour, we
came up with them, and, in a word, took them all in,
being no less than sixty-four men, women, and children;
for there were a great many passengers.
Upon the whole, we found it was a French merchant-
ship of 300 tons, homeward-bound from Quebeck, in
the river of Canada. The master gave us a long ac-
count of the distress of his ship, how the sire began in the
steerage by (he negligence of the steersman; but, on his
crying out for help, was, as every body thought, entirely
put out: but they soon found that some sparks of the
sirst sire had gotten into some part of the ship, so difsicult
to come at, that they could not effectually quench it;
and afterwards getting in between the timbers, and with-
in the cieling- of the snip, it proceeded into the hold, and
mastered all the skill, and all the application they were
able to exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty large;
being their long-boat, and a great shallop, besides a
small skiff, which was of no great service to them,
©ther than to get some fresh water and provisions int«
her,
her, after they had secured themselves from 'the sire,
They had indeed small hope of their lives, by getting
into these boats at that distance from any land; only,
as they said well, that they were escaped from the sire,,
and had a possibility, that some ship might happen to
be at sea, and might take them in. They had sails,,
oars, and a compass -y, and were preparing to make the
best of their way to Newfoundland, the wind blowing
pretty sair; for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E. They
Ytad as much provisions and water, as, with sparing it
so as to be next door to starving, might support them
about 11 days; in which, if they had no bad weather,
and no contrary winds, the captain said, he hoped he
rnight get to the banks of Newfoundland, and might
perhaps take some sish to sustain them till they might go
on shore. But there were so many chances against
them in all these cases: such as storms 'to overset and
founder them; rains and cold to benumb and perish their
limbs; contrary winds to keep them out and starve them;
that it must have been next to miraculous if they had
escaped.
Iti the midst of their consultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair, the captain, with tears in
hiis eyes, told me, they were on a sudden surprised with
the joy of hearing a gun sire, and after that sour more;
these were the sive guns which I caused to be sired at sirst
feeing the light: this revived their hearts, and gave them
the notice, which, as above, I designed it should, viz.
that there was a ship at hand for their help.
It was upon the hearing these guns, that- they took
down their masts and sails; and the found coming from
the windward, they resolved to lie by till morning.
Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they sired
three musquets, one a considerable while after another;
but these, the wind being contrary, we never heard.
Some time after that again, they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and hear-
ing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to
be sired ail the rest of the night; this set them to.
work with their oars to keep their,boats a-head, at
least that we might the sooner come up with themj
and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw
them.
It is impossible for me to express the several gestures,
the strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these
poor delivered people run into, to express the joy of their
fouls at so unexpected a deliverance; gries and sear are
easily described; sighs, tears, groans, and a very few mo-
tions of head and hands, make up the sum of its variety j
but an excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand ex-
travagancies in it; there were some in tears, some raging
and tearing themselves, as if they had been in the greatest
agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and downright
lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their
seet, others wringing their hands; some were dancing,,
several singings some laughing, more crying; many quire
dumb, not able to speak a word; others sick and vomit-
ing; several swooning, and ready to saint; and a sew
were eroding themselves, and giving God thanks.
I would not wrong them neither; there might be many
that were thanksul afterward; but the r»ssion was too
strong for them at sirst, and they were not able to master
it: they were thrown into ecstasies and a kind of frenzy,,
and so there were but a very sew who were composed
and serious in their joy.
Perhaps also the case may have some addition to it,
from the particular circumstance of the nation they be-
longed to; I mean the French, whose temper is allowed
to be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly,
and their spirits more fluid, than of other nations. I anv
not philosopher enough to determine the cause, but no-
thing I had ever seen besore came up to it: the ecstasies
poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when he found his
sather in the boat, came the nearest to it; and the surprise
of the master, and his two companions, whom I delivered -
from the two villains that set them on shore in the island,
came a little way towards it; but nothing was to com-
pare to this, either that I saw in Friday, or any where
else in my lise.
It is sarther observable, that these extravagancies did
not shew themselves in that different manner I have men-
tioned, in different persons only: but all the variety
svould appear in a stiort succession of moments, in one
aid
and the same person. A man that we-saw this minute
dumb, and, as it were, stupid and consounded, should
the next minute be dancing and hallooing like an antick;
and the next moment a tearing his hair, or pulling his
clothes to pieces; and stamping them under his feet like a
madman; a sew minutes after that, we should have him
all in tears, then sick, then swooning; and had not im-
. mediate help been had, would, in a sew moments more,
}.a\ e been dead; and thus it was, not with one or two,
or ten, or twenty, but with the greatest part of them;
and, if I remember right, our surgeon was obliged to let
above thirty of them blood.
There were two priests among them, one an old man,
and the other a young man; and that which was strangest
was, that the oldest man was the worst.
As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself sase, he dropped down stone dead, to ali
appearance; not the least sign of lise could be perceived
in him; our surgeon immediately applied proper reme-
dies to recover him; and was the only man in the ship
that believed he was not dead: and at Kngth he opened
a vein in his arm, having sirst chased and rubbed the
part, so as to warm it as much as possible: upon this the
blood, which only dropped at sirst, flowed something
freely; in three minutes after the man opened his eyes;
and about a quarter of an hour after that, he spoke,
frew better, and, in a little time, quite well; after the
lood was stopped, he walked about, told us he was per-
fectly well, took a dram of cordial, which the surgeon
£-ave him, and was, what we called, come to himself;
about a quarter of an hour after this, they came run-
ning into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a
French-woman that had sainted; and told him, the
priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had began to
revolve the change of his circumstances in his mind,
and this put him into an ecstasy of joy; his spirits
whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them;
the blood grew hot and severish; and the man was
as sit for Bedlam, as any creature that ever was in
it: the surgeon would not bleed him again in that
condition, but gave him something to doze and put
bim to sleep, which, after some time, operated upon
him, and he waked next morning persectly composed,
and well.
The younger priest behaved himself with great com-
mand of his passion, and was really an example of a
serious well-governed mind; at his sirst coming on board
the ship, he threw himself slat on his sace, prostrating
himself in thanksulness for his deliverance; in which I
unhappily and unseasonably dilturbed him, really think-
ing he had been in a swoon; but he spake calmly; *
thanked me; told me, he was giving God thanks for
his deliverance; begged me to leave him a sew mo-
ments, and that, next to his Maker, he would give me
thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not
only lest him, but kept others from interrupting him
also ; he continued in that posture about three minutes,
or a little more, after I lest him; then came to me, as
he had said he would, and, with a great deal of seri-
ousness and assection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked
ir.e.that had, under God, given him and so many mise-
rable creatures their lives: I told him, I had no room to
move him to thank God for it, rather than me; for I
had seen, that he had done that already; but I added,
that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dic-
tated to all men, and that we had as much reason as he-
to give thanks to God, who had blessed us so sar as to
make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of his
creatures.
After this, the young priest applied himself to his coun-
try-folks, laboured to compose them; persuaded, intreat- -
ed, argued, reasoned with them, and did his utmost to
keep them within the exercise of their reason; and with
some he had success, tho' others were, for a time, out of
all government of themselves.
1 cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps
it may be usesul to those into whose hands it may sall,
in the guiding themselves in all the extravagancies of
their passuns; for if an excess of joy can carry men out
to such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what
will not the extravagancies of anger, rage, and a pro-
voked mind, carry us to? And indeed, here I saw rea-
son for keeping an exceeding good watch over our pas-
lions of every kind, as well those of joy and satissaction,
as those of sorrow and anger.
We were something disordered by these extravagan-
-cies among our new guests for the sirst day; but when
they had been retired, lodgings provided for them a»
- well as our ship would allow, and they had flept heartily,
as most of them did, being satigued and frightened, they
were quite another fort of people the next day.
Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments,
lor the kindness shewn them, was wanting; the French,
"tis known, are naturally apt enough to exceed that way.
The captain, and one of the priests, came to me the next
, day ;and, desiring to speak with me and my nephew, the
, commander, began to consult with us what should be
done with them; and sirst they told us, that, as we had
,saved their lives, so all they had was little enough for a
.return to us for the kindness received. The captain said,
they had saved some money, and some things of value in
their boats, catched hastily t)ut of the slames; and if we
would accept it, they were ordered to make an osser of
it all to us; they only desired to be set on shore some-
where in our way, where, if possible, they might get a
passage to France.
My nephew was for accepting their money at sirst
', word, and to consider what to do with them afterwards-;
; but I over-ruled him in that part-; for I knew what it
, was to be set on shore in a strange country; and if the
Portugal captain, that took me up at sea, had served me
'so, and took all J had for my deliverance, I must have
.-starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brasils, as
I had been at Barbary, the being fold to a Mahometan
only excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not a much
better master than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a much
• worse.
I theresore told the French captain, that we had taken
them up in their distress, it was true; but that it was out
duty to do so, as we were sellew-creatures, and as we
would desire to be so delivered, if we were in the like
or any other extremity; that we had done nothing for
them, but what we believe they would have done for
us if we had been in their case, and they in ours; but
that we took them up to serve them, not to plunder them ,•
.»nd that it would be a most barbarous thing, to take that
little from them which they had saved out of the sire, and
then set them on shore, and leave them; that this would
be sirst to save them from death, and then kill them our-
selves; save them from drowning, and then abandon
them to starving; and, theresore, I would not let the
least thing be taken from them: as to setting them on
stiore, I told them indeed, that was an exceeding disfi-
culty to us, for that the ship was bound to the East-
Indies; and though we were driven out of our course-to
the westward, a very great way, which, perhaps, was
directed by heaven on purpose for their deliverance, yet
it was impossible for us wilsully to change our voyage on
this particular account;-nor could my nephew, the cap-
tain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under
charter-party to pursue his voyage by-the way of Brasil^
and all I knew he could do for them was, to put ourselves
in the way of meeting with other .ships homeward bound
from the West-Indies, and get them passage, if possible,
to England or France.
The sirst part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thanksul for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the passen-
gers, at the notion of being carried away to the East-
Indies ; they then intreated me, that seeing I was driven
so sar to die westward besore I met with them, I would
at least keep on the same course to the banks of New-
foundland, where it was possible I might meet with some
-ship or sloop that .they might hire to carry them back to
• Canada, from whence they came.
I thought this was but a reasonable request on their
part; and theresore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed
I considered, that to carry this whole company to the
East-Indies, would not only be an intolerable severity to
the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voy-
age, by devouring all our provisions; so I thought it no
breach of charter-party, but what an unsoreseen acci-
dent made absolutely necessary to us; and in which no
one could say we were to blame; for the laws of God
and nature would have forbid, that we should resuse
to take up two boats sull of people in such a distressed
condition.; and the nature of the thing, as well re-
specting
specting ourselves, as the poor people, obliged us to fee
them on shore somewhere or other, for their deliver-
ance; so I consented that we would carry them to New-
foundland, if wind and weather would permit; and, if
mot, that I would carry them to Martinico in the West-
ind ies.
The wind continued fresh, easterly, but the weather
pretty good; and as it had blowed continually in the
points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed
several opportunities ot' sending them to France-, for
*ve met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two
,were French, ftom St. Christopher's; but they had been
so long beating up against the wind, that they durst take
in no passengers for sear of wanting provisions for the
voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should
take in; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a
week after this, that we made the Banks of Newfound-
land, where, to shorten my story, we put all our French
people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there,
to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry them to
France, if they could get provision to victual themselves
with: when, I say, all the French went on shore, I
should remember, that the young priest 1 spoke of,
Jiearing we were bound to the East-Indies, desired to
go the voyage with us, and to be set on shore on the
coast of Coromandel: I readily agreed to that; for I
,wondersully liked the man, and had very good reason,
0.S will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen
entered themselves in our ship, and proved very usesul
fellows.
From hence we directed our course for the West-Indies,
{leering away S. and S. by E. for about 20 days together,
sometimes little or no wind at all, when we met with
another subject sor our humanity to work upon, almost
as deplorable as that besore.
It was in the latitude of 27 degrees, <; minutes N.
and the 19th day of March, 1694-c, when we espied
a sail, our course S. E. and by S. We soon perceived
it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us; but
could not at sirst know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-
top-mast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she
sires a gun as a signal of distress; the weather was pretty-
good, wind at N. N. W, a fresh gale, and we soon came
to speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from
*• Barbadoes, but had been blown out os the road at Bar-
badoes, a few days besore she was ready to sail, by
a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chies mate
were both gone on shore; so that beside the terror of the
storm, they were but in an indisserent case for good
artists to bring the ship home: they had been already
nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible
storm after the hurricane was over, which had blown
them quite out of their knowledge to the westward,
and in which they lost their masts, as above; they told
us, they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but
were then driven away again to the south-east, by a
strong gale of wind at N. N. W. the same that blew
now, and having no sails to work the ship with, but a
main-course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-
mast, which they had set up, they could not lie near the
wind, but were endeavouring to stand away for the Ca-
naries.
But that which was worst of all, was, that they were
almost starved for want of provisions, besides the satigues
they had undergone; their bread and flesh was quite
gone, they had not an ounce lest in the ship, and
had none for eleven days; the only relies they had,
was, their water was not all spent, and they had about
half a barrel of flour lest; they had sugar enough; some
succades or sweet-meats they had at sirst, but they were
devoured, and they had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant,
on board, who were going passengers, and thinking the
ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the
evening besore the hurricane began; and, having no pro-
visions os their own lest, they were in a more deplorable
condition than the rest; for the seamen, being reduced
to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no compas-
sion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers; and they
were indeed in a condition that their misery is very hard
to describe.
Voi. II. B I had
I had perhaps, not known this part, if my curiosity had
not led me, the weather being sair, and the wind abated,
to go on board the ship : the second mate, who upon this
occasion commanded the ship, had been on board our
(hip; and he told me indeed, that they had three passen-
gers in the great cabin, that they were in a deplorable
condition; nay, says he, I believe they are dead, for I
have heard nothing of them for above two days; and I
was afraid to enquire after them, said he, for I had no-
thing to relieve them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what
relies we could spare, and indeed I had so sar over-ruled
things with my nephew, that I would have victualled
them, tho' we had gone away to Virginia, or any part of
the coast of America, to have supplied ourselves; but
there was no necessity for that.
But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid
of eating too much, even of that little we gave them; the
mate or commander brought six men with him in his
boat; but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and
were so weak, they could hardly sit to their oars: the
mate himself was very ill, and half-starved; for he de-
clared he had reserved nothing from the men, and went
share and share alike with them in every bit they eat.
I cautioned him to eat sparingly; but set meat besore
him immediately, and he had not eaten three niouthsuls
besore he began to be sick, and out of order; so he stopt
awhile, and our surgeon mixed him up something with
some broth, which he said would be to him both food
and physic; and after he had taken it, he grew better:
in the mean time, I forgot not the men; I ordered vic-
tuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather de-
voured than ate it; they were so exceeding hungry, that
they were in a manner ravenous, and had no command
of themselves; and two of them ate with so much gree-
diness, that they were in danger of their lives the next
morning.
The sight of these people's distress was very moving
to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible pro-
spect of at my sirlt coming on shore in my island, where
1 had not the least mouthsul of food, or any hopes of
procuring it; besides the hourly apprehension I had of
r being
Robinson C k v s o t. tj
being trade the food of other creatures. But all the
while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable con-
dition of the ship's company, I could not put out of my
thought the story he had told me of th? three poor crea-
tures in the great cabin; (viz.) the mother, her son, and
the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two
•r three days ; and whom he seemed to confess they had
wholly neglected, their own extremities being so great;
by which I understood, that they had really giren them
no food at all; and that theresore they must be perished,
and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the
cabin.
As I theresore kept the mate, whom we then called cap-
tain, on board with his men to resresh them, so I also forgot
not the starving crew that were lest on board, but ordered
my own boat to go on board the ship, and with my mate
and twelve men to carry them a sack of bread, and four or
sive pieces of bees to boil. Our surgeon charged the men
to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to
keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men'* taking
it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot besore it waa
well boiled, and then to give every man but a little at a
time; and by this caution he preserved the men, who
would otherwise have killed themselves with that very
food that was given them on purpose to save their lives.
At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the
great cabin, and see in what condition the poor passenger*
were in, and, if they were alive, to comfort them and give
them what resreshment was proper; and the surgeon gave
him a large pitcher with some of the prepared broth which
fie had given the mate that was on board, and which he
idid not question would restore them gradually.
I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said above,
having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which I
knew the ship itself would present me with, in a more
lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the
captain of the ship, as we now called him, with roe, and
went myself a little after in their boat-
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to
get the victuals out of the boiler besore it was ready : but
my mate observed his order, and kept a good guard at
the cook-room door; and the man he placed there,
B 2 after
after using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept
them off by sorce: however, he caused some biscuit
cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened them with
the liquor of the meat, which they call brewis, and
gave them every one one, to stay their stomachs, and
told them that it was for their own sasety that he was
obliged to give them but little at a rime. But it was all
in vain, and had I not come on board, and their own
commander and officers with me, and with good
words, and some threats also of giving them no more,
I believe they would have broke into the cook-room
by force, and tore the meat out of the surnace; for words
indeed are of a very small force to an hungry belly:
however we pacisied them, and sed them gradually and
cautiously for the sirst time, and the next time gave them
more, and at last silled their bellies, and the men did well
enough.
But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was
of another nature, and sar beyond the rest; for as, sirst,
the ship's company had so little for themselves, it was
but too true, that they had at sirst kept them very low,
and at last totally neglected them; so that for six or seven
days, it might be said, they had really had no food at all,
and for several days besore, very little.
The poor mother, who, as the sirst mate reported, was
a woman of good sense, and good breeding, had spared
all she could get so affectionately for her son, that at last
she entirely sunk under it: and when the mate of our
ship went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her
back up against the sides, between two chairs, which
tvere lashed sast, and her head sunk in between her shoul-
ders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate
said all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a
speen put some breth into her mouth; she opened her
lips, and lifted up one hand, but could not speak; yet
she understood what he said, and made signs to him, in-
timating, that it was too late sor her; but pointed to her
child, as if she would have said, they should take care of
him.
However the mate, who was exceedingly moved with
the s%ht, endeavoured to get some of the broth ;nto her
mouth; and, fes he said, got two or three sj oonsuls down,
"'though
though I question whether he could be sure of it or not:
but it was too late, and she died the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most
affectionate mother's lise, was not so sar gone; yet he
lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with hardly any
lise lest in him ;• he had a piece of an old glove in his
mouth, having eaten up the rest of it: however, being
young, and having more strength than his mother, the
mate got something dewn his throat, and he began sen-
sibly to revive, though by giving him some time after
but two or three spoonsuls extraordinary, he was very
sick, and brought it up again.
But the next care was the poor maid ; she lay all along
npon the deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one
that had sallen down with an apoplexy, and struggled
for lise; her limbs were distorted, one of her hands was
clasped round the frame of one chair, and she griped it
so hard, that we could not easily make her let it go;
her pther arm lay over her head, and her seet lay both
together, set sast against the frame of the cabin-table;
in short, she lay just like one in the last agonies of death;
and yet she was alive too.
The poor creature was not only starved with hunger,
and terrisied with the thoughts of death, but, as the men
told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress,
whom we saw dying two or three days besore, and
whom she loved most tenderly.
, We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great know-
ledge and experience, and with great application, re-
covered her as to lise, he had her upon his hand as to her
senses, for she was little less than distracted for a con-
siderable time after; as shall appear presently.
Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be de-
sired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a jour-
ney into the country, where sometimes people stay a
week or a fortnight at a place. Our business was to
relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by for
them; and though they were willing to steer the same
course with us for some days, yet we could carry no
sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts: how-
ever, as their captain begged of us to help him to set up
1' B 3 a main-
a main-top-mast, and a kind of top-mast to his jury-
fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or
four days, and then having given him sive barrels of bees
and pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of
peas, flour, and what other things we could spare; and
taking three casks of sugar and some rum, and some
pieces of eight of them for satissaction, we lest them,
taking on board with us, at their own earnest request, the
youth, and the maid, and all their goods.
The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a
yretty, well-bred, modest, and sensible youth; greatly de-
jected with the loss of his mother, and, as is seems, had
lost his sather but a sew months besore at Barba-
does. I !e begged of the surgeon to speak to me, ta
take him out of the ship; for he said, the cruel sellows
had murdered his mother; and indeed so they had, that
is to say, passively; for they might have, spared a small
fustenance to the poor helpless widow, that might have
preserved her lise, though it had been just to keep her
alive. But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no jus-
tice, no right; and theresore is remorseless, and capable
of no compassion.
The surgeon told him how far we were going, and how
it would carry him away from all his friends, and put
him perhaps in as bad circumstances almost, as we
found them in; that is to say, starving in the world.
He said it mattered not whither he went, if he was but
delivered from the terrible crew that he was among:
that the captain (by which he meant me, for he could
know nothing of my nephew) had saved his lise, and
he was sure would nor hurt him; and as for the maid, he
was sure, if she came to herself, she would be very thank-
ful for it, let us carry them whither we would. The sur-
geon represented the case so asfectionately to me, that I
yielded, and we took them both on board with all their
goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could
not be removed, or come at; and as the youth had a
bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign a
writing, obliging him to go, as soon as he came to Bris-
tol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the
youth said he was related, and to deliver a letter which
I wrote to him, and all the goods he had belonging to the
deceased

deceased widow; which I suppose was not done; for I
could never learn, that the ship came to Bristol} but was,
as is most probable, lost at sea, being in so disabled a con-
dition, and so sar from any land, that I am of opinion,
the sirst storm she met with afterwards, she might founder
in the sea; for she was leaky, and had damage in her
hold when I met with her.
I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and had
hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at
sirst the winds had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody
with the little incidents of wind, weather, currents, &c.
on the rest of our voyage; but shortening my story for
the sake of what is to follow, shall observe that I came
to my old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April,
1695. It was with no small difficulty that I found the
place; for as I came to it, and went from it besore, on
the south and east side of the island, as coming from the
Brasils, so now coming in between the main and the
island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any land-
mark, I did not know it when 1 saw it, or know whether
I saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oroonoque,
but none for my purpose; only this I learned by my
coasting the shore, that I was under one great mistake
besore, viz. that the continent which I thought I saw,
from the island I lived in, was really no continent, but
a long island, or rather a ridge of islands reaching from
one to the other side of the extended mouth of that
great river; and that the savages who came to my island,
were not properly those which we call Caribbees, but
islanders, and other Barbarians of the same kind, who
inhabited something nearer to our side than the rest.
In short, I visited several of the islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not. On
one of them I found some Spaniards, and thought they
had lived there; but, speaking with them, found they
had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by, and that they
came thitherto make salt, and catch some pearl-muscles,
if they could; but they belonged to the Isle de Trini-
dad, which lay sarther north, in the latitude of 10 and
II degrees.
B 4. Thu*
Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes
,with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop
(which we had found a convenient boat, and theresore
kept her with their very good will) at length I came sair
on the south-side of my island, and I presently knew the
•very countenance of the place; so I brought the ship
•sase to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where
was my old habitation.
As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and
asked him, if he knew where he was? He looked about
a little, and presently clapping his hands, cried; O yes,
O there, O yes, O there, pointing to our old habitation;
and sell a dancing and capering like a mad sellow, and I
had much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea, to
swim athore to the place.
Well, Friday, said I, do you think we shall find any
tody here or no? And what do you think, shall we see
your sather? The sellow stood mute as a stock a good
while; but when I named his sather, the poor affectionate
creature looked dejected; and I could see the tears run
<lown his sace very plentisully. What is the matter, Fri-
day, said I? Are you troubled because you may see your
father? No, no, says he, shaking his head, no see him
xnore, no ever more see again. Why so, said I, Friday?
J-Iow do you know that? O no, O no, says Friday, he
long ago die; long ago, he'much old man. Well, well
said I, Friday, you don't know : but shall we see any one
else then? The sellow, it seems, had better eyes than I,
a.nd he points jurt to the hill above my old house; and
though we lay half a league off, he cries out, Me see!
jne see! yes, yes, me see much man there, and there, and
there. I looked, but could see nobody, no, not with a
perspective glass; which was, I suppose, because I could
fiot hit the place; for the sellow was right, as I found
upon enquiry the next day, and there were sive or six
jnen altogether stood to look at the ship, not knowing
what to think of us.
As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused
the English ancient to be spread, and sired three guns,
to give them notice we were friends; and about half
a quarter of an hour after, we perceived a smoke rise
from the side of the creek; so I immediately ordered
a boat
a boat out, taking Friday with me; and, hanging out a
white flag, or a' slag of truce, I went directly on shore,
taking-with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I
had told the whole story of my living there, and the man-
ner of it, and every, particular, both of myself and those
that I lest there; and who was on that account extremely
desirous to go with me. We had besides about sixteen men
very well armed, if we had found any new guest there
which we did not know of; but we had no need of
weapons. r
As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high
water, we rowed directly into the creek; and the sirst
man I sixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard whose lise I
had saved, and whom I knew by his sace persectly well;
as to his habit, I shall describe it afterwards. I ordered
nobody to go on shore at sirst but myself, but there was
no keeping Friday in the boat: for the assectionate crea-
ture had spied his sather at a distance a good way osf of
the Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of him; and
if they had not let him go on shore, he would have jump-
ed into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew
away to his sather like an arrow out of a bow. It
would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the
sirmest resolution, to have seen the sirst transports of this
poor sellow's joy, when he came to his sather; how he
embraced him, kissed him, stroaked his sace, took him up
in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay.down by
- him; then stood and looked at him, as any one would
look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour toge-
ther; then lay down upon the ground, and stroaked his
legs, and kissed them, and then got up again, and stared
at him; one would have thought the sellow bewitched:
but it would have made a dog laugh to see how the next
day his passion ran out another way: in the morning he.
walked along the shore, to and again, with his sather,
several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if
he had been a lady; and every now and then would
come to setch something or other for him to the boat,
either a lump of sugar, or a dram, a biscuit, or some-
thing or other that was good. In the afternoon his fro-
lics ran another way, for then he would set the old
man down upon the ground, and dance about him, and
£ 5 made
made a thousand antic postures and gestures; and all the
while he did this, he would be talking to him, and telling
him one story or another of his traTels, and of what had
happened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the
same silial assection was to be found in Christians to their
parents, in our parts of the world, one would be tempted
to say, there hardly would have been any need of the
sifth commandment.
But this is a digression; I return to my landing. It
would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and
civilities that the Spaniards received me with. The sirst
Spaniard, whom as I said, I knew very well, was he whose
lise I saved; he came towards the boat, attended by one
more, carrying a flag of truce also ; and he did not only
not know me at sirst, but he had no thoughts, no notion,
of its being me that was come, till I spoke to him : Seig-
nior, said 1, in Portuguese, do you not know me? At which
he spoke not a word; but giving his musquet to the man
that was with him, threw his arms abroad, and saying
something in Spanish, that I did not persectly hear, cams
forward, and embraced me, telling me he was inexcusable,
not to know that sace again, that he had once seen, as of
an angel from heaven, sent to save his lise: he said
abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred Spa-
niard always knows how; and then beckoning to the
person that attended him, bade him go and call out his
comrades. He then asked me, if I would walk to my own
habitation where he would give me possession of my own
Jiouse again, and where I should see there had been but
jiiean improvements; so I walked along with him; but
alas ! I could no more sind the place again, than if I had
never been there; for they had planted so many trees,
and placed them in such a posture, so thick and close to
one another, in ten years time they were grown so big,
that, in short, the place was inaccessible, except by such
windings and blind ways, as they themselves only who
made them could sind.
I asked th?n>j what put them upon all these fortisica-
tions ? He tO^ferrie, I would say there was need enough
of if, wneri Pey had given an accoirnt how they had
passed their time since their arriving in the island, espe-
cially after they had the misfortune to sind that I was
gone:
Robinson ClVitt. je
gone: he told me ne could not but have some satissaction
in my good fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a
good ship, and to my satissaction ; and that he had often-
times a strong persuasion, that one time or other he should
see me again : but nothing that ever besel him in his lise,
he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at sirst, as
the disappointment he was under when he came back to
the island, and found I was not there.
As to the three Barbarians (so he called them) that
were lest behind, and of whom he said he had a long
story to tell me; the Spaniards all thought themselves
much better among the savages, only that their number
was so small. And, says he, had they been strong
enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory; and
with that he crossed himself upon the breast. But, Sir,
says he, I hope you will not be displeased, when I shall
tell you how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for
our own preservation, to disarm them, and making them
our subjects, who would not be content with being mo-
derately our masters, but would be our murderers. I an-
swered, I was heartily afraid of it when I lest them
there; and nothing troubled me at my parting from the
island, but that they were not come back, that I might
have put them in possession of every thing sirst, and lest
the other in a state of subjection, as they deserved : but if
they had reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should
be very sar from sinding any sault with it; for I knew
they were a parcel of resractory ungovernable villains,
and were sit for any manner of mischies.
While I was saying this, came the man whom he had
sent back, and with him eleven men more; in the
dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what na-
tion they were of: but he made all clear both to them
and to me. First, he turned to me, and pointing to them,
said, These, Sir, are some of the gentlemen who. owe
their lives to you; and then turning to them, and point-
ing to me, lie let them know who 1 was; upon which
they all came up one by one, not as if they had been
sailors, and ordinary sellows, and I the like, but really,
as if they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I
a monarch, or a great conqueror: their behaviour was to
the last degree obliging and courteous, and yet mixed
B 6 with
with a manly, majestic gravity, which very well became
them ; and, in short, they had so much more manners than,
I, that I scarce knew how to receive their civilities, much
less how to return them in kind.
• The history of their coming to, and conduct in the
island, after my going away, is so remarkable, and has
so many incidents, which the former part of my relation
will help to understand, and which will, in most of the
particulars, reser to that account I have already given,
that I cannot but commit them with great delight to the
reading of those that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in
the sirst person, which will put me to the expence of
ten thousand said I's, and said he's, and he told me's,
and I told him's, and the like; but I (hall collect the
facts historically, as near as I can gather them out of my
memory from what they related to me, and from what
I met with in my conversing with them, and with the
place.
'In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligible as I
Can, I must go back to the circumstance in which I lest
the island, and which the persons were in, of whom I
art to speak'. At sirst it is necessary to repeat, that I had
sent away Friday's sather and the Spaniard, the two
whose lives I had rescued from the savages; I say, I
had sent them away in a large canoe to the main, as I
then thought it, to setch over the Spaniard's companions
whom he had lest behind him, in order to save them
from the like calamity that he had been in; and in order
to succour them from the present, and that, if possible,,
we might together sind some way for our deliverance af-
terward.
When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance
of> or the least room to hope for my own deliverance,,
any more than I had twenty years besore; much less had
J any foreknowledge of what after happened, I mean of
an English ship coming on shore there to setch them off,
and it could not but he a very great surprise to them,
when they came back, not only to sind that I was gone*
but to sind three strangers lest on the spot, possessed of
all that I had lest behind me, which would othewise
feave been their own.
The sirst thing, however, which I enquired into,
that I might begin where I lest off, was of their own
part: and I desired he would give me a particular ac-,
count of his voyage back to his countrymen wich the
boat, when I sent him to setch them over. He told
me there was a little variety in that part; for nothing re-
markable happened to them on the way, they having
Tery calm weather, and a smooth sea; for his coun-
trymen, it could not be doubted, he said, but that they
were overjoyed to see him: (it seems he was the prin-
cipal man among them, the captain of the vessel they
had been shipwrecked in, having been dead some time :)
They were, he said, the more surprised to see him, be-
cause they knew that he was sallen into the hands of
savages, who, they were satissied, would devour him,
as they did all she rest of their prisoners; that when he
told them the story of the deliverance, and in what
manner he was surnished for carrying them away, it
was like a dream to them ; and their astonishment, they
said, was something like that of Joseph's brethren,
when he told them who he was, and told them the story
of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court: but when he shewed
them the arms, the powder, the ball, and the provisions
that he brought them for their journey or voyage, they
were restored to themselves, took a share of the joy of
their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come
away with them.
Their sirst business was to get canoes; and in this they
were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part of
it, but to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to bor-
row two large canoes or periaguas, on the pretence of
going out a sishing, or for pleasure.
In these they came away the next morning; it seems they
wanted no time to get themselves ready, for they had no
baggage, neither clothes, or provisions, or any thing in the
world, but what they had on them, and a sew roots to eat,
of which they used to make their bread.
They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time, unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
to get off from the island; leaving three of the most
impudent, hardened, ungovernable, disagreeable villains
behind
behind me, that any man could desire to meet with, to
the poor Spaniards great gries and disappointment, you
may be sure.
'she only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on Ihore, they gave my letter to
them, and gave them provisions, and other relies, as I
had ordered them to do; also, they gave them the long
paper of directions, which I had lest with them, con-
taining the particular methods which I took for managing
every part of my lise there, the way how I baked my
bread, bred up my tame goats, and planted my corn,
how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word,
every thing I did ; -all this being written down, they
gave to the Spaniards, two of whom understood English
well enough; nor did they resuse to accommodate the
Spaniards with any thing else, for they agreed very well
for some time; they gave them an equal admission into
the house, or cave, and they began-to live very sociably;
and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my
method, and triday's sather together, managed all their
affairs; for, as for the Englishmen, they did nothing
but ramble about the island, shoot parrots, and catch
tortoises, and when they came home at night, the Spa-
niards provided their suppers for them.
The Spaniards would have been satissied with this,
would the other but have let them alone; which, how-
ever, they could not sind in their hearts to do long;
but, like the dog in the manger, they would not eat
themselves, and would not let others eat neither: the
disserences, nevertheless, were at sirst but trivial, and
such as are not worth relating; but at last it broke out
into open war, and it began with all the rudeness and in-
dolence that can be imagined, without reason, without
provocation, contrary to nature, and indeed to common,
^ense; and though it is true, the sirst relation of it came
from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call the ac-
cusers, yet when I came to examine the sellows, they could
not deny a word of it.
But besore I come to the particulars of this part, I
must supply a desect in my sormer relation; and this
was, that I forgot to set down among the rest, that,
as we were weighing anchor to set sail, there
happened a little quarrel on board our ship, which I wag
afraid once would turn to a second mutiny; nor was it
appeased, till the captain, rousing up his courage, and
taking us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and
making two of the most resractory sellows prisoners, he
laid them in irons; and as they had been active in the
former disorders, and let sall some ugly dangerous word*
the second time, he threatened to carry them in irons to
England, and have them hanged there for mutiny, and
running away with the ship.
This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to
do, it frighted some other men in the ship; and some of
them had put it in the heads of the rest, that the captain
only gave them good words for the present, till they should
come to some English port; and that then they should be
all put into a gaol, and tried for their lives.
The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it; upon which it was desired, that I, who still
passed for a great man among them, should go down
with the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell them, that
they might be assured, if they behaved well the rest of
the voyage, all they had done for the time past should
be pardoned. So I went, and as ter passing my Honour's
word to them, they appeared easy, and the more so,
when I caused the two men, who were in irons, to be re-
leased and forgiven.
But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that
night, the wind also salling calm; next morning we
found, that our two men who had been laid in irons,
had stole each of them a musquet, and some other wea-
pons; what powder or shot they had, we knew not; and
had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not yet haled up,
and run away with her to their companions in roguery on
shore.
As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on
more, with twelve men and the mate, and away they
went to seek the rogues; but they could neither sind
them, nor any of the rest; for they all fled into the woods,
when they saw the boat coming on shore. The mate
was once resolved, in justice to their roguery, to have
destroyed their plantations, burnt all their houshold-stuff
and surniture, and lest them to shift, without it; b it
having
having no order he let all alone, lest every thing as they
ibund it, and bringing the pinnace away, came on board
without them.
These two men made their number sive, but the
other three villains were so much wickeder than these,
that after they had been two or three days together,
they turned their two new-comers out of doors to shift
for themselves, and would have nothing to do with
them; nor could they for a good while be persuaded to
give them any food; as for the Spaniards they were not
yet come.
When the Spaniards came sirst on shore, the business
began to go forward; the Spaniards would have per.
shaded the three English brutes to have taken in their two
countrymen again, that, as they said, they might be all
one samily; but they would not hear of it: so the two
poor sellows lived by themselves, and sinding nothing
but industry and application would make them live com-
fortable, they pitched their tents on the north shore of
the island, but a little more to the west, to be out of the
danger of the savages, who always landed on the east parts
of the island.
Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and the
ofher to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the
Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, and
•t especially some of the peas which I had lest them, they
dug and planted, and inclosed, after the pattern I had set
for them all, and began to live pretty well; their sirst crop
of corn was on the ground, and though it was but a little
bit of land which they had dug up at sirst, having had
but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve them, and
find them with bread and other eatables ; and one of the
fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready
at making soup, puddings, and such other preparations, as
the rice, and the milk, and such little flesh as they got,
furnished him to do.
They were going on in a little thriving postare, when
the three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too,
jn mere humour, and to insult them, came and bullied
them, and told them the island was theirs; that the go-
vernor, meaning me, had given them possession of it,
and nobody else had any right to it; and, damn them,
they
they should build no houses upon their ground, unless
they would pay them rent for them.
The two men thought they had jested at sirst; and
asked them to come and sit down, and see what sine houses
they were that they had built, and tell them what rent
they demanded: and one of them merrily told them, if
they were ground-landlords, he hoped, if they built tene-
ments upon the land, and made improvements, they would,
according to the custom of all landlords, grant them a
long lease, and bid them go and setch a scrivener to draw
the writings. One of the three, damning and raging, told
them, they should see they were not in a jest; and going
to a little place at a distance, where the honest men had
made a sire to dress their victuals, he takes a sirebrand,
and claps it to the outside of their hut,, and very sairly set
it on sire; and it would have been all burnt down in a
sew minutes, if one of the two had not run to the sellow,
thrust him away, and trod the sire out with his seet, and
that not without some dissiculty too.
The sellow was in such a rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned upon him with a pole
he had in his hand ; and had not the man avoided the .
blow very nimbly, and run into the hut, he had ended
his days at once. His comrade, seeing the danger they
were both in, ran in after him, and immediately they
came both out with their musquets; and the man that was
sirst struck at with the pole, knocked the sellow down, who
began the quarrel, with the stock of their musquet, and
that besore the other two could come to help him; and
then seeing the rest come at them, they stood together,
and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them, bade
them stand osf.'
The other had sire-arms with them too; but one of
the two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made
desperate by his danger, told them, if they ossered to
move hand or foot, they were all dead men; and boldly
commanded them to lay down their arms. They did
not indeed lay down their arms; but seeing him re-
solute, it brought them to a parley, and they consented
to take their wounded man with them, and be gone;
and Indeed, it seems the sejlow was wounded sufficient-
ly with the blow; however, they were much in the
wrong,
wrong, since they had the advantage, that they did not
disarm them essectually, as they might have done, and
have gone immediately to the Spaniards, and given them
an account how the rogues had treated them; for the
three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every day
gave them some intimation that they did so.
But not to croud this part with an account of the les-
ser part of their rogueries, such as treading down their
corn, shooting three young kids, and a she-goat, which
the poor man had got to breed up tame for their store;
and, in a word, plaguing them night and day in this man-
ner, it forced* the two men to such a desperation, that
they resolved to sight them all three the sirst time they had
a sair opportunity. In order to this, they resolved to goto
the cattle, as they called it, that was my old dwelling,
where the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together,
at that time, intending to have a sair battle, and the
Spaniards should stand by to see sair play. So they'
got up in the morning besore day, and came to the place,
and called the Englishmen by their names, telling a
Spaniard that answered, that they wanted to speak with
them.
It happened that the day besore, two of the Spaniards,
having been in the woods, had seen one os the two
Englishmen, whom, for distinction, I call the honest men;
and he had made a sad complaint to the Spaniards, of
the barbarous usage they had met with from their three
countrymen, and how they had ruined their plantation,
and destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so hard
to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat, and their
three kids, which was all they had provided for their
sustenance; and that if he and his friends, meaning
the Spaniards, did not assist them 'again, they should be
starved. When the Spaniards came home at night, and
they were all at supper, he took the freedom to reprove
the three Englishmen, though in gentle and mannerly
terms, and asked them, how they could be so cruel, they
being harmless, inossensive sellows, and that they were
putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and
that it had cost them a great deal of pams to bring things
to such persection as they had.
One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What
had they to do there ? That they came on shore without
leave, and that they should not plant or build upon the
island; it was none of their ground. Why, says the
Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior Inglese, they must not
starve. The Englishman replied, like a true rough-hewn
tarpaulin, they might starve and be damned, they should
no: plant, nor build in that place. But what must they
do then, Seignior? says the Spaniard. Another of the
brutes returned, do! d—n them, they should be servants,
and work for them. But how can you expect that of
them? They are not bought with your money; you
have no right to make them servants. The Englishmen
answered, The island was theirs, the governor had given
it to them, and no man had any thing to do there but
themselves; and with that swore by his Maker, that he
would go and burn all their new huts; they should build
none upon their land.
Why Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same rule,
we must be your servants too. Ay, says the bold dog,
and so you shall too, besore we have done with you, mix-
ing two or three G—d d—mine's in the proper intervals
of his speech. The Spaniard only smiled at that, and made
him no answer. However, this little discourse had heated
them: and starting up, one says to the other, I think it
was he they called Will Atkins, come Jack, let us go and
have the other brush with them; we will demolish theij
castle, I will warrant you; they shall plant no colony in
our dominions.
Upon this they were all trooping away, with every
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some
insolent things among themselves, of what they would
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity ossered ; but
the Spaniards, it seems, did not so persectly understand
them as to know all the particulars; only that, in general,
they threatened them hard for taking the two EnglisK-
men's part.
Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time
that evening, the Spaniards said, they did not know;
but it seems they wandered about the country part of
the night; and then lying down in the place which I
nsed to call my bower, they were weary, and over-slept
them-
themselves. The case was this: They had resolved to shy
till midnight, and so to take the poor men when they were
asleep; and they acknowledged it afterwards, intending to
set sire to their huts while they were in them, and either
burn them in them, or murder them as they came out:
and, as malice seldom sleeps very found, it was very strange
they would not have been kept waking.
However, as the two men had also a design upon them,
as I have said, tho' a much sairer one than that of burning
and murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them
all, that they were up and gone abroad, besore the bloody-
minded rogues came to their huts.
When they came thither and found' the men gone,
Atkins, who it seems was theforwardest man, called out
to his comrades, ha! Jack, here's the nest: but, d—n
them, the birds are flown: they mused a while to think
what should be the occasion of their being gone abroad
,so soon, and suggested presently, that the Spaniards had
given them notice of it; and with that, they fliook
hands, and swore to one another, that they would be
revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made
this bloody bargain, they sell to work with the poor men's
habitation; they did not set sire indeed to any thing, but
they pulled down both their houses, and pulled them so
Jimb from limb, that they lest not the least stick standing,
or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood they
lore all their little collected houshold-stuff in pieces, and
threw every thing about in such a manner, that the poor
rnen found, afterwards, some of their things a mile osf
from their habitation.
When they had done this, they pulled up all the young
trees which the poor men had planted; pulled up the
inclosure they had made to secure their cattle and their
corn; and, in a word, sacked and plundered every thing,
as completely as a herd of Tartars would have done.
The two men were at thisjuncturegone to sind them out,
and had resolved to sight them where ever they had been,
tho' they were but two or three: so that, had they met,
there certainly would have been bloodshed among them;
for they were all very stout, resolute sellows, to give them
their due.
But Providence took more care to keep them asun-
der,
der, than they themselves could do to meet; for, as
they had dogged one another, when the three were gore
thither, the two were here; and afterwards, when the
two went back to sind them, the three were come to the
old habitation again; we shall see their differing con-
duct presently. When the three came back, like surious
creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they
had been about put them into, they came up to the
Spaniards, and told them what they had done, by way
of scoff and bravado; and one of them stepping up to
one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple of
boys at play, takes hold of his hat, as it was upon his
head, and giving it a twirl about, fleering in his sace,
says he to him, And you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall
have the same sauce, if you do not mend your manners.
The Spaniard, who, though quite a civil man, was as
brave, as a man could desire to be, and withal a strong
well-made man, looked steadily at him for a good
while; and then, having no weapon in his hand, stert
gravely up to him, and with one blow of his sist, knock-
ed him down, as an ox is selled with a pole-ax, at which
one of the rogues, insolent as the sirst, sired his pistol
at the Spaniard immediately; he missed his body indeed,
for the bullets went through his hair; but one of them
touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. The
blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than
he really was, and that put him into some heat, for besore
he acted all in a persect calm; but now resolving to go
through with his work, he stooped and took the sellow's
musquet whom he had knocked down, and was just going
to shoot the man who had sired at him; when the rest of
the Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and calling to
him not to shoot, they stept in, secured the other two, and
took their arms from them.
When they were thus disarmed, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own
countrymen, they began to cool; and giving the Spaniards
better words, would have had their arms again; Dut the
Spaniards, considering the seud that was between them and
the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the best
method they could take to keep them from one another,
told them they would do them no harm; and if they
would
would live peaceably they would be very willing to assist
and associate with them, as they did besore; but that they
could not think of giving them their arms again, while
they appeared so resolved to do mischies with them to
their own countrymen, and had even threatened them all
to make them their servants.
The rogues were now more capable to hear reason
than to act reason; but being resused their arms, they
went raving away, and raging like madmen, threaten-
ing what they would do, though they had no sire-arms:
but the Spaniards despising their threatning, told them,
they should take care how they offered any injury to their
plantation or cattle; for if they did, they would shoot
them, as they would do ravenous beasts, where ever
they found them; and if they sell into their hands
alive, they would certainly be hanged. However, this
was sar from cooling them; but away they went, swear-
ing and raging like suries of hell. As soon as they
were gone, came back the two men in passion and rage
enough also, though of another kind; for having been
at their plantation, and sinding it all demolished and de-
stroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had
provocation enough; they could scarce have room to
tell their tale, the Spaniards were so ea^er to tell them
theirs; and it was strange enough to sind, that three men
should thus bully nineteen, and receive no punishment at
all.
The Spaniard* indeed despised them, and especially
having thus disarmed them, made light of their threat-
cnings; but the two Englishmen resolved to have their
remedy against them, what pains soever it cost to sind
them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told them,
that they were already disarmed: they could not consent,
that they (the'two) mould pursue them with sire-arms,
and perhaps kill them: but, said the grave Spaniard,
who was their governor, we will endeavour to make
them do you justice, if you will leave it to us; for, as
there is no doubt but they will come to us again when
their passion is over, being not able to subsist without
our assistance, we promise you to make no peace with
them, without having a sull satissaction for you; and
upon
RoiIKSON ClUSOE,
spon this condition we hope you will promise to use no
violence with them, other than in your desence.
The two Englishmen yielded to this very aukwardly,
and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested,
they did it only to keep them from bloodshed, and to
make all easy at last; for, said they, we are not so many
of us; here is room enough for us all, and it is great
pity we should not be all good friends. At length they
did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing, living
for some days with the Spaniards; for their own habitation
was destroyed.
In about sive days time the three vagrants, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with hunger, hav-
ing chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while, came
back to the grove; and sinding my Spaniard, who, as
I have said, was the governor, and two more with him,
walking by the side of the creek ; they came up in a
very submissive humble manner, and begged to be re-
ceived again into the samily. They Spaniards used them
civilly, but told them, they had acted so unnaturally by
their countrymen, and so very grossly by them (the
Spaniards) that they could not come to any conclu-
sion witfiout consulting the two Englishmen, and the
rest; but, however, they would go to them, and dis-
course about it, and they should know in half an hour.
It may be guessed, that they were very hard put to it;
for it seems, as they were to wait this half-hour for an
answer, he begged they would send them out some bread
in the mean time; which he did, and sent them at the
same time a large piece of goat's slesh, and a broiled
parrot; which they eat very heartily, for they were hun-
gry enough.
After half an hour's consultation they were called in,
*nd a long debate had about them, their two country-
men charging them with the ruin of all their labour,
and a design to murder them; all which they owned
besore, and theresore could not deny now; upon the
whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators between
them; and as they had obliged the two Englishmen not
to hurt the three, while they were naked and unarmed,
so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild their
fellows two huts, one to be of die same dimensions,
and
and the other larger than they were besore; also to sence
their ground again, where they had pulled up the sences,
plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the
land again for planting corn, where they had spoiled it;
and, in a word, to restore every thing in the same state as
they found it, as near as they could; for entirely it could
not be, the season for the corn, and the growth of the
trees and hedges, not being possible to be recovered.
Well, they all submitttd to this; and as they had
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to live
pleasantly and agreeably together again ; only that these
three sellows could never be persuaded to work; I mean,
not for themselves, except now and then a little, just as
they pleased; however, the Spaniards told them plainly,
that if they would but live sociably and friendly together,
and study in the whole the good of the plantation, they
would be content to work for them, and let them walk
about and be as idle as they pleased; and thus having lived
pretty well together for a month or two, the Spaniards
gave them their arms again, and gave them liberty to go
abroad with them as besore.
It was not above a week after they had these arms,
and went abroad, but the ungratesul creatures began to
be as insolent and troublesome as besore; but however,
an accident happened presently upon this, which endan-
gered the sasety os them all; they were obliged to lay by
all private resentments, and look to the preservation of
their lives.
It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor,
as I call him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I
had saved, who was now the captain, or leader, or
governor of the rest; found himself very uneasy in the
night, and could by no means get any steep: he was
persectly well xin body, as he told me the story, only
found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon
men sighting, and killing one another, but was broad
awake, and could nor by any means get any fleep; in
short he lay a great while; but growing more and more
uneasy, he resolved to rise; as they lay, being so many
of them, upon goat-flcins, laid thick upon such couches
and pads as they made for themselves, and not in ham-
mocks
weeks and ship-beds, as Idid, who was but one ; so thejr
had little to do, when theywere willing to rise, but to get
•up upon their seet, and.perhaps put on a coat, such as it
•was, and their pumps, and they were ready for £Oing any
way that their thoughts guided them.
Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being dark,
•he could see little or nothing-; and besides, the tree*
which I had planted, as in my former account is describ-
-ed, and which were now grown tail, intercepted his
•sight, so that he could only look up, and see that it was
a clear star-light night; and, hearing no noise, here-
turned and laid him down again; but it was all one, he
could not fleep, nor could he compose himself to any
thing like rest, but his thoughts were to the last degree
.uneasy, and yet he knew not for what.
Having made some noise with rising and walking
about, going out and coming in, another of them waked,
, and, calling, alked who it was that was up? The Go-
vernor told him, how it had been with him: Say you
.so? said the other Spaniard.; such things are not to be
./lighted, I assure you.; there is certainly some'mischief
working, says he, near us; and presently he alked him,
Where are the Englishmen? They are all in their huts,
says he, sase enough. It seems, the Spaniards had kept
possession of the main apartment, and had made a place,
where the three Englishmen, since their last mutiny, al-
ways quartered by themselves, and could not came at the
rest. Well, says the Spaniard, there is something in it,
I am persuaded from my awn experience, I am satissied
our spirits embodied have converse with, and receive in-
telligence from, the spiiits unembodied, and inhabiting
the invisible world; and this friendly notice is given for
our advantage, if we know how to make use of it.——
Come, says he, let us go out and look abroad; and if
we sind nothing at all in it to justify our trouble, I'll tell
you a story to the purpose, that shall convince you of the
justice of my proposing it.
In a word, they went out to go to the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but they, being strong, and in
good company, nor alone, as I was, used none of mt
cautions to go up by the ladder, and then pulling it
op after them, to go up a second stage to the top, but
Vol. II. C were
tfl THB LITE AND AOVEMT»*ES »f
were going round through the grove unconcerned and
unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a light*
as of sire, a very little way off from them, and hearing
the voices of men, not of one, or two, but of a great
number.
In all the discoveries I had made of the savages land-
ing on the island, it was my constant care to prevent
them making the least discovery of there being any in,
habitant upon the place; and when by any necessity
they came to know it, they selt it so essectually, that
they that got away, were scarce able to give ,any ac-
count of it, for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor
did ever any that had seen me, escape to tell any one
else, except it were the three savages in our last en*
counter, who jumped into the boat, of whom I mention,
cd, that I was afraid they mould go home, and bring more
help.
Whether it was the consequence ,of the escape os
tlhose men, that so great a number came now together;
er whether they came ignorantly, and by accident, on
their usual bloody errand,, the Spaniards could not, it
seems, understand: but whatever it was, it had been their
business, either to have concealed themselves, and not
have seen them at all; much less to have let the savages
have seen that there were any inhabitants in the place;
but to have fallen upon them so effectually, as that not
a man of them mould have escaped, which could only
have been by getting in between them and their
boats; but this presence of mind was wanting to them,
which was the sum of their tranquillity sor a great
while.
We need not doubt, but that the governor, and she
man with him, surprized with this sight, ran back imme-
diately, and raised their sellows, giving them an account
of the imminent danger they were all in; and they again
us readily took the alarm, but it was impossible to per-
suade them to stay close within where they were, but that
<hey must all run out .to see how things stood.
While it was dark indeed, they' were well enough,
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to
view them by the light of three sires they had made
at some distance from one another; what they were
doing
ftoBixaotr Cif sti,- yr
4oing they knew not, and what to do themselves thejr
knew not; for, sirst, the enemy were too many; and, fc«
Condly, they did not keep together, but were divided into
several parlies, and were on shore in several places.
The Spaniards were in no small consternation at thi*
fight; and as they sound that the sellows ran straggling
all over the shere, they made no doubt, but, sirst or last,
ibme of them would chop in upon their habitation, or
opon some other place, where they would see the token*
of inhabitants; and they were in great perplexity also for
sear of their flock of goats, which would have been little
less than starving them, if they should have been destroy*
ed; so the sirst thing they resolved upon, was to dispatch
three men away besore it was light, viz. two Spaniards
and one Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the
jjreat valley where the cave was, and, if need were, to
drive them into the very cave itself-
Could they have seen the savages altogether in one
body, and at a distance from their canoes, they resolv-
«d, if there had been an hundred of them, to have at-
tacked them; but that could not be obtained, for
they were some of them two miles osf from the other,
and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two different
-nations.
After having mused a great while on the course they
should take, and beaten their brains in considering their
present circumstances; they resolved at last, while it
was dark, to send the oki savage (Friday's sather) out,
as a spy, to learn, if possible, something concerning
them, as what they came for, and what they intended to
do, and the like; the old man readily undertook it, and,
stripping himself quite naked, as most of the savages
were, away he went: after he had been gone an hour
.or two, he brings word, that he had been among them
undiscovered, that he found they were two parties,
and of two several nations, who had war with one
another, and had had a great battle in their own
country, and that both sides having had several pri-
soners taken in rhe sight, they were by mere chance
landed in the same island, for the devouring their
prisoners, and making merry; but their coming so by
-chance to the same place, had spoiled al] their mirth;
C 2- that
•that they were in a great-rage at one another, and were
•so near, that he believed they would'sight again, as soon
as day-light began to appear; but he did not perceive,
that they had any notion of any body's being on the island
but themselves. He had hardly made an end of tellings
•the story, when they could perceive, by the unusual noise
they made, that the two little armies were engaged in a
bloody sight.
Friday's sather used all the arguments he could to per-
suade our people to lie close, and not be seen; he told
them, their sasety consisted in it, and that they had no-
thing to do but to lie still, and the savages would kill one
another to their hands, and the rest would go away; and
it was so to a tittle. But it was impossible to prevail,
especially upon the Englishmen; their curiosity was so
importunate upon their prudentials, that they must run
out to see the battle; however, they used some caution,
viz. they did not go openly, just by their own dwelling,
but went sarther into the woods, and placed themselves to
advantage, where they might securely see them manage
the sight, and, as they thought, not to be seen by them;
but, it seems, the savages did see them, as we (hall sinfl
hereafter.
The battle was very sierce, and if I might believe the
Englishmen, orie of them said, he could perceive, tha£
some of them were men of great bravery, of invincible
spirits, and of great policy in guiding the sight. The
battle, they said, held two hours, before they could guess
which party would be beaten ; but then that party which
was nearest our people's habitation, began to appear
weakest, and, after some time more, some of them began
to fly; and this put our men again into a great contteri-
nation, lest any of those that fled should run into the
grove, besore their dwelling, for shelter, and thereby
involuntarily discover the place; and that by conse-
(;aence the pursuers should do the like in search for them,.
Upon this they resolved, that they would stand armed
within the wall, and whoever came into the grove, they
should sally out over the wall, and kill them; so that,
if possible, not one should return to give an accouut of
it; they ordered also, that it should be done with their
swords, or by knocking them down with the stock of the
musquet,
ftufquet, not by shooting them, for sear of raising an
alarm by the noise.
As they expected, it sell out; three of the routed army
fled for lise, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the"
place, not in «he least knowing whither they went, but
funning as into a thick wood for shelter; the scout they
Kept to look abroad, gave notice of this within, with
this addition, to our,men's great satissaction,, viz. That'
the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen which way
they were gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, X
man of humanity, would not susser them to kill the'
three sugitives; but, sending three men out by the top
ef the hill, ordered them to go round, and come in be-
hind them, surprise and take them'prisoners, which war
done; the residue of the conquered people fled to their
canoes, and-gotcff to sea; the victors retired, and made
no pursuit, or very little ;, but, drawing themselves into
a body together, gave twa great screaming shouts, which
they supposed were by way of triumph, and' so the
sight ended : and the same day, about three o'clock in
Hie afternoon, they also marched to their canoes. And
thus the Spaniards had their island again free to them-
selves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages
sbr several years after.
After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their den; and, viewing the sield of battle, they found
about two and thirty dead men upon the spot; some were
killed with great long arrows, several of which were
found sticking in their bodies; but most of them were
killed with their great wooden swords, sixteen or seven-
teen of which they found irt the sield of battle, and as
many bows, with a great many arrows: these swords
were great unwieldly things, and they must be very strong
men that used them: most of those men that were killed
with them, had their heads mashed to pieces, as wemay
fey, or, as we call it in English, their brains knocked
out, and several of their arms and legs broken; so that
it is evident they sight with inexpressible rag'e and sury;
they found not one wounded man that was not stone
dead; for either they stay by their enemy till they have
quite killed them, or they carry all the wounded men,
that are not quite dead, away with them.
C 3 Tins
This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a great
while; the sight had silled them with horror, and the
consequence appeared terrible to the last degree, especi-
ally upon supposing that some time or other they should
sall into the hand* of those creatures; who would not
only kill them as enemies, but kill them for food, as we
kilF our cattle. And they prosessed to me, that the>
thoughts of being eaten up like bees or mutton, though
it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nauseated their very
stomachs, made them sick when they thought of it, and
filJjd their minds with unusual terror, that they were not
themselves for some weeks after.
This, as-1 said, tamed even the three English brutes I
have been speaking of;. and for a great while after
they were very tractable, and went about the common busi-
ness of the whole society well.enough; planted, sowed,
reaped, and began to be all naturalized to the country y.
but some time after this, they sell all into such simple
measures again as brought them into a great deal of
trouble..
They had taken three prisoners, as-1 had observed; and
these three being lusty stout young sellows, they made
them serv ants, and taught them to work for them; and,
as slaves, they did well enough; but they did not take
their measures with them as I did by my man Friday,
viz.. to begin with them upon the principle of having,
saved their lives, and then instructed them in the rationali
principles of lise, much less of religion, civilizing and
reducing them by kind usage, and assectionate arguings;
bnt, as they gave them their food every day, so they gave
them their work too, and kept them sully employed im
drudgery enough; but they sailed in this by it, that
they never had them to assist them and sight for them, as.
I had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the
very flesh upon my bones.
But to cosie to the samily part; being all now good
friends (for common danger, as I said above, had
effectually reconciled them) they began to consider their
general circumstances ;. and the sirst thing that came
under their consideration was, whether, seeing the
savages particularly haunted that side of the island,
- Rn rssoN Ctvtbw.--
fnd that there were more remote and retired parts of it
equally adapted to their way of living, and manisestly to
their advantage, they mould not rather remove their ha-
bitation, and plant in some more proper place for their
sasety, and especially for the security of their cattle and
corn?
Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived, that
they should not remove their habitation; because that
some time or other they thought they might hear from
their governor again-, meaning me: and if 1 should send
any one to seek them, 1 would be sure to direct them on
that side, where, if they should sind the place demolished,
they would conclude the savages had killed us all, and
we were goi:e, and so oar supply would go away too.
But as to their corn and cattle, they agreed to remove
them into the valley where my cave was, where the
land was as proper to both, and where indeed there was
land enough: however, upon second thoughts, they al-
tered one part of that resolution too, and resolved only
to remove p^rt of their cattle thither, aad plant part of
their corn these; and so, if one part was destroyed the
ether might be saved :. and one piece of prudence they
used, which it was very well they did; viz. That they
never trusted these three savages, which they had taken
prisoners, with knowing any thing of the plantation they
kad made in that valley, or of any cattle they had
thtre; much less of the cave there, which they kept in
«ase of necessity, as-a sase retreat; and thither they car-
ried also the two barrels of powder, which I had lest
them at my coming away.
But, however, they resolved not to change their ha-
bitation; yet they agreed, that as I had caresully co-
vered it sirst with a wall or fortisication, and then with
a grove of trees; so, seeing their sasety consisted en-
tirely in their being concealed, of which they were now
fully convinced; they set to work to cover and conceal
the place yet more essectually than besore: to this pur-
pose, as I had planted trees (or rather thrust in stakes,
which in time all grew to be trees), for some good
distance besore the entrance into my- apartment, they
went on in the same manner, and silled up the rest of
that whole space of ground, from the trees I had set
C 4 quite
«jufte down to the side of the creek, where, as I said, I
landed my floats, and even into the very ouze where the
tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or
any sign that there had been any landing thereabout:
these stakes also, being of a wood very forward to grow4
as I have noted formerly, they took care to have gene-*
rally very much larger and taller than those which shad
planted, and placed them so very thick and close, thae
when they had been three or four years grown, there wa»
no piercing with the eye any considerable way into the
plantation: as for that part which I had planted, tht
trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh; and among'-
them they placed so many other short ones, and so thick,
that, in a word, it stood like a palisado a quarter of a
mile long, and it was next to impossible to penetrate
it, but with a little army, to cut it all down; for a lit-
tle dog could hardly get between the trees, they stood so
close.
But this was not at all; for they did the same by all th«
ground to the right hard, and to the lest, and rouni
even to the tep os the hill; leaving no way, not so
much as for themselves to come out, but by the ladder
placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted up;
and placed again from the sirst stage up to the top;
which ladder, when it was taken down, nothing but
what had wings or witchcraft to assist it, could come at
them.
This was excellently well contrived: nor was it left
than what they afterwards found occasion for; which
served to convince me, that as human prudence has au-
thority of providence to justify it, so it has, doubtless,
the direction of providence to set it to work; and, would'
we listen caresully to the voice of it, I am sully persuaded
•we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives
are now by our own negligence subjected to. But this
by the way.
I return to the story:—They lived two years after thi»
in. persect retirement, and had no more visits from the
savages; they had, indeed, an alarm given them one
morning, which put them in a great consternation;
for, some of the Spaniards being out early one
œorning on the west side, or rather end of the island-,
whicii.
Robinson Ctljb!,,, 57
which, by the way, was that end where I never went, for
sear of being discovered, they were surprized with seeing
above twenty sanoes of Indians just coming on shore.
They made the best of their way home, in hurry
enough; and giving the alarm to their comrades, they
kept close all that day and the next, going out only at
night, to make observation: but they had the good
luck to be mistaken; for wherever the savages went,
they did not land at that time on the island, but pur-
sued some other design.
And now they had another broil with the three Eng-
lishmen ; one of which, a most turbulent sellow, being in
a rage at one of the three slaves, which I mentioned
they had taken, because the sellow had not done some-
thing right which he bid him do, and seemed a little un-
tractable in his shewing him, drew a katchet out of a
frog-belt, in which he wore it by his side, and sell upon
the poor savage, not to correct him, but to kill him.
One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing him give the
sellow a barbarous- cut with the hatcher, which- he
aimed at his-head, but struck into his shoulder, so that'
Ke thought he had cut the poor creature's arm osf, ran
to him, and intreating him not to murder the poor man,
clapt in between him. and the savage, to prevent thw
mischies..
The sellow, being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would
serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which tie
Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a
shovel, which.he had in his hand (for they were workr
ing in the sield about the corn-land), knocked the
brute down: Another, of the Englishmen, running at tie
fame time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard
down;.and then two Spaniards more came to help iheir
man, and a third Englishman sell upon them. They had
hone of them any sire-arms, or any other weapons but
hatchets and other tools, except the third Englishman;
he had one of my old rusty cutlasses, with which he made
at the last Spaniards, and wounded them both: This fray
set the whole samily in an uproar, and more help com-
ing in,they took the three Englishmen prisoners. The next
question was, what should be done with them? They had
C 5. - been
been so often mutinous, and were so surious, so desperate,,
and so idle withal, that they knew not what course to take-
with them, for they were mischievous to the highest degree,
and valued not what hurt they did any man;, so that, in
short, it was not sase to live wkh them.
The Spaniard who was governor, told them in so many
words, that if they had been his own countrymen, he'
5& TllE tIFf AND ADVENTTTRBS or
nors, were to preserve society; and those who were dan-
gerous to the society, ought to be expelled oat of it; but,,
as they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generou*
kindness of an Englishman that they all owed their preser-
vation and deliverance, he would use them with all possible
lenity, .and would leave them to the judgment of the othtt
fwo Englishmen, who were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englistimen stood up, and said,
they desired it might not be lest to them : for, says he,
I am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows; and
With that gives an account, how Will Atkins, one of thei
three, had proposed to have all the sive Englishmen join
together, and murder all the Spaniards, when they were in
their sleep.
When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will
Atkins: How, Seignior Atkins, says he, Will you murder
as all? What have you to say to that? That hardened vil-
lain was so sar from denying it, that he said it was true,
and G—d d—mn. him they would do it still besore they
had done with them. Well, but Seignior Atkins, laid the
Spaniard, What have we done to you, that you will kill
5& TllE tIFf AND ADVENTTTRBS or
must we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill
you, or will you kill us? Why will you put us to the ne-
cessity of tliis, Seignior Atkins? says the Spaniard very
calmly, and smiling.
Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's
making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three
men, and withal had no weapons with him, it was thought
he would have attempted to have killed the Spaniard in the
middle of all the company.
T his hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider se-
riously what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the
Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of the opinion,
•* , - That
.That they should hang one of the three for an example to
the rest; and that particularly it should be he that had
twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet; and
indeed there was some reason to believe he had done it, for
the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the
wound he had received, that it was thought he could not
live, ,', ^ift
But the governor Spaniard still said; No. it was an Eng-
lishman that had saved all their lives, and :$e) would never
consent to put an Englishman to death, thoughhehad mur-
dered half of them ; nay, he said, if he had been killed hjra-
self by an Englishman, and had time left to speak,h should
be, that they should pardon him. •. j.^'; ;J j^j 'f.r;
This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spa-
niard, that there was no gainsaying is; and, as mercisul
counsels are most apt to prevail, where they' are so ear-
nestly pressed, so they all came into it ;,bus then it was
to be considered, what should be done to keep them from
the mischies they designed -t for all agreed, governor and
all, that means were to be used for preserving the so-
ciety from danger: After a long debate it was agreed J. sirst,
That they should be disarmed, and not permitted to have
either gun, or powder, or shot, or swjord, dr any weapon,
and should be turned out of the society, anif lest to live
where they would, and how they could, by themselves; but
that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, should
converse with them, speak with them, or have any thing to
do with them; that they should be forbid to come within a
certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and that
if they ossered to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn
kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings, buildings, sen-
ces, or cattle belonging to the society,. that they should
die without mercy, and would shoot them wherever they
could sind them.
The governor, a man of great humanity, musing up-
on the sentence, considered a little upon it; and, turn-
ing to the two honest Englishmen, said, Hold; yoirmust
reflect, that it will be long ere they can raise corn and
cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must
theresore allow them provisions. So he caused to be ad-
ded, That they should have a proportion os corn given
them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, by
which time they might be supposed to raise some of their
C 6 ownj
own; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goa(s,
and six kids given them, as well for present subsistence, as
for a store; and that they should have tools given them for
their work in the sield; such as six hatchets, an axe, a saw,
and the like: But they mould have none of these tools or
provisions, unless they would swear solemnly, that they
would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards with them,
or of their sellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the Society, and turned them
out to shift for themselves. They went away sullen and re-
fractory, as neither contented to go away, or tostay; butas
there was no remedy, they went pretending to go and chuse
a place where they should settle- themselves, to plant and
live by themselves; and some provisions were given, but
no weapons..
About four or sive days after, they came again for
,some victuals, and gave the governor an account where
they had pitched their tents, and marked themselves owt
an habitation or plantation; it was a very convenient
p'ace indeed, on the remotest part of the island, N. B.
in u ch about the place wiiere I providentially landed in
my sirst voyage, when I was driven out to sea, the Lord
alone knows whither, in my foolish attempt to surround
the island.
Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and
contrived them in a manner like my sirst habitation,
being close under the side of a hill, having some trees
growing already to the three sides of it; so that by
planting- others, it would be very easily covered from the
sioht, uriless narrowly searched for; they desired some
dry goat-skins for beds and covering, which were given
them; and upon their giving their words,, that they
would not disturb the rest, or injure any of their planta-
tions, they gave them hatchets, and what other tools they
;ouId spare; some pease, barley, and rice, for sowing,
ind, in a word, any thing they wanted, but arms and
immunition. '*J
They lived- in this separate condition about six months,
nd had got in their sirst harvest, though the quantity
i-as but small, the parcel of land they had planted be-
but little; for indeed, having all their plantation to
lnn, they had a great deal of work upon their hands;
nd when they came to make boards, and pots, and such
things,
^Atslffi tpi

'things, they were quiteout of their element, and could
make nothing of it; and when the rainy season came on,
for want of a cave in the earth, they could not keep their
grain dry, and it was in great danger of spoiling: and
this humbled them much; so they came and begged the
Spaniards to help them, which they very readily did; and
in four days worked a great-Hole in the side of the hill
for them, big enough to secure theircorn, and other things
from the rain; but ife was but a poor place at best, com-
pared to mine; and especially as mine was then; for the
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made several new
apartments in it.
About three quarters of a year after this separation;
a new frolic took these rogues, which, together with
their former villany they had committed, brought mis-
chies enough upon them, and had very near been tha
'ruin of the whole colony: the- three new associates
began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious lise they
led, and that without hope of bettering their circumr
siances; and a whim took them, that they would make
a voyage to the continent, from whence the savages
tame, and would try if they could not seize upon some
prisoners among the natives there; and bring them
home, so as to make them do the laborious part of the
work for them.
The project was not so preposterous; if they had gone
no sarther; but they did nothing, and proposed nothing;
but had either mischies in the design, or mischies in the
event: and, if I may give my opinion, they seemed to
be under a blast from heaven; for if we will not allow
a visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall we re-
concile the events of things with divine justice? It was
certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mu-
tiny and piracy, that brought them to the state they
were in ;. and,, as they shewed not the least remorse for
the crime, but added new villanies to it, such as, par-
ticularly, that piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding
a poor slave, because he did not, or perhaps couldnot,
understand to do what he was directed; and to wound
him in such a manner, as no question, made him a
cripple all his lise; and in a. place where no surgeon
-•f medicine could be had for his cure; and, what was
still worse, the murderous intent; or, to do justice to
the crime, the intentional murder, for such to be sure
it was, as was afterwards the former design they all laid,
to murder the Spaniards in cold blood, and in their
sleep.
But I leave observing, and return to the story: The
three sellows came down to the Spaniards one morning,
and, in very humble terms, desired to be admitted to
sneak with them: the Spaniards very readily heard what
they had to say, which was this i that they were tired of
living in the manner they did ; that they were not handy
enougli to make the necelferies they wanted •, and that,
having no help, they found they should be starved: but
if the Spaniards would giv e them leave to take one of the
canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and .
ammunition, proportioned for their desence, they would
go over to the main, and seek their fortunes, and so deli-
ver them from the trouble of supplying them with any
more provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them,
feut yet very honestly represented to them the certain,
destruction they were running into ; told them, they had
sussered such hardships upon that very spot, that they
could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell them, that
they would be starved or murdered; and bade then*
consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they should be starved
if they staid here, for they could not work, and would
not work; and they could but be-starved abroad ; and if
they were murdered, there was an end of them, they had
bo wives or children to cry after them; and, in short, in.- ,
sisted importunately upon their demand, declaring that
they would go, whether they would give them any arms
©r no.
The Spaniards told them, with gseat kindness, that
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like naked
men, and be in no condition to desend themselves; and
that tho' they could ill spare their sire-arms, having not
enough for themselves, yet they would let them have twa
musquets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a hatchet,
which they thought sufficient for them.
In a word, they accepted the offer; and having baked
them bread enough to serve them a month, and given
them as much goat's flesh as the/ could eat while it wa»
sweet,
«3
sweet, and a great basket sull of dried grapes, a pot sell ©F
fresh water, and a young kid alive to kill, they boklly set
out in a canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was at
least forty miles broad.
The boat was indeed a large one, and would have very
well carried i5 or 20 men; and theresore was rather too
big for them to manage; but as they had a sair breeze, and
the flood-tide with them, they did well enough: they had
made a mast of a long pole, and a sail of four large goar-
ftins dried, which they had sewed or laced together; and
away they went merrily enough; the Spaniards called
after them, Bon Veajo; and no man ever thought of seeing
them any more.
The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind, how
quietly and comfortably they lived, now those three tur-
bulent sellows were gone; as for their ever coming
again, that was the remotest thing from their thoughts
could be imagined; when behold, after 22 days ab-
sence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his>
him at a distance, two of them with guns upon their
shoulders.
Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitched,
and came frighted and amazed to the governor Spaniard,
and tells him they were all undone, for there were
strangers landed upon the island, he could not tell who:
the Spaniard pausing a while, says to him, How do you
mean, you cannot tell who ? They are savages to be sure.
No, no, says the Englishmen, they are men in clothes with
arms: Nay then, says the Spaniard, why are you concern-
ed ? If they are not savages they must be friends; for there
is no Christian nation upon earth, but will do us good
rather than harm.
While they were debating thus, came the three Eng-
lishmen, and, standing without the wood, which was
newly planted, hallooed to them; they presently knew
their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceased.
But now the admiration was turned upon another ques-
tion, viz. What could be the matter, and what made
them come back again?
It was not long besore they brought the men in; and
T enquiring where they had been, and what they had been

men coming towards

doing? They gave them a sull account of their voyage-
in a sew words; viz. That they reached the land in two
days, or something less; but, sinding the people alarmed
at their coming, and preparing with bows and arrows.to
- sight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed on to
the northward six or seven hours, till they came to a great
opening, by which they perceived that the land they saw
from our island was not the main, but an island; that en-
tering that opening of the sea, they saw another island on.
the right hand north, and several more west; and, being
resolved to land somewhere, they put over to one of the
islands which lay west, and went, boldly on shore; that
they found the people were courteous and friendly to
them, and they gave them several roots, and some dried'
sish, and appeared very sociable; and the women, as well:
as the men, were very forward to supply them with any
thing they could get for them to eat,, and brought it to
them a great way upon their heads.
They continued here four days, and enquired, 25.
well as they could of them by signs, what nations were
this way, and that way;, and were told of several sierce
and terrible people, that, lived almost every way; who, as
they made known by signs to them, used to eat men.;
but as for themselves, they said they never eat men or
women, except only such as they took in the wars; and
then they owned, that they made a great, seast,, and eat
their prisoners.
The Englishmen enquired, when they had a seast os that
kind? They told them, two- months ago, pointing
, to the moon, and then two singers;, and that their
great king had 200 prisoners now, which he had taken
in his war; and they were seeding.them to make them
fat for the next seast.. The Englishmen seemed mighty
desirous to see those prisoners; but the others, mistaking
them, thought they were desirous to have some ot
them, to carry away for their own eating. So they
beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the sun,
and then to the rising; which was to signify, that the
next morning, at sun-rising, they would bring some
for them; and accordingly, the next morning, they
brought down sive women, and eleven men; and gave
them to the Englishmen, to carry with them, on their
, voyage.
teyage, just' as we would bring so many cows and-oxen',
down to a sea-port town to victual a ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these sellows were at home,,
their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know
what to do ,, , to refuse the prisoners would have been the
highest affront to the savage gentry that could be offered,
them; and what to do with them they knew not; however,,
upon some debate, they resolved to accept of them; and, in
return, they gave the savages that brought them one of their
hatchets, an old key, a knise, and six or seven of their'
bullets, which, though they did not understand, they-
seemed extremely pleased with: and then tying the poo«>
creatures hands behind them, they (the people) dragged the
prisoners into the boat for our men*
The Englishmen-were obliged to come away as soon as
they had them, or,else they that gave them this noble
present, would certainly have expected that they should'
have gone to work with them, have killed two or three;
of them the next morning, and perhaps have invited the
donors to dinnex..
But, having taken their leave with all the respect*,
and thanks that could well pass between people, where
Qn. either side, they understood not one word they could
say, they put off with their boat,.and came back towards
the sirst island,, where, when they arrived,-they set eighti
of their prisoners at liberty, there being too many of them,
sor. their occasion.
In their voyage they endeavoured to have some commu-
nication with their prisoners, but it was impossible to make,
them understand any things nothing they could say to
them; or give them t or do for them, but was-looked upona
as going about- to murder them :.they sirst of all unbound,
them; but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially
the women, as if they just selt the knise at their throats;,
for they immediately concluded they were unbound oiv
purpose to be killed.
If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the same-
thing; they then concluded it was for. sear they should,
sink in flesh, and so not be sat enough to kill: if they
looked at one of them more particularly, the party pre--
sently concluded, it was to see whether he or she was sat-
test and sittest ro kill sirst.: nay,, after they had brought

them quite over, and began to use them kindly, and treaf
them well, still they expected every day to make a dinner
•r supper for their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given this unaccount-
able history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard
asked them, where their new samily was? And being
told that they had brought them on shore, and put them'
into one of their huts, and were come to beg some vic-
tuals for them; they ( the Spaniards) and the other two Eng-
lishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go*
a'll down to the place, and see them; and did so, and Fri-
day's sather with them.
When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound;
for when they had brought them on shore, they bound
their hands, that they might not take the boat and
fliake their escape; there, 1 say, they sat, all of then*
stark-naked : sirst, there were three men, lusty, comely
sellows, well-shaped, strait, and sair limbs, about 30 or
35 years of age, and sive women, whereof tw o might be
from 30 to 40, two more not above 24 or ij, and the
fifth, a tall comely maiden, about 16 or 11: the women
were well!-savoured agreeable persons, both in shape and
seatures, only tawny; and two of them, had they been per-
sect white, would have passed for handsome women, even
in London itself, having very pleasant agreeable counte-
nances, and of a very modest behaviour, especially when,
they came afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as they
called it, tho' that dress was very indisferent, it mull be
Consessed; of which hereafter.
The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth
to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a j.ull cha-
racter) men of the bell behaviour, of the most calm, se-
date tempers, and persect good-humour that ever I met
with; and in particular, of the greatest modesty, as will
presently appear: I say, the sight was very uncouth, to
see three naked men, and sive naked women, all together
bound, and in.the most miserable circumstances that human
nature could be supposed to be, viz. to be expecting every
moment to be dragged out, and have their brains knocked
out, and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for
2 dainty.
The sirst thing they did was to cause the old Indian*
Friday's
RtfBTNSO M Cll BJoVr'
Friday's sather, to go in, and see sirst if he knew any of
them, and then, if he understood any of their speech:
as soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously at
them, but knew none of them; neither could any of
them understands word he said, ora sign he could make,,
except one of the women.
However, this was enough to answer the end, which
was to satisfy them, that the men into whose hands they
were sallen were Christians; that they abhorred eating of
men or women, and that they might be sure they would:
not be killed: as soon as they were assured of this, they
discovered such a joy, and by such aukwardand several
ways, as is hard ta describe; for it seems they were of
several nations.
The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid, in>
the next place, to ask them if they were willing to be ser-
vants, and to work for the men that brought them away,
to save their lives ? At which they all sell a dancing; and
presently one sell to taking up this, and another that, any
thing that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to inti-
mate, that they were willing to work.
The governor, who found that the having womea
among them would presently be attended with some in-
eonveniency, and might occasion some strise, and per-
haps blood, asked the three men, what they intended to-
'do with these women, and how they intended to use-
them, whether as servants, or as women? One oT the
Englishmen answered very boldly and readily, that they
would use them as both. To which the^governor said,.
I am not going to restrain you from it; you are your own-
masters as to that: but this I think is but just, for avoids
ing disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it
of you for that reason only, viz. that you will all en-
gage, that if any of you take any of these women, as
a woman, or wise, you shall take but one; and that, hav-
ing taken one, none else should touch her; for though we
cannot marry any of you, yet it is but reasonable, that
while you stay here, the woman any of you takes should
be maintained by the man that takes her, and should be
his wise; I mean, says he, while he continues here; and
that none else should have any thing to do with her. All
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it without
any difficulty. Then,
Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards,- if they d*
signed to take any of them? But every one answered*
Nck some of them said they had wives in Spain, and
the others did not like women that were not Christians;
and altogether declared, that they would not touch one
of them; which was an instance of such virtue, as I
have not met with in all my travels; on the other-'
Hand, to be short, the sive Englishmen took them every
one a wise;. that-is to say, a temporary wife; and so they
set up a new form of living; scr the Spaniards and Fri-
day's sather lived in my old habitation, which they had
enlarged exceedingly within; the three servants, which
they had taken in the late battle of the savages, lived-
with them ; and these carried on the main part of the-
colony, supplying all the rest with food, and assisting,
them Tn any thing they could, or as. they found necessity
required.
But the wonder os this story was, how sive such re»
sractory ill-matched sellows should agree about these wo-
men, and that two of them should net pitch upon the
seme woman, especially seeing two or three of them were,
without comparison, more agreeable than the others:
but they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling
among themselves; for they set the sive women by them-
selves in one of their huts, and they went all into the
other hut, and drew lots among them who should chuse
sirst.
He that drew to chuse sirst,, went away by himself to
the hut where the poor naked creatures were, and setch-
ed out her he chose; and it was worth observing, that he
that chose sirst, took her that was reckoned the homeliest',
and the oldest of the sive, which made mirth enough
among the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at its
but thescllow considered better than any of them, that it
was application and business that they were to expt ct assist-
ance in, as much any thing else; and she proved the best
wise in the parcel..
When the poor women saw themselves set in a row
thus, and setched out one by one, the terrors of theif
condition returned upon them again, and they sirmly be-
lieved, that they were now going to be devoured: ac-
cordingly,, when the English sailor came in and setched
out one os them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry,,
-and hung about her, and took their leave of her with
such agonies and such affection, as would have grieved the
hardest heart in the world; nor was it possible for the
,Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to be Im-
mediately murdered, till they setched the old man, Fri-
day's sather, who instantly let them know, that the sive
men who had setched them out one by .one, had chosen
them for their wives.
When they had done this, and the fright the women
were in was a little over, the men went to work, and the
Spaniards came and'helped them.; and, in a sew hours,
they had built them every one .a new hut or tent for their-
lodging apart? for those they had already were crouded
with their tools, houshold-stuff and provisions: The three
wicked ones had pitched sarthest off, and the two honest
ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, so
.that they continued separate as besore: and thus my island
•was peopled in three places, and^asl may say, three towns'
were begun to be planted.
And here it is very well worth observing, that as.itof-
•ten happens in the -world (what the wise ends of God's
providences are in such a disposition of things, I cannot
fay) the two honest sellows had the two worst wives; and
the three reprobates, that were scarce worth hanging, that
were sit for nothing, and neither seemed born to do them-
selves good, or any one else, had three clever, diligent,
.caresul, and ingenious wives .; not that the two sirst were ill
wives as to their temper or humour; for all the sive were
most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures, ra-
ther like staves than wives; but my meaning is, they were
not alike capable, ingenious, industrious, or alike cleanly
and nea?.
Another observation I must make., to the honour of
a diligent application on the one hand, and to the dis-
grace of a slothsul, negligent, idle temper on .the other,
that when I came to the place, and viewed the several
improvements, planting, and management of the seve-
ral little colonies; the two men had so sar outgone the
three, that there was no comparison: they had indeed
both of them as much ground laid out far corn as they
wanted; and the reason was, because, according to my
rule,
mile, nature dictated, that it was to no purpose to sow
more corn than they wanted i but the difference os the
-cultivation, of the planting, of the sences, and indeed
every thing else, was easy to be seen at sirst view.
The two men 'had innumerable young trees planted
.about their huts, that when you came to the place, no-
tthing was to be seen but a wood; and though they had
their plantation twice demolished, once by their own
•countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be shewn
in_ its place; yet they had restored all again, and every
thing was flourishing and thriving about them; they had
grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard,
though they had themselves never seen any thing of that
Irind; and by their good ordering their vines, their
trapes were as good again as any of the others. They
ad also formed themselves a retreat in the thickest part
of the woods, where, though there was not a natural
cave, as I had found, yet they made one with incessant
.labour of their hands, and where, when the mischief
Which followed happened, they secured their wit es and
^children, so as they could never be found; they having,
by slicking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood,
which as I said, grew so easily, made a grove impas-
sable, except in one place, where they climbed up to get
.over the outside part; and then went in by ways of theij
,«wn leaving.
As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, tho*
they were much civilized by their new settlement, com*,
pared to what they were besore, and were not so quar-
relsome, having not the same opportunity, yet one of
the certain companions of a profligate mind never left
them, and that was their idleness: it is true, they plantr
ed corn, and made sences.; but Solomon's words were
.never better verisied than in them; "I went by the vine-
•«* yard of the slothsul, and it was overgrown with thorns;"
for when the Spaniards came to view their crop, they
.could not see it in some places for weeds; the hedge
had several gaps in it, where the wild goats had gotten
in, and eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a
dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for the pre-
sent, -but it was only shutting the stable-door after tiie
steed was stolen; whereas, when they looked on the
colon/
,•olony of the other two, there was the very sace of in-
yustry and success upon all they did.; there was not a weed
to be seen in all their corn, ora gap in any of their hedges^
and they, on the other hand, verisied Solomon's words in
another place: "The diligent hand maketh richi" for
,every thing grew and thrived, and they had plenty within
.and without; they,had more tame cattle than the other,
more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet more
pleasure and diversion too.
It is tjue, the wives of the three were very handy and
.cleanly within doors.; and, having learned the English
ways of dressing and cooking from one of the other Enge
liftmen, who, as I said, was a cook's mate on board
.the ship, they dressed their husband's victuals very nice-
ly; whereas the other could not be brought to under,
.stand it ; but then the husband, who, as I laid, had beeo
cook's mate, did it himself; but, as for the husband*
of the three wives, they loitered about, setched turtles
.eggs, and caught sish and birds: in a word, any thing
but labour; and they-sared accordingly. The diligent
Jived well and comfortably, and the slothsul lived hard
and beggarly; and so.I believe, generally speaking, iti*
all over the world.
But now I come to a scene, different from all that had
happened besore, either to them or me,; and the origin of
£he story was this.:
Early one morning there icame on shore sive or six
canoes of Indians, or savages, call them which yoit
please; and there is no .room to doubt that they came
upon the old errand of seeding upon their staves; but
that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to
our men too, that they did not concern themselves
.about it, as I- did ; but, having been made sensible by
experience, that their only business was to lie concealed,
and that, if they were not seen by any of the savages,
they would go off again quietly, when their business was
done, having as yet not the least notion of there being
any inhabitants in the island; I say, having been made
sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give no-
tice to all the three plantations to keep within doors,
and not to sliew themselves; only placing a scout in , a
proper
^proper place, to give notice when the boats went off to sea
again.
This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among
-the savages, that there were inhabitants there; which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole colo-
•lony. After the canoes with the savages were gone off,
-the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of them had
the curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to see
what they had been doing. Here, totheirgreat surprise,
they found three savages lest behind, and lying sast asleep
supon the grounds it was supposed, they had either been so
gorged with their inhuman seast, that, like beasts, they
were asleep, and would not stir when the others went, or
'they were wandered into the woods, and did not come back
iin time to be taken in.
The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and
persectly at a loss what to do; the Spaniard governor,
ias it happened, was with them, and his advice was ask-
ed, but he prosessed he knew not what to do; as for
Haves they had enough already; and as to killing them,
-there were none of them inclined to that; the Spaniard
governor told me they could not think of shedding inno-
cent blood; for, as to them, the poor creatures had done
- no wrong, invaded none of their property; and they
thought they had no just quarrel against them, to take
away their lives.
And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe,
that let all the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and
Peru be what they will, I never met with seventeen men,
of any nation whatsoever, in any foreign country, who
,were so universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so very
,good-humoured, and so courteous, as these Spaniards;
i and, as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very
nature; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous
passions, and yet all of them men of great courage and
spirit.
Their temper and calmness had appeared in their
bearing the unsusserable usage of the three Englishmen;
and their justness to humanity appeared now in the
case of the savages, as above: after some consultation
they,
they resolved upon this, that they would lie still awhile
longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone j
but then the governor Spaniard recollected, that the
three savages had no boat; and that, if they were lest to
rove about the island, they would certainly discover this
there were inhabitants in it, and so they should be undone
that way.
Upon this they went back again, and there lay the
sellows sast asleep still: so they resolved to awaken
them, and take them prisoners, and they did so: the poor
sellows were strangely frighted when they were seized up-
on and bound, and afraid, like the women, that they
should be murdered and eaten; sor, it seems, those peo-
ple think all the world do, as they do, eat men's fiesh;
but they were soon made easy as to that, and away they
carried them.
It was very happy for them, that they did not carry
them home to their castle; I mean to my palace under the
hill; but they carried them sirst to the bower, where was
the chies of their country work; such as the keeping the
goals, the planting the cam, &c. and afterwards they
carried them to the habitation of the two Englishmen.
Here they were set to work, though it was not much
they had for them to do; and whether it was by negligence
in guarding them, or that they thought the sellows could
not mend themselves, I know not, tut one of them ran
away; and, taking himself into the woods, they could
never hear of him more.
They had good reason to believe he got home again
soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages, who
came on shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who,
carrying on their revels as usual, went osf again in two
days time: this thought terrisied them exceedingly;
for they concluded, and that not without good cause in-
deed, that if this sellow got sase home among his com-
rades, he would certainly give them an account tint there
were people in the island, as also how weak ai d sew they
were; for this savage, as I observed besore, had never
been told, as it was very happy he had not, how many
they were, or where they lived, nor had he ever seen or
heard the sire of any of their guns, much less had they
shewn him any other of their retired places, such as the
Vol. II. D cave
74 THE LIFE AND adventures of
cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two Eng-
lishmen had made, and the like.
The sirst testimony they had, that this sellow had
given intelligence of them was, that about two months
after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven or
eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the.
north-side of the island, where they never used to
come besore, and landed about an hour after sun-rise;
at a convenient place, about a mile from the habitation
of the two Englishmen, where this escaped man had
been kept: as the Spaniard governor said, had they
been all there, the damage would not have been so
much, for not a man of them would have escaped: but
the case dissered now very much; for two men to sifty
were too much odds: the two men had the happiness
to discover them about a league osf, so that it was above
an hour besore they landed; and as they landed about
a mile from their huts, it was some time besore they
could come at them. Now having great reason to believe
that they were betrayed, the sirst thing they did, was to
bind the slaves which were lest, and cause two of the three
men, whom they brought with the women, who, it seems,
proved very saithsul to them, to lead them with their two
wives, and whatever they could carry away with them, to
their retired place in the woods, which I have spoken of
,above, and there to bind the two sellows hand and foot
till they heard sarther.
In .the next place, seeing the savages were all come on
,shore, and that they bent their course directly that
way, they opened the sences where their milch-goats
,were kept, and dtove them all out, leaving their goats
to straggle into the wood, whither they pleased, that the
savages might think they were all bred wild; but the
Togue who came with them was too cunning for that, and
gave them an account of it all; for they went directly to
the place.
When the two poor frighted men had secured their
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had
of the three, who came with the women, and who
was at their place by accident, away to the Spaniards,
with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy
help; and in the mean time they took their arms,
15
end what ammunition they had, and retreated towards the
place in the wood, where their wives were sent, keeping
«t a distance; yet so that they might see, if possible, which
way the savages took.
They had not gone sar, but that, from a rising
ground, they could see the little army of their enemies
come on directly to their habitation, and in a moment
more could see all their huts and houshold-stusf slaming
up together, to their great gries and mortisication ; for
they had a very great loss, and to them irretrievable, at
least for some time. They kept their station for awhile,
till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread them-
selves all over the place, rummaging every way, and every
place they could think of, in search for prey; and, in
particular, for the people, of whom it plainly appeared
they had intelligence.
The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves
not secure where they stood, because, as it was likely some
of the wild people might come that way, so they might
come too many together, thought it proper to make ano-
ther retreat about half a mile sarther, believing, as it
afterwards happened, that the sarther they strolled, the
fewer would be together.
The next halt was at the entrance into a very thick
grown part-of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tresa
stood, which was hollow, and vastly large; and in this
tree they both took their standing, resolving to see what
might osser.
They had not stood there long, but two of the savages
appeared running directly that way, as if they had already
notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack
them; and a little way surther they espied three more
coming after them, and sive more beyond them, all coming
the same way; besides which, they saw seven or eight more
at a distance, running another way; for, in a word, they
ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their game.
The poor men were now in great perplexity, whether
they should stand and keep their posture, or fly : but, after
a very short debate with themselves, they considered, that
if the savages ranged the country thus, besore help came,
they might, perh'ap, sind out their retreat in the w»ods,
and then all would be loft; so they resolved to stand them

THE LIF,« XND ADVENTURES Of
here; and if there were too many to deal with, then they
vould get to the top of the tree, from whence they doubt-
id not to desend themselves, sire excepted, as long as their
immunition lasted, tho' all the savages that were landed,
vhich were near sifty, were to attack them.
Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether
hey should sire at the two sirst, or wait for the three, and
b take the middle party; by which the two and thesive that
bllowed would be separated; at length they resolved to let
he two sirst pass by, unless they should spy them in the
ree, and come to attack them. The two sirst savages also
ionsirrr.ed them in this resolution, by turning a little from
hem towards another part of the wood; but the three
.nd the sive after them, came forwards directly to the
ree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there.
Seeing them come so strait towards them, they resolved
o take them in a line as they came; and as they resolved
0 sire but one at a time, perhaps the sirst shot might hit
hem all three; to which purpose, the man who was to
ire, put three or four bullets into his piece; and having
. sair loop-hcle, as it were, from a broken hole in the
ree, he took a sure aim without being seen, waiting till
hey were -within about thirty yards of the tree, so that
ie could not miss.
While they were thus waiting, and the savages came
>n, they plainly saw that one of the three was the run-
way savage that had escaped from them, and they both
inew him distinctly, and resolved that, if possible, he
riould not escape, tho' they should both sire; so the other
ood ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at the
rst shot, he should be sure to have a second.
But the sirst was too good a marksman to miss his aim:
Dr, as the savages kept near one another, a little behind
1 a line, in a word, he sired, and hit two of them di-
;ctly: the foremost was killed outright, being shot in
ie head: the second, which was the run-away Indian,
'as shot thro' the body, and sell, but was not quite dead;
nd the third had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps
y the same ball that went through the body of the se-
lnd; and, being dreadsully frighted, though not much
urt, sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling
1 a hideout manner.

'"on all.
The sive that were behind, more frighted with the
noise, than sensible of their danger, stood still at sirst:
sor the woods made the found a thousand times bigger
than it really was; the echoes rattling from one side to
another, and the fowls rising from all parts, screaming
and making, every sort, a several kind of noise, ac-
cording to their kind, just as it was when I sired the sirst
gun that, perhaps, was ever shot osf in that place since
it was an island.
However, all being silent again, and they not knowing
what the matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came
to the place where their companions lay, in a con-
dition miserable enough; and here the poor ignorant
crt»tures, not sensible that they were within reach of th«
same mischief, stood all os a huddle over the wounded
man, talking, and, as may be supposed, enquiring of him
how he came to be hurt; and who, it is very rational
to belie/e, told them that a slash of sire sirst, and, imme-
diately after that, thunder from their gods, had killed
those two, and wounded him: this, I say, is rational;
for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no
man near them, so they had never heard a gun In all
their lives, or so much as heard of a gun; neither knew
they any thing os killing or wounding at a distance,
with sire and bullets; if they hid, one might reasonably
believe, that they would not have stood so unconcerned,
in viewing the sate of their sellows, without some appro
hension of their own.
Our two men, though, as they consessed to me, it grie-
ved them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures,
who at the same time had no notion of their danger;
yet, having them all thus in their power, and the sirst:
having loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly both
together among them; and singling out by agreement
which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or very
much wounded, four of them; the sifth, frighted even
to death, though not hurt, sell with the rest; so that our
men, seeing them all sall together, thought they had
killed them all.
The belies that the savages were all killed, made our
two men come boldly out from the tree besore they had
charged their guns again, which was a wrong step; and
D 3 thejf
they were under some surprise, when they came to the
place, and found no less than four of the men alive, and
of them, two very little hurt, and one not at all: this
obliged them to sall upon them with the stocks of their
mulquets; and sirst, they made sure of the run-away sa-
vage, that had been the cause os all the mischies; and
of another that was hurt in his knee, and put them out
of their pain ; then the man that was not hurt at all came
and kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up,
and made piteous moan to them by gestures and signs,
for his lise; but could not say one word to them that
they could understand.
However, they signisied to him to sit down at the foot
of a tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen, with a
piece of rope twine, which he had by great chance in his
pocket, tied his seet sast together, and his hands behind
him, and there they lest him ; and, with what speed they
could, made after the other two which were gone besore,
scaring they, or any n.ore of them, should sind the way
to their covered place in the woods, where their wives,
and the few goods they had lest lay: they came once
in sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance;
however, they had the satissaction to see them cross over
a valley, towards the sea, the quite contrary way from
that which led to their retreat, which they were afraid
of; and, being satissied with that, they went back to th«
tree where they lest their prisoner, who, as they suppos-
ed, was delivered by his comrades; for he was gone, and
the two pieces of rope-yarn, with which they had bound
him, lay just at the foot of the tree.
They were now in as great a concern as besore, not
knowing what course to take, or how near the enemy .
might be, or in what numbers; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if all
vvas well there, and to make them easy, who were in
fright enough to be sure; for though the savages were
their own country-folks, yet they were most terribly afraid
o f them, and perhaps the more, for the knowledge they
had of them.
When they came thither, they found the savages had
been in the wood, and very near the place, but had not
found it; for, indeed, it was inaccessible, by the trees

standing so thick, as besore, unless the persons seeking it
had been directed by those that knew it, which these were
not; they found, theresore, every thing very sase, only
the women in a terrible fright: while they were here,
they had the comfort of seven of the Spaniards coming
to their assistance; the other ten, with their servants, and
old Friday, I mean Friday's sather, were gOBe in a body
to desend their bower, and the corn and cattle that were
kept there, in case the savages should have roved over to
that side of the country, but they did not spread so sarr-
with the seven Spaniards came one of the savages, who,
as I said, were their prisoners formerly, and with them
also came the savage whom the Englishmen had lest bound
hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they came that
way, saw the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound
the eighth, and brought him along with them; where,
however, they were obliged to bind him again, as they
had done the two others, who were lest when the third
ran away.
The prisoners began now to be a burden to them; and
they were so afraid of their escaping, that they thought
they were under an absolute necessity to kill them for
their own preservation; however, the Spaniard governor
would not consent to it; but ordered that they should be
sent out of the way, to my old cave in the valley, and be
kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and give
them food; which was done;—and they were bound
there hand and foot for that night.
When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were
so encouraged, that they could not satisfy themselves to
stay any longer there; but taking sive of the Spaniards,
and themselves, with four musquets and a pistol among
them,and two stoutquarterstaves, away they went in quest
of the savages; and sirst, they came to the tree where the
men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to see, that
some more of the savages had been there; for they at-
tempted to carry their dead men away, and had dragged
two of them a good way, but had given it over: from
thence they advanced to the sirst rising ground, where
they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where
they had the mortisication still to see some of the smoke;
but jieither could they here see any of the savages: they

en resolved, though with all possible cantion, to ga
irward towards the ruined plantation: but a little besore
ley came thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they
iw plainly the savages all embarking again in their ca.
oes, in order to be gone.
They seemed sorry at sirst that there jvas no way
3 come at them, to give them a parting blow: but
ipon the whole were very well satissied ta be rid of
hem.
The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all
heir improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come
ind help them to rebuild, and to assist them with needful
supplies. Their three countrymen, who were not yet
noted for having the least inclination to do any good,
yet, as soon as they heard of it (for they, living remote
eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all was over),
tame and offered their help and assistance, and did very
friendly work for several days, to restore their habitations,
and make necessaries for them ; and thus in a little tim.4
they were set up upon their legs again.
About two days after this, they had the sarther satis-
faction of feeing three of the savages canoes come driving
on shore, and at some distance from them, with twa
drowned men; by which they had reason to believe,
that they had met with a storm at sea, and had overset
some of them; for it blew very hard the night after they
went off.
However, as some might miscarry, so on the other
hand, enough of them escaped to insorm the rest, as well
of what they had done, as what happened to them; and
to whet them on to another enterpnze of the same nature,
vvhich they, it seems, resolved to attempt, with suffi-
cient force to carry all besore them; for, except what
the sirst man had told them of inhabitants, they could
/ay little to it of their own knowledge; for they
jiever saw one man, and the sellow being killed that had
assirmed it, they had no other witness to consirm it to
them.
It was sive or six months after this, before they heard
any more of the savages, in which time our men
were in hopes they had not forgot their former bad
lud.

nek, or had given over the hopes of better; when on a
sudden, they were invaded with a most formidable fleet, of
no less than twenty-eight canoes sull of savages armed with
bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such
like engines of war; and they brought such numbers with
them, that, in short, it put all our people into the utmost
consternation.
As they came on shore in the evening, and at the
eastermost side of the island, our men had that night to
consult and to consider what to do; and, in the sirst place,
knowing that their being entirely concealed was their only
fosety before, and would much more be so now, while the
number of their enemies was so great, they theresore
jesolved, sirst of all, to take down the huts which were
built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats
to the old cave; because they supposed the savages would
go directly thither, as. soon as it was day, to play the old
game over again, tho' they did not now land within two>
In the next place, they drove away all the stock of
goats they had at the old bower, as I called it, which
belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, lest as little ap-
pearance of inhabitants any where as possible; and the next
morning early they posted themselves with all their force,
a* the plantation of the two men, waiting for their coming.
As they guessed, so it happened ; these new invaders, leav*
fng their canoes at the east end of the island, came ranging
along the more directly towards the place, to the number
of two hundred and sifty, as near as our men could judge,.
Our anny was but small indeed; but, that which was
worse, they had not arms for all their number neither:
The whole account, it seems, stood thus: First, u to
men:
17 Spaniards.
5 Englishmen.

To their slaves they did not give either musquet or so>
£1, but they had every one an halbert, or a long staff, like
a quarter-staff, with a great spike of iron sastened into each
end of it, and by his side a hatchet; also every one of our
men had hatchets. Two of the women could not be pre-
vailed upon, but they would come into the sight; and they
had bows and arrows, which the Spaniardshad taken from
the savages, when the sirst action happened, which I have
spoken of, where the Indians fought with one another, and
the women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor, whom I have described so of-
ten, commanded the whole; and William Atkins, who,
tho' a dreadsul sellow for wickedness, u as a most daring
bold sellow, commanded under him. The savages came
forward like lions, and our men, which was the worst
of their sate, had no advantage in their situation; only
that Will Atkins, who now proved a most usesul sellow,
with six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of
bushes, as an advanced guard, with orders to let the sirst
of them pass by, and then sire into the middle of them -r
and, as soon as he had sired, to makehis retreat as nimbly
as he could, round a part of the wood, and so come in be-
hind the Spaniards where they stood, having a thicket of
trees all before them. . 
When the savages came on, they ran straggling about
every way in heaps, out of-aH manner of order; and
Will Atkins let about sifty of them pass by him; then,
seeing the rest come in a very thick throng, he order*

with six or seven bullets a-piece, about as big as large pif-
tol bullets. How many they killed or wounded, they
knew not; but the consternation and surprise was inex-
pressible among the savages, -who were srighted to the
last degree, to hear such a dreadsul noise, and see their
men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody that did it;
when in the middle of their fright, William Atkins, and
his other three, let fly again among the thickest of them;
and in less than a minute, the sirst three, being loaded
again, gave them a third volley.

as soon as they had sired, as they were ordered to do;
or had the rest of the body been at hand, to have poured
in their shot continually, the savages had been essectually
routed; for the terror that was among them came princi-
pally from this; viz. That they were killed by the Gods
with thunder and lightning, and eould see nobody that
hurt them; but William Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat: some of the savages, who were at
a distance, spying them, came upon them behind; and
tho' Atkins and his men sired at them also, two or three
times, and killed above twenty, retiring as sast as they
could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one
of h's sellow Englishmen with their arrows, as they did
afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who
came with the women; this stave was a most gallant sel-
low, and fought most desperately, killing sive of them with
his own hand, having no weapon but one of the armed
staves, and an hatchet.
Our men. being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded,
and two other men killed, retreated to a rising ground
in the wood; and the Spaniards, after siring three vol-
lies upon them, retreated also; for their number was so
great, and they were so desperate, that tho' above sifty
of them were killed, and more than so many wounded,
yet they came on in the teeth of our men, searless of
danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was
observed, that their wounded men, who were not quite
disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds, and
sought like madmen.
When our men retreated, they lest the Spaniard and!
the Englishman, that were killed, behind them;, and the
D 6 savages
savages, when they came up to them, killed them over
again in a wretched manner, breaking their arms, legs,
and heads, with their clubs, and wooden swords, like true
savages: but, sinding our men were gone, they did not seem
to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring,
which is, it seems, their custom; and shoused twice, in
token of their victory : after which, they had the mortisi-
cation to see several of their wounded men sall, dying with
the mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body
tip together upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he
was, wounded „ would have had him march, and charge
them again altogether at once: but the Spaniard re-
plied, Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded men
fight; let them alone till morning; all these wounded
men will be stisf and sore with their wounds, and saint
with the loss of blood j and so we shall have the sewer t»
engage.
The advice was good; but Will Atkins replied mer-
rily, That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too; and that'*
the reason I would go on, while I am warm. Well, Seig-
nior Atkins,.says the Spaniard, you have behaved gallant-
ly, and done your part, we will sight for you, if you cannot
eome on; but I think it best to stay till morning;. so they
waited.
But as it was a clear moon-light night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead and
wounded men, and a- great hurry and noise among them-
where they lay, they asterwards resolved to sall upon
them in the night, especially if they could come to give-
them but one volley besore they were discovered. Thi*
they had a sair opportunity to do y for one of the two
Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where the sight be*,
gan, led them round, between the woods and the sea-side^
westward, and turning short south, they came so near
where the thickest of them lay, that before they were seen
or heard, eight of them sired in among them, and did
dreadsul execution upon them; in half a minute more;
eight others sired after them; pouring in their small shot
jn such a quantity, that abundance were killed and wound-
ed; and all this while they were aot able to fee who hurt
them, or which way to fly»

,i'RoBjssoN Crusoe. ?y
The Spaniards charged again, with the utmost expedi-
tion, and then divided themselves into three bodies, and
resolved to sall in among them all together: they had it*
each body eight persons; that is to say, twenty-four,
whereof were twenty-two men, and the two women, who,
by the way, fought desperately.
They divided the sire-arms equally in each party,
and so of the halberts and staves. They would have
had the women keep back ; but they said, they were'
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus formed
their little army, they marched out from among the
trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, shouting:
and hallooing as loud as they could; the savages stood all
together, but were in the utmost consusion, hearing the
noise of our men shouting from three quarters toge-
ther: they would have fought if they had seen us; and as>
soon as we came near enough to be seen, some arrows were
shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, tho' not danger-
eufly. But our men gave them no rime; but, running up.
to them, sired among them three ways, and then sell in,
with the but-ends of their musquets, their swords, armed
staves, and hatchets; and laid about them so well, that, in
a word, they set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying
to save their lives which way soever they could.
Our men were tired with the execution; and killed,
or mortally wounded, in the two sights, about 180 of
them ; the rest being frighted out of their wits, scoured
thro' the woods, and over the hills, with all the speed
that sear and nimble seet could help them to do; and.
as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them,
they got altogether to the sea-side, where they landed,
and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at
an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that even-
ing from the sea-ward; so that it was impossible for them,
to put off; nay, the storm continuing all night, when the
tide came up, their canoes were most of them driven by
the surge of the sea so high upon the shore, that it re-
quired insinite toil to get them off; and some of them
were even dashed to pieces against the beach, or against
one another.
Our men, tho' gfad of the victory, yet got little rest
that night; but having refreshed themselves at well as
they
they could, they resolved to march to that part of the island
where the savages were fled, and see what posture they
were in. This necessarily led them overthe placewhere the
sight had been, and where they found several of the poor
creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering lise; a
sight disagreeable enough to generous minds; for a truly
great man, tho'obliged by the law of battle to destroy his
enemy, takes no delight in his misery.
However, there was no need to give any order in this
case; for their own savages who were their servants, dis-
patched those poor creatures with their hatchets.
At length they came in view of the place where the more
miserable remains of the savages army lay, where there ap-
peared about i oo still; their posture was generally sitting
upon the ground, with their knees up towards their mouth,
and the head put between the hands, leaning down upon
the knees.
When our men came within two musquetshot of them,
the Spaniard governor ordered two musquets to be sired
without ball, to alarm them;, this he did, that by their
countenance he might know what to expect, via. Whether
they were still in heart to sight, or were so heartily beaten,
as to be dispirited and discouraged, and so he might ma-
nage accordingly.
This stratagem took % for as- soon as the savages heard
the sirst gun, and sew the slash of the second, they started
up upon their seet in the greatest consternation imaginable;
and, as our men advanced swiftly towards them, they all
ran screaming and yawling away, with a kind of a howl-
ing noise, which our men did not understand, and had
never heard besore; and thus they ran up the hills into
the country.
At sirst, our mea had much rather the weather had
been calm, and they had all gone away to sea: but they
did not then consider, that this might probably have been
the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes as
not to be resisted; or, at least, to come so many and so
often,as would quite desolate the island, and starve them;
Will Atkins theresore, who,,notwithstanding his wound,
Jcept always with them, proved the best counsellor in this
case: his advice was, to take the advantage that of-
fered, and clap in between them and their boats, and
so deprive them os the capacity of ever returning any
more to plague the island.
They consulted long about this, and some were against
it, for sear of making the wretches fly into the woods, and
live their desperate; and so they should have them to hunt
like wild beasts; be afraid to stirabout their business, and
have their plantations continually rifled, all their tame
goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a lise of con-
tinual distress.
Will Atkins told them, they had better have to do with
100 men, than with 100 nations; that as they must de-
stroy their boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all
of them destroyed themselves. In a word, he shewed them
the necessity of it so plainly, that they all came into it;
so they went to work immediately with the boats, and,
getting some dry wood together from a dead tree, they
tried to set some of them on sire; but they were so wet,
that they would scarce burn. However, the sire so burned
the upper part, that it soon made them unsit for swimming
in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw what they were
about, some of them came running out of the woods; and,
coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down
and cried, Oa, Oa, Waramokoa, and some other words of
their language, which none of the others understood any
thing of; but as they made pitisul gestures, and strange
noises, it was easy to understand they begged to have their
boats spared, and that they would begone, and never come
thither again.
But our men were now satissied, that they had no way
to preserve themselves, or to save their colony, but ef-
sectually to prevent any of these people from ever going
home again; depending upon this, that if ever so much
as one of them got back into their country to tell the
story, the colony was undone: so that, letting them
know that they should not have any mercy, they sell to
work with their canoes, and destroyed them every one,
that the storm had not destroyed besore; at the sight of
which the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods,
which our people heard plain enough; after which they
ran about the island like distracted men; so that, in a
word, our men did not really know at sirst what to do with,
them.
Nor
Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider,
that while they made those people thus desperate, they
ought to have kept good guard at the same time upon
their plantations; for tho' it is true they had driven away
their cattle, and the Indians did not sind their main re-
treat, I mean my old cattle at the hill, nor the cave in
the valley; yet they found out my plantation at the
bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the sences and
planting about it; trod all the corn under foot; tore up
the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe; and did
our men an inestimable damage, though to themselves not
one sarthing's worth of service.
Tho' our men were able to sight them upon all occa-
sions, yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt
them up and down; for as they were too nimble of foot
for our men when they found them single, so our men durst
not go about single, for sear of being surrounded with
their numbers: the best was, they had no weapons; fortho*
they had bows, they had no arrows lest, nor any materials
to make any, nor had they any edged tool or weapon among
them.
The extremity and distress they were reduced to was
great, and indeed deplorable; but at the same time our
men were also brought to very hard circumstances by them:
'for tho' their retreats were preserved, yet their provision
was destroyed, and their harvest spoiled; and what to do,
or which way to turn themselves, they knew not; the only
resuge they had now, was the stock of cattle they had in
the valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew
there. The three Englishmen, William Atkins, and his
comrades, were now reduced to two, one of them being
killed by an arrow, which struck him on the side of his
head, just under the temples, so that he never spoke more;
and it was very remarkable, that this was the same barba-
rous sellow who cut the poor savage Have with his hatchet, •
and who afterwards intended to have murdered the
Spaniards.
I looked upon their case to have been worse at this
time, than mine was at any time after I sirst discovered
the grains of barley and rice, and got into the method
0f planting and raising my com, and my tame cattle;
jor now they had, as I may say, an hundred wolves upon
th«

the island, which would devour every thing they conld
come at, yet could be very hardly come at themselves.
The sirst thing they concluded, when they saw what
their circumstances were, was, that they would, if possible,
drive them up to the sarther part of the island, south-east,
that if any more savages came on more, they might not sind
one another; then, that they would daily hunt and harass
them, and kill as many of them as they could come at, tils'
they had reduced their number; and, if they could at last
tame them, and bring them to any thing, they would give
them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live upon
their daily labour.
In order to this, they followed them, and so terrisied
them with their guns, that in a sew days, if any of them
fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would
sall down for sear; and so dreadsully frighted they were,
that they kept out of sight sarther and sarther, till at last
our men following them, and every day almost killing and
wounding some of them, they kept up in the woods and
hollow places so much, that it reduced them to the utmost
misery for want of food; and many were afterwards found
.dead in the woods, without any hurt, but merely starved to
death.
When our men found this, it made their hearts re>
lent, and pity moved them; especially the Spaniard go-,
vernor, who was the most gentleman-like, generous-
minded man, that ever I met with in my lise: and he
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and
bring him to understand what they meant, so sar as to be
able to act as interpreter, and to go among them, and see
if they might be brought to some conditions, that might
be depended upon to save their lives, and to do us no
spoil.
It was some time besore any of them could be taken; but
being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last sur-
prised, and made a prisoner; he was sullen at sirst, and
would neither eat nor drink; but sinding himself kindly
used, and victuals-given him, and no violence ossered him,
he at last grew tractable, and came to himself.
They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him, and told him how kind the others would be
to them all; that they would not only save their lives,
but

but would give them a part of the island to live in, pro-
vided they would give satissaction, that they should keep
in their own bounds, and not come-beyond them, to in-
jure or prejudice others ; and that they should have corn
given them, to plant and make it grow for their bread,
and some bread given them for their present subsistence;
and old Friday bade the sellow go and talk with the rest
of his countrymen, and see what they said to it; assurin»
them, that if they did not agree immediately, they should
all be destroyed.
The poor wretches thoroughly humbled, and reduced
in number to about thirty-seven, closed with the propo-
sal at die sirst osser, and begged to have some food givgn
them; upon which twelve Spaniards, and two Englishmen,
well armed, and three Indian slaves, and old Friday,
marched to the place where they were; the three Indian
slaves carried them a large quantity of bread, and some rica
boiled up to cakes, and dried in the sun, and three live
goats; and they were ordered to go to the side of an hill,
where they sat down, eat the provisions very thanksully,
ind were the most saithsul sellows to their words that could
be thought of; for, except when they came to beg victuali
ind directions, they never came out of their bounds; and
here they lived when I came to the island, and I went to
ee them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make bread,
ireed tame goats, and milk them; they wanted nothing but
vives, and they soon would have been a nation: they were
ionsined to a neck of land, surrounded with high rocks bc-
lind them, and lying plain towards the sea besore them,
>n the south-east corner of the island: they had land enough,
nd it was very good and fruitsul; for they had a piece of
and about a mile and half broad, and three or four miles
n length.
Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such its I
nade for myself; and gave among them 1 z hatchets, and
hree or four knives; and there they lived the most subject-
d, innocent creatures that were ever heard.of.
After this, the colony enjoyed a persect tranquillity,
nth respect to the savages, till I came to re-visit them,
/hich was in about two years; not but that now and
oeri some canoes of savages came on shore for their
triumphal

triumphal unnatural seasts; but as they were of several
nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those that
came besore, or the reason of it, they did not make any
search or enquiry after their countrymen; and if they
had, it would have been very hard for them to have found
them out.
Thus, I think, I have given a sull account of all that
happened to them, to my return, at least, that was worth
notice. The Indians, or savages, were wondersully ci-
vilized by them, and they frequently went among them;
but forbid, on pain of death, any of the Indians coming to
them, because they would not have their settlement be-
trayed again.
One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they taught
the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets; but they
soon out-did their masters; for they made abundance of
most ingenious things in wicker-work; particularly, all
forts of baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, &c. as also
chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and abundance of
other things, being very ingenious at such work, when
they were once put in the way of it.
My coming was a particular relies to these people, be-
cause we surnished them with knives, scissars, spades, sho-
vels, pick-axes, and all things of that kind which they could
want.
With the help of these tools they were so very han-
dy, that they came at last to build up their huts, or
houses, very handsomely; raddling, or working it up
like basket-work all the way round, which was a very
extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very odd;
but was an exceeding good sence, as well against heat
as against all sorts of vermin; and our men were so taken
with it, that they got the wild savages to come and do-
the like for them; so that when I came to see the two
Englishmen's colonies, they looked, at a distance, as if
they lived all like bees in a hive; and as for Will Atkins,
who was now become a very industrious, necessary, and
sober sellow, he had made himself such a tent of bas-
ket-work, as I believe was never seen; it was 120 paces-
round on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the
walls were as close-worked as a- basket, in pannels or
squares, thirty-two in number, and very strong, stand-
ing about seven seet high : in the middle was another not
above 22 paces round, but built stronger, being eight-
square in its form, and in the eight corners stood eight
very strong posts, round the top of which he laid strong
pieces, joined together with wooden pins, from which he
raised a pyramid besore the roof of eight rafters, very
handsome, I assure you, and joined together very well,
though he had no nails, and only a few iron spikes,
which he had made himself too, out of the old iron that
1 had lest there; and, indeed, this sellow shewed abun-
dance of ingenuity in several things which he had no
knowledge of; he made himself a forge, with a pair of
wooden bellows to blow the sire; he made himself char-
coal for his work, and he formed out of one of the iron
crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon; in this
manner he made many things, but especially hooks, sta-
Eles and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the
ouse; after he pitched the roof of his innermost tent,
he worked it up between the rafters with balket-work, so
sirm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with rice
straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered
the top, that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or
siated. Indeed, he owned that the savages made the basket-
work for him.
The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all round
this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the 32 an-
gles to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty
ieet distant; so that there was a space like a walk, within
the outer wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty
feet wide.
The inner place he partitioned off with the same
wicker-work, but much sairer, and divided it into six
apartments, for that he had six rooms on a floor, and-
out of every one of these there was a door; sirst, into
the entry or coming into the main tent, and another
door into the space or walk that was round it; so that
this walk was also divided into six equal parts, which
served not only for a retreat, but to store up any necessa-
ries which the samily had occasion for. These six spaces
not taking up the whole circumserence, what other
apartments the outer circle had, were thus ordered:
as soon a* you were in at the door of the outer circle»
you had a short passage strait besore you to rfie door of
the inner house; but on either side was a wicker partition,
and a door in it, by which you went, sirst, into a large
room or store-house, 20 seet wide, and about 30 seet
long, and through that into another not quite so long:
so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms,
six of which, were only to be come at through the apart-
ments of the inner tent, and served as closets or retired
rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle; and
four large warehouses or barns, or what you please to call
them, which went in through one another, two on either
hand of the passage, that led through the outer door to the
inner tent.
Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in
the world-; nor an house or tent so neatly contrived, much
less so built: in this great bee-hive lived the three samilies-,
that is to say, Will Atkins, and his companion; the third
was killed, but his wise remained with three children; for
she was, it seems, big with child when he died; and the
other two were notatall backward togivethe widow her sull
share of every thing, I mean, as to their corn, milk, grapes,
&c. and when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the
shore, so that they all lived well enough, though it was
true, they were not so industrious as the other two, as has
been observed already.
One thing, however, cannot be omitted; viz. that as
for religion, I don't know that there was any thing of that
kind among them; they pretty often, indeed, put one
another in mind, that there was a God, by the very com-
mon method of seamen, viz. swearing by his name: nor
were their poor ignorant savage wives much the better for
their having been married to Christians, as we must call them;
for asthey knew very little of God themselves, so they were
utterly incapable of entering into any discourse with their
wives about a God, or to talk any thing to them concerning
religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say
the wives had made from them, was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty well; and all the children
they had, which were near twenty in all, were taught to
speak English too, from their sirst learning to speak,
though they at sirst spoke it in a very broken manner,

ike their mothers. There were none of those children
ibove six years old when I came thither; for it was not
much above seven years that they had setched these sive
savage ladies over, but they had all been pretty fruitsul,
for they had all children, more or less: I think the cook's
mate's wise was big of her sixth child; and the mothers
ivere all a good sort of well governed, quiet, laborious
*vomen, modest and decent, helpsul to one another, mighty
ibscrvant and subject to their masters, I cannot call them
liusbands; and wanted nothing but to be well instructed
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married; both
vhich were happily brought about afterwards by my
neans, or, at least, by the consequence of my coming
imong them.
Having thus given an account of the colony in general,
ind pretty much of my sive runagade Englishmen, I must
ay something of the Spaniards, who were the main body
5s the samily; and in whose story thereare some incidents
ilso remarkable enough.
I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances, when they were among the savages: they
old me readily, that they had no instances to give of their
ipplication or ingenuity in that country; that they were a
ioor, miserable, dejected handsul of people; that if means
lad been put into their hands, they had'yet so abandoned
heraselves to despair, and so sunk under the weight of
heir misfortunes, that they thoughtof nothingbutstarving:
>ne of them, a grave and very sensible man, told me, he
vas convinced they were in the wrong; that it was not the
>art of wise men to give up themselves to their misery, but
ilways to take hold of the helps which reason ossered, as
veil for present support, as tor suture deliverance: he
old me, that gries was the most senseless insignisicant
>assion in the world; for that it regarded only things past,
vhich were generally impossible to be recalled or to be
emedied, but had no view to things to come, and had no
hare in any thing that looked like deliverance, but ra-
her added to the affliction than proposed a remedy: and
ipon this he repeated a Spaniso proverb; which, tho'
cannot repeat in just the same words that he spoke it, yet
remember I made it into an English proverb of my own,
ius:

In trouhle to he troubled.
Is to hate your trouble doubled.
He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improve-
ments 1 had made in my solitude; my unwearied applica-
tion, as he called it, and how I had made a condition,
which, in its circumstances, was at sirst much worse
than theirs, a thousand times more happy than theirs was,
even now, when they were altogether: he told me, it wJs
remarkable, that Englishmen had a greater presence of
mind, in their distress, than any people that ever he met
with; that their unhappy nation, and the Portuguese, weie
the worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes;
for that their sirst step in dangers, aster common esforts are
over, was always to despair, lie down under it and die,
without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for
escape.
I told him, their case and mine dissered exceedingly;
that they were cast upon the shore without necessaries,
without supply of food, or of present sustenance, till
they could provide it: that it is true, I had this dis-
advantage and discomfort, that I was alone; but then
the supplies I had providentially thrown into my hands,
by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore, was
such a help, as would have encouraged any creature in
the world to have applied himself as I had done.
Seignior, says the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards
been in your case, we should never have gotten half
those things out of the ship as you did: nay, says he,
we should never have found means to have gotten a
raft to carry them, or to have gotten a raft on shore
without boat or sail 4 and how much less should we
have done, said he, if any of us had been alone! Well,
I desired him to abate his compliment, and go on with
the history of their coming on shore, where they land-
ed: he told me, they unhappily landed at a place
where there were people without provisions; whereas,
had they had the common sense to have put off to sea
again, and gone to another island a little sarther, they
had found provisions, though without people; there
ieing an island that way, as they had been told, where
». there
there were provisions, though no people; that is to fay,
that the Spaniards of Trinidad had frequently been there,
and silled the island with goats and hogs at several times;
where they have bred in such multitudes, and where
turtle and sea-fowls where in such plenty, that they could
have been in no want of flesh, though they had found no
bread; whereas, here they weie only sustained with a
sew roots and herbs which they understood not, and
which had no substance in them, and which the inha-
bitants gave them sparingly enough, and who could
treat them no better, unless they would turn canibals,
and eat men's flesh, which was the great dainty of the
country.
They gave me an account how many ways they strove
to civilize the Savages they were with, and to teach them
rational customs in the ordinary way of living, but in
vain; and how they retorted it upon them, as unjust,
that they, who came thither for assistance and support,
should attempt to set up for instructors of those that gave
them bread; intimating, it seems, that none should set
up for the instructors of others, but those who Could live
without them.
They gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they
were driv en to; how sometimes they were many days with,
out any food at all; the island they were upon being inha-
bited by a fort of savages that lived more indolent, and,
for that reason, were less supplied with the necessaries of
lise, than they had reason to believe others were in the
same part of the world; and yet they found that these sa-
vages were less ravenous and voracious, than those who
had better supplies of food.
Also they added, that they could not but see with what
demonstrations of wisdom and goodness, the governing
Providence of God directs the event of things in the world;
which, they said, appeared in their circumstances; for if,
pressed by the hardships they were under, and the bar-
renness of the country where they were, they had search-
ed after a better place to live in, they had then been out
of the way of the relief that happened to them by my
means.
Then they gave me an account, how' the savages,
whom they lived among, expected them to go out with
them into their wars: and it was true, that, as they had
sire-arms with them; had they not had the disaster to lose
their ammunition, they should not have been serviceable
only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible
both to friends and enemies; but being without powder
and shot, and yet in a condition, that they could not in
reason deny to go out with their landlords to their wars;
when they came in the sield of battle, they were in a
worse condition than the savages themselves; for they
neither had bows nor arrows, nor could they use those
the savages gave them; so that they could do nothing
but stand still, and be wounded with arrows, till they
came up to the teeth of their enemy; and then, indeed,
the three halberts they had, were of use to them; and
they would often drive a whole little army besore them,
with those halberts, and sharpened sticks put into the
muzzles of their musquets: but that for all this they
were sometimes surrounded with multitudes, and in great
danger from their arrows; till at last they found the way
to nuke themselves large targets of wood, which they
covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew
not; and these shielded them from the arrows of the sa-
vages j that notwithstanding these, they were sometimes
in great lianger, and were once sive of them knocked down
together, wirh the clubs of the savages, which was the
time when one of them was taken prisoner; that is to say,
the Spaniard, whom I had relieved: That at sirst they
though! he had been killed, but when afterwards they
heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the greatest
^ries imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured
their lives to have rescued him.
They told me, that when they were so knocked down*
rf-.e rest of their company rescued them, and stood over
them, sighting till they were come to themselves, all but
he who they thought had been dead; and then they made
their way with their halberts and pieces, standing close
together in a line, through a body of above a thousand sa-
vages, beating down all that came in their way, got the
victor)' over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, he-
cause it was with the loss of their friend, whom, the other
party sinding alive, carried him eff with some others, at
I gave an account of in my former.
*Vol. U. E They
They described most assectionately, how they were,
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and
companion in misery, who they thought had been de-
voured by wild beasts of the worst of kind, viz. by wild
rren; and yet how more and more they were surprised
with the account he gave them of his errand, and that
there was a Christian in a place near, much more one that
was able, and had humanity enough to contribute to their
deliverance.
They described how they were astonished at the sight
of the relies I sent them, and at the appearance of
loaves of bread, things they had not seen since their
coming; to that miserable place; how often they crossed
it, and blessed it as bread sent from heaven; and what
a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it; as also,
of the other things I had sent for their supply. And,
after all, they would have told me something of the
joy they were in, at the sight of a boat and pilots to
carry them away to the person and place, from whence
all these new comforts came; but they told me, it was
impossible to express it by words; for their excessive
joy driving them to unbecoming extravagances, they had
no way to describe them, but by telling me, that they
bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent to
their passion, suitable to the sense that was upon them;
that, in some it worked one way, and in some another;
and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would
burst out into tears; others be half-mad, and others im-
mediately saint. This discourse extremely affected me,
and called to my mind Friday's ecstacy, when he met his
sather, and the poor people's ecstacy, when I took them
op at sea, after their ship was on sire; the mate of the ship's
joy, when he found himself delivered in the place where
he expected to perish; and my own joy, when, aftertwenty-
cight years captivity, I found a good ship ready to carry
nie to my own country: All these things made me more
sensible of the relation of these poor men, and more affect-
ed with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of things,
as I found them, I must relate the heads of what I did
for these people, and the condition in which I lest them.
It was their opinion, and mine too, that they would be
troubled
troubled no more with the savages; or that, if they
were, they would be able to cut them osf, if they were
twice as many as besore; so that they had no concern
about that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the
Spaniard, whom I called governor, about their stay in the
island; for, as I was not come to carry any of them off,
so it would not be just to carry off some, and leave others,
who perhaps would be unwilling to stay, if their strength
was diminished.
On the other hand, I told them, I came to establish
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them
know, that I had brought with me relies,of sundry kinds
for them: That I had been at a great charge to supply
them with all things necessary; as well for their con-
venience, as their desence; and that I had such par-,
ticular persons with me, as well to increase and recruit
their number, as by tb,e particular necessary employments
which they were bred to, being artisicers, to aslist
the^i in those things, in which, at present, they were to
seek.
They were all together when I talked thus to them; and
besore I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked
them, one by one, if they had entirely forgot and buried
the sirfl animosities that had been among them, and cauld
shake hands with one another, and engage in astrictfriend-
fnip, and union of interest, so that there might.be no more
misunderstandings or jealousies.
A\i!liam Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good-humour, said, They had met with asflictions
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enough
to make them all friends: That for his part, he would
live and die with them; and was so sar srom designing
any thing against the Spaniards, that, he owned, they
had done nothing to him but what his own bad hu-
mour made necessary, and what he would have done, and,
perhaps, much worse, in their case; and that he would
ask them pardon, if I desired it, for the foolish and bru-
tish things he had done to them; and was very willing and
desirous of living in terms of entire friendship and union
with them; and would do any thing that lay in hi»
power ^o convince them of it: and, as for going to
England, he cared not if he did not go thither theie twenty
years.
E 3 The
The Spaniards said, they had, indeed, at sirst, dis-
rmed and excluded William Atkins, and his two coun-
rymen for their ill-conduct, as they had let me know:
nd they appealed to me, for the necessity they were
inder to do lo; but that William Atkins had behaved
limself so bravely in the great sight they had with the
avaees, and on several occasions since, and had shewed
limself so saithsul to, and concerned for, the geneial in-
erest of them all, that they had forgotten all that was
YHI tlfl AND ADVENTURES OP
rmi, and supplied with necessaries, as any of them;
nd that they nad testisied their satissaction in him, by
ommitting the command to him, next to the governor
imself: and as they had an entire considence in him,
nd all hi* countrymen, so they acknowledged, they had
nerited that considence, by all the methods that honest
nen could merit to be valued and trusted: and they most
icartily embraced the occasion ofgiving me this assurance,
hat they would never have any interest separate from one
.nother.
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend-
hip, we appointed the next day to dine all together;
ind, indeed, we made a splendid seast : I caused the
hip's cook, and his mate to come on shore, and dress
>ur dinner; and the old cook's mate we had on shore,
.ssifted. We brought on shore six pieces of good beef,
Hid four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provision,
vith our punch bowl, and materials to sill it; and, in
>artkular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and
en bottles of English beer; things that neither the Sp»-
liards, or the Englishmen had tasted for many yean,; and
irhich it may be supposed, they were exceeding glad
,f.
The Spaniards added to our seast sive whole kids, which
he coeks roasted; and three of them were sent covered up
lose on board our ship to the seamen, that they might
east on fresh meat from on shore, as we did with their salt
,icat from on board.
After this seast, at which we were very innocently
nerry, I brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that
here might be no dispute about dividing, I shewed them
here waa sufficient for then all; and desired that they
might

might all take an equal quantity of the goods that were {at
wearing; that is to say, equal when made up. As sirst, I
distributed linen sufficient to make every one of them four
shirts; and, at the Spaniard's request, afterwards made them
up six; these were exceeding comfortable to them, having
been what, as I may fay, they had long since forgot the use
of, or what it was to wear them.
I allotted the three English stuffs, which I mentioned
besore, to make every one a light coat, like a frock, which
I judged sittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose;
and ordered, that whenever they decayed, they should make
more, as they thought sit: The like for pumps, shoes, stock-
ings, and hats, &c.
I cannot express what pleasure, what satissaction, sat
upon the countenances of all these poor men, when they
saw the care I had taken of them, and how well 1 had
surnished them: they told me I was a sather to them j
ani that, having such a correspondent as 1 was, in so re-
mote a part of the world, it would make them forget that
they were lest in a desolate place; and they all volun-
tarily engaged to me, not to leave the place without my
•consent.
Then I presented to them the people I had brought with
me; particularly the taylor, the smith, and the two car-
penters, all of them most necessary people; but, above all,
jny general artisicer, than whom they could not name any-
thing that was more needsul to them; and the taylor, to
shew his concern for them, went, to work immediately,
and, with my leave, made them every one a shirt the sirst
thing he did; and, which was still more, he taught the
women not only how to sew and stitch, and use the needle,
but made them assist to make the shirts for their husbands,
and for all the rest.
As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how use-
ful they were, for they took in pieces all my clumsy un-
handy things, and made them clever convenient tables,
stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves, and every
thing they wanted of that kind.
But, to let them see how nature made artisicers at sirst,
I carried the carpenters to see William Atkins's basket-
house, as I called it; and they both owned, they never
£aw an instance of such natural ingenuity besore; nor
E 3 any
any thing so regular, and so handily built, at least of its
kind: and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a
good while, turning about to me, 1 am sure, says he, that
man has no need of us; you need do nothing but give him
tools.
Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave
every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had
no harrows or ploughs; and, to evfcry separate place, a pick-
axe, a crow, a broad-axe, and a saw; always appointing,
that as often as any were broken, or worn out, they should
be supplied, without grudging, out of the general stores
that I lest behind.
Naili, staples, hinges, hammers, chissels, knives, sciflars,
and all forts of tools, and iron-work, they had without tale,
as they required; for no man would care to take more than
they wanted; and he must be a fool that would waste or
spoil them, on any account whatever: And for the use of
the smith, I lest two tons of unwrought iron for a
supply.
My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought
them, was such, even to prosusion, that they could not
but rejoice at them; for now they could march as I used
to do, with a musquet upon each shoulder, if there was
occasion; and were able to sight iooo savages, if they,
had but some little advantages of situation; which also
they could not miss of, if they chose.
I carried on shore with me the young man whose mo-
. ther was starved to death, and the maid also; she was a
sober, well-educated, religious young woman, and be-
haved so inoffensively, that every one gave her a good
, word: She had, indeed, an unhappy lise with us, there
. being no woman in the ship but herself; but she bore it
with patience. After a while, seeing things so well or-
dered, and in so sine a way of thriving upon my illand,
and considering that they had neither business or ac-
quaintance in the East-Indies, or reason for taking so
long a voyage; I say, considering all this, both of them
came to me, and desired I would give them leave to re-
rnain on the island, and be entered among my samily, as
they called it.
I agreed to it readily; and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or
houses
houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, pallisadoed
like Atkint's, and adjoining to his plantation; their tents
were contrived so, that they had each of them a room
apart to lodge in, and a middle tent, like a great store-
house, to lay all their goods in, and to eat and drink in:
And now the other two Englishmen removed their habita-
tion to the same place; and so the island was divided in-
to three colonies, and no more; viz. the Spaniards with
old Friday, and the sirst servants, at my old habitation
under the hill, which was, in a word, the capital city,
and where they had so enlarged arid extended their works,
as well under, as on the outside of the hill, that they
lived, tho' persectly concealed, yet sull at large. Never
was there such a little city in a wood, and so hid, I be-
lieve, in any part of the world: For, I verily believe,
1000 men might have ranged the island a month, and,
if they had not known there was such a thing, and looked
on purpose for it, they would nor hfive sound it; for the
trees stood so thick, and so close, and grew so sast matted
into one another, that nothing but cutting them down
sirst, could discover the place; except the two narrow
entrances where they went in and out, could be found;
which was not very easy : One of them was just down at
the water's edge, on the side of the creek; and it was af-
terwards above 200 yards to the place; and the other was
up the ladder at twice, as I have already formerly descri-
bed it, and they had a large wood, thick planted, also, on
the top of the hill, which contained above an acre, which
grew apace, and covered the place from all discovery there,
with only one narrow place betwen two trees, not easy to
be discovered, to enter on that side.'
The other colony was that of Will Atkins'9, where
there were sour samilies of Englishmen, I mean those I
had lest there, with their wives and children; three
savages, that were slaves; the widow and children of
the Englishman that was killed; the young man and the
maid, and, by the way we made a wise of her also,
besore we went away: There were also the two carpen-
ters and the taylor, who I brought with me for them;
also the smith, whoJwas a very necessary man to'' them,
especially the gufrfmith, to take care of their arms;
and my other flSSn, whom I called Jack of all trades,
E4" who
who was himsels as good almost astwenty men,for he was
.not only a very ingenious sellow, but a very merry sellow;
and, besore I went away, we married him to the honest
maid that came with the youth in the ship; whom I men-
tioned before.
And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to
fay something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought
with me out of the ship's crew, whom I took at sea. It is
true, this man was a Roman, and, perhaps, it may give of-
fence to some hereafter, if I leave any thing extraordinary
upon record, of a man, whom, before I begin, I must (to
set him in just colours) represent interns very much to nil
disadvantage in the account of Protestants; as sirst, that
he was a Papist; secondly, a Popish Priest; and thirdly, a
French Popish Priest.
But justice demands of me to give him a due cha-
racter; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious,
and most religious person; exact in his lise, extensive
in his charity, and exemplary in almost every thing he
did: What, then, can any one say, against my bang
very sensible of the value of such a man, notwithstanding
his prosession ? Though it may be my opinion, perhaps, at
well as the opinion of others, who shall read this, that he
tvas mistaken. I
The sirst hour that I began to converse withhim, after
he had agreed to go with me to the East-Indies, I found
reason to delight exceedingly in his conversation: And he
sirst began with me about religion, in the most obliging
mannner imaginable.
Sir, says he, you have not only, under God (and, at
that, he crossed his breast) saved my lise, but you have
admitted me to go this voyage in your ship, and, by
your obliging civility, have taken me into your samily,
giving me an opportunity of free conversation: Now,
Sir, says he, you see by my habit what my prosession
is; and I guess by your nation, what your's is: I may
think it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my
utmost endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the
fouls that I can to the knowledge of the truth, and to
embrace the Catholic doctrine ; but, as I am here under
your permission, and in your samily, I am bound in
justice to your kindness, at well as in decency and good
manners,
tor
manners, to be under your government; and therefore, I
stall not, without yourleave, enter into any debates on the
points of religion, in which we may not agree, sarther
I told him, nis carriage was so modest, that I could
not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were
such people as they call heretics; but, that he was
not the sirst Catholic that I had conversed with, with-
out salling into any inconveniences, or carrying the
questions to any height in debate; that he should not
sind himself the worse used for being of a disserent opini-
on from us; and if we did not converse without any dislike
on either side, upon that score, it would be his sault, not
ours.
He replied, that he thought our conversation might
business to cap principles with every man he discoursed
with; and that he rather desired me to converse with
him as a gentleman, than as religieux; that if I would
give him leave, at any time, to discourse upon religious
subjects, he would readily comply with it; and that
then he did not doubt but I would allow him also to de-
send his own opinions, as well as he could: but that,
without my leave, he would not break in upon me with
any such thing.
He told me sarther, that he would not cease to> do all
that became him in his office, as a priest, as well as a
private Christian, to procure the good of the ship, and
tlie sasety of all that was in her: and though, perhaps, we
would not join with him, and he could not pray with us,
he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon
all occasions. In this manner we conversed; and, as he
was of a most obliging gentleman-like behaviour, so he
was, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good sense,
and, as I believe, of great learning.
He gave me a most diverting account of his lise,
and of the many extraordinary events of it;. of many
adventures which had besallen him in a sew years
that he had been abroad in the world, and particu-
larly this was very remarkable; viz. that during the

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
to the place whither any of the ships he was in were at
sirst designed: that his sirst intent was, to have gone to
Martinrco ; and that he went on board a ship bound
thither, at St. Malces; but being forced into Lisbon in
bad weather, the ship received some damage, by running
a-ground in the mouth of the river Tagus, and was ob-
liged to unload her cargo there: That sinding a Portu-
guese ship there bound to the Madeiras, and ready to sail,
and supposing he should easily meet with a vessel there
bound to Martinico, he went on board, in order to sail to
the Madeiras; but the master of the Portuguese ship,
being but an indisserent mariner, had been out in his
reckoning, and they drove to Fial; where, however, he
happened to sind a very good market for his cargo,
which was corn; and theresore resolved not to go to the
Madeiras, but to load sait at the Ifle of May, to go away
to Newfoundland: . He had no remedy in the exigence,
but to go with the ship; and had a pretty good voyage
as sar as the Banks, so they call the place where they
catch the sish, where, meeting with a French ship bound
from France to Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from
thence to Martinico, to carry provisions, he thought he
should have an opportunity to complete his sirst design:
But when he carr.e to Quebec, the master of the ship died,
and the ship proceeded no sarther: So the next voyage
he shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burnt,
when we took them up at sea, and then shipped them with
as for the East-Indies, as I have already said. Thus he had
leen disappointed in sive voyages, all, as I may call it, in
Mie voyage, besides what I shall have occasion to mention
arther of the same person.
But 1 shall not make digressions into other men's
lories, which, have no relation to my own. I return
o what concerns our assair in the island: He came to
ne one morning, for he lodged among us all the w hile
ve were upon the island; and it happened to be just
/hen I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at
ie sarthest part of the island; I say, he came to me,
nd told me, with' a very grave countenance, that he

some measure correspond with my general design, which
was the prosperity of my new colony; and, perhaps,
might put it, at least, more than he yet thought it was,
in the way of God's blessing.
I looked a little surprised at the last part of his dis-
course; and turning a little short, how, sir, said I, can
it be said, that we are not in the way of God's blessing,
after such visible assistances, and wondersul deliverances,
as we have seen here, and of which I have given you a
large account.
if you had pleased, sir, said he (with a world of mo-
desty, and yet with great readiness), to have heard me,
you would have found no room to have been displeased,,
much less to think so hard of me, that I should suggest,
that you have not had wondersul assistances and delive-
rances; and, I hope, on your behalf, that you are in the
way of God's blessing, and your design is exceeding good,
and will prosper. But, sir, said he, though it were more
so, than is even possible to you, yet there may be some
among you, that are not equally right in their actions:
And you know, that in the story of Israel, one Achan,
in the camp, removed God's blessing from them, and
turned his hand so against them, that thirty-six of them,
though not concerned in the crime, were, the objects
of divine vengeance, and bore the weight of that punish-
ment. •
I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told
him, his inserence was so just, and the whole design
seemed so sincere, and was really so religious in its own.
nature, that I was very sorry I had interrupted him;
and begged him to go on: And,- in the mean time, be-
cause it seemed, that what we had both to say, might
take up some time, I told him, I wasgoing to the English-
men's plantation; and asked him to go with me, and we
might discourse in it by the way: He told me, he would
more willingly wait on me thither, because there partly
the thing was ailed, which he desired to speak to me
about: So he walked on, and !• pressed him to be free
and plain with me, in what he had to say..
Why then, sir, says he, be pleased to give me leave
to lay down a. sew propositions,- as the foundation of.
what I have to say, that we may not differ, in the ge-
E $ neral'
neral principles, tho' we may be of some differing opU i'isa, «h ,
nions in the practice of particulars. First, sir, though we %d\m I
differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion, and iHrdiUia
it is very unhappy that it is so, especially in the case iiaiifeanv
besore us, as I shall shew afterwards; yet, there are some :id m n
general principles in which we both agree, viz First, aotbut so
that there is a God; and that this God, having given us r, T0 |j >
some stated general rules for our service and obedience,
*e ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him, i0;pioscsion
either by neglecting to do what he has commanded, or Nak oru
by doing what he has expressly forbidden: and let our *«dW
different religions be what they will, this general prin- *>Si,whi!i
ciple is readily owned by us all, That the blessing Mtln
of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous sin- 'atetool^
nine against his command; and every good Christian Siutbv
will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are '^.Ivtta
under his care, living in a total neglect of God and his j
commands. It is not your men being protestants, what- ^iWi
ever my opinion may be of such, that discharges me lT
from being concerned for their souls, and from endea- iini-
vouring, if it lies besore me, that they should live in as "Neons"
little distance from, and enmity with, their Maker as ^tky?

that, like Joshua (to take his own parable)., I might put (^ ™

Why then, sir, says he, I will take the libesty yoa 'j^J *

right, must stand in the way of God's blessing upon ^ 1 c

He gave me no lea\e to put in any more civilities, j 11
but went on. First, fir, says he, you have here four - 0t»
Englishmen^.
Englishmen, who have setched women from among the
savages, and have taken them as their wives, and have
had many children by them all, and yet are not married
to them after any stated legal manner, as the laws of
God and man require; and theresore are yet, in the
sense of both, no less than adulterers, and living in adul-
tery. To this, Sir, says he, I know you will object,
that there was no clergyman, or priest of any kind, ot
of any prosession, to persorm the ceremony; nor any
pen and ink, or paper, to write down a contract of mar-
riage, and have it signed between them. And I know
also, Sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you: I
mean, of the agreement that he obliged them to make,
when they took these women, viz. That they should chuse
them out by consent, and keep separately to them;
which, by the way, is nothing of marriage, no agree-
ment with the women or wives, but only an agreement
among themselves, to keep them from quarrelling.
But, Sir, the essence of the sacrament of matrimony
(so he called it, being a Roman} consists not only in the
mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man
and wise, but in the formal and legal obligation that
there is in the contract, to compel the man and woman,
at all times, to own and acknowledge each other; oblig-
ing the man to abstain siom all other women, to engage
in no other contract while these subsist; and on all occa-
sions, as ability allows, to provide honestly for them
and their children; and to oblige the women to the same,
or like conditions, mutatis mutandis, on their side.
Now, Sir, says he, these men may, when they please,
or when occasion presents, abandon these women, dis-
own their children, leave them to perish, and take other
women, and marry them whilst these are living. And
here he added, with some warmth, How, Sir, is God
honoured in this unlawsul liberty? And how shall a
blessing succeed your endeavours in this place,, however
good in themselves, and however sincere in your design,
while these men, who at present are your subjects, under
your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by
you to live in open adultery?
1 consess, I was struck at the thing itself, but mucti
more with the convincing arguments he supported, it
witfcj
with; for it was certainly true, that though they had no
clergyman on the spot, yet a formal contract on both
sides, made besore witnesses, and consirmed by any
token, which they had all agreed to be bound by, tho'
it had been but the breaking a stick between them, en-
gaging the men to own these women for their wives upon
all occasions, and never to abandon them or their chil-
dren, and the women to the same with their husbands,
had betn an effectual lawsul marriage in the sight of
God; and it was a great neglect that it was not done.
But I thought to have gotten off with my young priest,
by telling him, that all that part was done when I was
not here; and they had lived so many years with them
now, that if it was an adultery, it was past remedy; they
could do nothing in it now.
Sir, says he, aiking your pardon for such freedom,
you are right in this; that it being done in your ab-
sence, you could not be charged with that part of the
crime; but I beseech you, slatter not yourself, that you
are not theresore under an obligation to do your utter-
most now to put an end to it; how can you think, but
that, let the time past lie on whom it will, all the guilt
for the suture will lie entirely upon you? Because it is
certainly in your power now to put an end to it; and in
nobody's power but your's.
I was so dull still, that I did not take him right; hut
I imagined that, by putting an end to it, he meant,
that I should part them, and not suffer them to live toge-
ther any longer: and I said to him, I could not do that
by any means, for that it would put the whole island in
consusion. He seemed surprised that I should so sar
mistake him. No, Sir, says he, I do not mean that
you should separate them, but legally and effectually
marry them now: and, Sir, as my way of marrying
may not be so easy to reconcile them to, tho' it will be
us effectual, even by your own laws; so your way may
fre as well besore God, and as valid among men; I
mean, by a written contract, signed by both man and
vvoman, and by all the witnesses present; which all the
Jaws of Europe would decree to be valid.
I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much
sincerity of zeal,besides the.unusual impartiality in his
discourse,.
hi
discourse, as to his own party or church; and such a true
warmth for the preserving'people that he had no know-
ledge of, or relation to; I say, for presen ing them from
transgressing the laws of God; the like of which I had,
indeed, not met with any-where. But recollecting what
he had said, of marrying them by a written contract,
which I knew would stand too; I returned it back upon
him, and told him, I granted all that he had said to be
just, and, on his part, very kind; that I would discourse
with the men upon the point now, when I came to them:
And I knew no reason why they mould scruple to let
him marry them all; which I knew well enough would
be granted to be as authentic and valid in England, as if
they were married by one of our own clergymen. What
was afterwards done in this matter, I shall speak of by
itself.
I then pressed him to tell me, what was the second
complaint which he had to make; acknowledging, that
I was very much his debtor for the sirst; and thanked
him heartily for it. He told me, he would use the same
freedom and plainness in the second; and hoped 1 would
rake it as well: and this was, that, notwithstanding
these English subjects of mine, as he called them, had
lived with these women for almost seven years, and had
taught them to speak English, and even to read it; and
that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable under-
standing, and capable of instruction ; yet they had not to
this hour, taught them any thing of the Christian religion;
no, not so much as to know that there was a God, or a
worship, or in what mannerGod was to be served; or that
their own idolatry, and worshipping they knew not who,
was salse and absurd.
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and
what God would certainly call them to an account for -r
and, perhaps, at last take the work out of their hands.
He spoke this very assectionately and warmly. 1 am per-
suaded, says he, had those men lived in the savage coun-
try whence their wives came, the savages would have
taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters,
and to worship the devil, than any of these men, so sar
as I can see, has taken with them, to teach them the
knowledge of the true God, Now, Sir, said he,: tho' I
do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we
should be all glad to see the devil's servants, and the sub-
jectsofhis kingdom, taught to know the general princi-
ples of the Christian religion; that they might at least,
hear of God, and of a Redeemer, and of the resurrection,
and of a suture state, things which we all believe; they had
at least, been so much nearer coming into the bosom of
the true church, than they are now in the public proses-
sion of idolatry, and devil-worship.
I could hold no longer; I took him in my arms, and
embraced him with an excess of passion: how sar, said
I to him, have I been from understanding the most es-
sential pan of a Christian, viz. to love the interest of
the Christian church, and the good of other men's souls?
I scarce have known what belongs to being a Christian.
O Sir, do not say so, replied he; this thing is not your
sault. No! said I, but why did I never lay it to heart
as well as you? It is not too late yet, said he, be not
too forward to condemn yourself. But, what can be done
now? said I; you see I am going away. Will you give
me leave, said he, to talk with these poor men about it i
Yes, with all my heart, said I; and will oblige them to
give heed to what you fay too. As to that, laid he, we
rnust leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is our bur
finess to assist them» encourage them, and instruct them:
and, if you will give me leave, and God his blessing, I
do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls, shall be
brought home into the great circle of Christianity, if not
into the particular saith that we all embrace; and that
even while you stay here. Upon this, I said, I shall not
only give you leave, but give you a thousand thanks for
jt. What followed on this account I shall mention also
again in its place.
I now pressed him for the third article in which we
xvete to blame i why, really, says he, it is of the same
nature, and I will proceed (asking your leave J with the
fame plainness as besore; it is about your poor savages
yonder, who are (as I may say), your conquered subjects
It is a maxim, Sir, that is, or ought to be received
among all Christians, of what church, or pretended-
church soever; viz. that Christian knowledge ought to
be propagated by all possible means, and on all possible
occa-
RbriNSON Ctsiot nj
occasions. It is on this principle that our church sends
missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and that
our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage
in the most hazardous voyages, and the most danger-
ous residence among murderers and barbarians, to
teach them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring
them over to embrace the Christian saith. Now, Sir,
you have an opportunity here, to have six or seven
and thirty poor savage* brought over from idolatry to
the knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer,
that I wonder how you can pass such an occasion of do-
ing good; which is really worth the expence of a man's
whole lise.
I was now struck dumb indeed^ and had not one word
to say: I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for
God and religion besore me, let his particular principle*
be of what kind soever: as for me, I had not so much
as entertained a thought of this in my heart besore;
and, I believe, should not have thought of it; for I
looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom,
had we any work for them to do, we would have used
as such, or would have been glad to have transported
them to any other part of the world; for our business
was to get rid of them; and we would all have been sa-
tissied if they had been sent to any country, so they had
never seen their own. But to the case: I say, I was
consounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer
to make him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in
some disorder; Sir, said he, I shall be veiy sorry, if what
I have said gives you any ossence: No, no, said I, I am
offended with nobody but myself; but I am persectly
consounded, not only to think that I should never take
any notice of this besore, but with reflecting what no-
tice I am able to take of it now. You know, Sir, said I,
what circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East-
Indies, in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom
it would be an insusserable piece of injustice to detain
their ship here, the men lying all this while at victuals
and wages upon the owner's account: it is true, I
agreed to be allowed twelve days here; and if I stay
more, I must pay 31. sterling per diem demurrage: nor
can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more; and
I have
I have been here thirteen days already; so that I am
persectly unable to engage in this work, unless I would
susser myself to be lest behind here again; in which case,
if this single ship should miscarry in any part os her voy-
age, I should be just in the same condition that I was lest
in here at sirst; and from which I have been so wonder-
fully delivered.
He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my
voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience, whether
the blessing of saving seven and thirty souls, was not worth
my venturing all I had in the world for? I was not so
sensible of that as he was: and I returned upon him thus:
Why, sir, it is a valuable thing indeed, to be an instru-
ment, in God's hand, to convert seven and thirty heathens
to the knowledge of Christ; but as you are an ecclesiastic,
and are given over to that work, so that it seems naturally
to sall into the way of your prosession, how is it then,
that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it, than
press me to it t
Upon this he saced about, just besore me, as he walk-
ed along, and, putting me to a sull stop, made me a
very low bow: I most heartily thank God, and you, sir,
says he, for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a
work; and if you think yourself discharged from it,
and desire me to undertake it, I will most readily do it,
and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and
difficulties of such a broken disappointed voyage as I
have met with, that I have dropt at last into so glorious a
work.
I discovered a kind of rapture in his sace, while he
spoke this to me; his eyes sparkled like sire; his sace
glowed, and his colour came and went, as if he had
been salling into sits: in a word, he was sired with the
•joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a con-
siderable while, besore I could tell what to say to him;
for I was really surprised to sind a man of such since-
rity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond the
ordinary rate of men, not of his prosession only, but
even of any prosession whatsoever: but after I had con-
sidered it a while, I asked him seriously, if he was in
earnest, and that he would venture on the.single consi-
deration of an attempt on those poor people, to be locked
up
up in an unplanted island for, perhaps, his lise; and, at
last, might not know whether he should be able to do them
any good, or not?
He turned short upon me, and asked me, what I called
a venture ? pray, sir, said he, what do you think I con-
sented to go in your ship to the East-Indies for ? Nay,
said I, that I know not, unless it was to preach to the
Indians. Doubtless it was, said he; and do you think,
if I can convert these seven and thirty men to the saith
of Christ, it is not worth my time, though I should never
be setched osf the island again? Nay, is it not insinitely
of more worth to save so many souls, than my lise is,
or the lise of twenty more of the same prosession? Yes,
sir, says he, I would give Christ and the blessed Virgin
thanks all my days, if I could be made the least happy
instrument of saving the souls of these poor men, tho'
I was never to set my foot osf this island, or see my na-
tive country any more: but, since you will horiour me,
says he, with putting me into this work (for which I
wili pray for you all the days of my lise) I have one
humble petition to you, said he, besides. What is that?
said I. Why, says he, it is, that you will leave your man
Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to as-
sist me; for, without some help, I cannot speak to them,
or they to me.
I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, becaure
I could not think of parting with him, and that for so
many reasons; he had been the companion of my travels;
he was not only faithsul to me, but sincerely .assectionate
to the last degree; and I had resolved to do something
considerable for him, if he outlived me, as it was proba-
ble he would: then 1 knew, that as I had bred Friday
up to be a Protestant, it would quite consound him, to
bring him to embrace another prosession; and he would
never, while his eyes were open, believe that his old master
was an heretic, and would be damned; and this might in
the end ruin the poor sellow's principles, and so turn him
back again to his sirst idolatry.
However, a sudden thought relieved me in this
streight, and it was this; I told him, I could not say,
that I was willing to part with Friday on any account
whatever; though a work, that to him was of more
value
value than his lise, ought to me to be of much more
value than the keeping or parting with a servant. But,
on the other hand, I was persuaded, that Friday would
by no means consent to part with me; and then to
force him to it, without his consent, would be mani-
sest injustice; because I had promised I would never
to me that he would never leave me, unless I put mm
away.
He seemed very much concerned at it; for he had no
rational access to these poor people, seeing he did not
word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told him,
Friday's sather had learned Spanish, which I found he
also understood ; and he should serve him for an inwr-
preter; so he was much better satissied, and nothing could
persuade him, but he would stay to endeavour to conveit
them; but Providence gave another and very happy turn
to all this,
I come back now to the sirst part of his objections.
When we came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all
together; and after some accounts given them of what
I had done for them, viz. what necessary things I had
provided for them, and how they were distributed;
which they were sensible of, and very thanksul for; I
began to talk to them of the scandalous lise they led,
and gave them a sull account of the notice the clergy-
man had already taken of it ; and arguing how unchris-
tian and irreligious a lise it was, I sirst asked them, if
they were married men or bachelors? They soon ex-
plained their condition to me, and shewed me that two
of them were widowers, and the other three were single
men or bachelors. I asked them, with what consci-
ence they could take these women, and lie with them,
as they had done, call them their wives, and have so
many children by them, and not be married lawsully to
them?
They all gave me the answer that I expected; viz.
that there was nobody to marry them: that they
agreed besore the governor to keep them as their wives;
and to keep them, and own them, as their wives; and
the/ thought, as things stood with them, they were as

fcgally married as if they had been married by a parson,
and with all the formalities in the world.
I told them, that no doubt they were married in
the sight of God, and were bound in conscience to
keep them as their wives; but that the laws of men
being otherwise, they might pretend they were not mar-
ried, and so desert the poor women and children here-
after; and that their wives, being poor desolate wo-
men, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to
help themselves: I theresore told them, that unless I
was assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing
for them; but would take care, that what I did should
be for the women, and children, without them ; and that
unless they would give some assurances, that they would
marry the women, I could not think it was convenient
they should continue together as man and wise; for that
it was both scandalous to men, and ossensive to God, who
they could not think would bless them, if they went on
thus.
All this passed as I expected; and they told me,
especially Will Atkins, vt ho seemed now to speak for the
rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they had
been born in their own native country, and would not
leave them upon any account whatever; and they did
verily believe their wives were as virtuous, and as modest,
and did to the utmost of their skill, as much for them,
and for their children, as any women could possibly do;
and they would not part with them on any account:
And William Atkins, for his own particular, added, if
any man would take him away, and offer to carry him
heme to England, and to make him captain of the best
roan of war in the navy, he would not go with him, if he
might not carry his wise and children with him; and if
there was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married
to her now, with all his heart.
This was just as I would have it ; the priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not sar off;
So, to try him sarther, I told him I had a clergyman
with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have him
married the next morning; and bade him consider of
it, and talk with the rest: He said, As for himself, he
need not consider of it at all; for he was very ready to
do it, and was glad I had a minister with me; and he
believed they would be all willing also. I then told
him, that my sriend, the minister, was a Frenchman,
and could not speak. English; but that I would act the
clerk between them. He never so much as alked me
whether he was a Papist or Protestant; which was, in-
deed, what I was afraid of. But I say, they never
enquired about it. So we parted: I went back to my
clergyman; and Will Atkins went in to talk with his
companions. I desired the French gentleman not to
say any thing to them, till the business was thorough
ripe; and I told him what answer the men had given
me.
Besore I went from their quarter, they all came to
me, and told me, they had been considering what I had
said; that they were very glad to hear I had a clergy-
man in my company; and they were very willing to
give me the satissaction I desired, and to be formally
married as soon as I pleased; sor they were sar from
desiring to part from their wives; and that they meant
nothing but what was very honest, when they chose
them-: so I appoimed them to meet me the next morn-
ing; and that in the mean time, they should let their
wives know the meaning of the marriage-law; and that it
was not only to prevent any scandal, but also to oblige
them, that they should not forsake them, whatever might
happen.
The women were easily made sensible of the mean-
ing of the thing, and were very well satissied with it,
as, indeed, they had reason to be; so they sailed net
to attend all together; at my apartment, the next morn-
ing, where I brought cut my clergyman: and though
he had not on a minister's gown afier the manner
of England, or the habit of a^Priest, after the manner
of Fnnice; yet having a black vest, something like a
cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very
unlike a minister; and as for his language, I was inter-
preter.
But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and
the scruples he made of marrying the women, be-
cause they were not baptized, and prosessed Christians,
gave them an exceeding reverence for his person; and
there
there was no need after that to enquire whether he was a
clergyman or no.
Indeed I was afraid his scruple would have been car-
ried so sar, as that he would not have married them at
all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to say to him,
,he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily ; and
at last resused absolutely to marry them, unless he had
,sirst talked with the men, and the women too; and
though, at. sirst, I was a little backward to it, yet at
last 1 agreed to it with a good will, perceiving the sin-
,cerity of his design.
When he came to them, he let them know that I had
acquainted him with their circumstances, and with the
present design; that he was very willing to persorm
that part of his sunction, and marry them, as I had
desired; but that, besore he could do it, he must take the
liberty to talk with them: he told them,;'that in the
sight of all disserent men, and in the sense of the laws
of society, they had lived all this while in an open adul-
tery; and that it was true, that nothing but the consent-
ing to marry, or essectually separating them from one
another now, could put^an end to it; but there was a
dissiculty in it too, with respect to the laws of Christian
matrimony, which he was not sully satissied about, viz.
that of marrying one that is a prosessed Christian, to a
savage, an idolater, and a heathen, one that is not bap-
tized; and yet that he did not see, that there was time
lest for it, to endeavour to persuade the woman to be
baptized, or to prosess the name of Christ, whom they
had, he doubted, heard nothing of, and without which
they could not be baptized.
He told me, he doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little know-
ledge of God, or his ways; and theresore he could not
expect, that they hnd said much to their wives on that
head yet; but that unless they would promise him to
use their endeavours with their wives, to persuade
them to become Christians, and would, as well as they
could, instruct them in the knowledge and belies os
God that made them, and to worship Jesus Christ that
redeemed them, he could not marry them; for he.
would have no hand in joining Christians with sa-
vages;
vages; nor was it consistent with the principles of the-'
Christian religion; and was, indeed, expreii.lv forbid-
den in God's law.
They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered
it very saithsully to them, from his mouth, as near his
own words as I could, only sometimes adding some-
thin? of my own, to convince them how just it was,
and how I was of his mind: and I always very saith-
sully distinguished between what I said from myself,
and what were the clergyman's words. They told
me, it was very true what the gentleman had said,
that they were but very indsrerent Christians them-
selves, and that they had never talked to their wives
about religion : Lord, sir, says' Will Atkins, how st.ould
we teach them religion? Why, we know nothing our-
selves: and besides, sir, said he, should we go to talk
to them of God, and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell,
'rwould be to make them laugh at us, and alk i s, what
we believe ourselves? And if we should tell them, we
believe all the ihings that we speak of to them; such
as of good people going to heaven, and wicked peo-
ple to the devil, they would aflt us, where we intended
to go ourselves, who believe all this, and yet are such
wicked sellows, as we ir.dctd are: why, sir, said Will,
'tis enough to give them a surseit of religion at sirst
hearing: folks must have some religion themselves
before they pretend to teach other tenple. Will At-
kins, said I to him, though I am afraid what you say
has too much truth in it, yet can you not tell your
wise, that (he is in the wrong? that there is a God,
and a religion better than her own; that her gods are
idols; that they can neither hear nor speak; that there
is a great Being that made all things, and that can de-
stroy all that he had made; that he rewards the good,
and punishes the bad; that we arc to be judged by him,
at last, for all we do here: you are not so ignorant, but
even nature itself will teach you, that all this is true;
and I am satissied you know it all to be true, and be-
Jieve it yourself.
That's true, sir, said Atkins; but with what sace
can 1 say any thing to my wise of all this, when (he
will tell me immedately, it cannot be true?
No
izi
Not true, said I, what do you mean by that? Why
Sir, said he, she will tell me it cannot be true, that this
Clod (I shall tell her of) can be just, or can punish, or re-
ward, since I am not punished, and sent to the devil,
that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I
have been, even to her, and to every body else; and
that I should be sussered to live, that have been always
acting so contrary to what I must tell her is good, and
to what I ought to have done.
Why truly, Atkins, said I, I am afraid thou speakest
too much truth; and with that I let the clergyman
know what Atkins had said; for he was impatient to
know; O! said the priest, tell him there is one thing
will make him the best minister in the world to his
wise, and that is repentance; for none teach repentance
like true penitents: he wants nothing, but to repent,
and then he "will be so much the better qualisied to in-
struct his wise; he will then be able to tell her, that
there is not only a God, and that he is the just rewarder
of good and evil; but that he is a mercisul being, and,
with insinite goodness and long-sussering, forbears to pu-
nish those that ossend; waiting to be gracious, and wil-
ling not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should
return and live; that he often, susfers wicked men to go
on a long time, and even reserves damnation to the gene-
ral day of retribution; that it is a clear evidence of
God, and of a suture state, that righteous men receive
not their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till
they come into another world; and this will lead him to
teach his wise the doctrine of the resurrection, and of
the .last judgment: let him but repent for himself, he will
be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wise.
I repeated all this to Atkins,^who looked very serious
all the while, and who, we could easily perceive, was
niore than ordinarily assected with it: when being eager,
and hardly suffering me to make an end; I knew all
this, mailer, says he, and a great deal more; but I han't
the impudence to teBc thus to my wise: when God,
and roy own conscience knows, and my wise will be an
undeniable evidence against me, that I have liv. i as
if I had never heard of a God, or a suture state, or any
thing about it; and to talk of my repenting, alas! (and
Vot. II. V with
with that he setched a deep sigh; and I could see that
tears stood in his eyes) *tis past all that with me. Past
it! Atkins, said I, what dost thou mean by that? I
know well enough what I mean, Sir, says he; I mean
'tis too late; and that is too true.
I told my clergyman, word for word, what he said;
ithe poor zealous priest (I must call him so; for be his
opinion what it will, he had certainly a most singular
affection for the good of other men's souls; and it would
be hard to think he had not the like for his own; I say,
this zealous assectionate man) could not resrain tears
also: but, recovering himself, he said to me, ask him
but one question, Is he easy that it is too late, or is he
troubled, and wishes it were not so? I put the question
sairly to Atkins; and he answered with a great deal of
passion, How could any man be easy in a condition that
•certainly must end in eternal destruction? That he was
sar from being easy; but that, on the contrary, he be-
lieved it would one time or other ruin him.
What do you mean by that? said I. Why, he said,
he believed he should, one time or another, cut his own
throat to put an end to the terror of it.
The clergyman shook his head, with a great concern
in his sace, when I told him all this; but, turning quick
to me upon it, said, If that be hi* case, you may assure
him it is not too late; Christ will give him repentance:
but pray, says he, explain this to him, That as no man
is saved but by Christ, and the merit of -his passion,
procuring divine mercy from him, how can it be too late
for any man to receive mercy? Does he think he is able
.to fin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray
teli him, There may be a time when provoked mercy
will no longer strive, and when God may resuse to hear;
but that 'tis never too late for men to ask mercy: *nd
,we that are Christ's servants are commanded to preach
mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus Chaist, to all
those that sincerely repent; so that 'tis never too late re
.repent.
I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with'great
earnestness; but it seemed as if he turned osf the dis-
course to the rest; for he said to me, he would go and
have some talk with his wise: so he went out awhile,
and
and we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all stupid-
ly ignorant as to matters of religion; much as I was when
I went rambling away from my sather; and yet that there
were none of them backward to hear what had been said;
and all of them seriously promised, that they would talk
with their wives about it, and to do their endeavours to
persuade them to turn Christians.
The clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported what
answer they gave, but said nothing a good while; but,
at last, making his head, We that are Christ's servants,
says he, can go no surther than to exhort and instruct;
and when men comply, submit to the reproof, and pro-
mise what we alk, 'tis all we can do; we are bound to
accept their good words: but, believe me, sir, said he,
whatever you may have known of the lise of that man
you call William Atkins, I believe he is the only sincere
convert among them ; I take that man to be a true pe-
nitent; I won't despair of the rest; but that man is per-
fectly struck with the sense of his past lise; and I doubt
not, but when he comes to talk of religion to his wise, h^
will talk himself effectually into it; for attempting to.
teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves.
I knew a man, added he, who, having nothing but a sum-
mary notion of religion himself, and being wicked and
profligate, to the last degree, in his lise, made a thorough
resormation in himself, by labouring to convert a Jew:
and if that poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of
Jesus Christ to his wise, my lise for it, he talks himself
into a thorough convert, makes himself a penitent: and
who knows what may follow?
. Upon this discourse however, and their promising,
as above, to endeavour to persuade their wives to em-
brace Christianity, he married the other three couple;
but Will Atkins and his wise were not yet come in:
after this my clergyman, wailing awhile, was curious
so know where Atkins was gone; and turning to me,
says he, I intreac you, Sir, let us walk out of your
labyrinth here, and look; I dare say we shall sind this
poor man some where or other, talking seriously with
his wise, and teaching her already something of reli-
gion. I began to be of the same mind: so we went
out together; and I carried him a way which none

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
knew but myself, and where the trees were so thick set,
as that it was not easy to see through the thicket of
leaves, and sar harder to see in, than to fee out: when
coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins, and his
tawny savage wise, sitting under ihe shade of a bush, ve-
ry eager in discourse; I stopped short, till my clergyman
came up to me; and then, having shewed him where they
were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a good
while.
We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to
the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens; then down
to the earth, then out to the sea, then to himself, then to
her, to the woods, to the trees. Now, says my clergy-
man, you see my words are made good; the man preaches
to her; mark him, now he is telling her that our God
has made him, and her, ard th; heavens, the earth, the
sea, the woods, the trees, Sec. I believe he is, said I:
immediately we perceived Will Atkins start up upon his
seet, sell down upon his knees, and lift up both his
hands : we suppose he said something, but we could not
hear him; it was too sar for that: he did not continue
kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits down again
by his wife, and talks to her again. We perceived then
the woman very attentive; but whether she said any thing
or no, we could not tell. While the poor sellow was upon
his knees, I could see the tears run plentisully down
my clergyman's cheeks; and I could hardly forbear my-
self; but it was a great affliction to us both, that we were
lot near enough to hear any thing that passed between
them.
Well, however, we could come no nearer, for fear
jf disturbing them: so we resolved to see an end of
his piece of still conversation; and it spoke loud enough
o us, without the help of voice i he sat down again,
is I have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to
ler; and two or three times we could see him embrace
ær passionately; another time we saw him take out his
landkerchies, and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her
gain, with a kind of transport very unusual: and after
;veral of these things, we saw him on a sudden jump
p again, and lend her his hand to help her up, when
^mediately, leading her by the hand a step or two,

they both kneeled down together, and continued so about
two minutes.
My sriend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud,
St. Paul, St. Paul! behold he prayeth: I was afraid At-
kins would hear him; theresore I intreated him to with-
hold himself a while, that we might see an end of the
scene, which to me, I must consess, was the most assect-
ing, and yet the most agreeable, that ever I saw in my
Use. Well, he strove with himself, and contained him-*
self for a while, but was in such raptures of joy to think
that the poor heathen woman was become a christian,
that he was not able to contain himself; he wept several
times; then throwing up his hands, and crossing his
breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and by way
of giving God thanks for-so miraculous a testimony of
the success of our endeavours; some he spoke softly,
which I could not well hear; others audibly, some in La-
tin, some in French; then, two or three times the tears
of joy would interrupt him, that he could not speak at
all. But I begged that he would compose himself, and let
us more narrowly and sully observe what was besore us,
which he did for a time, and the scene was not ended
there yet: for, after the poor man and his wise were
risen again from their knees, we observed he stood talk-
ing still eagerly to her; and we observed by her mo-
tion that she was greatly assected with what he said, by
her frequent listing up her hands, laying her hand to
her breast,, and such other postures, as usually express
the greatest seriousness and attention: this continued
about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked
away too; so that we could see no more of them in that
situation.
I took this interval to talk with my clergyman; and
sirst, I told him, I was glad to see the particulars
we had both been witnesses to; that though 1 was hard
enough of belies in such cases, yet that I began to>
think that it was all very sincere here, both in the man :.nd
his wise, however ignorant they both might be; ard'I
hoped such a beginning would have yet a more happy
end; and who knows, said I, but these two may in
time, by instruction and example, work upon some
of the others! Some of them L said he, turning, quick
F 3 upon
upon me, ay, upon all of them ; depend upon it, if those
two savages (for he has been but little better, as you re-
late it) should embrace Jesus Christ, they will never leave
till they work upon all the rest; for true religion is na-
turally communicative ; and he that is once made a chris-
tian will never le-ave a pagan behind him, if he can help it.
I owned it wao'a most christian principle to think so, and
a testimony of a true zeal, as well as a generous heart in
him. But, my friend, said I, will you give me liberty to
start one difficulty here? I cannot tell how to object the
least thing against that assectionate concern, which you
shew for the turning the poor people from their paganism
to the christian religion. But how does this comfort
you, while these people are, in your account, out of the
pale of the Catholic church; without which you believe
there is no salvation; so that you esteem these but heretics
still; and foroiher reasons as effectually lost as the pagans
themselves?
To this he answered with abundance of candour, and
christian charity, thus; Sir, I am a Catholic of the
Roman church, and a priest of the order of St. Be-
nedict, and I embrace all the principles of the Roman
faith : but yet, if you will believe me, and this I do
not speak in compliment to you, or in respect to my
ajrcumstances, and your civilities; I say, nevertheless,'
[ tlo not look upon you, who call yourselves resormed,
.y-ithout some charity; I dare not say, though I know it
s our opinion in general; yet, 1 dare not say, that
/ou cannot be saved, will by no means limit the mercy
>f Christ, so sar as to think that he cannot receive you
nto the bosom of his church, in a manner to us im-
,erceivable, and which it is impossible, for us to know;
ind I hope you have the same charity for us: I pray
laily for your being all restored to Christ's church, by
vhatsoever methods he, who is all wise, is pleased to
lirect. In the mean time, sure, you will allow it to
onsist with me, as a Roman, to distinguish sar between
Protestant and a Pagan; between one that calls on
esus Christ, though in a way wich I do not think is
ccording to the true saith, and a savage, a barbarian,
bat knows no God, no Christ, np Redeemer at all;
nd if you are not within the pale of the Catolic
church,
church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it, than,
those that know nothing at all of God, or his church:
I rejoice, theresore, when I see this poor man, who, you
say, has been a profligate, and almost a murderer, kneel
down and pray to Jesus Christ, as we suppose he did,
though not fully enlightened; believing that God, from
whom every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his
heart, and bring him to the surther knowledge of the
truth in his own time; and if God shall influence this
poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage his
wise, I can never believe that he shall be cast away him-
self: and have I not reason then to rejoice, the nearec
any are brought to the knowledge of Christ, though they
may not be brought quite home into the bosom of the
Catholic church, just at the time when I may desire it:
leaving it to the goodness of Christ to persect his work-
in his own time, and his own way? Certainly I would
rejoice, if all the savages in America were brought, like
this poor woman, to pray to God, though they were to
be all Protestants at sirst, rather than they should continue
Pagans and Heathens; sirmly believing that he who had
bestowed that sirst light upon them, would rather illu*-
minate them with a beam of his heavenly grace, and
bring them into the pale of his church, when he should
see good.
I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
truly pious Papist, as much as I was oppressed by the
power of his reasoning: and it presently occurred to my
thoughts, that if such a temper was universal, we might
be all Catholic Christians, whatever church or particular
prosession we joined to, or joined in; that a spirit of charity
would soon work us all up into right principles; and, in
a word, as he thought that the like charity would make us
all Catholics: so I told him, I believed, had all the
members of his church the like moderation they would
soon be all Protestants: and there we lest that part; sot
we never disputed at all.
However, I talked to him another way, and, taking
him by the hand, my friend said I, I wish all the
clergy of the Roman church were blessed with such mo-
deration, and an equal share of your charity; I am en-
tirely of your opinion; but I must tell you, that if you
F 4 should
should preach such doctrine in Spain or Italy, they would
put you into the inquisition.
It may be so, said he, I know not what they might da
in Spain or Italy; but I will not say they would be the
better Christians for that severity; for I am sure there is
noiieresy in too much charity.
Well, as Will Atkins and his wise were gone, our
^business there was over: so we went back our own
way; and when we came back, we found them waiting
to be called in. Observing this, I asked my clergyman
if we should discover to him that we had seen him un-
der the bush, or no; and it was his opinion we should
not; but that we Ihould talk to him sirst, and hear what
be would say to us: so we called him in alone, nobody
being in the place but ourselves; and I began with him
thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what education had you?
What was your sather?
W. A. A better man than ever I shall be. Sir,, ray
ftiiher was a clergyman.
R. C. What education did he give you?
W. A. He would have taught me well, Sir; but I des-
pised al! education, instruction, or correction, like a
J^east as I was.
R. C. It is true, Solomon says, He that defpiseth re-
proof is brutisli.
W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutisli indeed ;I murdered my
sather; for Gcd's, sake Sir, talk no more about that, Sir;
J rnurdered my poor sather.
Friest. Ha! a murderer *!
* Here the Priest started (for I interpreted every
word as he spoke it) and looked pale: It seems
he believed that Will had really killed his own
sather.
R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand him so; Will
^tkins explain yourself; you did not kill your sather,
tJid you> w'tn )'our own hanQls?
W. A. No, Sir; 1 did not cut his throat; burl cut
the thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days;
j broke his heart by the most ungratesul, unnatural re-
turn
him sor the most tender asfectionate treatment that ever
sather gave, or child could receive.
R. C. Well, I did not ask you about your sather, to
extort this consession; I pray God give you repentance for
it, and forgive you that, and all your other sins; but I
asked you, because I see that though you have not much
learning, yet you are not so ignorant as some are, in things
that are good; that you have known more of religion a
great deal than you have practised..
J W. A. Though you, Sir, did notextort the con-session
that I make about my sather, conscience does; and when-
ever we come to look back upon our lives, the sins against
our indulgent parents are certainly the sirst that touch us;
the wounds they make ly deepest; and the weight they
leave will ly heaviest upon the mind, of all the sins we can,
commit..
R. C. You talk too seelingly and sensible for me,. At>
Kins; I cannot bear it:
W. You bear it, master! I dare say you know no-
thing of ir„
R. C. Yes, Atkins, every shore, every hill, nay, I may
say, every tree in this island is witness to the anguish of
my foul, for my ingratitude, and base usage of a good ten-
der sather; a sather much like your's, by your description;
and I murdered my sather as well.you, Will Atkins; bat
think, for all that,, my repentance is short of your's * too
by a great deal..
* I would have said more, is 1 could have restrained my
passions; but I thought this poor man's repentance
was so much sincerer than mine, that I was going
to leave off the discourse, and retire; for I was sur-
prised with whathesaid, and thought, that instead of
my going about to teach and instruct him, the man
was made a teacher and instructorto me, in a most
surprising and unexpected manner...
I laid all this besore the young clergyman, who wag
greatly affected with it, and said'to me, Did I not say,
i>ir, that when this man was converted,, he would preach
to us ? I tell you, Sir, if this one man be made a
true penitent, here will be no need of me, He will make
F5 Christians.

Christians of all in the island. But having a little composed
myself, 1 renewed my discourse with Will Atkins.
But, Will, said I, How comes the sense of this matterto
rouch just now?
W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has:
truck a dart through my very foul; I have been talking
ibout God and religion to my wise, in order, as you di-
rected me, to make a Christian of her; and she has
>reached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget while
live.
R, C. No, no; it is not your wise has preached to you ^
>ut when you were moving religious arguments to her,
:onscience has flung them back upon you.
W. A. Ay, Sir, with such a force as it is not to be
esisted,
R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between
rou and your wise;. for I know something of it al-
cady.
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give you a full account
>f Jt; I am too sull to hold it, and yet have no tongue
o express it; but let her have said what she will, and
hough I cannot give you an account of it, this I can
ell you of it, that I resolve to amend and resorm my
ise.. '.
R. G. But tell us some- of it.. How did you begin,
i for this has been an extraordinary case, that is
ertain; she has preached a sermon, iudeed, if she has
/rought this upon you.
W. A. Why, 1 sirst told her the nature of our laws
bout marriage, and what the reasons were that mert
nd women were obliged to enter into such compacts,
s it was neither in the power of one or other to break
aat otherwise order and justice could not be maintained,
nd men would run from their wives, and abandon their
hildren, mix consusedly with one another, and neither
imilies be kept entire, or inheritances be settled by a le-
al descent.
R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will. Could you make
it understand what you meant by inheritance and sami-
es? They knew no such a thing among the savages, but
arry any how, without any regard to relation, con-
nguinity, ot- family; brother, and sister; nay; as I

have been told, even the sather and daughter, and the son
and the mother.
W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinsormed; and my
wise assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor it;
perhaps for any surther relations, they may not be so exact
as we are; but she tells me they never touch one another
in the near relations you speak of.
R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?
W.A. She said she liked it very well, and it was much
better than in her country.
R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was?
W. A. Ay, ay, there began all ourdialogue. I aflced her
If she would be married to me our way? She asked me, .
What way that was? I told her marriage was appointed
of God; and here we had a strange talk together, indeed> .
as ever man and wise had, I believe.
N. B. This dialogue between W. Atkins and his wise,.
as I took it down in writing, just after he told it me> .
was as follows:
Wise. Appointed by your God 1 Why, have you a God;!
in your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in every country.. .
Wise. No your God in my country; my country have
the great old Benamuekee God.
W. A. Child, I am very unsit to shew you who God
is; God is in heaven, and made the heaven and the earth* .
arid all that in them is.
Wise. No makee de earth; no you God makee de
earth; no make my country *.
* W. A. laughed a little at her expression of God not,
making her country. _
Wise. No laugh: Why laugh me? This is no ting to
laugh +.
+ He was justly reproved by his wise; for she was more.
serious than he at sirst. .
W. A. .That's true indeed; I will not laugh any more^ •
my dear. ,
Wise. Why you say, you God make all?
W. A. Yes, child, our God made the whole world, .
and you, and me, and all things; for he is the only
V 6 true

true God; there is no God but he; he lives for ever in
heaven.
Wise. Why you no tell me long ago?
W. A. That's true indeed; but I have been a wicked
wretch, and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with
any thing besore, but have lived without God in the world,
myself.
Wise. What,haveyoudegreatGadinyoucountry,you
no know him? No say O to him? Na do goad ting for
him? That no impossible!
W.. A.. It is too true though for all that : we live as if
there was no God in heaven-, or that he had no power on
earth.
Wise. But why God let you do so? Why he no makee
you good live?
W.. A. It is all our own sault?
Wise. But you say me, he is great, much great, have
much great power; can make kill when he will; why he
no makee kill when you no serye him? No-fay O to him?
JJo be good mans ?,
W. A.. That is- true; he might strike me dead, and!
ought to expect it; for I have been a wicked wretch, that.
fa true: but God is mercisul, and does not deal with us as
fve deserve.
Wise. But then, do not you tell God tankee for that
fOCH
W. A. No, indeed: I have noMhanked God for hi»
xnercy, any more than I have seared God for his
power.
Wise. Then you God no God; me no think, believe
fie be such one, great much power, strong; no makee
kill you, though you makee him much angry.
W. A. What! will my wicked lise hinder you from
Relieving in God ! What a dreadsul creature am I? And
^trhat a sad truth is it that the horrid lives of Christians.
Jjjnder the conversation of Heathens..
Wise. How me tink you have great much God + up
there, and yet no da well, no do good ting? Can he tell?
Sure he no tell what you do.
t She points up to heaven.
W.A>
W. A. Yes, yes, he knows and sees all things; he hear*,
us speak, sees what we do, knows what we think, though
we• do not speak.
W ise. What!'he no hear you swearj curse, speak the
great damn.
W. A. Yes, yes, he hears it all.
Wise. Where be then the muchee great powej
strong?
W. A. He is mercisul; that is all we can say for it;
and this proves him to be the true God; he is God, and
not man; and theresore we are not consumed +.
+ Here Will Atkins told us, he was struck with horror,
to think how he could tell his wise so clearly, that
God sees, and hears, and knows the secret thoughts
of the heart, and all that we do; and yet that he
had dared to do all the vile things he had done.
Wise. Mercisul! what you call dat
W. A. He is our sather and maker; and lie pities and
spares us.
Wise. So then he never makee kill, never angry whew
you do wicked; then he no good himself, or no great
able.
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear; he is insinitely good, and'
insinitely great, and able to punish too; and sometimes,
to shew his justice and vengeance, he lets fly his anger to
destroy sinners, and makes examples ; many are cut off in
their sins.
Wise. But no makee kill you yet; then he tell you, may
be, that he no makee you kill, so you make de bargain with
him, you do bad ting, he no be angry at you, when he be
angry at other mans.
W. A. No, indeed, my sins are all presumptions upon
his goodness;. and he would be insinitely just, if he de-
stroyed me, as he has done other men..
Wise. Well, and yet no kill, no makee you dead!
What you say to him for that? You no tell him tankea
for all that too!
W. A. I am an unthankful, ungrateful dog, that is.
ttac
Wife.
Wise. Why he no makee you much good better? You
say he makee you.
W. A. He made me as he made all the world; 'tis I
have desormed myself, and abused his goodness, and have
made myself an abominable wretch.
Wise. I wish you makee God know me; I no makee
him angry; I no do bad wicked ting.
Here Will Atkins said his heart funk within him, to
hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to
know God; and he such a wicked wretch, that he
could not say one word to her about God, but what
the reproach of his own carriage would make most
irrational to her to believe; nay, that already she
could not believe in God, because he was so wicked
was not destroyed.
W. A. My dear, you mean you wish I could teach you
to know God, not God to know you; for he knows you
already, and every thought in your heart.
Wise. Why then he know what I say to you now; ha
jcnow me wish to know him: how shall me know who
jiiakee me?
W. A. Poor creature, he must teach thee; I cannot
teach thee; I'll pray to him to teach thee to know him;
and to forgive me, that I am unworthy to teach thee.
The poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring
him to make her know God, and her wishing to know
him, that, he said, he sell down on his knees besore
her, and prayed to God to enlighten her mind with
the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, and to pardon
his sins, and accept.of his being the unworthy instru-.
ment of instructing her in' the principles of religion;
after which he sat down by her again; and their,
dialogue went on.
js. B. This was the time when we saw him kneel down"
and lift up his hands.
Wise,
Wise. What you put down the knee for ? What you
hold up the hand for? What you say? Who you speak,
to? What is that?
W. A. My dear, I bow my knees in token of my sub-.
mission to him that made me: I said O to him, as you
call it, and as you say, your old men do to their idol Be-
namuckee; that is, I prayed to him.
Wise. What you.say O to him for?
W. A. I prayed to him to open your eyes and your
understanding, that you may know him, and be accepted
by him.
Wise. Can he do that too?
W. A. Yes, he can; he can do all things.
Wise. But he no hear what you say?
W. A. Yes, he has bid us pray to him; and promised.
t» h 'ar us.
Wise. Bid you pray? When he bid you? How he bid
you ? What you hear him speak?'
W. A. No, we do not hear him speak; but he has re-
vealed himself many ways to us.
Here he was at a great loss to make her understand-
that God had revealed himself to us by his word;
and what his word was: but at last he told it her.
thus:
W. A.. God has spoken to some good-men in former
days, even from heaven, by plain words; and God has in-
spired good men, by his spirit; and they have written all
his laws down in a book. ,
Wise. Me no understand that : where is book?'
W. A. Alas! my poor creature, I have not this book;
but, I hope, I shall, one time or other, get it for you to
lead it..
Here he embraced her with great assection; but with
inexpressible gries, that he had not a Bible.
Wise. But how you makee me know, that God teachee
them to write that book?
W. A. By the same rule that we know him to be God.

Here the poor man said he could forbear no longer;
but, raising her up, made her kneel by him; and he prayed
to God aloud, to instruct herin the knowledge of himself,,
by his spirit;, and that by some good Providence, if pos-
sible, she might some time or other come to have a bible,
that she might read the word of God, and be taught by
him to know him..
This was the time that we saw him list her up by tha;
hand, and saw him kneel down by her, as above.
They had several other discourfas it seems, after-
this, too long to set down here;, and particularly she
made him promise, that since he consessed his own
Jise had been a.wicked, abominable coarseof provoca-
tion against God, that Ire would resorm it, and not make
God angry any more, kst he-should make him dead, as
she called it,.and then she should be left alone, and never
be taught to know this God better; and lest he should be
miserable, as he had told her wicked men should be astet,
deaths
This was a strange account, aod very assecting to us
both, but particularly to the young clergyman: he was
indeed wondersully surprised with it; but under the
greatest affliction imaginable, that he could not talk to
her; that he could not speak English to make her under-
hand him; and as she spoke but very broken Eng

lish, he could not understand her. However, he turned him-
self to me, and told me, that he believed there must be
more to do with this woman than to marry her. I did not
understand him at sirst, but at length he explained himself;
viz. That she ought to be baptized.
I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for
going about it presently: No, no; hold, Sir, said he,
though I would have her baptized by all means, yet I
must observe that Will Atkins, her husband, has, in-
deed, brought her in a wondersul manner to be willing
to embract a religious lise; and has given her just ideas
of the being of a God, of his power, justice, and mercy;
yet I desire to know of him, if he has said any thing to
her of Jesus Christ, and of the salvation of sinners; of the
nature of saith in him, and the redemption by him; of
the holy spirit, the resurrection, the last judgment, and
a suture state.
I called Will Atkins again, and aisked him; but the
Eoor sellow sell immediately into tears, and told us,
e had said something to her of all those things, but
'that he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own
conscience so reproached him with his horrid ungodly
lise, that he trembled at the apprehensions, that he»
knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should
give to those things, and make her rather contemn reli-
gion, than receive it: but he was assured, he said, that
her mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all
those things, that if I would but discourse with her, she
would make it appear to my satissaction, that my labour
would not be lost upon her.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as in-
terpreter between my religious priest and the woman, I
intreated him to begin with her: but sure such a sermon:
was never preached by a Popish priest in these latter ages
of the world; and, as I told him, I thought he had all the
zeal, all the knowledge, all the sincerity of a Christian,
without the errors of a Roman Catholic ;. and that I took
him ft> be such a clergyman as the Roman bishops were.,
besore the church of Rome assumed spiritual sovereignty/
over the consciences of men.
In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace
the knowledge of Christ, and of redemption byjiim,
BOS'
not with wonder and astonishment only, as she did the
sirst notions of a God, but with joy and saith, witli an
assection, and a surprising degree of understanding, scarce
to be imagined, much less to be expressed; and at her own
request she was baptized.
When he was preparing to baptize her, I intreated him,
that he would persorm that ossice with some cautir>ni
that the man might not perceive he was of the Roman
church, if possible; because of other ill consequences
which might attend a difference among us in that very
religion which we were instructing the other in. He
told me, that as he had no consecrated chapel, nor pro-
per things for the ossice, I should see he would do it in a
manner, that I should not know by it, that he was a Ro-
man Catholic myself, if I had not known it besore: and
so he did; for saying only some words over to himself in
latin, which I could not understand, he poured a who!*
dish sull of water upon the woman's head, pronouncing
in French very loud, Marv; which was the name her
husband desired me to give her, for I was her godsather,
I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost; so that none couM' know any
thing by it, what religion he was of: he gave the bene-
diction afterwards in Latin; but either Will Atkins did
not know but it was in French, or else did not. take notice
of it ai that time.
As soon as this was over, he married them; and after
the marriage was over, he turned himself to Will Atkins,
and in a very asfectionate manner exhorted him, not only
to persevere in that good disposition he was in, but ta
support the convictions that were upon him, by a resolu-
tion to resorm his lise; told him, it was in vain to say he
j-epented, if he did not forsake his crimes; represented-
to him* how God had honoured him with being
the instrument of bringing his wise to the knowledge
of the Christian religion; and that he should be care-
ful he did not dishonour the grgce of God;, and that,
if he did, he would see the Heathen a better Christian
than himself; the savage converted, and the instrument
cast away.
He said a. great many good things to them both, and
then recommended them, in a few word*, to God's

goodness, gave them the benediction again, 1 repeating
every thing to them in English: And thus ended the cere-
mony. I think it was the most pleasant, agreeable day to
me that ever I passed in my whole lise. .
But my clergyman had not done yet; his thoughts hung
continually upon the conversion of the 37 savages; and
sain he would have staid upon the island to have under-
taken it; but I convinced him, First, that his undertaking-
was impracticable in itself; and 2dly, that, perhaps, I
could put it into a way of being done, in his absence, to
his satissaction; of which by and by.l
Having thus brought the affair of the island to a nar-
row compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, .
when the young man, whom I~liad taken out of the
samished ship's company, came to me, and told me, he
understood I had a clergyman with me; and that I had
caused the Englishmen to be married to the savages, whom
they called wives; that he had a match too, which he
desired might be sinished besore I went, between two
Christians; which he hoped would not be disagreeable to
me.
I knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother's servant, for there was no other Christian wo-
man on the island; so I began to persuade him not to do
any thing of that kind rashly, or because he found him-
self in this solitary circumstance: I represented, that he
had some considerable substance in the world, and good
friends, as I understood by himself, and by his maid
also; that the maid was not only poor, and a servant,
but was unequal to him, she being 26 or 27 years old ;•
and he not above 17 or 18; that he might, very pro-
bably with my assistance, make a removal from this
wilderness, and come into his own country again; and
that then it wou'.d be a thousand to one but he would
repent his choice; and the dislike of that circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to say
more; but he interrupted me, smiling; and told me,
with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my
guesses; that he had nothing of thatkind in his thoughts,
nis present circumstances being melancholy and discon-
folate enough; and he was very glad to hear, that I had
thoughts of putting them in a way to see their own.

country again; and that nothing should have set him upon
staying there, but that the voyage I was going was- so ex-
ceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite
out of the reach of all his friends; that he had nothing to
desire of me, but that I would settle him in some little
property in the island where he was; give him a servant
or two, and some sew necessaries, and he would settle
himself here like a planter, waiting the good time when,
if ever I returned to England, I would redeem him, and
hoped I would not be unmindsul of him when I came to
England; that he would give me some letters to hjs friend*
in London, to let them know how good I had been to him,
and what part of the worlds and what circumstances I had
lest him in: and hepriraised me, that whenever I redeem-
ed him, the plantation, and allthe improvements he had
made upon it, let the value be what it would, should he
w holly mine.
His discourse was very prettily delivered,, considering
his youth; and was the rcore agreeable to me, because
he told me positively the match was not for himself. I
gave him all possible assurances, that if I lived to come
sase to England, I would deliver his letters, and do his
business esfectually; and that he might depend I would
never forget the circumstances I lest him in; but still I
w as impatient to know who was the person to be married:
Upon which he told me, it was my Jack of all Trades,,
and his maid Susan.
I was most agreeably surprised when he named the-
match; for, indeed, I had thought it very suitable-
The character of that man I have given already; and
is for the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober,
md religious young woman; had a very good share of,

The match being proposed in this manner, we mar-
ried them the same day; and, as I was sather at the
altar, as I may say, and gave her away, so I gave her
a portion; for I appointed her and her husband a hand-
some large space of ground for their plantation; and,
indeed, this match, and the proposal the young gentle-
man made to me, to give him a small property in the
iiland, put me upon parcelling it out among them, that
they might not quarrel afterwards about their situation.
This sharing out the land to them I lest to Will At-
kins, who, indeed was now grown a most sober, grave,
managing fellow; persectly resormed, exceeding pious
and religious ; and, as sar as I may be allowed to speak
positively in such a case, I verily believe, was a true,
sincere penitent.
He divided things so justly, and so much to every
one's satissaction, tr.at they only desired one general
writing under my hand for the whole; which I caused
to be drawn up, and signed and sealed to them, setting
out the bounds and situation of every man's planta-
tion, and testifying, that I gave them thereby, severally, a
right to the whole possession and inheritance of the respec-
tive plantation or sarms, with their improvements, to them
and their heirs; reserving all the rest of the lsland as my
own property, and a certain rent for every particular plan-
tation, after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in
my name, came to demand it, -producing an attested copy
of the same writing.
As to the government and laws among them, I told
them, I was not capable of giving them better rules
than they were able to give themselves; only made
them promise me, to live in love and good neighbour-
hood with one another: And so I prepared to leave
them.
One thing I must not omit; and that is, that being
'bow settled in a kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in hand, it was but
odd to have seven and thirty Indians live in a nook of
the island, independent, and, indeed, unemployed; for,
excepting the providing themselves food, which they had
dissiculty enough in sometimes, they had no man-
ner of business or property to manage: I proposed th^r -
fore to the governor Spaniard, that he should go to them
with Friday's sather, and propose to them to remove, and
either plant for themselves, or take them into their several
samilies as servants, to be maintained for their laboiir,
but without being absolute slaves; for I would not admit
them to make them slaves by force, by any means, because
they had their liberty given by capitulation, and, as it
,were, articles of surrender, which they ought not to
break.
They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came
all very cheersully along with him; so we allotted them
land, and plantations, which three or four accepted of,
but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the
several samilies we had settled; and thus my colony was
in a manner settled, as follows: the Spaniards possessed
my original habitation, which was the capital city, and
extended their plantation all along the side of the brook,
which made the creek, that I have so often described, as
sar as my bower; and as they increased their culture,
it went always eastward ; -the English lived in the north-
east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades began,
and came on southward, and south-west, towards the
.back part of the Spaniards; and every plantation had a
treat addition of land to take in, if they found occa-
on; so that they need not jostle one another for want of
*oom.
All the west end of the island was lest uninhabited,
that if any of the savages should come on shore there, only

j < ;if they disturbed nobody, nobcdywould disturb them;
jnd no doubt but they were often astiore, and went away
again; for I never heard that the planters were ever attack-
ed and disturbed any more.
It now came into my thoughts, that I had hinted to
my friend, the clergyman, that the work of converting
the savages might, perhaps, be set on foot in his ab-
sence, to his satissaction: and I told him, that now I
thought it was put in a sair way; for the savages being
thus divided among the Christians, if they would but
every one of them do their part with those which came
under their hands, 1 hoped it might have a very good
essect.
He
He agreed presently in that, if, said he, they will do
tlieir part; but how, says he, shall we obtain that of
them ? I told him, we would call them all together,
and leave it in charge with them, or go to them one
by one, which he thought best; so we divided it; he
to speak to the Spaniards, who were all papists; and I
to the English, who were all protestants; and we recom-
mended it earnestly to them, and made them promise,
that they would never make any distinction of papist
•or protestant, in their exhorting the savages to turn
Christians; but teach them the general knowledge of
ithe true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ ; and
they likewise promised us, that they would never have
any disserences or disputes, one with another, about re-
ligion.
When I came to Will Atkins' house (I may call it so,
for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work, I be-
lieve was not standing in the world again!) I say, when
I came thiiher, I found the young woman I have men-
tioned above, and William Atkins's wise, were become
-intimates; and this prudent, religious, young woman,
had persected the work Will Atkins had begun; and
though it was not above four days afteT what I have
related, yet the new-baptized savage woman was made
such a Christian, as I have seldom heard of any like
her, in all my observation, or conversation, in the
world.
It came next in my mind, in the morning, besore I
went to -them, that among all the needsul things I had
to leave with them, I had not lest a bible; in which I
shewed myself less considering for them, than my good
friend the widow was for me, when she sent me the
cargoes tool, from Lisbon, where she packed up three
bibles and a prayer-book. However, the good woman's
charity had a greater extent than ever (be imagined;
for they were reserved for the comfort and instruction
of those tl at made much better use of them than I had
done.
I took one of the bibles in my pocket, and when
I came to William Atkins's tent, or house, I found
the young woman, and Atkins's baptized wise, had
been discoursing of religion together; (for William At-
kint
Ron ss
ins told it me, with a great deal of joy) I aiked, if
ley were together now ? and he said, yes; so I went
lto the house, and he with me, and we found them
>gether very earnest in discourse: O, sir, says William
itkins, when God has sinners to reconcile to himself,
nd aliens to bring home, he never wants a messeu-
er i My wise has got a new instructor; I knew I
as unworthy, as I was uncapable of that work; that
oung woman has been sent hither from Heaven; she
; enough to convert a whole island of savages. The
oung woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but
desired her to sit still; I told her she had a good work
pon her hands, and I hoped God would bless her in
We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had
ny book among them, though I did not alk; but I put
ly hand in my pocket, and gulled out my bible: Here,
aid I to Atkins, I have brought you an assistant, that,
erliaps, you had not besore. The man was so con-
aunded, that he was not able to speak for some time;
ut, recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands,
nd, turning to his wise; here, my dear, says he,
id not I tell you, our God, though he lives above,
ould hear what we said? Here is the book I prayed
ar, when you and I kneeled down under the bust};
ow God has heard us and sent it. When he had said
hus, the man sell into such transports of a passionate
ay, that between the joy of having it, and giving God
hanks for it, the tears ran down his sace like a child
hat was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was like to have
un into a mistake, that none of us were aware of;
ar she sirmly believed God had sent the book upon her
ulband's petition: It is true, that providentially it
,-as so, and might be taken so in a consequent sense-;
^t I believed it would have been no difficult matter, at
hat time, to have persuaded the poor woman to have
elieved that an express messenger came from Heaven,
n .purpose to bring that individual book; but it was
x> serious a matter to suffer any delusion to take
lace: .So I turned to the young woman, and told

rert, in her sirst, and more ignorant understanding of
things; and begged her to explain to her, that God
may be properly said to answer our petitions, when,
in the course of his Providence, such things are, in a
particular manner, brought to pass, as we petitioned for;
but we do not expect returns from heaven, in amiraculous
and particular manner; and that it is pur mercy it is not
so.
This the young woman did afterwards effectually; so
that there was, I assure you, no priestcraft used here : and
I should have thought it one of the most unjustisiable
frauds in the world, to have had it so; but the surprise
of joy upon Will Atkins is really not to be expressed;
and there, we may' be sure, was no delusion: sure no
man was ever more thanksul in the world for anything
of its kind, than he was for this bible; and, I believe,
never any man was glad of a bible from a better prin-
ciple ; and though he had been a most profligate creature,
desperate, headstrong, outrageous, surious, and wicked
to a great degree; yet this man is a standing rule to us
all, .sor the well instructing children; viz. that parents
,should never give over to teach and instruct, or ever
despair of the success of their endeavours, let the chil-
dren be ever so obstinate, resractory, or, to appearance,
insensible of instruction; for, if ever God in his Provi-
dence touches the consciences of such, the force of their
education returns upon them, and the early instruction of
parents is not lost, though k may have been many years
laid asleep; but, some time or other, they may sind the
benesit of it.
Thus it was with this poor man, however ignorant he
was, or divested of religion and Christian knowledge.
He found he had some to do with now more ignorant than
himself; and that the least part of the instruction of his
good sather, that could now come to his mind, was of use
to him.
Among ther.st, it occurred to him, he said, how his
father used to insist much upon the inexpressible value
of the bible; the privilege and blessing of it to nations,
senvlies, and persons; but he never entertained the least
notion of the worth of it till now; when, being to talk to
Vol. II. G heathens,
heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted the help of
the written oracle for his assistance.
The young woman was very glad of it also, for the pre-
sent occasion, though she had one; and so had youth on
board our ship, among the goods, which were not yet
brought on more. And now, having said so many things
of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one story more
of her and myself, which has something in it very insorm-
ing and remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the poor young wo-
man was reduced; how her mistress was starved to death,
and did die, on board that unhappy ship we met at sea;
and how the whole ship's company being reduced to the
last extremity, the gentlewoman and her son, and this
maid, were sirst hardly used, as to provisions; and, at lad,
totally neglected and starved; that is to say, brought to
the last extremity of hunger.
One day, being discoursing with her upon the extremi-
ties they suffered, I alked her.if she could describe, bywhat
she selt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared? She
told me, she believed she could; and she told her tale very
distinctly thus:
First, Sir, says she, we had for some days fared ex-
ceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger; but now,
at last, we were wholly without food of any kind, ex-
cept sugar, a little wine, and a little water. The
sirst day after I had received no food at all, I found
myself, towards evening, sirst empty and sickish at my
stomach; and, nearer night, mightily inclined to yawn-
ing, and sleepy; I laid down on a couch, in the great
cabin, to sleep; and slept about three hours, and
awaked a little resreshed, having taken a glass of wine
when I lay down; after being about three hours awake,
it being about sive o'clock in the morning, I found my-
self empty, and my stomach sickish again, and laid down
again ; but could not sleep at all, being very saint and
ill; and thus I continued all the second day, with a
strange variety, sirst hungry, then sick again, with
Teachings to vomit; the second night, being obliged to
go to bed again, without any food more than a draught
of sair water, and, being asleep, I dreamed I was at
Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily stocked
with
with provisions; that I bought some for my mistress, and
went and dined very heartily.
I thought my stomach was sull after this, as it would
have been after, or at, a good dinner; but when I waked,
I was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to sind myself in the
•xtremity of samine: the glass of wine we had, I drank,
and put sugar into it, because of its having some spirit
to supply nourishment; but there being no substance
in the stomach for the digesting ossice to work upon, I
found the only essect of the wine was, to raise disagree-
able sumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay, as
they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some
time.
The third day iivthe morning, after a night of strange
and consused inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than
sleeping, I awaked, ravenous and surious with hunger;
and I question, had not my understanding returned, and
conquered it, I say, I question whether if I had been a
mother, and had a little child with me, its lise would have
been sase, or no.
This lasted about three hours; during which time I
was twice raging mr.d, as any creature in Bedlam, as
my young master told me, and as he can now insorm
you.
In one of these sits of lunacy, or distraction, whether
by the motion of the ship, or some slip of my foot, I
know not; I sell down, and struck my sace against the
corner of a pallet-bed, in which my mistress lay; and
with the blow, the blood gushed out of my nose; and
the cabin-boy bringing me a little bason, I sat down, and
bled into it a great deal; and as the blood ran from me,
I came to myself; and the violence of the slame, or the
sever I was in, abated, and so did the ravenous part of
the hunger.
Then I grew sick, and reached to vomit, but could
not; for I had nothing in my stomach to bring up:
after I had bled feme time, I swooned, and they all
believed I wss dead; but I came to myself soon after,
and then had a most dr«adsul pain in my stomach, not
to be described; not like the cholic, but a gnawing
eager pain for food; and, towards night, it went off
with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food •
G 2 some-

bmething like, as I suppose, the longing of a woman
vith child. I took another draught of water with lu-
rar in it, but my stomach loathed the sugar, and brought
t all up again: then I took a draught of water without su-
rar, and that stayed with me; and laid me down upon the
5ed, praying most heartily, that it would please God to
ake me away; and composing my mind in hopes os it, 1
lumbered awhile; and then waking, thought mylelt dy-
ne, being light with vapours from an empty stomach, l
ecommended my soul to God, and earnestly wished that
omebody would throw me into the sea.

Se obliged him to eat it; and, I believe, it saved fan

no comfort, but in the hope that I should die besore
morning..
All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was now
turned into a disease; and I had a terrible cholic and grip-
ing; wind, instead of food, having found its way into the
bowels; and in-this condition I lay till morning, when I
was surprised a little with the cries and lamentations of my
young master, who called out to me, that his mother was
dead, I lifted myself up a little, for I had not strength to
rise,, but found she was not dead, though she was. able to
give very little signs of lise.
I had then such convulsions in my stomach, sot want
of some sustenance, that I cannot describe them; with
such frequent throes and pangs of appetite, that no-
thing but the tortures of death can imitate: and this
condition I was in, when I heard the seamen above cry
our, A, sail, a sail! and halloo and jump about as if they
were distracted.
I was not able to get osf from the bed, and my mi£.
tress much less; and my master was so sick, that I
thought he had been expiring; so we could not open the
cabin-door, or get any account what it was that occa-
sioned such a combustion; nor had we any conversation
with the ship's company for two days, they having told
us they had not a mouthsul of any thing to eat in the
ship i and they told us afterwards, they thought we had
been dead.
It was this dreadsul condition we were in, when you
were sent to save our lives: and how you found us, Sir,
you know as well as I, and better too.
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct ac-
count of starving to death, as, I consess, I never met
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me : I am the
rather apt to believe it to be a true account, because the
youth gave me an account of a good part of it; though.
I must own not so distinct, and lo seelingly, as his
maid; and the rather, because, it seems, his mother
fed him at the price of her own lise: but the poor
maid, though her constitution being stronger than that
of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly woman,
too, she might struggle harder with it: I say, the poor
maid might be supposed to seel the extremity something
G 3 sooner
sooner than her mistress, who might be allowed to keep
the last bits something longer than me parted with any
to relieve the maid. No question, as the case is here
related, if our ship, or some other, had not so providen-
tially met them, a sew days more would have ended all
their lives, unless they had prevented it by eating one
another; and even that, as their case stood, would have
served them but a little while, they being 500 leagues
from any land; or any possibility of relief, other than
in the miraculous manner it happened :• but this is by the
way. I return to my disposition of things among the
people.
And sirst, it is to be observed here, that, for many
reasons I did not think sit to let them know any tiling
of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought of setting
up among them; for I found, at least, at my sirst coming,
such seeds of division among them, that I saw it plainly,
had I set up the sloop, and lest it among them, they
would, upon very light disgust, have separated, and gone
away from one another; or perhaps, have turned pirates,
and so made the island a den of thieves, instead of a
plantation of sober and religious people, as I intended
it to be; nor did I leave the two pieces of brass cannon
that I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns, that
my nephew took extraordinary, for the same reason: I
thought they had enough to qualify them for a desensive
war against any that should invade them; but I was not
to set them up for an ossensive war, or to encourage them
ro go abroad to attack others, which, in the end, would
only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and all
their undertakings: I reserved the sloop, theresore, and
the guns, for their service another way, as I shall observe
in its place.
I have now done with the island: I lest them all in
good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition, and
went on board my ship again the sifth day of May, hav-
ing been sive and twenty days among them; and, as
they were all resolved to stay upon the island till I came
to remove them, I promised to send some surther relief
from the Brasils, if I could possibly sind an opportunity;
and particularly, I promised to send them some cattle;
such as sheep, hogs, and cows; for, as to the two
cows
cows and calves, which I brought from England, we had
been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill them at
sea, for want of hay to seed them.
The next day, giving them a salute of sive guns at
parting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints,
in the Brasils, in about 22 days; meeting nothing remark-
able in our passage, but this, that about three days asterwe
sailed, being becalmed, and the current setting strong to
the N. N. E. running, as it were, into a bay or gulph, on
the land-side, we were driven something out of our course;
and once or twice our men cried, Land, to the westward;
but whether it was the continent or islands, we could not
tell by any means.
But the third day, towards evening, the sea smooth,
and the weather calm, we saw the sea, as it were, co-
vered, towards the land, with something very black,
not being able to disaover what it was; but, after some
time, our chies mate going up the main shrouds a little
way, and looking at them with a perspective, cried out,
it was an army. I could not imagine what he meant
by an army, and spoke a little hastily, calling the sellow
a fool, or some such word: Nay, Sir, says he, don't be
angry, for it is an army, and a fleet too; for I believe
there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle
along, and they are a coming towards us too, apace, and
sull of men.
I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my
nephew the captain; for he had heard such terrible stories
of them in the island, and having never been in those seas
besore, that he could not tell what to think of it, but said
two or three times we should all be devoured. I must con-
sess, considering we were becalmed, and the current set
strong towards the shore, I liked it the worse: however,
I bade him not be afraid, but bring the ship to an anchor,
as soon as we came so near as to know that we must engage
them.
The weather continued calm, and they came on apace
towards us; so Igave orders to come to an anchor, and
surl all our sails. As for the savages, I told them, they
had nothing to sear from them but sire; and theresore
they should get their boats out, and sasten them, one
close by the head, and the other, by the stern, and man
G 4 them
them both well, and wait the issue in that posture:
this I did, that the men in the boats might be ready,
with sheet and buckets, to put out any sire these sa-
vages might endeavour to six upon the outside of the
sliip.
in this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while
they came up with us, but never was such a horrid sight
seen by Christians: my mate was much mistaken in his
calculation of their number, I mean of a thousand canoes;
the most we could make of them, when they came up, being
about r 26; and a great many of them too; for some of
them had sixteen or seventeen men in them, some more,
and the least six or seven.
When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck
with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which they
had, doubtless, never seen besore; nor could they, at
first, as we afterwards understood, know what to make of
us. They came boldly up however; very near to us, and
seemed to go about to row round us; but we called to our
*nen in the boats, not to let them come too near them.
This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for sive or six of their
large canoes came so near our long-boat, that our men
beckoned with their hands to them to keep back; which
they understood very well, and went back; Lut at their
retreat about coo arrows came on board us from those
boats; and one of our men in the long-boat was very much
wounded.
However, 1 called to them not to sire by any means ; but
we handed down some deal-boards into the boat, and the
carpenter presently set up a kind of a sence, like w.-ste
boards, to cover them from the arrows of the savages, it
they should shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards .they came all up in a
body a-stern of us, and pretty near, so near that we could
easily discern what they were, though we could not tell
their design. I easily found they were some of my old
friends, the same fort of savages that I had been used
to engage with ; and in a little time more they rowed
somewhat sarther out to sea, till they came directly
broadside with us, and then rowed down strait upon us,
till they came so near, that they could kar us speak:
upotv
upon this I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they
should shoot any more arrows, and make all our guns
ready; but, being so near as to he within hearing, I
made Friday go out upon the decki and call out aloud
to them in his language, to.know what they meant;
which accordingly he did: whether they understood
him or not, that I knew not;,but as soon as he had
called to them, six of them, who were in the foremost,
or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us; and,
stooping down, shewed us their naked backsides; just
as it, in English, (saving your presence) they had bid us
kiss ;whether this was a dssiance or chal-
lenge, we knew not; or whether it was done in mere con-
tempt, or a signal to the rest; but immediately Friday
cried out, They were a going to shoot; and unhappily
for him .(poor sellow) they let fly about 300 of their ar-
rows; and, to my inexpressible gries, killed poor Fri-
day, no other mart being in their sight. The poor sel-
low was shot with no less than three arrows, and about
three more sell very nigh him -r such unlucky marksmen
they were.
I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant, the
companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that I
immediately ordered sive guns to be loaded with small
shot, and four with great; and gave them such a broad-
side as they had never had in their lives besore to be
sure.
They were not above half a cable's length off when we
sired; and our gunners took their aim so well, that three
or four of their canoes were overset, as we had reason to
believe, by one shot only.
The ill manners of turning up their bare backsides
to us, gave us no great offence; neither did I know for
certain whether that, which would pass for. the greatest
contempt among us, might be understood so by them
or not; theresore, in return, I had only resolved to have
sired four or sive guns with powder only, which I knew
would fright them sussiciently: but when they shot at us
directly with all the sury they were capable of, and
especially as they had killed my poor Friday, whom I so
entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, so well de-
served it; I not only had been justisied before God and
G 5 nun,
ra* AND APVENTDRES OF
rnan, bnt would have been very glad, if I could, to have
•verset every canoe there, and drowned every one of
them.
I can neither tell how many we killed, or how many
we wounded, at this broadside; but sure such a fright and
hurry was never seen among such a multitude; there were
j 3 or 14 of their canoes split, and overset, in all; and the
men all set a swimming; the rest, frighted out of their
wits, scoured away as fast as they could, taking but little
care tosave those whose boats were split or spoiled with our
shot: so I suppose that there were many of them lost; and
our men took up one poor sellow swimming for his life,
above an hour after they were all gone.
Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and
•wound a great many: but, in short, we never knew any
thing how it went with them; for they fled so sast, that,
in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not see above
three or four straggling canoes; nor did we ever fee
the rest any more: for a breeze of wind springing
up the same evening, we weighed and set sail for the
We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so sul-
len, that he would neither eat or soeak; and we all sancied
he would starve himself to death: but I took a way to cure
him; for I made them take him, and turn him into the
Jong-boat, and make him believe they would toss him into
the sea again, and so leave him where they found him, if
he would not speak; nor would that do, but they really
did throw him into the sea, and came away from him;
and then he followed them, for he swam like a cork, and
called to them in his tongue, tho' they knew not one word
of what he said. However, at last they took him in again,
and then he began to be more tractable; nor did 1 ever
design they should drown him.
We were now under sail again; but I was the most
disconsolate creature alive for want of my man Friday,
and would have been very glad to have gone back to
the island, to have taken one of the rest from thence
for my occasion, but it could not be; so we went on:
we had one prisoner, as 1 have said; and it was a long
while besore we could make him understand any thing;
but,
but, in time, our men taught him some English, and he
began to be a little tractable: afterwards we enquired
what country he came from, but could make nothing
of what he said; for his speech was so odd, all guttu-
rals, and spoken in the throat, in such an hollow and
odd manner, that we could never form a word from
him ; and we were all of opinion that they might speak
that language as well, if they were gagged, as other-
wise; ror could we perceive that they had any occa-
sion either for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate; but formed
their words just as a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an
open throat: he told us however, some time after,
when we had taught him to speak a little English,
that they were going, with their kings, to sight a
great battle. When he said kings, we asked him how
many kings? He said, there were sive nation (we could
not make him understand the plural S.), and that they all
joined to go against two nation. We asked him, What
made them come up to us? He said, to makee te great
wonder look: where it is to be observed, that all those
natives, as also those of Africa, when they learn English,
they always add two E's at the end of the words where we
use one, and place the accent upon the last of them; as
makee, takee, and the like; and we could not break him
of it; nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it osf,
though at last he did.
And now I name the poor sellow once more, I
must take my last leave of him ; poor honest Friday!
We buried him with all decency and solemnity possi-
ble, by patting him into a coffin, and throwing him
into the sea; and I caused them to sire eleven guns for
him; and so ended the lise of the most gratesul, saith-
sul, honest, and most assectionate servant that ever man
had.
We now went away with a sair wind for Brasil,
and, in about twelve days time, we made land in the
latitude of sive degrees south of the line, being the
north-easternmost land of all that part of America.
We kept on S. by E. in sight of the shore, four days,
when we made the Cape St. Augustine, and in three days
came to an anchor osf the bay of All Saints, the old
G 6 place
place of my deliverance, from whence came both my good
and evil sate.
Never did a ship come to this part that had less busi-
ness than I had; and yet it was with great difficulty that
we were admitted to hold the least correspondence on
shore: not my partner himself, who was alive, and made
a great sigure among them; not my two merchant trus-
tees, nor the same of my wondersul preservation in the
island, could obtain me that savour: but my partner,
remembering that 1 had given sive hundred moidores to
the prior of the monastery of the Augustines, and three
hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went te the mo-
nastery, and obliged the prior that then was, to go to the
governor, and beg leave for me presently, with the cap-
tain and one more, besides eight seamen, to come on
shore, and no more; and this upon condition-absolutely
capitulated for, that we should not osser to land any goods,
out of the ship, or to carry any person away without li-
cence.
They were so strict with us, as to landing any goods,
that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three
bales of English goods, such as sine broad-cloths, stusfs,
and some linen, which I had brought for a present to my
partner.
He was a very generous broad-hearted man, though'
(like me) he came from little at sirst; and though he
knew not that I had the least design of giving him any
thing, he sent me on board a present of sresh provisions,,
wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores,
including some tobacco, and three or four sine medals
in gold. But I was even with him in my present,.
,vvhich, as I have said, consisted of sine broad-cloth,,
.English stusfs, lace, and sine Hollands. Also I deli-
vered him about the value of iool. sterling, in the
iame goods, for other uses; and I obliged him to set
up the sloop which I had brought with me £rom_ Eng-
land, as I have said, for the use of roy colony, in or-
tJer to send the resreshments I intended to my planta-
tion.
Accordingly he got hands, and sinished the sloop in
ji very sew days, for she was already framed, and I gave
-he master of her such instructions as he could not miss
the
the place; nor did he miss it, as I had an account from
my partner afterwards. I got him soon loaded with th
small cargo I had sent them ; and one of our seamen, that
had been on Ihore with me there, ossered to go with the
sloop, and settle there, upon my letter to the governor
Spaniard, to allot him a sufficient quantity of land fora
plantation; and giving him some clothes, and tools, for
his planting-work, which, he said, he understood, hav-
ing been an old planter in Maryland, and a buccaneer
into the bargain.
I encouraged the sellow by granting all'he desired; and,
as an addition, gave him the savage which we had taken
prisoner of war, to be his slave, and ordered the governor
Spaniard to give him his share of every thing he wanted
with the rest.
When we came to sit this man out, my old partner
told me, there was a certain very honest sellow, a Bra-
sil planter of his acquaintancej who had sallen into the
displeasure of the church. I know not what the mat-
ter is with him, says he; but on my conscience, I
thipk he is an heretic in his heart; and he has been-
obliged to conceal himself for sear of the inquisition
that he would be very glad of such an opportunity
to make his escape, with his wise and two daughters;
and if I would let them go to the island, and allot
them a plantation, he would give them a small stock to
begin with ; for the officers of the inquisition had seized
all his essects and estate, and he had nothing lest but
a little houshold-stusf, and two slaves; and, adds he,
though I hate his principles, yet I would not have him
sall into their hands, for he will assuredly be burnt alive
if he does.
I granted this presently, and joined my Englishman
with them; and we concealed the man, and his wise,
and daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop
put out to go to sea; and then (having put all their
goods on board the sloop some time before) we put
them on board the sloop, after she was got out of the-
bay.
Our seaman was mightily pleased with this new
partner; and their stock, indeed, was. much alike rich,
in tools, in preparations, for a sarm; but nothing to-
begin
begin with, but as aboye. However, they carried over
with them (which was worth all the rest) some materials
for planting sugar canes, with some plants of canes;
which he, I mean the Portugal man, understood very
well.
Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in
the island, I sent them, by this floop, three milch
cows, and sive calves, about twenty-two hogs among
them, three sows big with pig, two mares, and a stone-
horse.
For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged
three Portugal women to go; and recommended it to
them to marry them, and use them kindly. I could have
procured more women, but I remembered, that the poor
persecuted man had two daughters, and there were but
five of the Spaniards that wanted; the rest had wives of
tbeir own, though in another country.
All this cargo arrived sase, and, as you may easily sup-
pose, very welcome to my old inhabitats, who were now
( with this addition) between sixty and seventy people, be-
sides little children; of which there were a great many: I
found letters at London from them, all by way of Lisbon,
when I came back to England, being sent back to the Bra-
fjls by this floop; of which I shall take some notice in its
place.
I have now done with my island, and all manner of
discourse about it; and whoever reads the rest of my
jriemorandums, would do well to turn his thoughts
entirely from it, and expect to read only of the follies
0{ an old man, not warned by his own harms, much

I had no more business to go to the East-Indies, than
a man at sull liberty, and having committed no crime,
Jxas to go the turnkey at Newgate, and desire him
to lock him up among the prisoners there, and starve
j^m. Had I taken a small vessel from England, and
^ent directly to the island; had I loaded her, as I did

tion,
tion, and for my people, took a patent from the govern-
ment here, to have secured my property, in subjection
only to that of England, which, to be sure, I might have
obtained; had I carried over cannon and ammunition,
servants, and people to plant, and, taking possession of
the place, fortisied and strengthened it in the name of
England, and increased it with people, as I might easily
have done; had I then settled myself there, and sent the
ship back, loaded with good rice, as I might also have
done in six months time, and ordered my friends
to have sitted her out again for our supply; had I done
this, and stayed there myself, I had, at least, acted like a
man of common sense; but I was possessed of a wander-
ing spirit, scorned all advantages, pleased myself with be-
ing the patron of these people I had placed there, and do-
ing for them in a kind of haughty majestic way, like an
old patriarchal monarch; providing for them, as if I had
been sather of the whole samily, as well as of the planta-
tion : but I never so much as pretended to plant in the
name of any government or nation, or to acknowledge
any prince, or to call my people subjects to any one na-
tion more than another: nay, I never so much as gave
the place a name; but lest it as I found it, belonging to
no man; and the people under no discipline or govern-
ment but my own; who, though I had an influence over
them as sather and benesactor, had no authority or power
to act or command any way or other, sarther than vo-
luntary consent moved them to comply: yet even this,
had I stayed there, would have done well enough; but
as I rambled from them, and came thither no more, the
last letters I had from any of them were by my part-
ner's means, who, afterwards sent another stoop to the
; and who sent me word, though I had not the
till sive years after it was written, that they went
on but poorly, were malecontent with their long stay
there; that Will Atkins was dead; that sive of the Spa-
niards were come away; and that though they had not
been much molested by the savages, yet they had had
some Ikirmishes with them; that they begged of him to
write to me, to think of the promise I had made to setch
them away, that they might see their own country again
besore they died.

But I was gone a wild-goose chase indeed; and they
,who will have any more of me, must be content to follow
rne through a new variety of follies, hardships, and wild
adventures; wherein the justice of Providence may be duly
observed, and we may see how easily Heaven can gorge
us with our own desires, make the strongest of our wishes
to be our affliction, and punish us most severely with those
very things which've think it would be our utmost happi-
ness to be allowed in.
Let no wise man slatter himself with the strength of his
own judgment, as if he was able to chuse any particular
station of life for himself. Man isa short-sighted creature,
sees but a very little way besore him; and as his passions
are none of his best friends, so his particular assections are
generally his w orst counsellors.
1 say this, with respect to the impetuous desire I had front
a youth, to wander into the world; and how evident it
now was, that this principle was preserved in me for my
punishment. How it came on, the manner, the circum-
stance, and the conclusion of it, it is easy to give you his-
torically, and with its utmost variety of particulars. But
thesecretendsof Divine Providence, in thus permitting us
to be hurried down the stream of our own desires, sire only
to be understood of those who can listen to the voice of
Providence, and draw religious consequences from God's
justice,and their own mistakes. ?,
Be it, had I business, or no business, away I went;
it is no time now tc^enlarge./uny sarther upon the reason
or absurdity of rny.'own conduct; but to come to the
history, I was embarked for the voyage, and the voyage
J went.
I shall only add here, that my honest and truly
pious clergyman lest me here -y a ship being ready to go
to Lisbon, he asked me leave to go thither; being still, as
Jie observed, bound never to sinish any voyage he began;
how happy had it been for me, if I had gone with
him.
But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints
are best; had I gone with h\my I had never had so many
things to be thanksul for, and you had never heard of the-
second part of the travels and adventures of Robinson
Crusoe;
Crusoe; so I must leave here the sruitless exclaiming at
myself, and go on with my voyage.
From the Brasils we made directly away over the Atlan-
tic sea, to the Cape de Bonne Esperance, or, as we call it.
the Cape of Good Hope; and had a tolerable good voy-
age, bur course generally south east; now and then a storm,,
and some contrary winds. But my disasters at sea were atan
end; my suture rubs and cross events were to besal me or*
shore; that it might appear, the land was as well prepared
to be our scourge, as the sea; when Heaven, who directs
the circumstances of things, pleases to appoint it to be
so.
Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo
on board, who was to direct all her motions, after she ar-
rived at the Cape; only being limited to a certain number
of days, for stay, by charter-party, at the several ports she
was to go to: this was none of my business, neither did
I meddle with it at all; my nephew the captain, and the.
supercargo, adjusting all those things between them a*
they thought sit.
We made no stay at the Cape, longer than was needsul
to take in fresh water, but made the best of our way for
the coast of Coromandel; we were indeed insormed, thai
a French man of war of fifty guns, and two large merchant
(hips were gone for the Indies; and as I knew we
were at war with France, I had some apprehensions of
them; but they went their own way, and we heard no more
of them.
I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with de-
scriptions of places, journals of our voyages, variations of
the compass, latitudes, meridian distances, trade-winds,
situation of ports, and the like; such as almost all the his-
tories of long navigation are full of, and which make the
reading tiresome enough; and are persectly unprositable to.
all that read, except only to those who are to go to those
places themselves.
It is enough to name the ports and places which we
touched at; and what occurred to us upon our pasting
from one to another. We touched sirst at the island of
Madagascar; where, tho' the people are sierce and treache-
rous, and in particular, very well armed with lances and
bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, yet
we
we sared very well with them awhile; they treated us very
civilly; and for some trisles which we gave them, such as
knives, scilfars, &c. they brought us eleven good sat bul-
locks, middling in size, but very good in flesh; which we
took in, partly for fresh provisions for our present spend-
ing, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.
We were obliged to stay here for some time, after we
had surnished ourselves with provisions; and I, that
was always too curious to look into every nook of
the world wherever I came, was for going on shore
as often as I could. It was on the east-side of the
island that we went on shore one evening; and the
people, who, by the way, are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at u», at a dis-
tance: as we .had traded freely with them, and had
been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no danger;
but when we saw the people, we cut three boughs out
of a tree, and stuck them up at a distance from us,
which, it seems, is a mark in the country, not only
of truce and friendship, but, when it is accepted,
the other side set up three poles, or boughs, also;
which is a signal that they accept of the truce, too; but
then this is a known condition of the truce, that you
are not to pass beyond their three poles towards them,
por they come past your three poles, or boughs toward
you; so that you are persectly secure within the three
poles; and all the space between your poles and theirs,
Js allowed like a market, for free converse, trassick, and
commerce. When you go thither, you must not carry
your weapons with you; and if they come into that space,
they stick up their javelins and lances, all at the sirst poles,
and come on unarmed; but if any violence is ossered
them, and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the
poles, and lay hold of their weapons, and then the truce
Js at an end.
It happened one evening, when we went on shore,
that a greater number of their people came down
than usual, but were all very friendly and civil. They
brought with them .several kinds of provisions, for
which we satissied them with such toys as we had;
their women also brought us milk and roots, and se-
veral things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet;
and we made us a little tent, or hut, of some boughs of
trees, and lay on shore all that night.
I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well
satissied to lie on shore as the rest: and the boat lying at
an anchor, about a stone's cast from the land, with two
men in her to take care of her, I made one of them come
en shore; and getting some boughs of trees to cover us aU
so in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat,
and lay on board, under the cover of the branches of the
trees, all night.
About two o'clock in the morning, we heard one of
our men make a terrible noise on the more, calling out,
for God's sake to bring the boat in, and come and help
them, for they were all like to be murdered; at the same
time I heard the siring of sive mufquets, which was the
number of guns they had, and that three times over; for,
it seems, the natives here, were not so easily frighted with
guns, as the savages were in America, where I had to do
with them.
All this while I knew not what was the matter; but
rousing immediately from fleep with the noise, 1
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three susils we had on board, to land, and assist our
men.
We got the boat soon to the more; but our men
were in too much haste: for, being come to the more,
theyfilunged into the water, to get to the boat with all the
expedition they could, being pursued by between three and
four hundred men. Our men were but nine in all, and
sive of them had susils with them; the rest, indeed,
pistols and swords, but they were of small use to
them.
We took up seven os our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of them being very ill wdunded; and
that which was still worse, was, that while we stood in
the boat to take our men in, we were in as much danger,
as they were in on shore; for they poured their ar-
rows in upon us so thick, that we were sain to barricade
the side of the boat up with the benches, and two or three
loose boards, which, to our great satissaction, we
had, by mere accident, or providence rather, in the
boat.
And

And yet, had it been day-light, they are, it seemsy
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen but the
least part of any of us, they would have been sure of us;
we had, by the light of the moon, a little sight of them, as
they stood pelting us from the shore with darts and ar-
rows; and, having got ready our sire-arms, we gave them
a volley; and we could hear by the cries of some of them,
that
we had wounded several; however, they stood thus
in battle-array on the shore till break of day, which we
suppose was, that they might see the better to take their
aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to
weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we must
needs stand up in the beat, and they were as sure to hit
us, as we were to hit a bird in a- tree with small (hot;
we made signals of distress to the ship, which, though
Ihe rode a league osF, yet roy nephew, the captain,
hearing our siring, and, by glasses, perceiving the pos-
ture we lay in, and that we sired towards the lhore,
pretty well understood us; and weighing anchor with
all speed, he stood as near the shore. as he durst with
the ship, and then sent another boat, with ten hands
in her, to assist us; but we called to them, nor to
come' too near, telling them what condition we were in:
however, they stood in nearer to us; and one of the
men, taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and
keeping our boat between him and the enemy, so that
they could not persectly see him, swam on board us,
and made the line sast to the boat; upon which we
slips our little cable, and leaving our anchor behind,
they towed us out of the reach of the arrows, we all
the while, lying close behind the barricado we had
made.
As soon as we were got from between the ship and the
shore, that she could lay her side to the shore, we ran.
'along just by them, and we poured in a broadside among
them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small bullets,,
and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a terri-
ble havoc among them.
When we were got onboard, and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray;
and, indeed, our supercargo, who had been often in
those.
itiose parts, put me upon it; for he said, he was sure
die inhabitants would not have touched us, after we had
made a truce, if we had- not done something to pro-
voke them to it: at length it came out, viz. that an
old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had
brought it within our poles, with a young woman
with her, who also brought some roots or herbs;
and while the old woman (whether she was mother to
the young woman, or no, they could not tell) was sell-
ing us the milk, one of our men ossered some rude-
p.ess to the wench that was With her; at which the
eld woman made a great noise. However, the seaman
would not quit his prize, but carried her out of the old
woman's sight, among the trees, it being almost dark; the
old woman went away without her, and, as we
suppose, made an outcry among the people sbecame from;
who, upon notice, raised this great army upon us in three
or four hours; and it was great odds but we had been all
destroyed. v
One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, just at the beginning of the attack, as
he sallied out of the tent we had made; the rest came
osf free, all but the sellow who was the occasion of all
the mischies, who paid dear enough for his black mis-
tress, for we could not hear what became of him a
great while ; -we lay upon the shore two days after,
though'tbie wind -presented, and made signal* for him;
fi>a<ie,'.our. 'boat sail up more, and down-shore, several
leagues, but in vain; so we were obliged to give him
over; and if healohe had sussered for it, the loss had been
the less.
I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing
on shore once more, to try if I could learn any thing of
him or them; it was the third night after the action, that
I had a great mind to learn, if I could by any means, what
mischies we had dbne, and how the game stood on the In-
dian side; 1 was caresul to do it in the dark, lest we
should be attacked again; but I ought indeed to have
been sire, that the men I went with, had been under my
command, besore I engaged in a thing so hazardous and
n rsehievous, as I was brought into it without my know-
ledge or desix;.
We
• We took twenty stout sellows with us as any in the
ship, besides the supercargo and myself; and we landed
two hours besore mid-night, at the same place where
the Indians stood drawn up in the evening besore; I landed
here, because my design, as I have said, was chiefly to
see if they had quitted the sield, and if they had left any
marks behind them, or of the mischies we had done
them; and I thought, if we could surprise one or two of
them, perhaps we might get our man again, by way of
exchange.
We landed without any noise, and divided our men
into two companies, whereof the boatswain com-
manded one, and I the other: We neither could hear
nor see any body stir when we landed; so we inarched
up, one body at a distance from the other, to the
sield of battle: At sirst we could see nothing, it being
very dark; but by and by, our boatswain, that led the
sirst party, stumbled and sell over a dead body: This
made them halt there awhile; for knowing by the cir-
cumstances, that they were at the place where the In-
dians had stood, they waited for my coming up: Here
we concluded to halt till the moon began to rife, which
we knew would be in less than an hour; and then
we could easily discern the havoc we had made
among them: We told two and thirty bodies upon the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some had
an arm, and some a leg, shot off; and one his head:
those that were wounded, we supposed they had carried
iway.
VVhen we had made, as I thought, a sull discovery of
ill we cotald come at the knowledge of, 1 was for going on
aoard again; but the boatswain and his party often sent
ne word, that they were resolved to make a visit to the
ndian town, where these dogs, as they called them, dwelt;
ind desired me to go along with them; and if they could
ind them, as they still sancied they mould, they did not
loubt, they said, getting a good booty; and it might be,
hey might sind Thomas Jeffrys there; that was the man's
lame we had lost.
Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well
nough what answer to have given them; for I would

was not a hazard sit for us to run, who had a ship, and
a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage to make,
which depended very much upon the lives of the men;
but as they sent me word they were resolved to go, and
only alked me and my company to go along with them.
I positively resused it, and rose up' (for I was sitting on
the ground) in order to go to the boat; one or two of the
men began to importune me to go; and, when I still re-
sused positively, Degan to grumble, and say they were
not under my command, and they would go. Come,
Jack, says one of the men, will you go with me? I
will go for one. Jack said he would go; and anothei
followed, and then another; and, in a word, they all
lest me but one, whom, with much dissiculty too, I per-
suaded to stay; so the Supercargo and I, with one man,
went back to the boat, where, 1 told them, we would stay
for them, and take care to take in as many of them as should
be lest; for I told them, it was a mad thing they were go-
ing about, and supposed most of them would run the fate
of Thomas Jeffrys.
They told me, like seamen, they'd warrant it they
would come off again; and they would take care, &c.
So away they went. I intreated them to consider the
ship, and the voyage; that their lives were not their
own; and that they were intrusted with the voyage,
in some measure; that, if they miscarried, the (nip
might be lost for want of their help; and that they
could not answer it to God or man. I said a great
deal more to them on that head, but I might as well
have talked to the main-mast of the ship; they were
mad upon their journey; only they gave me good
words, and begged I would not be angry; said, they
would be very cautious, and they did not doubt but
they would be back again in about an hour at sarthest;
for the Indian town, they said, was not above half a mile
Well, they all went away, as above; and though the
attempt was desperate, and such, as none but madmen
would have gone about, yet, to give them their due,
they' went about it warily, as well as boldly. They were
osf: though they found it above two
to it.

fore they got
gallantly

gallantly armed, that is true; for they had every man a
i'usil or musquet, a bayonet, and every man a pistol;
some of them had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers;
and the boatswain, and two more, had pole-axes: be-
sides all which they had among them thirteen hand-grena-
does. Bolder sellows, and better provided, never went
about any wicked work in the world.
When they went out, their chies design was plunder;
and they were in mighty hopes of sinding^-gold-there;
but a circumstance, which none of them were aware of,
set them on sire with revenge, and made devils of them
all: when they came to the sew Indian houses, which
they thought had been the town, which were not above
half a mile off, they were under a great disappointment;
for there were not above twelve or thirteen houses; and
where the town was, or how big, they knew not: they
consulted theresore what to do, and were some time be-
fore they could resolve; for if tlæy sell upon these, they
must cut all their throats; and it was ten to one but some
of them might escape, it being in the' night, though the
moon was up; and if one escaped, he would run away,
ind raise all the town, so they snould have a whole ar-
my upon them. Again, on the other hand, if they went
iway, and lest those untouched (for the people were,
ill asleep] they could not tell which way to look for the
own.
However, the last was the best advice; fa they re-
blved to leave those houses, and look for the town as
veil as they could :, so they went on a little way, and
bund a cow tied to a tree: this they presently con-
;luded would be a good guide to them; for they said
he cow certainly belonged to the town before them,
>r the town behind them; and if they untied her,
hey should, see which way she went; if she went back,
hey had nothing to say to her; but, if she went for-
ward, the^ f.ad nothing to do but to follow her; so
hey cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags,
nd ,tbp cow went on besore them: in a word, the .
owl led them directly to the town, which, as they
eported, consisted of above 200 houses, or huts; and
n some of these, they found several samilies living
ogethet.'
Here

Here they found all silent; as profoundly secure, as sleep
and a country that had never seen an enemy of that
kind, could make them: upon this they called another
council, to consider what they had to do; and, in a
word, they resolved to divide themselves into three bo-
dies, and to set three houses on sire in three parts of the .
town; and as the men came out, to seize them and bind
them ; if any resisted, they need not be asked what to do
then; and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder;
but resolved to march silently sirst through the town, and
see what dimensions it was of, and consider if they
might venture upon it, or no.
They did so, and desperately resolved that they would
venture upon them ; but while they were animating one
another to the work, three of them, that were a little
besore the rest, called out aloud, and told them they had
found Tho. Jeffrys; they all ran up to the place; and so
it was indeed, for there they found the poor sellow hang-
ed up naked by one arm, and his throat cut; there was
an Indian house just by the tree, where they found six-
teen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who had
been concerned in the fray with us besore, and two or
three of them wounded with our shot; and our mea
found they were awake, and talking one to another in
that house, but knew not their number,
v The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged
them, as besore, that they swore to one another they
would be revenged, and that not an Indian who came
into their hands should have quarter; and to work they
went immediately: and yet not so madly as by the rage
and sury they were in might be expected. Their sirst
care was to get something that would soon take sire;
but aster a little search, they found that would be to no
purpose, for most of the houses were low, and thatched
with flags or rushes, of which the country is sull; so
they presently made some wild-sire, as we call it, by wet-
ting a little powder in the palms of their hands; and, in
a quarter of an hour, they set the town on sire in four
or sive places: and particularly that house where the In-
dians were not gone to bed. As soon as the sire began
to blaze, the poor frighted creatures began to rush out
to save their lives; but met with their sate in the at-

THE LIFE ANB ADVENTURES OF
tempt, and especially at the door, where they drove
them back, the boatswain himself killing one or two
with his pole-ax; the house being large, and many in
it, he did not care to go in, but called for a hand-gre-
nado, and threw it among them, which, at sirst, frighted
them, but when it burst, made such havock among
them; that they cried out in a hideous manner.
In short, most of the Indians, who were in the open
part of the house, were killed or hurt with the grenado,
except two or three more, who pressed to the door,
which the boatswain and two more kept with the bayo-
nets in the muzzles of their pieces, and dispatched all
who came that way. But there was another apartment
in the house, where the prince, or king, or whatsoever
he was, and several others, were; and they kept in, till
the house, which was by this time all of a light flame,
sell in upon them, and they were smothered, or burnt
to ashes.
All this while they sired not a gun, because they
would not waken the people saster than they could
master them; but the sire began to waken them sall
enough, and our sellows were glad to keep a little to-
gether in bodies; for the sire grew so raging, all the
houses being made of light combustible stuff, that they
could hardly bear the street between them; and their
business was to follow the sire for the surer execution:
as sast as the sire either forced the people out of thole
houses which were burning, or frighted them out of
athers, our people were ready at their doors to knock
them on the head, still calling and hallooing to one an-
ather to remember Tho. Jessrys.
While this was doing, I must consess I was very un-
;asy, and especially, when I saw the slames of the town,
vhich, it being night, seemed to be just by me.
My nephew, the captain, who was roused by his men
oo, seeing such a sire, was very uneasy, not knowing
vhat the matter was, or what danger I was in; especi-
lly hearing the guns too; for by this time they began
o use their sire-arms: a thousand thoughts oppressed his
lincl concerning me and the supercargo, what should
ecome of us: and at last, though he could ill spare any
lore men, yet, not knowing what exigence we might

be in, he takes another boat, and with thirteen men
and himself comes on shore to me.
He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the
boat, with no more than two men, for one had been
lest to keep the boat; and though he was glad that we
were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to
know what was doing; for the noise continued, and the
slame increased: I consess it was next to an impossibility
for any men in the world to restrain their curiosity of
knowing what had happened, or their concern for the
sasety of the men. In a word, the captain told me, he
would go and help his men, let what would come. I
argued with him, as I did before with the men, the sasety
of the ship, and the danger of the voyage, the interest
of the owners and merchants, &c. and told him I would
go, and the two men, and only see if we could, at a
distance, learn what was like to be the event, and come
back, and tell him.
It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk
to the reit besore; he would go, he said, and he only
wished he had lest but ten men in the snip; for he could
not think of having his men lost for want of help: hc-
had rather, he said, lose the ship, the voyage, and hia
lise, and all; and so away went he.
Nor was I more able to stay behind now, than I
was to persuade them not to go besore; so, in short, the
captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace, and
setch twelve msn more from the ship, leaving the long-
boat at an anchor; and that when they came back, six
men should keep the two boats, and six more come after
us; so that he lest only sixteen men in the ship; for the
whole ship's company consisted of 65 men, whereof two
were lost in the sirst quarrel which brought this mis-
chies on.
Being now 011 the march, you may be sure we selt
little os the greund we trod on ; and being guided by
the sire, we kept no . path, but went directly to the
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns were sur-
prising to us besore, the cries of the poor people
were now quite of another nature, and silled us witjj
horror. I must consess I never was at the sacking of
a city, or at the taking of a town by storm; I have

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ireland,
and killing man, woman and child ; and I had read of
Connt Tilly sacking of the city of Magdeburg, and
cutting the throats of z 2,000 of both sexes; but I never
had an idea of the thing itself besore; nor is it possible
to describe it, or the horror which was upon our minds
at hearing it.
However we went on, and, at length, came to the
town, though there was no entering the streets of it
for the sire. The sirst object we met with, was the
ruins of a hut or house, or rather the ashes of it,
for the house was consumed; and just before it, plain
now to be seen by the light of the sire, lay four men
and three women killed; and, as we thought, one or
two more lay in the heap among the sire. In short,
these were such instances of a rage altogether barbarous,
and of a sury something beyond what was human, that
we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it;
er, if they were the authors of it, we thought that every
one of them ought to be put to the worst of deaths: but
this was not all; we saw the sire increased forward, and
the cry went on just as the sire went on, so that we were
In the utmost consusion. We advanced a little way sar-
ther; and beheld, to our astonishment, three women na-
ked, crying in a most dreadsul manner, and flying as
if they had, indeed, had wings, and after them sixteen
or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and con-
sternation, with three of our English butchers (for I can
call them no better) in the rear; who, when they could
not overtake them, sired in among them, and one that
w as killed by their shot sell down in our sight; when
the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and
that we would murder them, as well as those that pur-
sued them, they set up a most dreadsul shriek, especially
the women; and two of them sell down as if already
dead with the fright.
My very foul shrunk within me, and my blood ran
chill in my veins when I saw ^his; and I believe, had
the three English sailors that pursued them.come on,
I had made our men kill them all. However, we took
.fome ways to let the poor flying creatures know that

we would not hurt them; and immediately they came
up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands listed up,
made piteous lamentations to us to save them, which we
let them know we would do; whereupon they kept all
together in a huddle, close behind us, for protection.
I lest my men drawn up together, and charged them
to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our
people, and see what devil it was possessed them, and
what they intended to do; and, in a word, to com-
mand them osf; assuring them, that if they stayed tiH
day-light, they would have a hundred thousand men
about their ears; I say I lest them, and went among
those flying people, taking only two of our men with
me; and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among
them: some of them had their seet terribly burnt with
trampling and running through the sire; others thetr
hands burnt; one of the women had sallen down in the
lire, and was almost burnt to death besore she could
get out again; two or three of the men had cuts in
their backs and thighs, froai our men pursuing; and
another was shot through the body, and died while I
was there.
I would sain have learned what the occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one word they said;
though by signs I perceived that some of them knew
not what was the occasion themselves. I was so terri-
could not stay there, but went back to my own men:
I told them my resolution, and commanded them to
follow me; when in the very moment came four of our
men, with the boatswain at their head, running over the
heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood
and dust, as if they wanted more people to massacre;
when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could
halloo; and with much ado, one of them made them
hear; so that they knew who we were, and came up
to us. '... i
As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a hal-
loo like a shout of triumph, for having, as he thought,
more help come; and without bearing to hear me, cap-

I will kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon
his head. We have sworn to spare none os them: we
will root out the very name of them from the earth
and thus he ran on, out of breath too with action, and
would not give us leave to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice that I might silence him
a little: Barbarous dog! said I, what are you doing?
I won't have one creature touched more, upon pain of
death. I charge you, upon your lise, to stop your
hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead man this
niinute.
Why, Sir, says he, do you know what you do, or
what they have done? If you want a reason for what
we have done, come hither; and with that he shewed
me the poor sellow hanging upon a tree with his throat
cut.
I consess I was urged then myself, and at another
time should have been forward enough: but I thought
they had carried their rage too sar, and thought of
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, 'Cursed be
their anger, for it was sierce; and their wrath, for it
was cruel.' But I had now a new talk upon my hands;
for when the men I carried with me saw the sight, as I
had done, I had as much to do to restrain them, as I
should have had with the others; nay, my nephew him-
self sell in with them, and told me, in their hearing,
that he was only concerned for sear of the men being
overpowered; sor, as to the people, he thought not one
of them ought to live; for they had all glutted them-
selves with the murder of the poor man, and that they
ought to be used like murderers: upon these words,
away ran eight of my men with the boatswain and
his crew, to complete their bloody work: and I, seeing
jt quite out of my power to restrain them, came away
pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight, much
.Jess the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches
that sell into their hands.
1 got nobodv to come back with me but the super-
cargo and two men; and with these I walked back ta
the boats. I* was a very greac piece of folly in me, I
consess, to venture back, as it were, alone; for, as V.
began now to be almost day, and the alarm had run
. . over
over the country, there stood about forty men' armed
with lances and bows at the little place where the twelve
or thirteen houses flood mentioned besore; but by acci-
dent I missed the place, and came directly to the sea-
side; and by the time I got to the sea-side it was broad
day; immediately 1 took, the pinnace, and went aboard,-
and sent her back to assist the men in what might
happen.
I observed that about the time I came to the boat-
side, the sire was pretty well out, and the noise abated;
but in about half an hour after I got on board, I heard
a volley of our men's sire-arms, and saw a great smoke;
this, as I underiioed afterwards, was our men salling
upon the forty men, who, as I said, stood at the sevr
houses on the way; of whom they killed sixteen or se-
venteen, and set all those houses on sire, but did not
meddle with the women or children.
By that time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnace, our men began to appear; they came dropping
in, some and some; not in two bodies, and in form, as
they went out, but all in heaps, straggling here and
there in such a manner, that a small torce of tesolute
men might have cut them all off.
But the dread of them was upon the whole country;
the people were amazed and surprised, and so frighted,
that, 1 believe, an hundred of them would have fled at
the sight of but sive of our men. Nor in all this terrible
action was there a man who made any considerable de-
sence; they were so agitated between the terror of the
lire, and the sudden attack of our men in the dark, that
they knew not which way to turn themselves; for if they
fled one way, they were met by one party; if back
again, by another; so that they were every where knock-
ed down. Nor did any of our men receive the least
hurt, except one who strained his foot, and another had
one of his hands very much burnt.
I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and,
indeed, with all the men, in my mind, but with him in
particular; as well for his acting so out of his duty, as
commander of the ship, and having the charge of the
voyage upon him, as in prompting, rather than cooling,
the rage of his men, in so bloody and cruel an en-
H 4 terprise:
tcrprise: my nephew answered me very respectsully;
but told me, that when he saw the body of the poor sea-
man, whom they had murdered in such a cruel and
barbarous manner, he was not master of himself, neither
could he govern his passion: he owned, he mould not
have done so, as he was commander of the ship; but,
:;s he was a man, and nature moved him, he could not
.bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not sub-
ject to me at a)l; and they knew it well enough, so
they took no notice of my dislike.
The next day we set sail; so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the
number they killed; some said one thing, some another:
but, according to the best of their accounts put all to-
gether, they killed or destroyed, about 150 people, men,
women, and children, and lest not a house standing in
jhe town.
As for the poor sellow Thomas Jeffrys, as he was quite
dead, for his throat was so cut that his head was half off,
it would do him no service to bring him away; so they
lest him where they found him, only took him down
from the tree where he was hanged by one hand.
However just our men thought this action to be, I was
against them in it; and I always, after that time, told
them God would blast the voyage; for I looked upon
the blood they shed that night to be murder in them:
for though it is true that they killed Thomas Jeffrys, yet
jr was as true that Jeffrys was the aggressor, had broken
the truce, and had violated or debauched a young wo-
man of theirs, who came to our camp innocently, and
on the faith of their capitulation.
The boatswain desended this quarrel when we were
afterwards on board. He said, it was true that we
seemed to break the truce, but really had not; and that
the war was begun the night before by the natives
themselves, who had shot at us, and killed one of our
jnen without any just provocation; so that, as we were
jn a capacity to sight them, we might also be in a capa-
city to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordina-
ry manner; that though the poor man had taken liberty
tvith a wench, he ought not to have been murdered, and
that in such a villanous manner: and that they did^ no*
thing but what was just, and'that the laws of God al-
lowed to be done to murderers.
One would think this should have been enough to
have warned us against going on shore among heathens
and barbarians; but it is impossible to make mankind
wise, but at their own experience; and their experience
seems to be always of most use to them, when it is
dearest bought.
We were now bound to the Gulph of Persia, and from
thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Su-
rat; but the chies of the supercargo's design lay at the
bay of Bengal, where, if he miffed of the business out-
ward-bound, he was to go up to China, and return to
the coast as he came home.
The sirst disaster that besel us was in. the Gulph of
Persia, where sive of our men, venturing on shore on
the Arabian side of the Gulph, were surrounded by
the Arabs, and either all killed, or carried away into
slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to
rescue them, and had but just time to get off their
boat: I began to upbraid them with the just retribution
of heaven in this case; but the boatswain very warmly
told me, he thought I went sarther in my censures than
I could shew any warrant for in scripture, and reserred
to the thirteenth of St. Luke, ver. 4. where our Saviour
intimates, that those men, on whom the Tower of Si-
loam sell, were not sinners above all the Galileans; but
that which, indeed, put me to silence in this case, was,
that none of these sive men, who were now lost, were of
the number of those who went on shore to the massacre
of Madagascar (so I always called it, though our men
could not bear the word massacre with any patience):
and, indeed, this last circumstance,. as I have said, put
me to silence for the present.
But my frequent preaching to them on- this subject
had worse consequences than I expected; and the boat-
swain, who had heen the head of the attempt, came
up boldly to me one time, and told me, he found that
1 continually brought that affair upon the stage; that
I made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the
men very ill on that account, and himself in particu-
lar; that as I was but a passenger, and had no com-
, H j mand
mand in the ship, or concern in the voyage, they were
not obliged to bear ir; that they did not know but I
might have some ill design in my head, and, perhaps,
call them to an account for it when they came to Eng-
land; and that theresore, unless I would resolve to have
done with it, and also not to concern myself sarther
with him, or any of his assairs, he would leave the
ship; for he did not think it was sase to sail with me
among them* •
I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him, that I did consess I had all along op-
posed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would al-
ways call it; and that I had on all occasions spoken my
rnind freely about it, though not more upon him than
any of the rest; that as to my having no command
in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise any au-
thority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in
things which publickly concerned us all; as to what
concern I had. in the voyage, that was none of his
business; I was a considerable owner of the ship, and
in that claim I conceived I had a right to speak, even
s arther than I had yet done, and would not be account-
able to him, or any one else; and began to be a little
vvarm with him: he made but little reply to me at
that time, and I thought that asfair had been over.
We were at this time in the road to Bengal; and, being
,willing to see the place, I went on shore with the
supergargo, in the ship's boat, to divert myself; and
towards evening was preparing to go on board, when
one of the men came to me, and told me, he would not
have me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for
they had orders not to carry me on board. Any one
may guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a mes-
sage; and I asked the man, Who bade him deliver that
errand to me? He told me the cockswain. I said no
more to the sellow, but bid him let them know he had
delivered his message, and that I had given him no
answer to it.
1 immediately went, and sound out the supercargo,
and told him the story, adding, what I presently fore-
saw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny in the
ship; and intreated him- to go immediately on board the
• ft'?
ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the captain of it:
but I might have spared this intelligence, for, besore I
had spoken to him on shore, the matter was effected on
board: the boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and,
in a word, all the inserior officers, as soon as I was gone
off in the boat, came up to the quarter-deck, and de-
sired to speak with the captain; and there the boat-
swain, making a long harangue (for the sellow talked
very well), and repeating all he had said to me, told
the captain in a sew words, that as I was now gone
peaceably on shore, they were loth to use any violence
with me; which, if I had not gone on shore, they
would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone.
They theresore thought sit to tell him, that as they
shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his com-
mand, they would persorm it saithsully: but if I would
not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it,
they would all leave the ship, and sail no sariher with
him: and at that word ALL, he turned his sace about
towards the main-mast, which was, it seems, the signal
agreed on between them; at which all the seamen being
got together, they cried out, One and ALL, One and
ALL.
My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of
great presence of mind; and though he was surprised,
you may be sure, at the thing, yet he told them calmly
he would consider of the matter; but that he could do
nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it: he used
some arguments with them, to shew them the unrea-
sonableness and injustice of the thing; but it was all in
vain; they swore, and shook hands round, besore his
sace, that they would all go on shore, unless he would
engage to them not to susser me to come on board the
ship. .
This was an hard article upon him, who knew his-
obligation to me, and did not know how I might take
it; so he began to talk cavalierly to them -y told them,
that I was a very considerable owner of the ship, and
that in justice he could not put me out of my own
house ; that this was next door to serving me as the sa-
mous pirate Kid had done, who made the mutiny in
the ship, set the captain on shore in an uninhabited
H o island,
island, and ran away with the ship; that let them g»
into what ship they would, if ever they came to Eng-
land again, it would cost them dear; that the ship was
mine, and that he would not put me out of it; and that
he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than
disoblige me so much; so they might do as they pleas-
ed. However, he would go on Shore, and talk with
me there; and invited the boatswain to go with him,
and perhaps they might accommodate the matter with
roe.
But they all rejected the proposal; and said, they
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither
cn board, nor on more ; and if I came on board, they
w ould go on shore. Well, said the captain, if you are
all of this mind, let me go on Ihore, and talk with him;
ib away he came to me with this account, a little after
the message had been brought to me from the cock-
/wain.
I was very glad to see my nephew, I must consess -r
for I was not without apprehensions that they would
consine him by violence, set sail, and run away with
jhe ship; and then I had been stript naked in a remote
country, and nothing to help myself: in short, I had
been in a worse case than when I was all alone in the
island.
But they had not come to that length, it seems, to my
great satissaction: and when my nephew told me what
they had said to him, and how thej had swora, and
.shook hands, that they would one and all leave the
ship, if I was suffered to come on board, I told him, he
Jhould not be concerned at it at all, sor I would stay oa
shore : I only desired he would take care and send me all
my necessary things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum
of money, and I would sind my way to England as well
as I could.
This was a heavy piece of news to. my nephew; but
there was no way to help it, but to comply with it.
So in short, he went on board the ship again, and satis-
£cd the men, that his uncle had yielded to their im-
portunity, and had sent for his goods from on board
the ship. So the matter was over in a very few
hours;
hours; the men returned to their duty, and I began to
consider what course I should steer.
I was now alone in the remotest part of the world,
as I think I may call it; for I was near three thousand
leagues, by sea, sarther off from England, than I was
at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here by
land over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might
so from thence to , Baflbra by sea, up the Gulph of
ersia, and from thence might take the way of the ca-
ravans, over the deserts of Arabia to Aleppo and Scan-
. deroon; from thence by sea again to Italy, and so over
land into France; and this, put together, might be, at
least, a sull diameter of the globe; hut, if it were to be
measured, I suppose it would appear to be a great deal
more.
I had another way besore me, which was to wait for
some English ships, which were coming to Bengal from
Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get passage on
board them for England: but as I came hither without
any concern with the English East-India company, so it
would be difficult to go from hence without their licence,
unless with great savour of the captains of the ships, or of
the company's sactors ; and to both I was an uttej
stranger.
Here I had the particular pleasure, speaking by con-
trarieties, to see the ship set sail without me; a treat-
ment, I think, a man in my circumstances soarce ever
met with, except from pirates running away with a
ship, and setting those that would not agree with.their
villany on shore: indeed, this was the .next door to
it, both ways: however, my nephew lest me two ser-
vants, or rather one companion, and one servant;
the sirst was clerk to the purser, whom he engaged to
go with me; and the other was his own servant:
I took me also a good lodging in the house of an Eng-
lish-woman, where several merchants lodged, some
French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and one English-
man. Here I was handsomely enough entertained; and,
that I might not be said to run rashly upon any thing, I
stayed here above nine months, considering what course
to take, and how to manage myself: I had some English
goods with me, of value, and a considerable sum of
money,
THE LIFE AND A.DVENTWRES OF
money, my nephew surnishing me with a thousand pieces
of eight, and a letter of credit for more, if I had occa-
sion, that I might not be sheightened, whatever might
happen.
1 quickly disposed of my goods, and to advantage too;
and, as I originally intended, I bought here some very
good diamonds, which, of all other things, was the moll
proper for me, in my circumstances, because I might always
carry my whole estate about me.
After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my
return to England; but none salling to my mind, the Eng.
lish merchant, who lodged with me, and with whom I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance, came to me one
morning; Countryman, says he, I have a project to com-
municate to you, which, as it suits with my thoughts,
may, for aught I know, suit with your's also, when you
shall have thoroughly considered it.
Here we are posted, says he, you by accident, and I
by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote
from my own country; but it is in a country where, by
us who understand trade and business, a great deal of
money is to be got: if you will put a thousand pounds
to my thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here, the
sirst we can get to our minds; you shall be captain, I'll
De merchant; and we will go a trading voyage to China;
for what should we stand still for? The whole world is
in motion, rolling round and round; all the creatures of
Sod, heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and dili-
gent: why should we be idle? There are no drones, fays
le, living in the world but men: why should we be of
bat number?
I liked this proposal very well, and the more, because
t seemed to be expressed with so much good-will, and
n so friendly a manner; I will not say but that I might,
>y my loose and unhinged circumstances, be the sitter to
mbrace a proposal for trade, and, indeed, for any thing
lse; or otherwise, trade was none of my element: however,
might perhaps say, with some truth, that if trade was
ot my element, rambling was; and no proposal for seeing
ny part of the world which I had never seen besore, could
offibly come amiss to me.

It was, however, some time besore we could get a ship
to our mind; and when we got a vessel, it was not
easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many as were
necessary to govern the voyage, and manage the sailors
which we shouJd pick up there; after some time we got at
mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, English; a Dutch car-
penter, and three Portuguese fore-mast men; with these, we
found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen,
such asthey are, to makeup.
There are so many travellers who have written the
history of their voyages and travels this way, that it
would be but very little diversion to any body, to give
a long account of the places we went to, and the people
who inhabit there: those things I leave to others, and
reser the reader to those journals and travels of Eng-
lishmen, many os which, I sind, are published, and more
promised every day: it is enough for me to tell you,
that we made the voyage to Achin, in the island of
Sumatra, sirst; and from thence to Siam, where we ex-
changed some of our wares for opium, and for some
arrack; the sirst, a commodity which bears a great price
among the Chinese, and which, at that time, was very
much wanted there: in a word, we went up to Susham,
made a very great voyage, were eight months out, and
returned to Bengal; and I was very well satissied with
my adventure. I observe, that our people in England
often admire how the ossicers, which the company send
into India, and the merchants which generally stay there,
get such very good estates as they do, and sometimes come
home worth sixty, seventy, and an hundred thousand
pounds at a time.
But it is no wonder, or, at least, we shall see so much
sarther into it, when we consider the innumerable ports
and places where they have a free commerce, that it will
then be no wonder; and much less will it be so, when
wt consider, that at all those p!f c:s and ports where the
Knglish ships come, there is so much, and such constant
demand for the growth of all other countries, that there
is a certain vent for the return, as well as a market abroad
for the goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good voyage, and I got so
much money by the sirst adventure, and such an insight
into
into the method of getting more, that, had I been twenty
years younger, I should have been tempted to have stayed
here, and sought no sarther for making my fortune: but
what was all this to a man on the wrong side of three-
scorei; that was rich enough, and came abroad more in
obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world, than
a covetous desire of getting in it? And, indeed, I think,
it is with great justice that I now call it a restless desire;
for it was so: when I was at home, I was restless to go
ibroad; and now I was abroad, I was restless to be at
iome. I say, what was this gain to me? I was rich
;nough already; nor had I any uneasy desires about
jetting more money; and theresore, the prosits of the
voyage to me, were things of no great force to me, for
:he prompting me forward to sarther undertakings:
lence I thought, that by this voyage I had made no
>rogress at all; because I was come back, as I might call
t, to the place from whence I came, as to an home;
vhereas my eye, which, like that which Solomon speaks
)f, was never satissied with seeing, was still more desirous
>f wandering and seeing. I was come into a part of the
vorld which I never was in besore; and that part in par-
icular which I had heard much of; and was resolved to
ee as much of it as I could; and then I thought, I might
ay, I had seen all the world that was worth feeing.
But my sellow-tiaveller and I had different notions;
do not name this to insist upon my own, for I acknowl-
edge his was most just, and the most suited to the end
isa merchant's lise; who, when he is abroad upon adven-
ures, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as the best thing
or him, which he is like to get the most money by: ray
ew friend kept himself to the nature of.the thing, and
/ould have been contenf to have gone likea carrier's horse,

e coold, as he called it, sind his account in it: on
ie other hand', mine, ,as old as I was, was the notion
f a mad rambling, boy, that never cares to fee a thing
vice over.
But this was not all ; I had a kind of impatience
pon me to be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled
solution imaginable, which way to go: in the inter-
J of these consultations, my friend, who was always

»pon the search for business, proposed another voyag
to me, viz. among the spice-islands; and to bring home
a load of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts; places
where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but the islands be-
long partly to the Spaniards; though we went not so sar,
but to some other, where they have not the whole power
as they have at Batavia, Ceylon, &c. We were not long
in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty was in
bringing me to come to it; however, at last, nothing
else ossering, and sinding that really stirring about and
trading, the prosit being so great, and, as I may say,
certain, had more pleasure in it, and more satissaction to
the mind, than sitting still; which, to me especially, was
the unhappiest part of lise, I resolved on this voyage too;
which we made very successsully, touching at Borneo,
and several islands, whose names I do not remember,
and came home in about sive months: we fold our spice,
which was chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs, to the
Persian merchants, who carried them away fortheGulph;
and, making near sive of one, we really got a great deal
of money.
My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at
me; Well now, said he, with a sort of an agreeable in-
sult upon my indolent temper, is not this better than
walking about here, like a man of nothing to do, and
spending our time in staring at the nonsense and igns-
rance os the Pagans? Why truly, said I, my friend, I
think it is; and I begin to be a convert to the principles
of merchandizing; but I must tell you, said I, by the
way, you do not know what I am doing; for if once
I conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, as old
as I am, I shall harass you up and down the world till I
tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let
you lie still.
B t to be short'with my speculations: a little while
after this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; (he
was a coaster, not an European trader, and of about
two hundred tons burden: the men, as they pretended,
having been so sickly, that the captain had not men
enougn to go to sea with, he lay by at Bengal; and, »s
if having got money enough, or being willing, for other
reasons, to go for Europe, he gave public notice, that
he
R o B I
: would sell his ship: this came to my ears besore my
ew partner heard of it; and I had a great mind to buy
: so I went home to him, and told him or it: he confi-
ers awhile, for he was no rash man neither; but, mu-
ng some time, he replied, She is a little too big; but,
owever, we will have her. Accordingly we bought the
iip; and, agreeing with the master, we paid sor her;
nd took posleslion: when we had done so, we resolved
o entertain the men, if we could, to join them with those
vt had, for the pursuing our business; but on a sudden,
hey having not received their wages, but their share of the
noney, as we afterwards learnt, not one of them was to
>e found. We enquired much about them, and at length
vere told, that they were all gone together, by land, to
Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence; and from
thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea totheGulph
>f Persia.
Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, as
that I missed the opportunity of goin<* with them; for
such a ramble, I thought, and in such company as would
both have guarded me, and diverted me, would have
suited mightily with my great design; and I should both
have seen the world, and gone homewards too: but I
was much better satissied a sew days after, when I came
to know what sort of sellows they were; for, in short,
their history was, that this man they called captain,
was the gunner only, not the commander; that they
had been a trading voyage, in which they were at-
tacked on shore by some of the Malaccans, who had
killed the captain and three of his men; and that after
the captain was killed, these men, eleven in number,
had resolved to run away with the ship, which they did;
and had brought her in at the bay of Bengal, leaving the
mate and sive men more on shore; of whom we shall hear
sarther.
Well 5 let them come by the ship how they would,
we came honestly by her, as we thought; though wedid
not, I consess, examine into things so exactly as
we ought; for we never enquired any thing of the
seamen, who, if we had examined, would certainly
have saultered in their accounts, contradicted one ano-
ther, and, perhaps, contradicted themselves; or, one

how or other, we should have seen reason to have sus-
pected them; but the man shewed us a bill of sale for
the ship, to one Emanuel Clostershoven, or some such-
name (for I suppose it was all a forgery), and called him-
self by that name; and we could not contradict him; and
being withal a little too unwary, or, at least, having no
suspicion of the thing, we went through with our bargain.
However, we picked up some English seamen here
after this, and some Dutch; and we now resolved for a
second voyage, to the south-east, for cloves, &c. that is
to say, among the Philippine and Malacca isles; and,
in short, not to sill this part of my story with trifles,
when what is yet to come is so remarkable, I spent,
srom sirst to last, six years in this country, tracing from
port to port, backward and forward, and with very
good success; and was now the last year with my part-
ner, going in the ship above mentioned, on a voyage
to China; but designing sirst to Siam, to buy rice.
In this voyage, being, by contrary winds, obliged to
beat up and down a great while in the streights of Ma-
lacca, and among the islands, we no sooner got clear
of those dissicult seas, but we found our ship had sprung
a leak, and we were not able, by all our industry, to sind
out where it was. This forced us to make for some port;
and my partner, who knew the country better than I did,
directed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia;
for I had made the English mate, one Mr. Thompson,
captain, not being willing to take the charge of the
ship upon myself: This river lies on the North side of
the great bay or gulph, which goes up to Siam.
While we were here, and going often on shore for re-
freshment, there comes to me one day an Englishman,
and he was, it seems, a g inner's mate on board an
English East India ship, which rode in the same river,
up at, or near tha city of Cambodia; what brought
him hither we knew not; but he comes up to me, and,
speaking English, Sir, says he, you are a stranger to me,
and I to you; but I have something to tell you, that
very nearly concerns you.
I looked steadily at him a good while, and he thought
at sirst I had known him, but I did not: If it very nearly
concerns raz, said I, and not yourself, what moves yon

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURE! OF
) tell it me ? I am moved, says he, by the imminent
anger you are in; and, for aught I see, you have no
nowledge of it. I know no danger I am in, said I,
ut that my ship is leaky, and I cannot sind it out; but
propose to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I can
nd it. But, sir, says he, leaky, or not leaky, sind it,
r not sind, you will be wiser than to lay your ship on
lore to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to
ou: Do you know, sir, said he, the town of Cambodia
es about sifteen leagues up this river? and there are
.vo large English ships about sive leagues on this side,
nd three Dutch. Well, said I, and what is that to me?
V'hy, sir, says he, is it for a man that is upon such ad-
ensures as you are, to come into a port, and not examine
rlt what ships there are there, and whether he is able to
eal with them i I suppose you do not think you are a
latch for them. I was amused very much at his dis-
ourse, but not amazed at it; for I could not conceive
/hat he meant; and I turned short upon him, and said,
ir, I wish you would explain yourself; I cannot ima.
ine what reason I have to be afraid of any of the com-
any's ships, or Dutch ships; I am no interloper; what
an they have to say to me?
He looked like a man half-angry, half-pleased; and
ausing a while, but smiling, Well, sir, says he, if
ou think yourself secure, you must take your chance;
am sorry your sate should blind you against good
dvice; but assure yourself, if you do not put to
;a immediately, you will the very next tide be at-
acked by sive long-boats sull of men; and, perhaps,
f you are taken, you will be hanged for a pirate, and
he particulars be examined into asterwards: I thought,
r, added he, I should have met with a better recep-
on than this, for doing you a piece of service of such
nportance. I can never be ungratesul, said I, for
ny service, or to any man that ossers me any kind-
ess; but it is past my comprehension, said I, what
ley should have such a design upon me sor: How-
ver, since you say there is no time to be lost, and
lat there is some villanous, design in hand against me,
will go on board this minute, and put to sea lm-
lediately, if my men can stop the leak, or if we can

swim without stopping it: But, sir, said I, shall I go
away ignorant of the reason of all this? Can you give
me no sarther light into it?
I can tell you but part of the story, sir, says he; but
I have a Dutch seaman here with me, and, I believe,
I could persuade him to tell you the rest; but there is
scarce time for it: but the short of the story is this, the
sirst part of which, I suppose, you know well enough,
viz. That you were with this ship at Sumatra; that
there your captain was murdered by the Malaccans,
with three of his men; and that you, or some of those
that were on board with you, ran away with the ship,
and are since turned PIRATES. This is the sum of
the story, and you will all be seized as pirates, I can
assure you, and executed with very little ceremony; for
you know merchants ships shew but little law to pirates,
if they get them in their power.
Now you speak plain English, said I, and I thank
you; and though I know nothing that we have done,
like what you talk of, but I am sure we came honestly
and sairly by the ship, yet, seeing such work is a
doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly,
I will be upon my guard. Nay, sir, says he, do not
talk of being upon your guard; the best desence is to
be out of danger; if you have any regard to your
lise, and the lives of all your men, put to sea
without sail at high-water; and as you have a whole
tide before you, you will be gone too sar out besore
they can come down; for they will come away at
-high-water; and as they have twenty miles to come,
you'll get near two hours of them by the difference
of the tide, not reckoning the length of the way:
Besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they
will not venture to follow you sar out at sea, especially
if it blows.
Well, said I, you have been very kind in this: What
(hall I do for you, to make you amends i Sir, says he,
you may not be so willing to make me amends, be-
cause you may not be convinced of the truth of k.; I
will make an offer to you; I have nineteen months pay
due to me on board the ship , which I came out
.of England in; and the Dutchman, that is with me, has
seven
seven months pay due to him; if you will make good
our pay to us, we will go along with you; if you sind
nothing more in it, we will desire no more •, but if we
do convince you, that we have saved your lise, and the
sllip, and the lives of all the men in her, we will leave
the rest to you.
I consented to this readily; and went immediately on
board, and the two men with me. As soon as I came
to the ship side, my partner, who was on board, came
out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great
deal of joy, O ho! O ho! we have stopped the leak!
we have stopped the leak! Say you so, said I, thank
God! but weigh the anchor then immediately. Weigh!
says he: What do you mean by that? What is the mat-
ter? says he. Ask no questions, said I, but all hands
to work, and weigh, without losing a minute. He was
surprised: But, however, he called the captain, and he
immediately ordered the anciior to be got up; and
though the tide was not quite done, yet a little land-
breeze blowing, we stood out to sea: then I called him
into the cabin, and told him the story at large; and we
called in the men, and they told us the rest of it; but as
it took up a great deal of time, so besore we had done,
a seaman comes to the caSin door, and calls out to us,
that the captain bade him tell us, we were chased:
Chased, said I! by whom and by what? By sive sloops,
or boats, said the sellow, sull of men. Very well, said
I; then it is apparent there is something in it. In the
next place, I ordered all the men to be called up; and
told them, that there was a design to seize the ship,
and to take us for pirates; and asked them, if they
would stand by us, and by one another r The men an-
swered, cheersully, that one and all, they would live and
die with us. Then I asked the captain, what way he
thought best for us to manage a sight with them: For,
resist them I resolved we would, and that to the last
drop. He said, readily, that the way was to keep
them off with our great shor, as long as we could, and
then to sire at them with our small arms, to keep them
from boarding us; but when neither of these would do
any longer, we should retire to our close quarters; per-
haps they had not materials to break open our bulk-
beads, or get in upon us. The
The gunner had in the mean time, orders to bring twa
guns to bear fore and aft, oat of the steerage, to clear the
deck, and load them with musquet-bullets, and small
pieces of old iron, and what next came to hand; and thus
we made ready for sight; but all this while..kept out to
sea, with wind enough, and could see the boats at a dis-
tance, being sive large long-boats following us, with aU
the sail they could make.
Two of these boats, which, by our glasses, we could
see, were English, had outsailed the rest, were near two
leagues a-head of them, and gained upon us considerably;
-j^fe.that we found they would come up with us; upon
which we found a gun without a shot, to intimate that
they should bring to; and we put out a slag of truce,
as a signal for parley; but they kept crowding after us,
till they came within shot: upon this we took in our
white slag, they having made no answer to it, hung out
the red slag, and sired at them with shot: Notwith-
standing this, they came on till they were near enough to
call to them with a speaking trumpet, which we had on
board; so we called to them, and bade them keep off at
i\ their peril.
It was all one, they crowded after us, and endeavoured
to come under our stern, so to board us on our quarter:
Upon which, seeing they were resolute sor mischies, and
depended upon the strength that followed them, I ordered
to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broad-
side, when immediately we sired sive guns at them; one
of them had been levelled so true, as to carry away the
stern of the hindermost boat, and bring them to the neces-
fity of taking down their sail, and running all to the head
of the boat, to keep her from sinking; so she lay bv,
and had enough of it; but seeing the foremost boat still
crowd on after us, we made ready to sire at her in par-
as- tseular. <>','
?y , While this was doing, one of the three boats that
rts Was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made
H -.tip' to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and
K' we could afterwards see her take out the men: we called
'again to the foremost boat, and offered a truce to par-
ley again, and to know what was Her business with us;
but had no answer: only stie crowded close under our
stern.
stern. Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterooi
fellow, run out his two chase guns, and sired at her;
but the shot missing, the men in the boat shouted,
waved their caps, and came on; but the gunner,
getting quickly ready again, sired among them a second
time; one shot of which, though it missed the boat
itself, yet sell in among the men, and we could easily
see, had done a great deal of mischies among them;
but we, taking no notice of that, weared the ship again,
and brought our quarter to bear upon them; and, siring
three guns more, we found the boat was split almost to
pieces; in particular, her rudder, and a piece of her
stern, was shot quite away; so they handed their sail
immediately, and were in great disorder; but to com-
plete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at
them again; where he hit them we could not tell, but
we found the boat was sinking, and some of the men
already in the water: upon this I immediately manned
out our pinnace, which we had kept close by our side,
with orders to pick up some of the men, if they could,
and save them from drowning, and immediately to come
on board with them; because we saw the rest of the
boats began to come up. Our men in the pinnace
followed their orders, and took up three men; one of
which was just drowning, and it was a good while be-
fore we could recover him. As soon as they were on
board, we crowded all the sail we could make, and stood
sarther out to sea; and we found, that when the other
three boats came up to the sirst: two, they gave over their
chace.
Being thus delivered from a danger, which, though I
knew not the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater
than I apprehended; I took care/that we would changeour
course, and not let any one imagine whither-we were go-
ing: so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the
course of all the European ships, whether they were bound
to China, or any where else, within the commerce of the
European nations.
When we were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and enquire sirst, what the
meaning of .all this should be? The Dutchman let 'us
into the secret of it at once; telling us, That the sel-
low that fold us the ship, as we said, was no more than
a thies, that had run away with her. Then he told us ho\r
the captain, whose name too he mentioned, though I do
not remember it now, was treacherously murdered by
the natives on the coast of Malacca, with three of his
men; and that he, this Dutchman, and four more, got
into the woods, where they wandered about a great
while; till at length, he in particular, in a miraculous
manner, made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship,
which sailing near the shore, in its way from China, had
sent their boat on shore for fresh water; that he durst
not come to that part of the shore where the boat was,
but made, shift, in the night, to take in the water sarther
off, and, swimming a great while, at last the ship's
boat took him up.
He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two
of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived, having
deserted the rest in their travels; and gave an account,
that the sellow who had run away with the ship, sold her
at Bengal to a set of pirates, which were gone a cruising
in her; and that they had already taken an English ship,
and two Dutch ships, very richly laden.
This latter part we found to concern us directly, and
though we knew it to be salse, yet, as my partner said,
very well, if we had sallen into their hands, and they had
such a prepossession against us besorehand, it had been in
vain for us to have desended ourselves, or to hope for any
good quarters at their hands; especially, considering that
our accusers had been our judges, and that we could have
expected nothing from them but what rage would have
dictated, and ungoverned paision have executed: and
theresore it was his opinion, we should go directly back
to Bengal, from whence we came, without putting in at
any port whatever; because there we could give an ac-
count of ourselves, and could prove where we were
when the ship put in, whom we bought her of, and the
like; and which was more than all the rest, if we were
put to the necessity os bringing it before the proper
judges, we should be sjre to have some justice; and not
be hanged sirst, and judged afterwards.
Vol. II. I I was
I was some time of my partner's opinion; but after a
little more serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was
a very great hazard for us to attempt returning to Ben-
gal, for that we were on the wrong side of the sheights
of Malacca; and that if the alarm was given, we should
be sure to be way-laid on every side, as well b)' the
Dutch of Batavia, as the English elsewhere; that if we
should be taken, as it were, running away, we should
even condemn ourselves, and there would want no more
evidence to destroy us. I also alked the English sailor's
opinion, who said, he was of my mind, and that we
should certainly be taken.
This danger a little startled my partner, and all the
ship's company; and we immediately resolved to go away
to the coast of Tonquin, and so.on to China; and from
thence pursuing the sirst design, as to trade, sind some
way or other to dispose of the ship, and come back in
some of the vessels of the country, such as we could
get. This was approved cf as the best method for our
security; and accordingly we steered away N. N. K.
keeping above sifty leagues osf from the usual course to
the eastward.
This, however, put us to some inoonveniencies; for
sirst, the winds, when we came to that distance from the
shore, seemed to be more steadily against us, blowing
almost trade, as we call it, from the east, and E. N. E.
so that we were a long while upon our voyage; and we
were but ill provided with Victuals for so long a run;
and, which was still worse, there was some danger, that
those English and Dutch ships, whose boats pursued us,
whereof some were bound that way, might be got in
besore us; and if not, some other ship, bound to China,
might have insormation of us front them, and pursue us
with the fame vigour*
I must consess, I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long boats,
to have been in the most dangerous coedition that ever
I was in through all my past lise ; for, whatever ill cir-
cumstances I had been in, I was never pursued for a
thief besore: nor had I ever done any thing that me-
rited the name of dishonest, or fraudulent, much less
thievish. I had chiefly been mine own enemy; or, as
I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my
own. But now I was embarrassed in the worst condition
imaginable; for though I was persectly innocent, I wai
in no condition to make that innocence appear. And
if I had been taken, it had been under a supposed guilt of
the worst kind; at least, a crime esteemed so among the
people I had to do with.
This made me very anxious to make an escape, though,
which way to do it, I knew not; or what port or place
we should go to. My partner, seeing me thus dejected,
though he was the most concerned at sirst, began to en-
courage me; and describing to me the several ports of
that coast, .told me, he would put in on the coast of
Cochinchina, or the bay of Tonquin; intending to go
afterwards to Macao, a town once in the possession of the
Portuguese, and where still a great many European sami-
lies resided, and particularly the missionary priests usually
went thither, in order to their going forward to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; and accordingly,
though after a tedious and irregular course, and very
much streightened for provisions, we came within sight
of the coast very early in the morning; and, upon re-
flection upon the past circumstances we were in, and tie
danger, if we had not escaped, we resolved to put into
a small river, which, however, had depth enough of
water for us, and to see if we could, either over-land,
or by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were
in any port thereabouts. This happy step was, indeed,
our deliverance; for though we did not immediately see
any European ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet, the next
morning, there came into the bay two Dutch ships, and
a third without any colours spread our, but which we
believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two
leagues distance, steering for the coast of China; and
in the afternoon went by two English ships, steering the
same course; and thus, we thought, we saw ourselves
beset with enemies, both one way and the other. The
place, we were in was wild and barbarous, the people
thieves, even by occupation or prosession; and though,
it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and, ex-
cept getting a sew provisions, cared not how little we
had to do with them, yet it wai with much difficulty

that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them seve-
ral ways.
We were in a small river of this country, within a
sew leagues of its utmost limits northward; and by
our boat we coasted north-east to the point of land
which opens to the great bay of Tonquin; and it was in
this beating up along the shore, that we discovered as
above, that in a word, we were surrounded with ene-
mies. The people we were among were the most bar-
barous of all the inhabitants of the coast; having no
correspondence with any other nation, and dealing
only in sish and oil, and such gross commodities; and
it may be particularly seen, that they are, as I said, the
most barbarous of any of the inhabitants; viz. that
among other customs they have this one, that if any
vessel had the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their
coast, they presently make the men all prisoners; that
is to say, slaves: and it was not long besore we found
a spice of their kindness this way, on the occasion fol-
lowing.
I have observed above, that our ship sprung a leak
at sea, and that we could not sind it out; and, however,
it happened, that, as I have said, it was stopped unex-
pectedly, in the happy minute of our being to be seized
by the Dutch and English ships, near the bay of Siam;
yet, as we did not sind the ship so persectly tight and sound
'as we desired, we resolved, while we were in this place,
to lay her on shore, take out what heavy things we had
on board, which were not many, and to wash and clean
her bottom; and, if possible, to sind out where the
Jeaks were.
Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought
gil our guns, and other moveable things, to one side,
we tried to bring her down, that we might come at her
bottom; for, on second thoughts, we did not care to lay
her dry aground, neither could we sind out a proper place
for it. .
T he inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with
such a sight, came wondering down to the shore to
Jook at us; and seeing the ship lie down on one side
in suph a manner, and heeling towards the shore, and
not seeing our men, who were at work on her bot-
tom)
torn, with stages, and with their boats on the off side,
they presently concluded that the ship was cast away, and
hy in so very sast on the ground.
On this supposition they came all about us in two or
three hours time, with ten or twelve large boats, having,
some of them eight, some ten men in a boat, intending,
no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the
ship, and is they had found us there, to have carried us
away for staves to their king, or whatever they call him,,
for we knew not who was their governor.'
When they came up to the ship, and began to row
round her, they discovered us all hard at work, .on the-
outside of the ship's bottom and side, washing, and
graving, and stopping, as every sea-saring man know*
how.
They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what their
design was; but, being willing to be sure, we took
this oppcrtunity to get some of us into the ship, and
others to hand down arms and ammunition to those
that were at work, to desend themselves with, if there
should be occasion; and it was no more than need;
for, in less than a quarter of an hour's consultation,
they agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a wreck;
rhat we were all. at work, endeavouring to save her, or
to" save- our lives by the help of our boats; and when?
we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded,
by that motion, that we were endeavouring to save
some of our goods. Upon this they took it for granted
they all belonged to them; and away they came di-
rectly upon our men, as if it had been in a line of
battle.
Our men, seeing so many of themi began to be'
frighted; for we lay but in an ill posture to sight, and
cried out to jus to know what they should do. I im-
mediately called to the men who worked upon the
stages to flip them down, and get up the side into
the ship; and bade those in the boat to row round and
come on board; and those sew of us who were on
board, worked with all the strength and hands we
had, to bring the ship to rights; but, however, neither
the men.upon the stage, nor those in the boats, could
I 3 do
Robin
do as they were ordered, besore the Cochinchinesc were
upon them; and, with two of their boats boarded our
long boar, and began to lay hold of the men as their
prisoners.
The sirst man they laid hold of was an English seaman,
a stout strong sellow, who having a musquet in his hand,
never offered to sire it, but laid it down in the boat, like
a fool, as I thought. But he understood his business bet-
ter than I could teach him; for he grappled the Pagan,
and dragged him by main sorce out ot their own boat
into ours; where, taking him by the two ears, he beat
his head so against the boat's gunnel, that the sellow
died instantly in his hands; and in the mean time, a
Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musquet, and
vv ith the but end of it, so laid about him, that he knock-
ed down sive of them, who attempted to enter the boat;
but this was little towards resisting thirty or forty men,
who searless, because ignorant of their danger, began to
throw themselves into the long boat, where we had but
sive men to defend it: but one accident gave our men a
complete victory, which deserved our laughter rather
than any rhing else; and that was this:
Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of
she ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had
caulked her, to stop the leaks, had got two kettles just
Jet down into the boat; one silled with boiling pitch,
and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and such stusf
as the shipwrights used for that work; and the man that
tended the carpenter had a great iron laddie in his hand,
with which he supplied the men that were at work with
that hot stuff; two of the enemy's men entered the
boat just where this sellow stood, being in the fore-
sbeets; he immediately saluted them with a ladlesul of
the stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and scalded them,
being half naked, that they roared out like two bulls,
and enraged with the sire, leaped both into the sea.
The carpenter saw it, and cried out, Well done, Jack,
give them more of it; when, stepping forward him-
lelf, he takes one of their mops, and dipping it in
the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among them so
plentisully, that, in short, of all the men in three boats,
there was not one that was not scalded and burnt with

it in a most frightsul, pitisul manner, and made such an
howling and crying, that I never heard a worse noise,
and, indeed, nothing like it; for it was worth observ-
ing, that though pain naturally makes all people cry
out, yet every nation have a particular way of excla^
mation, and make noises as disserent from one another
as their speech. I cannot give the noise these crea-
tures made a better name than howling, nor a name
more proper to the tone of it; for I never heard any
thing more like the noise of the wolves, which, as I
have said, I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of
Languedoc.
I was never pleased With a victory better in my lise;
not only as it was a persect surprise to me, and that our
danger was imminent besore; but as we got this victo-
ry without any bloodshed, except of that man the sellow
killed with his naked hands, and which I was very much
concerned at; for I was sick of killing such poor savage
wretches, even though it was in my own desence, know-
ing they came on errands which they thought just, and
knew no better; and that though it may be a just thing,
because necessary, for there is no necessary wickedness in
nature; yet I thought it was a sad lise, when we mull be
always obliged to be killing our sellow-creatures to pre-
serve ourselves; and, indeed, I think so still; and I
would, even now, suffer a great deal, rather than I
would take away the lise even of the worst person injur-
ing me. I believe also, all considering people, who know
the value of lise, would be of my opinion, if they en-
tered seriously into the consideration of it.
But to return to my story; all the while this was do-
ing, my partner and I, who managed the rest of the mem
on board, had, wilh great dexterity, brought the ship
almost to rights; and, having gotten the guns into their
places again, the gunner called to me, to bid our boat
get out of the way, for he would let fly among them. I
called back again to him, arid bid him not offer to sire,
for the carpenter would do the work without him; but
bade him heat another pitch kettle; which our cook,
who was on board, took care of. But the enemy was so
terrisied with what they met with in their sirst attack,,
that they would not come on again; and some of them,
I 4. that
that were sarthest off, seeing the ship swim, as it were,
upright, began, as we supposed, to see their mistake,
and gave over the enterprise, sinding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear ot' this merry sight; and,
having gotten some rice, and some roots and bread,
with about sixteen good big hogs, on board, two dayi
besore, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go for-
ward, whatever came of it; for we made no doubt
but we should be surrounded the next day with rogues
enough, perhaps more than our pitch-kettle would dis-
'pose of sor us.
We, theresore, got all our things on board the sam»
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. In
the mean time, lying at an anchor some distance from
t he shore, we were not so much concerned, being now
in a lighting posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if
any enemy had presented. The next day, having sinish-
ed our work within board, and sinding our ship was
persectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail; we would
have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to
insorm ourselves of what was to be known concerning
the Dutch ships that had been there; but we durst not
jland in there, because we had seen several ships go in,
as we fupposfe, but a little besore ; so we kept on N. E.
towards the isle of Formosa, as much afraid of being
feea by a Dutch or English merchant ship, as a Dutch
or Engliso merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an
_/\lgerine man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E. as
jf we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine islands,
jxrid this we did, that we might not fall into the way of
any of the European ships; and then we steered north
again, till we came to the latitude of 22 deg. 20 min.
Jjy which means we made the island of Formosa directly,
,vvhere we came to ar. anchor, in order to get water and
freso provisions, which the people there, who are very
courteous and civil in their manners, supplied us with
willingly, and dealt very sairly and punctually with us in
all their agreements and bargains; which is what we did
fiot sind among other people; and may be owing to the
j-emains of" Christianity, which was once planted hereby
a Dutch missionary of Protestants, and is a testimony

of what I have often observed, viz. that the christian re-
ligion always civilizes the people, and resorms their man-
ners, where it is received, whether it works saving ef-
sects upon them or no.
From hence we sailed still north, keeping the coast
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were be-
yond all the ports of China, where our European ships
usually come; being resolved, if possible, not to sall into
imy of their hands, especially in this country, where, as
oqr circumstances were, we could not sail of being en-
tirely ruined; nay, so great was my sear in particular,
as to my being taken by them, that I believe sirmly I
would much rather have chosen to sall into the hands of
the Spanish inquisition.
Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we re-
solved to put into the sirst trading port we should come
at; and, standing in for the shore, a boat came off two
leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on board,
who, know ing us to be an European ship, came to offer
his service, which, indeed, we were very glad of, and
took him on board : upon which, without asking us whi-
ther we would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and.
sent it back.
I thought it was now so- much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began,
to talk with him about carrying of us to the Gulph of
Nanquin, which is the most northern part of the coast of
China. The old man said he knew the Gulph of Nan-
quin very well; but, smiling, asked us what we would'
do there?
I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase
China wares, callicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
&c. and so would return by the same course we came..
He told us our best port had been to have put in at Ma-
cao, where we could not sail of a market sor our opium,
to our satissaction, and might, for our money, have
purchased all sorts of China goods, as cheap as we could
at Nanquin.
Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,,
of which he was very opiniated, or conceited, I told,
him, we were gentlemen, as well as merchants; and
that we had a mjnd to go and see the great city of
I 5 Pekiu,.
Pckin, and the samous court of the monarch of China.
.Why then, says the old man, you should go to Ningpo,
where, by the river that runs into the sea there, you may
go up within sive leagues of the great canal. This
canal is a navigable made stream, which goes through
the heart of all that vast empire of China, crosses all the
rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help of
sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin, being
in length near 270 leagues.
Well, said I, Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our
business now: the great question is, If you can carry
us up to the city of Nanquin, from whence we can travel
to Pekin afterwards? Yes, he said, he could do so very
well, and there was a great Dutch ship gone up that
way just besore. This gave me a little shock; a Dutch
ship was now our terror, and we had much rather have
met the devil, at least if he had not come in too fright-
ful a sigure: we depended upon it, that a Dutch ship
would be our destruction, for we were in no condition to
sight them: all the ships they trade with in those para
being of great burden, and of much greater force than
we were.
The old man found me a little consused, and under
some concern, when he named a Duteh ship; and said
to me, Sir, you need be under no apprehension of the
.Dutch, I suppose they are not now at war with your na-
tion. No, said I, that's true; but I know not what li-
berties men may take, when they are out of the reach
of the laws of their country. Why, said he, you are
no pirates, what need you sear? They will not meddle
with peaceable merchants sure.
If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up
into my sace at that word, it was hindered by some
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circulate it; for
it put me into the greatest disorder and consusion imagin-
able; nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but
that the old man easily perceived it.
Sir, said he, I sind you are in some disorder in your
thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which
way you think sit; and, depend upon it, I'll do you all
the service I can. Why, Seignior, said I, it is true, I
jun a little unsettled in my resolutioa at this time, whither
to go in particular; and I am something more so, for
what you said about pirates; I hope there are no pirates
in these seas, we are but in an ill condition to meet with
them; for you see we have but a small force, and but
very weakly manned.
O, Sir, said he, do not be concerned, I do not know
that there have been any pirates in these seas these sifteen
years, except one, which was seen, as I hear, in the bay
of Siam, about a month since; but you may be assured
she is gone to the southward; nor was she a ship of any
great force, or sit for the work; me was not built for a
privateer, but was run away with by a reprobate crew
that were on board, after the captain and some of his men
had been murdered by the Malaccans, at or near the
island of Sumatra.
What! said I, seeming to know nothing os the mat'-
ter, Did they murder the captain? No, said he, I do
not understand that they murdered him; but, as they
afterwards ran away with the ship, it is generally believed
they betrayed him into the hands of the Malaccans, who
did murder him; and, perhaps, they procured them to-
do it- Why then, said I, they deserve death, as much
as if they had done it themselves. Nay, said the old
man, they do deserve it; and they will certainly have
k- if they light upon any English or Dutch ship ; for they
have all agreed together, that, if they meet that rogue,
they will give bin* no- quarter.
But, said I to him, you say the pirate is gone outo£
these seas: how can they meet with him then? Why,,
that is true, said he, they do say so; but he was, as I
tell you, in the bay of Siam, in the river Cambodia, and
was discovered there by some Dutchmen who belonged to
the ship, and who were lest on shore when they run-
away with her; and some English and Dutch traders
being in the river, they were within a. little of taking
him. Nay, said he, if the foremost boats had been well
seconded by the rest,, they had certainly taken, him; but
he, sinding only two boats within reach of him, tacked
about, and sired at these two, and disabled them, besore-
the other came up; and then, standing off to sea, the;
other were not able to follow him, and so he got away..
But they have all so exact a description, of the ship, that •,

hey will be sure to know him ; and where-evcr they sind
him, they have vowed to give no quarter to either the
captain, or the seamen, but to hang them all up at the
yard-arm.
What! said I, will they execute them right or wrong,
hang them sirst, and judge'them afterwards? 0, Sir! said
the old pilot, there is no need to make a formal business
of it with such rogues as those; let them tie them back to
back, and set them a diving; it is no more than they
rightly deserve.
i knew I had my old man sast aboard, and that he
could do me no harm; so that I turned short upon him:
Well, now, Seignior, said I, and this is the very reason
why I would have you carry us to Nanquin, and not to
put back to Macoa, or to any other part of the coun-
try where the English or Dutch ships come; for, be it
known to you, Seignior, those captains of the English
and Dutch ships are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fel-
lows, that neither know what belongs to justice, or how
to behave themselves, as the laws of God and nature di-
rest; but being proud of their ossices, and not under-
standing their power, they would act the murderers to
punish robbers; would take upon them to insult men
falsely accused, and determine them guilty without due
enquiry; and perhaps I may live to call some of them to
an account for it, where they may be taught how justice
is to be executed; and that no man ought to be treated
us a criminal till some evidence may be had of the
crime, and that he is the man.
With this I told him, that this was the very ship they
had attacked; and gave him a sull account of the Ikir-
xnish we had with their boats, and how foolishly and
coward-like they had teha\ed. I told him all the stor-
es cur buying the ship, and how the Dutchmen served
us. I told him the reasons I had to believe that thls
story of killing the master by the Malaccans was not
true; as also the running away with the ship; but that
jt was all a siction of their own, to suggest that the men
were turned pirates ; and they ought to have been sure
it was so, besore they had ventured to attack us by sur-
prise, and oblige us to resist them; adding, that they
mild have the blc

would have the blood of those men, who were killed
there, in our just desence, to answer for.
The old man was amazed at this relation; and told us,
we were very much in the right to go away to the norths
and that if he might advise us, it should be to sell the
ship in China, which we might very well do, and buy ot
build another in the country: andx said he, though you
will not get so good a ship, you may get one able enough
to carry you and all your goods back again to Bengal,
or any where else.
I told him I would take his advice, when I came to
any port where I could sind a ship for my turn, or get
any customer to buy this. He replied, I should meet
with customers enough for the ship at Nanquin, and that
a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go back
again; and that he would procure me people both to buy
one, and sell the other.
Well, but, Seignior, says I, as you say they know the
ship so well, I may, perhaps, if I follow your measures,
be instrumental to bring some honest innocent men into
a terrible broil, and, perhaps, be murdered in cold blood;
for wherever they sind the ship, they will prove the
guilt upon the men, by proving this was the ship;
and so innocent men may probably be overpowered and
murdered. Why, said the old man, I'll sind out a way
to prevent that also ; for as I know all those commanders
you speak of very well, and shall see them all as they
pass by, I will be sure to set them to rights in the thing,
and let them know that they had been so much in the
wrong; that though the people, who were on board at
sirst might run away with the ship, yet it was not true
that they had turned pirates; and that in particular those
were not the men that sirst went osf with the ship, but
innocently bought her for their trade 1 and I am per-
suaded they will so sar believe me, as, at least, to act
more cautiously for the time to come. Well, said I, and
will you deliver one message to them from me? Yes,
I will, says he, if you will give it under your hand, in.
writing, that I may be able to prove it came from you,
and not out of my own head. I answered, that I would
readily give it him under my hand. So 1 took a pen,
and ink, and paper, and wrote at large the story of
assaulting
assaulting me with the long-boats, &c. the pretended
reason ot' it, and the unjust cruel design of it; and con-
cluded to the commanders, that they had done what they
not only should have been ashamed of, but also, that if
ever they came to England, and I lived to see them
there, they should all pay dearly for it, if the laws of
my country were not grown out of use besore I arrived
there.
My old pilot read this over and over again, and asked
me several times if I would stand to it. I answered, I
would stand to it as long as I had any thing left in the
world; being sensible that I should, one time or other,
sind an opportunity to put it home to them. But
we had no occasion ever to let the pilot carry this let-
ter; for he never went back again. While those things
were passing between us, by way of discourse, we went
forward directly for Nanquin, and, in about thirteen days
fail, came to anehor at the south-west point of the
freat gulph of Nanquin; where, by the way, I came
y accident to understand, that the two Dutch ships
,were gone that length besore me, and that I should cer-
tainly sall into their hands. I consulted my partner
again in this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as
I was, and would very gladly have been sase on shore
almost any-where. However, I was not in such perplex-
ity neither, but asked the old pilot, if there was no
creek, or harbour, which I might put into, and pursue
my business with the Chinese privately, and be in no
danger os the enemy ? He told me, if I would sail to
the southward, about two and forty leagues, there was
a little port called Quinchang, where the sathers of the
mission usually landed from Macao, on their progress to
teach the christian religion to the Chinese, and where no
European ships ever put in; and, if I thought proper to
put in there, I might consider what sarther course to
take when I was on shore. He consessed, he said, it was
jiot a place for merchants, except that at some certain
times they had a kind of a sair there, when the mer-
chants from Japan came over thither to buy the Chinese
merchandizes.
We all agreed to go back to this place; the name of
the port, as he called it, I may, perhaps spell wwng:
lor
for I do not particularly remember it, having lost this,
together with the names of many other places set down
p; in a little pocket-book, which was spoiled by the water,
on an accident which I shall relate in its order; but this
I remember, that the Chinese or Japanese merchants we
correspond with, call it by a different name from that
which our Portuguese pilot gave it, and pronounced it as
above, Quinchang.
As we were unanimous in'our resolutions to go to this
place,'we weighed the next day, having only gone twice
onshore, where we were to get freshwater; on both
which occasions the people of the country were very civil
to us, and brought us abundance of things to sell to us;
I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea, rice, and some
fowls; but nothing without money.
'We came to the other port (the wind being contrary)
:.- not till sive days; but it was very much to our satissac-
T' •" tion; and I was joysul, and, I may say, thanksul, when
k ' I set my foot sase on shore; resolving, and my partner
Bi-.-too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and es-
| Ojfects any other way, though not every way to our satis-
saction, we would never set one foot on board that un-
happy vessel again; and indeed, I must acknowledge,
that of all the circumstances of lise that ever 1 had any
experience^ of, nothing makes mankind so completely
miserable as that of being in constant sear. Well does
the scripture say, "The sear of man brings a snare;"
it is a lise of death; and the mind is so entirely suppres-
3.K sed by it, that it is capable of no relies; the animal spi-
lt!' rits sink, and all the vigour of nature, which usually
V.' • supports men under other afflictions, and is present to
B, them in the greatest exigencies, sails them here.
Nor did it sail of its usual operations upon the sancy,
It-* -%y heightening every danger; representing the English
and Dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing rea-
son, or distinguishing between honest men and rogues;
kL.- , or between a story calculated for our own turn, made
E . out of nothing, on purpose to deceive, and a true ge«
II*' nuine account of our whole voyage, progress, and de-
ls ' sign; for we might many ways have convinced any
P' reasonable creature that we were not pirates; the
goods we had on board, the course we steered, out
frankly
frankly shewing ourselves, and entering into such and
such ports; even our very manner, the force we had,
the number of men, the sew arms, little ammunition,
and short provisions; all these would have served to con-
vince any man that we were no pirates! The opium,
and other goods we had on board, would make it appear
the ship had been at Bengal; the Dutchmen, who, it was
said, had the names os all the men that were in the ship,,
might easily see that we were a mixture of English, Por-
tuguese, and Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board.
These, and many other particular circumstances, might
have made it evident to the understanding of any com-
mander, whose hands we might fall into,, that we were
no pirates.
But sear, that blind useless passion, worked another
v/ay, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our
understandings, and set the imagination at work, to
form a thousand terrible things, that, perhaps, might
pever happen ; we sirst supposed, as, indeed, every body
had related to us, that the seamen on board the English
and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch, were so en-
raged at the name of a pirate, and especially at our
beating osf their boats, and escaping, that they would
not give themselves leave to enquire whether we were
pirates or no; but would execute us offhand, as we call
j t, without giving us any room for a desence. We re-
flected that there was really so much apparent evidence
before them, that they would scarce enquire after any
niore; as, sirst, that the ship was certainly the same,
and that some of the seamen among them knew her,
and had been on board her; and, secondly, that when
vve had intelligence at the river Cambodia, that they
-were coming down to examine us, we sought their boats,
and fled; so that we made no doubt but they were as
fully satissied of our being pirates, as we were satissied
0{ the contrary; and I often said, I knew not but I
should have been apt to have taken the little circum-
stances for evidence, if the tables were turned, and my
case was theirs; and have made no scruple of cutting
all the crew to pieces, without believing, or, perhaps,
considering, what they might haye to pffer in their
But let that be how it will, those were our apprehen-
sions; and both my partner and 1 too scarce flept a
night without dreaming of halters, and yard-arms;
that is to say, gibbets; of sighting, and being taken;
of killing, and being killed; and one night 1 was in
luch a sury in my dream, sancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my double sist against the side'of
the cabin I lay in, with such a force as wounded my
hand most grievou fly, broke my knuckles, and cut and
bruised the flesh; so that it not only waked me out of my
sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost two of my
singers.
Another apprehension I had, was, of the cruel usage
we should meet with from them, if we sell into their
hands: then the story of Amboyna came into mv head,
and how the Dutch might, perhaps, torture us, as ihey
did our countrymen there; and make some of our mtin,
by extremity of torture, consess those crimes they
never were guilty of; own themselves, and all of us, to
be pirates; and so they would put us to death, with a
formal appearance of justice; and that they might b«
tempted to do this, for the gain of our ship and cargo,
which was worth four or sive thousand pounds, put all
together.
These things tormented me, and ray partner too, night
and day; nor did we consider that the captains of ships
have no authority to act thus; and if we had surrendered
prisoners to them, they could not answer the destroying
us, or torturing us, but would be accountable for it
when they came into their own country. This, I say,
gave me no satissaction; for, if they will act thus with
us, what advantage would it be to us that they would be
called to an account for it; or, if we were sirst to be
murdered, what satissaction would it be to us to have
them punished when they came home?
I cannot resrain taking notice here what reflections I
now had upon the past variety of my particular circum-
stances ; how hard I thought it was, that I, who had spent
forty years in a lise of continued dissiculties, and was, at
last, come, as it were, at the port or haven which all
men drive at, viz. to have rest and plenty, should be a
volunteer
volunteer in new sorrows, by my own unhappy choice;
and that I, who had escaped so many dangers in my
youth, should now come to be hanged in my old age,
and in so remote a place, for a crime I was not in the
least inclined to, much less guilty of; and in a place and
circumstance, where innocence was not like to be any pro-
tection at all to me.
After these thoughts, something of religion would
come in; and I would be considering that this seemed
to Die to be a disposition of immediate Providence; and
I ought to look upon it, and and submit to it, as such;
that although I was innocent as to men, I was sar from
being innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look
in, and examine what other crimes in my life were
incst obvious to me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this punishment as a retribution ; and that I
ought to submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck,
if it had pleased God to have brought such a disaster
upon me.
In its turn, natural courage would sometimes take
its place; and then I would be talking myself up to
vigorous resolution, that I would not be taken to be
barbarously used by a parcel of merciless wretches in
cold blood; that it was much better to have sallen into
the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters, and
who, I was sure, would seast upon me when they had
taken me, than by those who would, perhaps, glut their
rage upon me, by inhuman tortures and barbarities;
that, in the case of the savages, I always resolved to
die sighting to the last gasp; and why mould I not do
so now, seeing it was much more dreadsul, to me at least,
to think of salling into these men's hands, than ever it
was to think of being eaten by men: for the savages,
give them their due, would not eat a man till he was
dead; and killed him sirst, as we do a bullock; but
that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty ot
death. Whenever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure
to put myself into a kind of sever with the agitations
of a supposed sight; my blood would boil, and my eyes
sparkle, as if I was engaged: and I always resolved
that I would take no.quarter at their hands; but even
at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the
ship.
211
{hip, and all that was in her, and leave them but little
booty to boast of.
But how much the greater weight the anxieties and per-
plexities of those things were to our thoughts while we
were at sea, by so much the greater was our satissaction,
when we saw ourselves on shore; and my partner told
me, he dreamed, that he had a very heay load upon his
back, which he was to carry up an hill, and found that
he was not able to stand long under it; but the Portu-
guese pilot came, and took it off his back, and the hill
disappeared, the ground besore him shewing all smooth
and plain: And truly it was so; we were all like men
who had a load taken off their backs.
For my part I had a weight taken off from my
heart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and, as
I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that
ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot, who was
now our friend, got us a lodging, and a warehouse
for our goods, which, by the way, was much the same;
it was a little house or hut, with a large house joining
to it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with
large canes, to keep out pilsering thieves, of which it
seems there were not a sew in the country. However,
the magistrates allowed us all a little guard, and we had
a soldier with a kind of halbert, or half pike, who'
stood centinel at our door; to whom we allowed a pint
of rice, and a little piece of money, about the value of
three pence, per day, so that our goods were kept very
sase.
The sair, or mart, usually kept in this place, had been
over some time; however, we found that there were three
or four junks in the river, and two Japanners, I mean,
ships from Japan, with goods which they had bought in
China, and were not gone away, having Japanese mer-
chants on shore.
The sirst thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us, was,
to bring us acquainted with three missionary Romish
priests, who were in the town, and who had been there
some time, converting the people to Christianity; but we
thought they made but poor work of it; and made them
but lorry Christians when they had done. However,
that was not our business. One of these was a French-
man,
man, whom they called sather Simon; he was a jolly
vvell-coniiitioned man, very free in his conversation,
not seeming so serious and grave as the other two did,
one of whom was a Portuguese, and the other a Genoese;
but sather Simon was courteous, easy in his manner, and
very agreeable company; the other two were more re-
served, seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously
to the work they came about, viz. to talk with, and
insinuate themselves among the inhabitants, wherever
they had opportunity; we often eat and drank with
those men: and though I must consess, the conversion, as
they call it, of theChinesc to Christianity, is so far from
the true conversion required, to bring heathen people to
the faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little more
than letting them know the name of Christ, fay sonw
prayers to the Virgin Mary, and her Son, in a tongm
which they understand not, and to cross themselves,
and the like; yet it must be consessed, that these re-
ligious, whom we call Missionaries, have a sirm belief
mat these people should he saved, and that they are the
instruments of it; and, on this account, they undergo
not only the satigue of the voyage, and hazards of
living in such places, but oftentimes death itself, with
the most violent tortures, for the sake of this workt
and it would be a great want of charity in us, whatever
opinion we have of the work itself, and the manner of
their doing it, if we should not have a good opinion of
their zeal, who undertake k with so many hazards, and
who have no prospect of the least temporal advantage to-
themselves.
But to return to my story: This French priest, sather
Simon, was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief
if the mission, to go up to Pckin, the royal seat of the-
-hinese emperor; and waited only for another priest,
•ho was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along
ith him; and we scarce ever met together, but he was
vising me to go that journey with him, telling me,
w he would shew me all the glorious things ot that
ghty empire; and among the rest, the greatest citv
the world; a city, said he, that your London, and
Paris, put together, cannot be equal to. This was
city of Pekin, which, I consess, is very great, and
insinitely
insinitely sull of people; but, as I looked on those
things with disserent eyes from other men, so I shall
give my opinion of them in sew words, when I ccme,
in the course of my travels, to speak more particularly
of them.
But siist, I come to my friar or missionary: Dining
with him one day, and being very merry together,
I shewed some little inclination to go with him; and he
pressed me and my partner very hard, and with a great
many persuasions, to consent. Why, sather Simon, says
my partner, why should you desire our company so
much ? You know we are heretics, and you do hot love
us, nor can keep us company with any pleasure. O!
says he, you may, perhaps, be good catholics in time;
my business here is to convert heathens; and who knows
but I may convert you too. Very well, sather, said I,
so you will preach to us all the way. I won't be trou-
blesome to you, said he; our religion does not divest us
of good manners; besides, said he, we are here like
countrymen; and so we are, compared to the place we
are in; and if you are hugonots, and I a catholic, we
may be all Christians at last; at least, said he we are
all gentlemen, and we may converse so, without being
uneasy to one another. I liked that part of his dis-
course very well, and it began to put me in mind of my
priest that I had lest in the Brasils; but this sather
Simon did not come up to his character by a great deal;
for though sather Simon had no appearance of a crimi-
nal levity in him neither, yet he had not that sund of
Christian zeal, strict piety, and •sincere affection to re-
ligion, that my other good ecclesiastic had, of whom
I have said so much.
But to leave him a little, though he never lest us, nor
soliciting us to go with him, but we had something
else besore us at that time; for we had, all this while,
our ship and our merchandize to dispose of; and we
began to be very doubtsul what we should do, for we
were now in a place of very little business; and once I
was about to venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and
the city of Nanquin: But Providence seemed now more
visibly, as I thought, than ever, to concern itself in our
affairs; and I was encouraged from this very time to
. think,

think, I should, one way or other, get out of this entan.
gled circumstance, and be brought home to my own
country again ; though I had not the least view'of the
manner; and when I began sometimes to think of it,
could not imagine by what method it was to be done.
Providence, I say, began here to clear up our way a
little; and the sirst thing that ossered was, that our old
Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who
!>egan to enquire what goods we had; and, in the sirst
place, he bought all our opium, and gave us a very good
price for it, paying us in gold by weight, some in
small peices of their own coin, and some in small
wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. While we
*ere dealing with him for our opium, it came into my
head, that he might, perhaps, deal with us for the ship
roo ; and I ordered the interpreter to propose it to him.
He shrunk up his shoulders at it, when it was sirst pro-
>osed to him; but, in a sew days after, he came to me,
vith one of the missionary priests for his interpreter, and
iold me, he had a proposal to make to me, and that was
ihis: He had bought a great quantity of goods of us
vhen he had no thoughts (or proposals made to him)
)f buying the ship; and that, theresore, he had not
noney enough to pay for the ship; but if I would let
he same men who were in the ship navigate her, he
vould hire the ship to go to Japan, and would send
hem from thence to the Philippine islands with another
oading, which he would pay the freight of, before
hey went from Japan; and that, at their return, he
vould buy the ship. I began to listen to this proposal,
ind so eager did my head still run upon rambling, that
could not but begin to entertain a notion myself os
;oing with him, and so to sail from the Philippine islands
.way to the South Seas; and accordingly I asked the
apanese merchant, if he would not hire us to the
'hilippine islands, and discharge us there? He said, No,
le could not do that ; for then he eould not have the re-
urn of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan,
le said, at the ship's return. Well, still 1 was for taking
lim at that proposal, and going myself; but my partner,
/iser than myself, persuaded me from it, representing
he dangers, as well of the seas, as of the Japanese, who

area salse, cruel, and treacherous people; and then of
the Spaniards at the Philippines; more salse, more cruel,
more treacherous, than they.
But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a con-
clusion; the sirst: thing we had to ao, was to consult
with the captain of the ship, and with the men, and
know if they were willing to go to Japan; and, while
I was doing this, the young man, whom, as I said, my
nephew had lest wkh me as my companion for my
travels, came to me and told me, that he thought that
-voyage promised very sair, and that there was a great
prospect of advantage, and he would be very glad if I
undertook it; but that if I would not, and would give
him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I pleased
to order him; that if ever he came to England, and
I was there, and alive, he would render me a saithsul
account of his success, and it mould be as much mine as
I pleased.
I was really loth to part with him; but, considering
the prospect of advantage, which was really considerable,
and that he was a young sellow as likely to do well in
it as any I knew, I inclined to let him go; but sirst 1
told him I would consult my partner, and give him an
answer the next day. My partner and I discoursed
about it; and my partner made a most generous offer:
he told me, you know it has been an unlucky ship, and
we both resolve not to go to sea in it again, if your steward
(so he called my man) will venture the voyage, I'll leave
my mare of the vessel to him, and let him make the best
of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets
with success abroad, he shall account for one half of
the prosits of the ship's freight to us, the other shall be
his own.
If my partner, who was no way concerned with my
young man, made him such an osser, I could do no
less than offer him the same; and all the ship's com-
pany being willing to go with him, we made over half
the ship to him in property, and took a writing from
him, obliging him to account for the other; and away
he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very
punctual honest man to him, protected him at Japan, and
got him a licence to come on shore, which the Europeans
in general have not lately obtained; paid him his freight
very punctually, sent him to the Philippines, loaded wiih
Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own,
who trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back Euro-
pean goods again, and a great quantity of cloves, and
other spice; and there he was not only paid his freight
very well, and at a very good price, but being not wil-
ling to sell the ship then, the merchant surnished him
with goods on his own account; that, for some money,
and some spices of his own, which he brought with
him, he went back to the Manillas, to the Sjaniards,
where he fold his cargo very well. Here, having got-
ten a good acquaintance at Manilla, he got his (hip
made a free ship; and the governor of Manilla hired him
to go to Acapulco in America, on the coast of Mexico;
and gave him a licence to land there, and travel to Mexi-
co; and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe, with all
his men.
He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and
there he fold his ship; and having there also obtained
allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he found
means, some how or other, to go to Jamaica with all
^is treasure; and about eight years after came to Eng-
land, exceedingly rich; of which I shall take notice in
its place; in the mean time, I return to our particular
affairs.
Being now ,to part with the ship, and ship's com-
pany, it came besore us, of course, to consider what
recompence we should give to the two men, that
gave us such tiirely notice of the design against us in
the river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had
done us a considerable service, and deserved well at our
hands; theugh, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues too; for, as they believed the story ot our
being pirates, and that we had really run away with the
ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
design that was formed against us, but to go to sea
with us as pirates; and one of them consessed after-
wards, that nothing else but the hopes of going a
roguing brought him to do it. However, the ser-
vice they did us was not the less; and therefore, as 1
had promised to be gratesul to them, I sirst ordered the
. money
s^Money to be paid to them, which they said was due
'to them on board their respective ships; that i9 to
fry, the Englishmen nineteen months pay, and to the
Dutchmen seven; and, over and above that, I gave each
x of them a small sum of money in gold, which con-
futed them very well; then I made ihe Englishman gun-
,fr of the ship, the gunner being now made second
iate and purser; the Dutchman I made boatswain;
Jf£> they were both very well pleased, and proved very
t'jscrviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout
sellows.
We were now on shore in China. If I thought myself
~nished, and remote from my own country, at Bengal,
where I had many ways to get home for my money,
[Jwhat could I think of myself now, when I was gotten
about a thousand leagues sarther osf from home,
and persectly destitute of all manner of prospect os
return!
All we had for it was this : that in about four months
'time there was to be another sair at that place where we
were,, and then we riiight be able to purchase all sorts of
the manusactures of the country, and withal might pos-
sibly sind some Chinese junks or vessels from Nanquin,
.that would be to be sold, and would carry us and our
goods whither we pleased. This I liked very well, and
resolved to wait; besides, as our particular persons were
not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships cam*
thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to load
l*0«r go ids, and get passage to some other place in India
-nearer home.
Upon these hopes we resolved to contiuue here;
but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
njes into the country; sirst, we went ten days jour-
Sjfiey to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth
I.ffeeing indeed; they say it has a million of people in
which, however, I do not believe: it is regularly
T»uilt, the streets all exactly strait, and cross one ano-
Bwber in direct lines, which gives the sigure of it great
j^avantage.
But when I came to compare the miserable people of
these countries with ourr; their sabrics, their man-
ner of living, their government, their religion, their
Vol. II. k. wealth,
wealth, and their glory (as some call it) I must confess,
I do not so much as think it worth naming, «r worth
roy while to write of, or any that shall come after me
to read.
It is very observable, that we wonder at the gran-
deur, the riches, the pomp, the ceremonies, the go-
vernment, the manusactures, the commerce, and the con-
duct of these people; not that they are to be wondered
at, or indeed, in the least to be regarded; but because,
having sirst a notion of the barbarity of those coun-
tries, the rudeness and .the ignorance that prevail
there, we do not expect to sind any such things so far
•off.
Othewise, what are their buildings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to
.the universal commerce of England, Holland, France,
and Spain? What their cities to ours, Tor wealth,
strength, gaiety of apparel, rich surniture, and an in-
sinite variety? What are their ports, supplied with a
sew junks and barks, to our navigation, our mer-
chants fleets, our large and powersul navies? Our
city of London has more trade than all their mighty
empire. One English, or Dutch, or French man of
war of 80 guns, would sight with, and destroy, all the
shipping of China. But the greatness of their wealth,
their trade, the power of their government, and
strength of their armies, are surprising to us, because,
as I have said, considering them as a barbarous nation
os' pagans, little better than savages, we did not expect
such things among them; and this, indeed, is the ad-
vantage with which all their greatness and power is re-
presented to us; otherwise it is in itself nothing at all;
for, as I have laid of their ships, so it may be said of
their armies and troops; all the forces of their em-
pire, though they were to bring two millions of men
jnto the sield together, would be able to do nothing but
j-uin the country, and starve themselves. If they were
to besiege a strong town in Flanders, or to sight a dis-
ciplined army, one line os German cuirassiers, or of
French cavalry, would overthrow all the horse of China;
or a million of their foot could not stand besore one em-
battled body of our insantry, posted so as not to be sur-
rounded,
rounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in
number; nay, I do not boast if I say, that 30,000
German or English foot, and 10,000 French horse,
would sairly beat all the forces of China. And so of
our fortisied towns, and of the art of our engineers,
in assaulting and desending towns; there is not a forti.
sied town in China could hold out one month against
the batteries and attacks of an European army; and at
the same time, all the armies of China could never
take such a town as Dunkirk, provided it was not
starved; no, not in ten years siege. They have sire-
arms, it is true, but they are awkward, clumsy, and
uncertain in going osf; they have powder, but it is of
no strength; they have neither discipline in the sield,
exercise in their arms, skill to attack, or temper to re-
treat; and theresore I must consess it seemed strange to
me when I came home, and heard our people say such
sine things of the power, riches, glory, magnisicence,
and trade of the Chinese, because I saw and knew that
they were a contemptible herd, or crowd of ignorant
sordid staves, subjected to a government qualisied only
to rule such a people; and, in a word, for I am now
launched quite beside my design, I say, in a word, were
not its distance inconceivably great from Muscovy, and
were not the Muscovite empire almost as rude, impotent,
and ill-governed a crowd of slaves as they, the Czar of
Muscovy might, with much ease, drive them all out of
their country, and conquer them in one campaign;
and had the Czar, who I since hear is a growing prince,
and begins to appear formidable in the world, sallen
this way, instead of attacking the warlike Swedes, in
which attempt none of the powers of Europe would have
envied or interrupted him, he might, by this time, have
been einpcrcr of China, instead of being beaten by the
king of Sweden at Narva, when the latter was not one
to six in number. As their strength and their gran-
deur, so their navigation, commerce, and hulbandry,
is impersect and impotent, compared to the same things
in Europe; also, in their knowledge, their learning,
their stall in the sciences, they have globes and spheres,
and a smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics;
but when you come to enquire into their knowledge,
K 2 how
ow short-sighted are the wisest of their students!
Iicy know nothing of the motion of the heavenly ha-
les; and so grossly, absurdly ignorant, that when the
un is eclipsed, they think it is a great dragon has as-
aulted and run away with it, and they sall a clatter-
ng with all the drums and kettles in the country, to
right the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm
)i bees.
As this is the only excursion of this kind which I
iave made in all the account I have given of my
ravels, so I shall make no more descriptions of coun-
ties and people ; it is none of my business, or any part
lf my design; but giving an account of my own ad-
ventures, through a lise of insinite wanderings, and
i long variety of changes, which, perhaps, sew have
beard the like of, I shall say nothing of the mighty
places, desert countries, and numerous people, I ha\e
^ et to pass through, more than relates to my own
story, and which my concern among them will make
pecessary, I was now, as near as I can compute, in
the heart of China, about the latitude of thirty de-
grees north of the line, for we were returned from
pJanquin; I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin,
vvhich I had heard so much of, and sather Simon impor-
tuned me daily to do it; at length his time of going
^vvay being set, and the other missionary, who was to
go with him, being arrived from Macao, it was neces-
sary that we should resolve esther to go, or not to go;
so I reserred him to my partner, and lest it wholly to
jiis choice; who, at length, resolved it in the affirma-
tive; and we prepared for our journey. We set out
•yvith very good advantage, as to sinding the way; for
tve got leave to travel in the retinue of one os their
mandarins, a kind of viceroy, or principal magistrate,
the prov ince where they reside, and who take great
flate upon them, travelling with great attendance, and
^vith great homage from the people, who are some-
times greatly impoverished by them, because all the
countries they pass through are obliged to furnish
provisions for them, and all their attendants. That
^hich I particularly observed, as to our travelling

with his baggage, was this: that though we received
sufficient provisions, both for ourselves and our horses,
from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet
we were obliged to pay for every thing we had after
the market-price of the country; and the mandarin's
steward, or commissary of the provisions, collected it
duly from us, so that our travelling in the retinue of
the mandarin, though it was a very great kindness to
us, was not such a mighty savour in him, but was,
indeed, a great advantage to him, considering there
were about thirty other people travelling in the same
manner besides us, under the protection of his retinue,
or, as we may call it, under his convoy. This, I say,
was a great advantage to him, for the country surnished-
all the provisions for nothing, and he took all our money
for them.
We were sive and twenty days travelling to Pekin,
through a country insinitely populous, but miserably
cultivated, the husbandry, œconomy, and the way of
living, all very miserable, though they boast so much
of the industry of the people; I say, miserable; and
so it is, if we, who understand how to live, were to
endure it, or to compare it with our own, but not so to
these poor wretches, who know no other. The pride
of these people is insinitely great, and exceeded by no-
thing but their poverty, which adds to that which I call
their misery. 1 must needs think the naked savages of
America live much more happy, because, as they have
nothing, so they desire nothing ; whereas these are proud
and insolent, and, in the main, are mere beggars and
drudges; their ostentation is inexpressible, and is chiesly
shewed in their clothes and buildings, and in the keeping
multitudes of servants or staves, and, which is to the
last degree ridiculous, their contempt of all the world
but themselves.
I must consess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards
in the deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary,
than here; and yet the roads here are well paved, and
well kept, and very convenient for travellers; but no-
thing was more awkward to me, than to see such an
haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of
tL^ grossest simplicity and ignorance; for all their samed
K 3 ingenuity
ingenuity is no more. My friend, sather Simon, and I,
illtd to be very merry upon these occasions, to fee the
beggarly pride of those people; for example, coming by
the house of a country gentleman, as sather Simon called
him, about ten leagues off from the city of Nanquin,
we had, sirst of all, the honour to ride with the master os'
the hotase about two miles; the state he rode in was a
persect Don Quixotism, being a mixture of pomp and
poverty.
The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a
scaramouch, or Merry-andrew: being a dirty callico,"
with all the tawdry trappings of a fool's coat, such as
hanging-sleeves, taffety, and cuts and Hashes almost on
every side; it covered a rich taffety vest, as greasy as a
butcher, and which testisied, that his honour must needs
be a most exquisite sloven.
His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling crea-
ture, ibefa as in England might sell for about thirty or
forty shillings; and he had two slaves followed him on
foot, to drive the poor creature along; he had a whip
,in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as sast about
the head, as his slaves did about the tail; and thus he
j-ode by us with about ten or twelve servants, and we
^vere told he was going from the city to his country
/eat, about half a league besore us. We travelled on
gently, but this sigure of a gentleman rode away before
us; and as we stopped at a village about an hour to re-
fresh us, when we came by the country feat of this great
jjian, we saw him in a little place, besore his door,
eating his repast; it was a kind of a garden; but he
was easy to be seen, and we were given to understand,
that the more we looked on him, the better he would be
pleased.
He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto-tree,
which effectually shaded him over the head, and on the
south side; but under the tree also was placed a Lrge
umbrella, which made that part look well enough;
j,e sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a
heavy corpulent man; and his meat being brought
him by two women slaves, he had two more, whose
osfice, I think, sew gentlemen in Europe would accept
cf their service in, viz. one fed the 'squire with a spoon,
and
and the other held the dilh with one hand, and scraped
off what he let sall upon his worship's beard, and taftety
vest, with the other; while the great sat brute thought
it below him to employ his own hands in any of those
samiliar offices, which kings and monarchs would rather
do than be troubled with the clumsy singers of their ser-
vants.
1 took this time to think what pain men's pride puts
them to, and how troublesome a haughty temper,
thus ill-managed, must be to a man of common sense ;,
.and, leaving the poor wretch to please himself with out
looking at him, as if we admired his pomp, whereas-
we really pitied and contemned him, we pursued our-
journey; only sather Simon had the curiosity to stay
to insorm himself what dainties the country justice had
to seed on, in all his state; which he said he had the
honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a dose
that an English hound would scarce have eaten, if it had
been offered him, viz. a mess of boiled rice, with a great
piece of garlick in it, and a little bag silled with green
pepper, and another plant which they have there, some-
thing like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tast-
ing like mustard; all this was put together, and a small
lump or piece of lean mutton boiled in it; and this was
Bis worship's repast, four or sive servants more attend-
ing at a distance. If he sed them meaner than he was
sed himself, the spice excepted, they must sare very
coarsely indeed.
As for our mandarin, with whom we travelled, he was
respected 4ike a king; surrounded always with his gentle-
men, and attended in all his appearances with such pomp,
that I saw little of him but at a distance; but this I ob-
served, that there was not a horse in his retinue, but that
our carriers pack-horses in England seem to me to
look much better; but they were so covered with equi-
page, mantles, trappings, and such like trumpery, that
you cannot see whether they are sat or lean. In a
word, we could scarce see any thing but their seet and
rheir heads.
I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble and
perplexity that I had given an account of being over,
Xhad no anxious thoughts about me; which made thi»
K 4 journey
journey much the pleasanter to me; nor had I anv ill
accident attended me, only in the palling or fording a
small river, my horse sell, and made me free of the
country, as they call it; that is to say, threw me in; the
place was not deep, but it wetted me all over: I mention
xt, because it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set
down the names of several people and places which I had
occasion to remember, and which, not taking due care
os, the leaves rotted, and the words were never after to
be read, to my great loss, as to the names of some placei
which I touched at in this voyage.
At length we arrived at Pekin; I had nobody with me
but the youth, whom my nephew the captain had given
me to attend me as a sctvant, and who proved very
trusty and diligent; and my partner had nobody with
him but one servant, who was a kinsman. As for the
Portuguese Pilot, he being desirous to see the court, ne
gave him his passage, ihat is to say, bore his charge!
for his company; and to use him.as an interpreter, tot
fee undei stood the language of the country, and spoke
good French and a little English; and, indeed, this old
jrian was a most usesul implement to us every where;
'for we had not been above a week at Pekin, when he
came laughing; Ah, Seignior Inglese, said he, I have
something to tell you will make your heart glad. My
J-.tart glad! said I: what can that be f I don't know
jiny thing in this country can ei'.her give me joy or grief;
to any great degree. Yes, yes, said the old man, in
t>roken English, make you glad, me sorrow; sorry he
vould have said. This made me more inquisitive. Why,
said I, will it make you sorry ? Because, said he, you
Jaave brought me here twenty-sive days journey, and u ill
leave me to go back alone; and v\ hich way shall I get
to my port afterwards, without a ship, without a horie,
lv-ithout pecune? So he called money; being his bio-
^ n Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry
tvith.
Jn short, he told us there was a great caravan ot
jVloscovy and Polish merchants in the city, and they
were preparing to set out on their journey, bl land, to
jVluscovy, within four or sive weeks, and he was sure
,ve would take the opportunitv to go with them, and
leave
leave him behind to go back all alone. I consess, I was
surprised with this news: a secret joy spread itself over
my whole soul, which I cannot describe, and never selt
besore or since; and I had no power, for a good while,
to speak a word to the old man; but at last I turned to
him: How do you know this? said I: are you sure it is
true? Yes, said he, I met this morning, in the street, an
old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, or one you call
a Grecian, who is among them; he came last from Astra-
can, and was designing to go to Tonquin where I former-
ly knew him, but has altered his mind, a,nd is now re-
solved to go back with the caravan to Moscow, and so
down the river of Wolga to Astracan. Well, Seignor/
said I, do not be uneasy about being lest to go T>ack
alone; if this be a method for my return to England,
it shall be your sault if you go back to Macao at all.
We then went to consulting together what was to be
done, and alked my partner what he thought of the
pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his affairs?
lie told me he would do just as I would; for he had set-
tled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and lest his effects in
such good hands, that as we made a good voyage here,
if he could vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, such -
as might be worth the carriage, he would be content to
go to England, and then make his voyage back to Bengal
by th; company's ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our
Portuguele pilot would go with us, we would bear his
charges to Moscow, or to England, if he pleased; nor,
indeed, were we to be esteemed over-generous in that
pnrt neither, if we had not rewarded him sarther; for
the service he had done us was really worth all that,
and more; for he had not only been a pilot to us at
sea, but he had been also like a broker for us on shore;
and his procuring for us the Japan merchant, was some
hundreds os pounJs in our pockets. So we consulted
together about it; and, being willing to gratify him,
which was, indeed, but doing him justice, and very
w illing also to have him with us besides, for he was a
most necessary mm on all occasions, we agreed to
give him a quantity of coined gold, which, as I coro-
K 5 pute
pute it, came to about 175 pounds sterling between ns,
and to bear his charges, both for himself and horse, ei•-
cept only a horse to carry his goods.
Having settled this among ourselves, we called him,
to let him know what we had resolved; I told him, he
had complained of our being like to let him go back
alone, and I was now to tell him we were resolved he
should not go back at all: that as we had resolved to
go to Europe with the caravan, we resolved also lit
should go with us, and that we called him to know
his mind. He shook his head, and said it was along
journey, and he had no pecune to carry him thither,
nor to subsist himself when he came thither. We told
him, we believed it was so, and theresore we had re-
solved to do something for him, that should let him
see how sensible we were os the service he had done us;
and also how agreeable he was to us: and then I told
him what we had resolved to give him here, which h»-
might lay out as we would do our own; and that as for
his charges, if he would go with us, we would set him
sase ashore, (lise and casualties excepted) either in Mus-
covy, or in England, which he would, at our own
charge, except only the carriage of his goods.
He received the proposal like a man transported,
and told us,' he would go with us over the whole
vporld; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves for
the journey. However, as it was with us, so it was
•vvith the other merchants, they had many things to do;
and instead of being ready in sive weeks, it was four
jtionths and some odd days besore all things were got to-
gether.
It was the beginning of February, our style, when we
set out from Pekin; my partner and the old pilot had
gone express back to the port where we had sirst put
in, to dispose of some goods which we had lest.there ;.
and 1, with a Chinese merchant, whom I had some
knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to Pekin on
his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I bought,
ninety pieces of sine damasks, with about two hundred
pieces of other very sine silks, of several sorts, some
juixedwith gold, and had all these brought to Pekin
against.
against my partner's return; besides this, we bought
a very large quantity of raw silk,' and some other
goods; our cargo amounting, in these goods only,
to about three thousand sive hundred pounds ster-
ling, which, together with tea, and some fine cal-
licoes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and cloves,.
loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides
those we rode upon; which, with two or three spare
horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made
us, in short, twenty-six camels and horses, in,our re-
tinue.
The company was very great, and; as near as I can
remember, made between three and four hundred horses
and camels, and upwards of an hundred and twenty men,.
very well armed, and provided for all events. For, as .
the eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the
Arabs, , so are these by the Tartars; but they are not al-
v together so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous.
when they prevail.
The company consisted of people of several nations,.
such as Muscovites chiefly; for there were about sixty of
them who were merchants or.inhabitants of Muscow,,
though of them some were Livonians, and, to our parti-
cular satissaction, sive of them were Scots, who appeared
also to be-men of great experience in business, and very
good substance.
When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides,
who were sive in number, called all the gentlemen and
merchants; that is to sky, all the passengers, except the.
servants, to a great council, as they termed it.. At this
great council every one deposited a certain quantity of
money to a common stock, for the necessary expence of
buying forage on the way, where it was not otherwise
to be had, and for satisfying the guides, getting horses,.
and the like. And here they constituted the journev,
as they called it, viz. They named captains and offi- -
cers to draw us all up, and give the command in case of
an attack, and gave every one their turn of command..
Nor was this forming us into order • any more than what
we found needsul upon the way, as shall be observed in ,
its place,.
K6 The
The road, all on this side of the country, is very
populous, and is sull of potters, and earth-makers, that'
is to say, people that tempered the earth for the China
viare; and, as I was going along, our Portuguese pilot,
who had always something or other to say to make us
merry, came sneering to me, and told me, he would shewr
the greatest rarity in all the country; and that 1 should
have this to say of China, after all the ill-humoured
things I had said of it, that lhad seen one thing which
was not to be seen in all the world beside. I was very
iirportunate to know what it was; at last he told me, it
was a gentleman'* house, built all with China ware.
Well, said I, are not the materials of their building the
product of their own country; and so it is all China
ware, is it not? No, no, says he, I mean, it is a house
all made of China ware, such as you call so in England;
or, as it is called in our country, porcelain. Well, said
J, such a thing may be: How big is it? Can we
carry it in a box upon a camel ? If we can, we will
buy it. Upon a camel! said the old pilot, holding up
both his hands, why there is a samily of thirty people
lives in it.
I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came
to it, it was nothing but this; it was a timber house, or
a house built, as we call it in England, with lath and
plaister, but all the plaistering was really China ware,
that is to say, it was plailtercd with the earth that makes
China ware.
The outside, w hich the sun shone hot upon, was glazed,
and looked very well, persectly white, and painted with
blue sigures, as the large China ware in England is
painted, and hard, as if it had been burnt. As to the
jiiside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined up
with, hardened and painted tiles, like the little, square
tiles we call gaily-tiles in England, all made of the sinest
China, and the sigures exceeding sine indeed, with ex-
jr.iordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold, many
tilts making but one sigure, but joined so artisicially
with mortar, being made of the same earth, that it was
vtry hard to see where the tiles met. The floors of the
foows were of the same composition, and as hard as the
tajthen floors we have in use ia several parts of Kng-
land,'especially Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leices-
tershire, &c. as hard as stone, and smooth, but not
burnt and painted, except some smaller rooms, like
closets, which were all as it were paved with the same
tile; the cielings, and, in a word, all the plaistering-
work in the whole house, were of the same earth; and,
after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same,
but of a deep shining black.
This was a China warehouse indeed, trulv and literally
to be called so; and, had 1 not been upon the journey, I
could have stayed some days to fee and examine the par-
ticulars of it. They told me there were fountains and
sish-ponds in the garden, all paved at the bottom and
sides with the same, and sine statues set up in rows on the
walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, and burnt
whole.
As this is one of the singularities of China, so they
may be allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they
excel in their accounts of it; for they told me such
incredible things of their persormance in crockery-
ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as know-
ing it could not be true: one fold me, in particular,
of a workman that made a ship, with all its tackle,
and masts, and sails, in earthen ware, big enough to
carry sifty men.' If he had told me he launched it, and
made a voyage to Japan in it, I might have said some-
thing to it indeed; but, as it was, I knew the whole
story, which was, in shert, asking pardon for the word,
that the sellow lied; so I smiled, and said nothing
to it.
1 his odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan,
for which the leader of it for the day, sined me about
the value of three shillings; and told me, if it had
been three days journey without the wall, as it was
three days within, he must have sined n e four times as
much, and made me ask pardon the next council
day ; so I promised to be more orderly y for, indeed,
I found afterwards the orders, made for keeping all
together were absolutely necessary for our coaimon
sasety.
In two days more we passed the great China walli
made for a fortisication against the Tartars; and a very
great
X3° tlM AND At)VKN-TU»ES Of
great work it is, going over hills and mountains in an*
endless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the
precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or,,
indeed, climb up, or where, if they did, no wall could
hinder them. They tell us, its length is near a thou-
sand English miles, but that the country is sive hun-i
dred in a strait measured line, which the wall bounds,,
without-measuring the windings and turnings it takes;
*tis about sour sathom high,. and as many thick in some
places.
I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without tres-
passing on our orders, for so long the caravan was in
passing the gate; I say, I stood still an hour to look at
jt on every side, near and sar osf, I mean, what was
within my view; and the guide of our caravan, who
had been extolling it for the wonder of the world,
vvas mighty eager to hear my opinion of it. I told
him it was a most excellent thing to keep off the Tar-
tars, which he happened not to understand as I meant
it, and so took it for a compliment;.but the old pilot
laughed; O Seignior Inglese, said he, you speak in co-
lours. In colours! said I: what do you mean by
that? Why you speak what looks white this way, and
hlack that way; gay one way, and dull another way;
you tell him it is a good wall to keep out Tartars;
you tell me by that, it is good for nothing but to keep
out Tartars;. or, it will keep out none but Tartars; I
understand you, Seignior Inglese, I understand you, said
he, joking; but Seignior Chinese understand you his
own way.
Well, said I, Seignior, do you think it would stand
out an army of our country people, with a good train of
artillery; or our engineers, with two companies of
nainers? Would they not batter it down in ten days, that
anarmy might enter in battalia, or blow it up into the air,
foundation and all, that there should be no sign of it
Jest? Ay, ay, said he, I know that. The Chinese
granted mightily to know what I said, and I gave him
leave to tell him a sew days after, for we were then al-
most out of their country, and he was to leave us in a
little time afterwards; but when he knew what I had
fyid, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard
tio more of his sine story of the Chinese power and
greatness while he stayed.
After we had passed this mighty Nothing, called a-
wall; something like the Picts wall, so samous in Nor-
thumberland, and built by the Romans, we began to sind:
the country thinly inhabitedj and the people rather con-
sined to live in fortisied towns and cities, as being sub-
ject to the inroads and depredations of the Tartars, who-
rob in great armies, and theresore are not to be resisted
by the naked inhabitants of an open country..
And here I began to sind the necessity of keeping to-
gether in a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw several,
• troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to see
them distinctly, 1 wondered how that the Chinese em-
pire could be conquered by such contemptible sellows ;.
for they are a mere herd or crowd of wild sellows, keep-
ing no order, and understanding no discipline, or man-
ner of sight.'
Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, taught
nothing, and are sit for nothings and this we foundi
the sirst day we saw them, which was after we entered
the wilder part of the country; our leader for the day
gave leave for about, sixteen of us to go a hunting, as,
they call it; and w+.at was this but hunting of sheep!
However, it may be called hunting too; for the crea-
tures are the wildest, and swiftest of foot, that ever I.
saw of their kind; only they will not run a great way,.
and you are sure of sport when you begin the chace ;.
for they appear generally by thirty or forty in a slock,,
and, like true sheep, always keep together when they
fly.
In pursuit of this odd fort of game, it was our hap
to meet with about forty Tartars; whether they were
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked
for another kind of prey, I know not; but as soon as .
they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very
loud, but with a barbarous found that I had never
heard besore;, and, by the way, never care to hear
again. We all supposed this was to call their friends
about them; and so it was; for in less than half a quarter
ef an hour, a troop of forty or sifty more appeared at
about
about a mile distance; but our work was over sirst, as it
happened.
Ore of rlie Scots merchants of Moscow happened to
be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the horn, he
told us, in short, that we had nothing to do, but to charge
them immediately, without loss ot time; and, drawing
us up in a line, he alked, If we were resolved ? We told
him, We were ready to sollow him: so he rode directly
up to them. They stood gazing at us like a mete crowd,
drawn up in no order, nor shewing the sace of an)' order
at all; but as soon as they saw us advance, they let
fly their arrows; which, however, missed us very
happily; it seems they mistook not their aim, but tl.eir
distance; sor their arrows all sell a little short of us, but
with so true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards
nearer, we must have had several men wounded, it not
killed.
Immediately we halted; and though it was at a
great distance, we sired, and sent them leaden bullets
tor wooden arrows, following our shot full gallop,
resolving to sall in among them sword in hand ; set
so our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, indeed,
but a merchant; but he behaved with that vigovr and
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool
courage too, that I never saw any man in action litter
ior command. As soon as we came up to them, we
fired our pistols in their saces, and then drew ; but
they fled in the greatest consusion imaginable; the
only stand any of them made was on our right, where
three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest to
come back to them, having a kind of scyinitar m
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs.
Our bra\e commander, without asking any body to
follow him, galloped up close to them, and with his
fusil knocked one of them oft' his horse, killed the
second with his pistol, and the third ran away; and thus
ended our sight: but w e had this misfortune attending
it, viz. that all our mutton that we had in chace get
away. We had not a man killed or hurt; but, as tor
the Tartars, there were about sive of them killed ; how
jcany were wounded, we knew not; but this we knew.
that the other party was so frighted with the noise of our
guns, that they fled, and never made any attempt upon,
us.
We w ere all this while in the Chinese dominions, and
theresore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but
in about sive days we entered a vast great wild desert,
which held us three days and nights march; and we
were obliged to carry out water with us in great leather
bottles, and t0 encamp all night, just as I have heard they
do in the deserts of Arabia.
I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in ? And
they told me, this was a kind of 'border that might be
called NoM<i..'i Land; being part of the Great Kara-
kathy, or Grand Tartary; but that, however, it wai
leckoned to China; that there was no care taken here to
prescne it from the inroads of thieves; and theresore it
was reckoned the worst desert in the whole march, though
we were to go over some much larger.
In passing this wilderness, which, I consess, was at the
first view very frightsul to me, we saw two or three time*
little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon
their own assairs, and to have 'no design upon us; and
so, like-the man who met the devil, if they had no-
thing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them; we
let them go.
- Once, however, a party of them came so near as
to stand and gaze at us; whether it was to consider
w hat they should do, viz. to attack us, or not attack us,
we knew l ot; but when we were passed at some dis-
tance by them, we made a rear-guard of forty men,
and stood ready for them, letting the caravan pass half
a mile, or thereabout, besore us: after a while they
n aiched osf, only we found they assaulted us with sive
arrows at their parting; one of which wounded ahorse,
so that it disabled him; and we .lest him the next day,
poor creature, in great need of a good farrier; we sup-
pose they might Ihoot more arrows, which might fall
short of us; but we saw no rsoie arrows, or Tartars, at
that time.
We travelled near a month after this, the way s being
not so good as at sirst, though still in the dominions of
the
the Emperor of China; but lay, for the most part, in
villages, some of w hich were fortisied, because of the
incursions of the Tartars. When we came to one of
these towns (it was about two days and an halfs journey
besore we were to come to the city of Naum), I wanted
to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all'
the way upon that road, and of horses also, such as they
are, because so many caravans coming that way, they
are very often wanted. The person that I spoke to, to
get me a camel, would have gone and setched it for me;
but I, like a fool, must be officious, and go myself
along with him. The place was about two miles out
of th« village, where, it seems, they kept >he camels and
horses seeding under a guard. •
I walked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese, being desirous,, forsooth, of a little
variety. When we came to this place, it was a low
jnarshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park,,
with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the doors:
having bought a camel, and agreed for she price, I
came away; and the Chinese man, thatwent with m«,
led the camel, when on a sodden came up sive Tar-
tars on horseback; two of them seized the fellow,
and took the camel from him, while the other three
stepped up to me, and my old pilot; seeing us, as it
were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but
my sword, which could but ill desend me against three
horsemen. The sirst that came up, stopped sliort upon
rr.y drawing my sword (for they are arrant cowards); but
2 second coming upon my lest, gave me a blow on the
lead, which I never selt till afterwards,, and wonder-
ed, when I came to myself, what was the matter with
me, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground;
but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Pro-
vidence, unlocked for, directs deliverances from dan-
gers, which to us are unforeseen), had a pistol in his
pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars nei-
ther; if they had, I suppose they would not have attack-
ed us; but cowards- axe always boldest when there is
no danger..
235
The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the sellow that had struck me, and laying
hold of his arm with one hand, and pulling him down
by main force a little towards him with the other, he
shot him into the head, and laid him dead on the spot;
he then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped
• us, as I said, and besore he could come forward again
• (for it was all done as it were in a moment) made a blow
at him with a fcymitar, which he always wore; but,
missing the man, cut his horse into the fide of his head,
cut one of his ears off by the root, and a great slice
down the side of his sace. The poor bealt, enraged
with the wounds, was no more to be governed by his
rider, though the sellow sat well enough too; but away
he flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reacft,
and at some distance rising upon his hind legs, threw
down the Tartar, and sell upon him.
In this interval the poor Chinese came in, who had
•loft the camel, but he had no weapon; however, seeing
'the Tartar down, and his horse sallen upon him, he run*
had by his side, something like a pole-ax, but not a
pole-ax neither, he wrenched it from him, and made
shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my
old man had the third Tartar to deal with still; and,
seeing he did not fly as he expected, nor came on to
sight him, as he apprehended, but stood stock still, the
old man stood still too, and salls to work with his tackle
to charge his pistol again; but as soon as the Tartar
saw the pistol, whether he supposed it to be the same cr
another, I know not; but away he scoured, and lest my
pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a complete
victory.
By this time I was a little awake; for I thought,,
when I sirst began to awake, that 1 had been in a sweet
sleep; but, as I said above, I wondered where I was,,
how I came upon the ground, and what was the mat-
ter; in a word, a sew minutes after, as sense returned,
1 selt pain, tho' I did not know where; I clapped my
hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then I
felt my head ach; and then, in another, moment, me-.
to him, and, seizin

ugly ill-savoured weapon he

THE LIFE AND ADVEKTURES OF
mory returned, and every thing was present to me
again.
I jumped up upon my seet instantly, and got hold of
my sword, but no enemies in view. I found a Tartit
lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly by him;
and, looking sarther, I saw my champion arid deli-
verer, who had been to see what the Chinese had done,
coming back with his hanger in his hand;, the old man,
seeing me on my seet, came running to me, and em-
braced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid before
that I had been killed ; and seeing me bloody, would
see how i was hurt; but it was not much, only what we
call a broken head; neither did I afterwards sind any
great inconvenience from the blow other than the place
which was hurt, and which was well again in two or
three days.
We made no great gain, however, by this victory;
for we lost a camel, and gained a horse: but that which
was remarkable, when we carre back to the village,
the man demanded to be paid for the camel; I dis-
puted it, and it was brought to a hearing before the
Chinese judge of the place; that is to say, in English,
we went besore a justice of the peace. Give him his
due, he acted with a great deal ot prudence and impar-
tiality; and, having heard both sides, he gravely alked
the Chinese man that went with me to buy the camel,
w hose servant he was? I am no servant, said he, bit
went with the stranger. At whose request? said the
justice. At the stranger's request, laid he. Why then,
said the justice, you were the stranger's servant for
the time; and the camel being delivered to his
servant, it was delivered to him, and he must pay (or
it.
I consess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word
to say; but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the
consequence, and so accurate stating the case, 1 p»'d
ivillingly for the camel, and sent feranother; but)ou
nay observe, I sent for it; I did not go to fetch it my-
relf anymore; I had enough of that.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese eiv
>;re: they call it fortisied, and so it is, as sortisicattons
jo there; for this I will venture to affirm, that all the

Tartars in Karakathav, which, I believe, are some mil-
lions, could not batter down the walls with their bows
and arrows; but to call it strong, if it were attacked
with cannon, would be to make those who understand it
laugh at you.
We wanted, as I have said, above two days journey
of this city, when messengers were sent express to every
part of the road, to tell all travellers and caravans to
halt, till they had a guard sent to them; for that an
unusual body of Tartars, making ten thousand in all,
had appeared in the way, about thirty miles beyond the
city.
This was very bad news to travellers; however, it was
caresully done of the governor, and we werj very glad
to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly, two
davs after, we had zoo soldiers sent us from a garrison
of the Chinese on our lest, and three hundred more from
the city of Naum, and with those we advanced boldly;
the three hundred soldiers from Naum marched in our
front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men on
each side of our camels with ourbaggnge, and the whole
caravan in the centre; in this order, and well prepared
for battle, we thought ourselves a match for the whole
ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared; but
the next day, when they did appear, it was quite another
thing.
It was early in the morning, when marching from a ,
little well-situated town, called Changu, we had a river
to pass, where we were obliged to serry; and had
the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the
time to have attacked us, when, the caravan being over,
the rear-guard was behind; but they did not appear
there.
About three hours after, when we were entered upon a
desert of about sisteen or sixteen miles over, behold, by
a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was at
hand; and they were at hand indeed, for they came on
upon the spur.
^ he Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked
so big the day besore, began to stagger, and the soldiers
frequently looked behind them; which is a certain sign
,in a soldier, that he is just ready to run away. My old
pilot
pilot was of my mind; and, being near me, he called
out, Seignior Inglese, said he, those sellows must be
encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the Tartars
come on, they will never stand it. 1 am of your mind,
said I: but what course must be done? Done, said he,
let sifty of our men advance, and slank them on each
wing, and encourage them, and they will sight like brave
sellows in brave company ; but without it they will every
man turn his back. Immediately I rode up to our leader,
and told him, who was exactly of our mind; and ac-
cordingly sifty of us marched to the right wing, and
sifty to the lest, and the rest made a line of reserve; for
so we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to
make another body to themselves, and to guard the ca-
mels; only that, if need were, the should fend an hun-
dred men to aslist the last sifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumerable
company they were; how many, we could not tell, but
ten thousand we thought was the least. A party of them
came on sirst, and viewed our posture, traversing the
ground in the front of our line; and as we found them
within gun-shot, our leader ordered the two wings to ad-
vance swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with
their shot, which was done; but they went off, and I
suppose went back to give an account of the reception
they were like to meet with; and, indeed, that salute
clogged their stomachs; for they immediately halted,
flood awhile to consider of it, and, wheeling off to the
lest, they gave over the design, and said no more to us
for that time, which was very agreeable to our circum-
stances, which were but very indifferent for a battle with
such a number.
Two days aster this we. came to the city Naum, or
Naunrri; we thanked the governor for his care for us,
and collected to the value of 100 crowns, or there-
abouts, which we gave to the foldic.vsent to guard us;
and here we rested one day. This is a garrison indeed,
and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the
reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite frontiers
lay nearer to them than they do now, the Muscovites hav-
ing abandoned that part of the country (which lies srom
the city west, for about two hundred miles) as desolate
and
2 39
^rad unsit for use; and more especially, being so very re-
mote, and so difficult to send troops hither for its desence;
sor we had yet above two thousand miles to Muscovy,
properly so called.
After this we passed several great rivers, and two dread-
sul deserts, one of which we were sixteen days passing
over, and which, as I said, was to be called, No Man's
Land; and, on the 13th of April, we came to the fron-
tiers of the Muscovite dominions. I think the sirst city,
or town, or fortress, whatever it might be called, that
belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was called Argun,
being on the west side of the river Argun.
I could not but discover an insinite satissaction, that I
was now arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country;
,or, at least, in a country governed by Christians; sot
though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, but just de-
serve the name of Christians, yet such they pretend to
be, and are very devout in their way. It would certain-
ly occur to any man who travels the world as I have
done, and who had any power of reflection; I say, it
would occur to him to reflect, what a blessing it is to
be brought into the world where the name of God,
and of a Redeemer, is known, worshipped, and adored,
and not where the people, given up by Heaven to
strong delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate them-
selves to stocks and stones; worship monsters, elementSi
horrible shaped animals, and statues, or images of mon-
sters. Not a town or city we passed through but had
their pagods, their idols, and their temples, and igno-
rant people worshipping even the works of their own
hands.
Now we came where, at least, a sace of the Christian
worship appeared, where the knee was bowed Jto Je-
sus; and, whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian-
religion was owned, and the name of the true God
was called upon, and adored; and it made the very
recesses of my foul rejoice to see it. 1 saluted the brave
Scotch merchant I mentioned above, with my sirst ac-
knowledgment of this; and, taking him by the hand,
I said to him, blessed be God, we are once again come
among Christians! He smiled, and answered, do not
rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are
but an odd fort of Christians; and, but for the name of
it, you may see very little of the substance for some
months farther of ourjournev.
Well, said I, but still 'tis better than Paganism, and
worshipping of devils. Why, I'll tell you, said he; ex-
cept the Russian soldiers in garrisons, and a few of the
inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of
this country, for above a thousand miles sarther, is inha-
bited by the worst, and most ignorant of pagans; and
so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of solid
earth, if I understand any thing of the sursace of the
globe, that is to be found in any part of the world:
we had at least twelve hundred miles to the sea, east-
ward; we had at least two thousand to the bottom
of the p.altic sea, westward; and almost three thou-
sand miles, if we lest that sea, and went on well to the
British and French channels: we had sull sive thousand
miles to the Indian or Persian sea, south; and about
eight hundred miles to the frozen sea, north: nay, if
some people may be believed, there might be no sea
north-east til! we came round the pole, and consequently
into the north-west, and so had a continent of land
into America, no mortal knows where; though I could
give some reasons why I believe that to be a mistake
too.
As we entered into the Muscovite dominions, a good
while besore we came to any considerable town, we
had nothing to observe there but this: sirst, that all the
rivers rua to the east. As I understood by the chans
which some of our caravans had with them, it was
plain that all those rivers ran into the great river
Yamour, or Gammour. This river, by the natural
course of it, must run into the east sea, or Chinese
ocean. The story they tell us, that the mouth of this
river is choaked up with bulrushes of a monstrous
growth, viz. three seet about, and twenty or thirty
feet high, I must be allowed to say, I believe nnthin;
of; but as its navigation is of no use, because there is
no trade that wav, the Tartars, to whom alone it belongs,
dealing in nothing but cattle, so nobody that ever I
heard of, has been curious enough either to go down
to
to the mouth of it in boats, or come up from the mouth
of it in ships; but this is certain, that this river run-
ning due east, in the latitude of 60 degrees, carries a
vast concourse os rivers along with it, and sinds an ocean
to empty itself in that latitude; so we are sure of sea
there.
Some leagues to the north of this river there are seve-
ral considerable rivers, whose streams run as due north as
the Yamour runs east : and these are all found to join
their waters with the great river Tartarus, named so from
the northernmost nations of the Mogul Tartars, who,
the Chinese say, were the sirst Tartars in the world ; and
who, as our geographers allege, are the Gog and Ma-
gog mentioned in sacred story.
These rivers running all northward, as well as all the
other rivers 1 am yet to speak of, make it evident, that
the northern ocean bounds the land also on that side; so
that it does not seem rational in the least to think, that
the land can extend itself to join with America on that
side, or that there is not a communication between the
northern and the eastern ocean; but of this I shall say no
more ; it was my observation at that time, and theresore I
take notice os it in this place. We now advanced from
the river Arguna, by easy and moderate journeys, and
were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Mus-
covy has taken, to have cities and towns built in as
many places as are possible to place them, where his
soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary
soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest coun-
tries of their empire, some of which I had read were
particularly placed in Britain for the security of com-
merce, and for the lodging of travellers; and thus it was
here; for wherever we came, though at these towns and
.stations the garrisons and governor were Rusfians, and
prosessed mere pagans, sacrisicing to idols, and worship-
ing the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven;
and not only so, but were, of all the heathens and pa-
gans that ever I met with, the most barbarous, except
only that they did not eat men's flesh, as our savages of
America did.
Some instances of this we met with in the country
between Arguna, where we enter the Muscovite doou-
, Vol. JI. L nions,
nions, and a city of Tartars and Russians together, called
Nertzinskay; in which space is a continued desert or
forest, which cost us twenty days to travel over it. In a
village, near the last of those places, I had the curiosity
to go and see their way of living, which is most brutish
and ur.sufferable; they had, I suppose, a great sacrisice
that day; sor there stood out upon an old stump of a
tree, an idol made of wood, frightsul as the devil; at
least as any thing we can think of to represent the
devil can be made; it had an head certainly not
so much as resembling any creature that the world ever
iaw ; ears as big as goats horns, and as high; eyes a> big
as a crown piece; a nose like a crooked ram's horn, and
a mouth extended four-cornered, like that of a lion,
with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's under-bill;
it was dressed up in the filthiest manner that you can sup-
pose; its upper, garment was of sheep-skins, with the
wool outward; a great Tartar bonnet on the head,
with two horns growing through it; it was about
eight fiet high, yet had no seet or legs, or any other
proportion of parts.
This scare-crow was set up at the out-side of the
village; and when I came near to it, there were six-
teen or seventeen creatures, whether men or women
I could not tell, for they make no distinction by their
habits, either of body or head; these lay all slat on the
fround, round this formidable block of shapeless wood,
saw no motion among them any more than if they
had been logs of wood like their idol; at sirst I really
,thought they had been so; but when I came a little
nearer, they started up upon their seet, and raised an
howling cry, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed
hounds, and walked away as if they were displeased at
our disturbing them. A little way off from this mon-
ster, and at the door of a tent or hut, made all of
skeep-skins and cow-skins, dried, stood three butchers;
I thought they were such; for when I came nearer
to them, I found they had long knives in their hands,
and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep
killed, and one young bullock, or steer. These, it
seems, were sacrisices to that senseless log of an idol;
and these three men priests belonging to it; and the
seventeen
seventeen prostrated wretches were the people wha
brought the osfering, and were making their prayers to
that ltock.
I consess I was more moved at their stupidity, and this
brutish worship of an hobgoblin, than ever I was at any
thing in my lise; to see God's most glorious and best
creature, to whom he had granted so many advan-
tages, even by creation, above the rest of the works
ot his hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and that
foul adorned with saculties and capacities adapted both
to honour his Maker, and be honoured by him; I say,
to see it sunk and degenerated to a degree so more
than stupid, as to prostrate itself to a frightsul nothings,
a mere imaginary object, dressed up by themselves,
and made terrible to themselves by their own con-
trivance, adorned only with clouts and rags; and
that this should be the effect of mere ignorance, wrought
up into hellish devotion by the devil himself; who, envy-
ing his Maker the homage and adoration of his creatures,
had deluded them into such gross, surseiting, sordid,
and brutish things, as one would think should shock
nature itself.
But what signisied all the astonishment and reflection
of thoughts? Thus it was, and I saw it besore my
eyes; and there was no room to wonder at it, or think
it impossible; all my admiration turned to rage; and
I rode up to the image or monster, call it what you.
will, and with my sword cut the bonnet that was on
its .head in two in the middle, so that it hung down
by one of the horns; and one of our men that was
with me took hold of the skeep-ikin that covered it,
and pulled at it, when, behold, a most hideous outcry
and howling ran through the village, and two or three
hundred people came about my ears, so that I was
glad to scour for it; for we saw some had bows and
arrows; but I resolved from that moment to visit them
again.
Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which
was about four miles off, in order to provide some
horses, which they wanted, several of the horses hav-
ing been lamsd and jaded with the badness of the way,

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
and our long march over the last desert; so we had
some leisure here to put my design in execution. I com-
municated my project to the Scots merchant of Mos-
cow, of whose courage I had a sussicient testimony,
as above. I told him what I had seen, and with what
indignation I had since thought, that human nature
could be so degenerate. I told him, I was resolved,
if I could get but four or sive men, well armed, to go
with me, to go and destroy that vile, abominable
idol; to let them see, that it had no power to help it-
self, and consequently could not be an object of worship,
or to be prayed to, much less help them that osfered sa-
crisices to it.
He laughed at me: said he, Your zeal may be good;
.but what do you propose to yourself by it? Propose!
said I, to vindicate the honour of God, which is in-
sulted by this devil-worship. But how will it vindicate
the honour of God? said he, while the people will
not be able to know what you mean by it, unless
you could speak to them too, and tell them so; and
then they will sight you too, I will assure you ; for they
are desperate sellows, and that especially in desence of
their idolatry. Can we not, said I, do it in the night,
and then leave them the reasons in writing, in their own
language? Writing! said he—why there is not in sive
nations of them, one man that knows any thing of
a letter, or how to read a word in any language,
or in their own. Wretched ignorance! said I to him;
however, I have a great mind to do it; perhaps.nature
may draw inserences from it to them, to let them fee
how brutish they are to worship such horrid things.
Look you, Sir, said he, if your zeal prompts you to
it so warmly, you must do it; but, in the next place,
I would have you consider these wild nations of people
are subjected, by force, to the Czar of Muscovy's domi-
nions; and if you do this, it is ten to one but they will
come by thousands to the governor of Nertzinskay, and
complain and demand satissaction; and if he cannot
give them satissaction, it is ten to one but they revolt;
md it will occasion a new war with all the Tartais in the
;ountry. . ....

This, I consess, put new thoughts into my head for
a while; but I harped upon the same string still ; and
all that day I was uneasy to put my project in execu-
tion. Towards the evening the Scots merchant met me
by accident in our walk about the town, and desired
to speak with me: I believe, said he, I have put you
off your good design; I have been a little concerned
about it since; for I abhor the idol and idolatry a3
much as you can do. Truly, said I, you have put it
off a little as to the execution of it, but you have not
put it all out of my thoughts; and, I believe, I shall do-
it still besore I quit this place, though I were to be de-
livered up to them for satissaction. No, no, said he;
God forbid they mould deliver yoa up to such a crew
of monsters! they shall not do that neither; that
would be murdering you indeed. Why, said I, how
would they use me? Use you! said he; I'll tell you
how they served a poor Russian, who affronted them in
their worihip just as you did, and whom they took
prisoner, after they had lamed him with an arrow, that
he could not run away; they took him and stripped him
stark naked, and set him upon the top of the idol mon-
ster, and stood all round him, and shot as many arrows
into him as would stick over his whols body; and them
they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in him, as
a sacrisice to the idol. And was this the same idol?
said I. Yes, said he, the very same. Well, said I, I
will tell you a story; so I related the story of our men
at Madagascar, and how they burnt and sacked the vil-
lage there, and killed man, woman, and child, for their
murdering one of our men, just as it is related besore;
and when I had done, I added, that I thought we ought
to do so to this village. >
He listened very attentively to the story; but when
I talked of doing so to this village, said he, you mis-
take very much ; it was not this village, it was almost
a hundred miles from this place; but it was the same
idol, for they carry him about in procession all over
the country. Well, said I, then that idol ought to be
punished for it; and it mall, said I, if I live this night
eut. ••
L 3 la
In a word, sinding roe resolute, he liked the design,
and told me I should not go alone, but he would ge with
me; but he would go sirst, and bring a stout sellow, one
of his countrymen, to go also with us; and one, said
he, as samous for his zeal as you can desire any one to
be against such devilish things as these. In a word, he
brought me his comrade, a Scotsman, whom he called
Captain Richardson; and I gave him a sull account of
what I had seen, and also os what I intended; and he
rold me readily, he would go with me, if it cost hin>
his lise. So we agreed to go, only we three. I had,
indeed, proposed it to my partner; hut he declined it.
He said, He was ready to assist me to the utmost, and
upon all occasions, for my desence; but that this was
an adventure quite out of his way: so, I say, we resolved
upon our work, only we three, and my man-servant, and
to put it in execution that night about midnight, with
a Jl the secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to
delay it till the next night, because the caravan being to
£*t forward in the morning, we supposed the governor
could not pretend to give them any satissaction upon us
vehen we were out of his power; the Scots merchant, as
steady in his resolution to enterprize it, as bold in exe-
cuting, brought me a Tartar's robe, or gown of shcep-
fltins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had
provided the fame for himself and his countryman, that
r}ie people, if they saw us, should not be able to deter-
mine who we were.
All the sirst night we spent in mixing up some combus-
[ible matter with aqua-vitæ, gunpowder, and such other
itiaterialsaswe could get 5 and, having a good quantity
0f tar in a little pot, about an hour after, night we set
Tilt upon our expedition.
We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night,
lDd found that the people had not the least jealousy of
-Janger attending their idol; the night was cloudy; yet
he moon gave us light enough to see that the idol
rood just in the same posture and place that it did
;,esbre. The people seemed to be all at their rest ; only,

we saw the three priests, whom we mistook for butchers,
we saw a light, and, going up close to the door, we
heard people talking, as if there were sive or six of
them; we concluded, theresore, that if we set wild-sire
to the idol, these men would come out immediately, and
run up to the place to rescue it from the destruction that
we intended for it; and what to do with them we knew
not. Once we thought of carrying it away, and
setting sire to it at a distance; but when we came to
handle it, we found it too bulky for our carriage ;.
so we were at a loss again. The second Scots-
man was for setting sire to the tent or hut, and knock-
ing the creatures that were there on the head when
they came out; but I could not join with that; I was-
Robinson C * «lt*b' 24,7
Well, then, laid the Scots merchant, I will tell you
what we will do; we will try to take them prisoners,,
tie their hands, and make them stand and fee their idol-
destroyed.
As it happened, we had twine, or packthread, enough
about us, which we used to tie our sire-works together
with; so we resolved to attack these people sirst, and
with as little noise as we could. The sirst thing we dklr
we knocked at the door, when one of the priests com-
ing to it, we immediately seized upon him, stopped
his mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and led him
to the idol, where we gagged him, that he might not
make a noise; tied his seet also together, and lest him
on the ground.
Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that
another would come out to see what the matter was;
but we waited so long till the third man came back to
us; and then, nobody coming out, we knocked again
gently, and immediately out came two more, and we
served them just in the same manner, but were obliged
to go all with them, and lay them down by the idol
some distance from one another; when, going back,
we found two more were come out to the door, and
a third stood behind them within the door. We seized
the two, and immediately tied them, when the third
stepping back, and crying out, my Scots merchant
went in after, him, and taking out a composition we
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he set sire
to it, and threw it in among them; by that time the
other Scotsman, and my man, taking charge of the two
men already bound, and tied together also by the arm,
led them away to the idol, and lest them there, to
see if their idol would relieve them, making haste back
to us.
When the surze we had thrown in had silled the hut
with so much smoke that they were almost susfocated,
we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind,
which slamed like a candle, and, following it in, we
found there were but four people lest, who, it seems,
were two men and two women, and, as we supposed,
had been about some of their diabolical sacrisices. They
appeared, in short, frighted to death, at least so as to
sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak neither,
for the smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound them, as we had
the others, and all without any noise. I should have
said, we brought them out of the house, or hut, sirst;
for, indeed, we were not able to bear the smoke any
jnore than they were. When we had done this, we car-
ried them altogether to the idol; when we came there
we sell to work with him ; and sirst we daubed him
all over, and his robes also, with tar, and such other
ituff as we had, which was tallow mixed with brim-
stone; then we stopped his eyes, and ears, and mouth,
full of gunpowder; then we wrapped up a great
piece of wildsire in his bonnet; and then, sticking
all the combustibles we had brought with us upon him,
we looked about to see if we could sind any thing
else to help to burn him; when my Scotsman remem-
bered, that by the tent, or hut, where the men were,
there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or rushes
I do not remember; away he and the other Scotsman
ran, and setched their arms sull of that. When we
bad done this, we took all our prisoners, and brought
hem, having untied their seet, and ungagged their
nouths, and made them stand up, and set them just
^jfore their monstrous idol, and then set sire to the.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts,
till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the <
idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, had split and
desormed the shape of it; and, in a word, till we saw
it burnt into a mere block or log of wood ;- and then
setting the dry forage to it, we found it would be soon
quite consumed; so we began to think of going away ^.
but the Scotsman said: No, we must not go; for these
poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the
sire, and burn themselves with the idol; so we resolved
to stay till the forage was burnt down too, and then we
came away and lest them.
In the morning we appeared among our sellow travel-
lers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our journeys
nor could any man suggest that we had been any-
where but in our beds, as travellers might be supposed to-
be, to sit themselves for the satigues of that day's jour-
ney.
But it did not end so; for the next day came a great,
multitude of the country people, riot only of this village,
but of an hundred more, for aught I know, to the town,
gates; and, in a-most outrageous manner, demanded
satissaction of the Ruffian governor, for the insulting,
their priests, and burning their great Cham-Chi-Tbaun-
gu; such an hard name they gave the monstrous crea-
ture they worshiped: the people of Nertzinskay were,
at sirst in a great consternation ; for, they said, the Tar-
tars, were no less than thirty thousand, and that in *
sew days more they would be one hundred thousand
strong.
The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease
them, and gave them all the good words imaginable.
He assured them he knew nothing of it, and that there
had not a soul of his garrison been abroad y that it could
not be from any body there; and if they would let hirr*
know who it was, they should be exemplariJy punished.
They returned, haughtily, That all the country reve-
renced the great Cham-Chi-Thaungu,. who dwelt in the
sun, and no mortal would have dared to.offer violence to
his image but some Christian miscreant; so they
«aHed them, it seems, and they, theresore, denounced
L j wan

v-ar against him, and all the Ruffians, who, they said,
were miscreants and Christians.
The Governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a
breach, or to have any cause of war alleged to be given
by him, the Czar having straightly charged him to treat
the conquered country with gentleness and civility, gave
them still all the good words he could ; at last he told
rhem, there was a caravan gone towards Russia that morn-
ing, and, perhaps, it was some of them who had done
them this injury; and that if they would be satissied with
that, he would fend after them, to enquire into it. This
seemed to appease them a little; and accordingly the
fovernor sent ;ifter us, and gave us a particular account
ow the thing was; intimating withal, that if any in
our caravan had done it, they should make their escape;
but that, whether they had done it or no, we Ihould make
all the haste forward that was possible; and that, Li the
mean time, he would keep them in play as long as he
could.
This was very friendly in the governor. However,
when it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew
any thing bf the matter; and, as for us that were guilty,
,we were the least of all suspected; none so much as aiked
os the question; however, the captain of the caravan,
for the time, took the hint that the governor gave us,
sihd we marched or travelled two days and two nights
without any considerable stop, and then we lav at a vil-
lage called Plothus; nor did we make any long stop here,
but hastened on towards Jarawena, another of the Czar
of Muscovy's colonies, and where we expected wessiould
be sase; but it is to be observed, that here we began, for
two or three days march, to enter upon a vast nameless
desert, of which I shall say more in its place; and which,
if we had now been upon it, it is more than probable we
had been all destroyed. It was the second day's march
from Plothus, that, by the clouds of dust behind us at
3 great distance, some of our people began to be sensible
we were pursued; we had entered the desert, and had
passed by a great lake, called Schanks Osier, when we
perceived a very great body of horse appear on 'he
other
other side of the lake to the north, we travelling well*
We observed they went away west, as we did; but had
supposed we should have taken that side of the lak<>,
whereas we very happily took the south side; and in two
days more we saw them not; for they, believing we were
still besore them, pushed on, till they came to the river
Udda; this is a very great river when it passes sarther
north; but when we came to it, we found it narrow and
ford able.
The third day they either found their mistake, or. had
intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards ,
the dusk of the evening. We had, to our great satisfac-
tion, just pitched upon a place for our camp, which was •
very convenient for the night; for as we were upon a.
desert, though but at the beginning of it, that was above
sive hundred miles over, we had no towns to lodge at,.
and, indeed,expected none but the city Jarawena, which'
we had yet two days march to; the desert, however, had
some sew woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which
ran all into the great river Udda. It was in a narrow
streight between two small, but very thick woods, that
we pitched our little camp for that night, expecting to ,
be attacked in the night.
Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for
but as it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to 'go about:
in troops in that desert, so the caravan always for-
tify themselves every night against them, as against ar-
mies of robbers;, and it was, therefore,,no new tiling
to be pursued. ...
But we had this night, of all the nights of our travels,
a- most advantageous camp; for we lay hetvveen two-
woods, with a little rivulet running just besore our front;,
so that we could not be surrounded or attacked any
way, but in our front or rear; we took care also to
make our front as strong as we couLd, by placing our'
packs, with our camels and horses, all in a line on the in-
side of the river, and we selled some, trees- in our
rear..
In this posture we encamped for the night; but trie
enemy was upon us besore we had sinished our situa-
tion ;: they did not come on us like thieves, as we
L.6- expected,
expected, but sent shree messengers to us, to demand the
men to be delivered to them, that had abused their priests,
and burnt their god Cham-Chi-Thaungu, that they
might burn them with sire; and, upon this, they said,
they would go away, and do us no sarther harm, other-
wise they would burn us all with sire. Our men looked
very blank at this message, and began to stare at one-
another, to see who looked with most; guilt in their sa-
ces; but, nobody was the word, nobody did it. The-
leader of the caravan sent word, he was well assured it
was not done by any of our camp; that we were peace-
able merchants travelling on our business -y that we had
done no harm to them, or to any one else; and therefore
they must look sarther for their enemies who had in-
jured them, for we were not the people; so desired them
not to disturb us; for, if they did, we should desend
ourselves.
They were sar from being satissied with this for an
answer,, and a great crowd of them came down in the
morning, by break of day, to our camp; but, seeing us
in such an advantageous situation, they durst come no-
farther than the brook in our front, where they stood, and
shewed us such a number, as, indeed, terrisied us very
much; for those that spoke least of them, spoke of ten
thousand. Here they stood, and looked at us a while,
and then setting up a great howl, they let fly a cloud of
arrows among us; but we were well enough fortisied for
that, for we were sheltered under our baggage; and I
«3o not remember that one man of us was hurt.
Some time after this, we saw them move a little to our
j-ight, and expected them on the rear, when a cunning
fellow, a Cossack, as they call them, of Jarawena, in the
pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the cara-
van, said to him, I will send all these people away to
Sibeilka;this was a city four or sive days journey, at least,
to the south, and rather behind us. So he takes his bow
and arrows; and> getting on horseback, he rides away
from our rear directly, as it were, back to Nertzinskay;
after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes to
the army of the Tartars, as if he had been sent express to»
tell them a long story, that the people who had burnt
Cham-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a ca-
ravan of miscreants, as he called them; that is to say,
christians; and that they were resolved to burn the god
Seal Isarg, belonging to the Tonguses.
As this sellow was a mere Tartar, and persectly spoke
their language, he counterseited so well, that they all took
it from him, and away they drove, in a most violent
hurry to Sibeilka, which, it seems, was sive daye jour-
ney to the south, and, in less than three hours they were
entirely out of our sight, and we never heard any more
of them, nor ever knew whether they went to that other
place called Sibeilka, or no.
So we pasted sasely on to the city of Jarawena,
where there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there we
rested sive days, the caravan being exceedingly satigued
with the last day's march, and with want of rest in the
night.
From this city we had a frightsul desert, which held us
three and twenty days march. We surnished ourselves
with some tents here, for the better accommodating our-
selves in the night; and the leader of the caravan pro-
cured sixteen carriages, or waggons, of the country, for
carrying our water and provisions; and these carriages
were our desence every night round our little camp; so
that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been
very numerous indeed, they would not have been able to
hurt us.
We may well be supposed to want rest again after
this long journey; for, in this desert, we saw neither
house or tree, or scarce a busti; we saw, indeed, abun-
dance of the sable-hunters, as they called them •> these are
all Tartars of the Mogul Tartary, of which this country
is a part ; and they srequently attack small caravans;
but we saw no numbers of them together. I was curious
to see the sable-tkins they catched; but I could never
speak with any of them; for they durst not come near
us, neither durst we straggle from our company to go
near them.
After we had passed this desert, we came into a
country pretty well inhabited; that is to say, we found
towns and castles settled by the Czar of Muscovy, with
garrisons
garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect the caravans,
and desend the country against the Tartars, who would
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his
Czarish majesty has given such strict orders sor the well
guarding the caravans and merchants, that if there are
any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments of the
garrifrn are always sent to see travellers safe from station
to station.
And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had an.
opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots
merchant who was acquainted with him, offered us a
guard of sifty men, if we thought there was any danger,
to the next station.
I thought long besore this, that as we came nearer to
Europe, we should sind the country better peopled, and
the people more civilized; but I found mysels mistaken,
in both, for we had yet the nation of the Tongueses to-
pass through; where we saw the same tokens of paga^
jiism and barbarity, or worse, than besore; only as- they
were conquered by the Muscovites, and entirely reduced,
they were not so dangerous; but for the rudeness as
jnanners, idolatry, and polytheism, no people in the
•world ever went beyond them. They are clothed all in
fleins of beasts, and their houses are built of the same..
You know not a man from a woman, neither by the
rtiggedness of their countenances, or their clothes;
and in the winter, when the ground is covered with
show, they live under ground in houses like vaults,
which have cavities cœ caves going from, one to ano-
ther.
If the Tartars had thein Cham-Chi-Tbaungu sor a
,whole village, or country, these had idols in every hut,
and every cave; besides, they worship the stars, the sun,
the wateE, the snow; and, in a word, every thing that
they do not understand, and they understand but very
little; so that almost every element, every Uncommon
thing, sets them a sacrisicing.
But I am no more to describe people than countries,
sny sarther than my own story comes to be concerned
jo them. I met with nothing peculiar to myself in all
this country, which I reckon was, from the desert which
I spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half
os
of it being another desert, which took us up twelve days
severe travelling, without house, tree or bush; but were
obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well water
as bread. After we were out of this desert, and had
travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite
city or station, on the great river Janezay. This river,
they told us, parted Europe from Asia, though our map-
makers, as I am told, do not agree to it; however, it
is certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient Siberia,
which now makes a province only of the vast Muscovite-
empire, but is itself equal in bigness to the whole em-
pire of Germany.
And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism stilt
prevailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons; all the
country between the river Oby, and the river Janezay,
is as entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the
remotest of the Tartars, nay, as any nation, for aught
I know, in Asia, or America. I alii* found, which I
observed to the Muscovite governors, whom I had op-
portunity to converse with, that the pagans are not much'
the wiser, or the nearer Christianity, for being under tlve
Muscovite government; which they acknowledged was
true enough, but, they said, it was none of their busi-
ness: that if the Czar expected to convert his Siberian',"
or Tonguese, or Tartar subjects, it mould be done by
sending clergymen among them, not soldiers; and they
added, with more sincerity than I expected, that they
found it was not sb much the concern of their monarch
to make the people Christians-, as it was to make them;
subjects.
From this river, to the great river Oby, we crossed a
wild Uncultivated country; I cannot say 'tis a barbarous
foil; 'tis only barren of people and good manage-
ment; otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant, fruitsul,
and agreeable country. What inhabitants we found in
it are all pagans, except such as are sent among them
from Russia; for this is the country I mean on both
sides the river Oby, whither the Muscovite crimin:'!?,
that are not put to death, are banished, and from
Whence it is next to impossible they should ever come
away,
I hare
I have nothing material to say of my particular
affairs, rill I came to Tobolflri, the capital of Siberia,
where I continued some time on the following occa-
sion:
We had been now almost seven months on our jour-
ney, and winter began to come on apace; whereupon
my partner and I called a council about our particular
affairs, in which we found it proper, considering that
vve were bound for England, and not for Moscow, to
consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us of
sledges and rein deer to carry us over the snow in the
winter-time; and, indeed, they have such things, as it
would be incredible to relate the particulars of, by
which means the Russians travel more in the winter than
they can in summer, because in these fledges they are
a.ble to run night and day; the snow being frozen, is one
universal covering to nature, by which the hills, the
vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all smooth, and hard as
a (lone; and they run upon the sursace, without any re-
gard to what is underneath.
But I had no occasion to push at a winter journey of
this kind; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and
xr)y route lay two ways; either I must go on as the cara-
van went, till I camk to Jarislaw, and then go off weft
sot Narva, and the gulph of Finland, and so either
j>y sea or land to Dantzick, where I might possibly fell
jjiy China cargo to good advantage, or I must leave the
^ravan at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I
jiad but six days by water to Arch-Angel, and from
thence might be sure os shipping, either to England,
j-Jolland, or Hamburgh.
Now to go aay of these journeys in the winter
would have been preposterous; for as to Dantzick, the
jjaltick would be frozen up, and I could not get pas-
sage; and to go by land in those countries, was sar
jess sase than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise to
y^rch-Angel, in October, all the snips would be gone
from thence, and even the merchants, who dwell there
summer, retire south to Moscow in the winter,
when the ships are gone; so that I should have no-
thing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a scar-
city,
city of provisions, and must lie there in an empty town
all the winter: so that, upon the whole, I thought it
much my better way to let the caravan go, and to
make provision to winter where I was, viz. at Tobolski,
in Siberia, in the latitude of sixty degrees, where I was
sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with,
viz. plenty of provisions, such as the country asforded,
a warm house, with suel enough, and excellent com-
pany; of all which I shall give a sull account in its
place.
I was now in a quite disserent climate from my
beloved island, where I never selt cold, except when
I had my ague; on the contrary, I had. much to do
to bear my clothes on my back, and never made any
sire but without doors, and my necessity, in dres-
sing my food, &c. Now I made me three good vests,
with large robes or gowns over them to hang down
to the seet, and button close to the wrists, and all
these lined with surs, to make them sufficiently
warm.
As to a warm house, I must consess, I greatly dis-
like our way in England, of making sires in every
room in the house, in open chimneys, which, when
the sire was out, always kept the air in the room
cold as the climate. But, taking an apartment in a
good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be
built like a surnace, in the centre of six several rooms,
like a stove; the sunnel, to carry the smoke, went up
one way, the door to come at the sire went in ano-
ther, and all the rooms were kept equally warm,
but no sire seen; like as they heat the bagnios in Eng-
land.
By this means we had always the same climate in all
the rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and how
cold soever it was without, it was always warm within;
and yet we saw no sire, nor were ever incommoded with
any smoke.
The most wondersul thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a country
fa barbarous as that of the most northerly parts of Eu-
rope, near the frozen ocean, and within but a very sew
degrees of Nova Zembla.
But
But this being the country where the state criminals or*
Muscovy, as I observed besore, are all banished ; this city
ivas sull os noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and,
in short, all degrees of th« nobility, gentry, soldiery,
and courtiers of Muscovy. Here were the samous
Prince Galilsken, or Galosfken, and his son, the old
General Robostisky, and several other persons of note,
and some ladies.
By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthe-
less, I parted with here, I made an acquaintance
with several of these gentlemen, and some of them
of the sirst rank; and from these, in the long win-
ter nights in which I stayed here, I received several
agreeable visits. It was talking one night with a cer-
tain prince, one of the banished ministers of state
belonging to the Czar of Muscovy, that my talk of
roy particular case began. He had been telling me
abundance of sine things, of the greatness, the magni-
sicence, and dominions, and the absolute power of
the emperor of the Ruffians. I interrupted him, and
told him, I was a greater and more powersul prince
than ever the Czar of Muscovy was, though my do-
minions were not so large, or my people so many. The
Ruffian grandee looked a little surprised, and, sixing
his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what I
meant.
I told him his wonder would cease, when I had ex-
plained myself. First, I told him, I had the absolute
disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects
that notwithstanding my absolute power, I had not
one person disassected to my government, or to my
person, in all my dominions. He shook his head
at that, and said, There, indeed, I outdid th« Czar of
Muscovy. I told him, that all the land*-in my king-
dom were my own, and all my subjects were not only
my tenants, but tenants at will; that they would all
sight for me to the last drop; and that never tyrant,
for such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so uni-
versally beloved,, and j<et so- horribly, scared,, by hit
subjects.
After.
Aster amusing them with these riddles in govern-
ment for a while, I opened the case, and told them
the ltory at large of my living in the island, and how
'1 managed both myself and the people there, that were
under me, just as I have since minuted it down. They
were exceedingly taken with the story, and especially
the prince, who told me with a sigh, that the true
greatness of lise was to be master of ourselves; that
he would not have exchanged such a state of lise as-
inine, to have been Czar of Muscovy; and thai he found
more selicity in the retirement he seemed to be banished
to there, than ever he found in the highest authority
be enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar: that
the height of human wisdom was to bring our temper*
down to our circumstances, and to make a calm within,
under the weight of the greatest storm without.—
When he came sirst hither, he said, he used to tear
the hair from his head, and the clothes from his
back, as others had done besore him; but a little time
and consideration had made him look into himself, as
,well as round himself, to things without: that he found
the mind of man, if it was out once brought to reflect
upon the state of universal lise, and how little this
•world was concerned in its true selicity, was persectly
capable of making a selicity for itself, sully satisfying
to it/elf, and suitable to its own best ends and desires,
with but very little assistance from the world; that
air to breathe in, food to sustain lise, clothes for
warmth, and liberty for exercise, in order to heaVh,
completed, in his opinion, all that the world could
do for us: and though the greatness, the authority,, the
riches, and the pleasures, which sorue enjoyed in the
world, and which he had enjoyed his share of, had
much in them that was agreeable to us, >et he observed,
that all those things chiefly gratisied the coarsest of our
affections; such as our ambition, our particular pride,
our avarice, our vanity, and our sensuality; all which
were, indeed, the mere product of the worst part of
man, were in themselves crimes, and had in them thei
seeds of all manner of crimes; but neither were related-,
to, or concerned with, any of those virtues that constU
tmed

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
tuted us wise men, or of those graces which distin-
guished us as Christians: that being now deprived of all'
the sancied felicity, which he enjoyed in the sull exer-
cise of all those vices, he said, he was at leisure to look
upon the dark side of them, where he found all manner
of desormity ; and was now convinced, that virtue only
makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and preserves
him^ in the way to a superior happiness in a suture state;
and in this, he said, they were more happy in their ba-
nishment, than all their enemies were, who had the full
pofleflion of all the wealth and power that they (the
banished) had lest behind them.
Ner, Sir, said he, do I bring my mind to this poli-
tically, by the necessity of my circumstances, which
Ibme call miserable; but if I know any thing of myself,
I would not go back, no, not though my master, the
Czar, should call me, and offer to reinstate me in all my
former grandeur; I say, I would no more go back to
it, than I believe my soul, when it shall be delivered
from this prison of the body, and has had a taste of
the glorious state beyond lise, would come back to the
gaol of flesh and blood it is now inclosed in, and
leave heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of human
affairs.
He spake this with so much warmth in his temper, so
much earnestness and motion of his spirits, which were
apparent in his countenance, that it was evident it was
the true sense of his foul; and, indeed, there was no
xoom to doubt his sincerity.
I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a mo-
narch in my old station, of which I had given him an
account, but that I thought he was not a monarch only,
but a great conqueror; for that he that has got a vic-
tory over his own exorbitant desires, and has the abso-
lute dominion over himself, and whose reason entirely
governs his will, is certainly greater than he that con-
quers a city. But, my Lord, said I, shall I take the
liberty to ask you a question? With all my heart, said
be. If the door of your liberty was opened, said I,
would not you take hold of it to deliver yourself from
this exile?
Hold,
Hold, said he, your question is subtle, and requires
some serious just distinctions to give it a sincere answer;
and I'll give it you from the bottom of my heart. No-
thing that I know of in this world would move me to
deliver myself from the state of banishment, except these
two: First, The enjoyment of my relations; and, secondly,
A little warmer climate; but I protest to you, that to go
back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the power, the
hurry of a minister of state; the wealth, the gaiety, and
the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a courtier; if my
master should send me word this moment, that he restores
me to all he banished me from, I protest, if I know
myself at all, I would not leave this wilderness, these
deserts, and these frozen lakes, for the palace of Mos-
cow.
Bur, my lord, said I, perhaps you not only are ba-
nished from the pleasures of the court, and from the
power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed be-
fore, but you may be absent too from some of the
conveniences of lise; your estate, perhaps consiscated,
and your essects plundered; and the supplies lest you
here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of
lise.
Ay, said he, that is as you suppose me to be a
lord, or a prince, &c. So, indeed, I am; but you
are now to consider me only as a man, an human crea-
ture, not at all distinguished from another; and so I can
susser no want, unless I should be visited with sickness and
distempers. However, to put the question out of dispute;
you see our manner; we are in this place sive persons of
rank; we live persectly retired, as suited to a state of
banishment 4 we have something rescued from the ship-
wreck of our fortunes, which keeps us from the mere
necessity of hunting for our food; but the poor sol-
diers who are here, without that help, live in as much
enty as we. They go into the woods, and catch
bles and foxes; the labour of a month will m tintain
them a year; and as the way of living is not expensive,
'so it is not hard to get sufficient to ourselves: So that
.objection is out of doors,
J have.
I have no room to give a sull account of the most
agreeable conversation I had with this truly great
man; in all which he shewed, that his mind was so
inspired with a superior knowledge of things, so sup-
ported by religion, as well as by a vast share of wis-
dom, that his contempt of the world 'was really as
much as he had expressed, and that he was always
the same to the last, as will appear in the story I am
going to tell.
I had been here eight months, and a dark dread-
ful winter I thought it to be; the cold was so intense,
that I could not so much as look abroad without
being wrr.pt in surs, and a mask of sur before my
sace, or rather a hood, with only an hole for breath,
and two for sight. The little day-light we had, was,
as we reckoned, for three months, not above sive hours
a day, and six at most; only that the snow lying on the
ground continually, and the weather clear, it was never
quite dark. Our horses were kept (or rather starved)
underground ; and as for our servants (for we hired ser-
vants here to look after our horses and ourselves), we had
every now and then their' singers and toes to thaw
and take care of, lest they should mortify and fall
off.
It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights smaH, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of deer,
dried and cured in the season; good bread enough, but
baked as biscuits; dr ied sish of several sorts, and some
slesh of mutton, and of buffaloes, which is pretty good
bees. All the store of provisions for the winter are laid up
in the summer, and well cured; our drink was water
mixed with aqua-vitæ instead of brandy; and, for a
treat, mead instead of wine; which, however, they have
excellent good. The hunters, who ventured abroad all
weathers, frequently brought us in fresh venison, very fat
and good; and sometimes bears flesh, but we did not
much care for the last. We had a good stock of tea.
with which we treated our friends as above; and, in a
word, we lived very cheersully and well, all thing*
considered.

It was now March, and the days grown considerably
ionger, and the weather at least tolerable; so other tra-
vellers began to prepare sledges to carry them over the
snow, and to get things ready to be going; but my
measures being sixed, as I have said, lor Arch-Angel,
and not for Muscovy or the Baltick, I made no motion,
knowing very well, that the ships from the south do not
set out for that part of the world till May or June;
and that if I was there at the beginning of August, it
would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away;
and theresore, I say, I made no haste to be gone, as others'
did ; in a word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the
travellers, go away besore me. It seems, every year they
go from thence to Moscow for trade; viz. to carry surs,
and buy necessaries with them, which they bring back to
surnish their shops; also others went on the fame errand
to Arch-Angel; but then they also, being to come back
again above eight hundred miles, went all out besore
me.
In short, about the latter end of May I began to make
all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this, it oc-
curred to me, that seeing all these people were banished
by the Czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and-yet, when they
came there, were at liberty to go whither they would }
why did they not then go away to any part of the
world wherever they thought sit? and I began • to
examine what should hinder them from making such an
attempt.
But my wonder was over, when I entered upon
that subject with the person I have mentioned, who
answered me thus: Consider, sirst, sir, said he, the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition
are in ; especially, said he, the generality of the people
who are banished hither. We are surrounded, said he*
with stronger things than bars and bolts; on the
north side is an unnavigable ocean, where ship neves
sailed, and boat never swam; neither, if we had both,
could we know whither to go with them. Every other
way, said he, we have above a thousand miles to pase
through the Czar's own dominions, and by ways ut-
terly impassable, except by the roads made by the go-
vernment,
v«rnment, and through the towns garrisoned by his
troops; so that we could neither pass undiscovered by the
road, or subsist any other way; so that it is in vain to
attempt it.
1 was silenced, indeed, at once, and found that they
were in a prison, every jot as secure as if they had
been locked up in the cattle of Moscow; however, it
came into my thoughts, that I might certainly be
made an instrument to procure the escape of this ex-
cellent person, and that it was very easy for me to
carry him away, there being no guard over him in
the country ; and as I was not going to Moscow, but to
Arch-Angel, and that I went in the nature of a caravan,
by which 1 was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns
in the desert, but could encamp every night where I
would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Arch-
Angel, where 1 could immediately secure him on board
an English or Dutch ship, and carry him osf safe along
with me; and, as to his subsistence, and other particu-
lars, that should be my care, till he should better supply
himself.
He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the while I spoke; nay, I could see in his
very sace, that what I said put his spirits into an ex-
ceeding serment; his colour frequently changed, his
eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might
be even perceived in his countenance; nor could he im-
mediately answer me, when I had done, and, as it were,
expected what he would say to it; and after he had
paused a little, he embraced me, and said, how unhappy
are we, unguided creatures as we are, that even our
greatest acts of friendship are made snares to us, and
we are made tempters os one another! My dear
friend, said he, your offer is so sincere, has such
kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is so
calculated for my advantage, that I must have very
little knowledge of the woild, if I did not both won-
der at it, and acknowledge the obligation I have upon
jne to you for it: But did you believe I was sincere
in what I have so often said to you of my contempt
of the world? Did you believe I spoke my very soul
^to you, and that I had really maintained that degree
of selicity here, that had placed me above all that the
world could give me, or do for me? Did you believe I
was sincere, when I told you I would not go back, if I
was recalled even to be all that once I was in the court,
and with the savour of the Czar my master? Did you
believe me, my friend, to be an honest man, or did yon
think me to be a boasting hypocrite? Here he stop-
ped, as if he would hear what I would say ; but, indeed,
I soon after perceived, that he stopped because his spirits
were in motion; his heart was sull of struggles, and
he could not go on. I was, I consess, astonished at the
thing, as well as at the man, and I used some argu-
ments with him to urge him to set himself free: that
he ought to look upon this as a door opened by hea-
ven for his deliverance, and a summons by Providence,
who has the care and good disposition of all events, to
do himself good, and to render himself usesul in the
world.
He had by this time recovered himself: How do
you know, Sir, said he warmly, but that instead os a
summons from heaven, it may be a seint of another
instrument, representing, in all the alluring colours, to
me, the shew of selicity as a deliverance, which may
in itself be my snare, and tend directly to my ruin?
Here I am free from the temptation of returning to my
former miserable greatness; there I am not sure, but
that all the seeds of pride, ambition, avarice, and
luxury, which I know remain in my nature, may revive
and take root, and, in a word, again overwhelm me;
and then the happy prisoner, whom you see now master
of his soul's liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his
own senses, in the sull of all, personal liberty. Dear
Sir, let me remain in this blessed consinement, banished
from the crimes of lise, rather than purchase a shew of
freedom at the expence of the liberty of my reason, and
at the expence of the suture happiness which now I have
in my view, but shall then, I sear, quickly lose sight
of; sor I am but flelh, a man, a mere man, have pas-
sions and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me
as any man: O be not my friend and my tempter both
together!

If I was surprised besore, I was quite dumb now, and
lood silent, looking at him; and, indeed, admired what
saw; the struggle in his foul was so great, that though
lie weather was extremely cold, it put him into amott
,-iolcnt sweat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his
nind; so I said a word or two, that I would leave him
ioi consider of it, and wait on him again; and then I
withdrew to my own apartment.
About two hours after, I heard somebody at or.near
the door of the room, and was going to open<he door;
but he had opened it, and corse HU My dear friend,
laid he, you had almost overset me, but I am recovered:
do not take it ill that I do not close with your offer; I
assure you, it is not for want of a sense of the kindness
of it in you; and I come to make the most sincere ac-
knowledgment of it to you; but, I hope, I have got
the victory over myself.
My lord, said I, I hope you are sully satissied, that
you did not resist the call of Heaven. Sir, said he, if -it
had been from heaven, the same power would have in-
sluenced me to accept it; but, I hope, and am sully
satissied, that it is from heaven that I decline it; and
I have an insinite satissaction in the parting, that you
shall leave me an honest man still, though not a free
man.
I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and juake pro-
fession to him of my having no end in it, but a sincere
desire to serve him. He embraced me very paffion-
ately, and assured me he was sensible of that, and
should always acknowledge it; and with that he offered
roe a very sine present of sables, too much, indeed,
for me to accept from a man in his circumstances; a
I would have avoided them, but he would not be
sused.
The next morning 1 sent my servant to his lord-
ship with a small present of tea, two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which
did not all weigh above six ounces, or thereabouts; but
were sar short of the value of his sables, which, in-
deed, when I came to England, I sound worth near two
Iwndred pounds. He accepted the tea, and fine f^ce

f 1 had be
of the damask; and one of the pieces of gold, which had
a sine stamp upon it, of the Japan coinage, which I found
he took, for the rarity of it, but would not take any
more; and sent word, by my servant, that he desired to
speak with me.
When I came to him, he told me, I knew what
had passed between us, and hoped 1 would not move
him any more in that affair; but that, since I mado
such a generous offer to him, he asked me, if I had
kindness enough to offer the same to another person
that he would narr.e to me, in whom he had a grear
share of concern. I told him, that I could not say I
inclined to do so much for any one but hilhself, for
whom I had a particular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance r
however, if he would please to name the person to me,
I- would give him my answer, and hoped he would'
not be displeased with me, if he was with my answer..
He told me, it was his only son, who, though I had-
not seen, yet was in the fame condition with himself,
and above two hundred miles from him-, cn the other'
side the Oby; but that,, if I consented,, he would send
for him.
I mad.e no hesitation, but told him I would do it I
made some ceremony in letting him understand, that
it was wholly on his account; and that seeing I could nofc
prevail on him,, I would shew my respect to him, by
my concern for his son: but these things are too tedious
to repeat here. He sent away the next day for his son,
and in about twenty days he came back with the messen-
ger, bringing six or seven horses loaded with very rich
fars, and which, in the whole, amounted to a very great
value.
His servants brought the horses into the town,, but.
lest the young lord at a distance till night, when he earner
incognito into our apartment, and his sather presented
him to me; and, in short, we concerted there the man-
ner of our travelling, and every thing proper for the
journey.
1 had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black
fox-skins, sine ermins, and such other surs that are very
rich; I say, I had bought them in that city, for exchange .

THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF
for some of the goods brought from China; in particu-
lar, for the cloves and nuimegs, of which I Ibid the
greatest part here; and the rest afterwards at Archangel,
sor a much better price than I could have done at Lon-
tl<m; and my partner, who was sensible of the prosit, and
whose business, more particularly than mine, was merchan-
dize, was mightily pleased with our stay, on account of
the traffic we made here.
It was in the beginning of June when I left this re-
moie place, a city, I believe, little heard of in the
wcrld; and, indeed, it is so sar out of the road of com-
merce, that I know not how it snould be much talked
of. We were now come to a very small caravan, being
only thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all of
tt:em passed for mine, though my new guest was pro-
prietor of eleven of them. It was most natural also,
that I should take more servants with me than 1 had be-
fore, and the young lord passed for my steward ; what
£reat man I passed for myself I know not, neither did
it concern me to enquire. We had here the worst and
the largest desert to pass over that we met with in all
the journey; indeed I call it the worst, because the
way was very deep in some places, and very uneven
in others; the best we had to say for it was, that we
thought we had no troops of Tartars and robbers to
fear, and that they never came on this side the river
Oby, or at least but very seldom; but we found it
otherwise.
My young lord had with him a saithsul Muscovite
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was perfectly
acquainted with the country; and who led us by pri-
vate roads, that we avoided coming into the principal
towns and cities upon the great road, such as 1 umen,
Soloy, Kamoslcoy, and several others; because the
Vluscovite garrisons, which are kept there, are very cu-
rious and strict in their observation upon travellers,
ind searching lest any of the banished persons of note
hould make their escape that way into Muscovy ; but
,y this means, as we were kept out of the cities, so our
,-hoIe journey was a desert, and we were obliged to en-
amp and lie in our tents, when we might have had
ood accommodation in the cities on the way; this
the
the young h>rd was sensible of, that he would not
allow us to lie abroad, when we came to several cities^
on the way; but lay abroad himself, with his servant',,
in the woods,- and met us always at the appointed,
places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed the river
Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary between
Europe and Asia; and the sirst city on the European side
was called Soloy-Kamoikoy, which is as much as to say,
the great city on the river Kama; and here we thought
to have seen some evident alteration in the people, their
manners, their habit, their religion, and their business;
but we were mistaken;-for as we had a vast desert to
pass, which, by relation, is near seven hundred miles,
long.in some places, but not above two hundred miles
long over where we passed it; so,, till we came past that
horrible place, we found very little difference between
that country and the Mogul Tartary; the people mostly.
Pagans, and little better than the savages of America;
their houses and towns sull of idols, and their way os'
living wholly barbarous, except in the. cities as above,
and the villages near them; where they are Christians, as .
they, call themselves, of the Greek church; but even
these have their religion mingled with so many reliques-
of superstition, that it is scarce to be known in some,
places for mere sorcery and witchcraft.
In passing this sorest, I thought, indeed, we must,afteri
all our dangers were, in ourimagination, escaped, as be-
fore, have been plundered and robbed, and perhaps mur-
dered by a troop of thieves;.of what country they were,.
whether, the roving bands of the Ostiachi, a kind of
Tartars, or wild people on the banks of the Oby, had
ranged thus sar; or whether they were the sable hunters
of Siberia, 1 am .yet at a loss to know ; but they were
an on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were
at sirst about sive and forty in number; they came so ,
near to us, as within about two musquet-shot; and, alk-
ing no questions, they surrounded us with their horse,
and looked very earnestly upon us twice; at length they
placed themselves just in our way;. upon which we. i
drevy up in a little line besore our camels, being
'M 3 not
rot above sixteen men in all; and being drawn up
thus, we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant,
who attended his lord, to see who they were ; his mas-
ter was the more willing to let him go, because he
was not a little apprehensive that they were a Siberian
troop sent after him. The man came up near them
with a slag of truce, and called to them ; but though
he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of lan-
guages rather, he could not understand a word they said;
however, after some signs to him not to come near-
er to them at his peril; so he said he understood
them to mean, offering to moot at him if he ad-
vanced; the sellow came back no wiser than he went,
only that by their dress, he said, he believed them to be
some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hords;
and that there must be more of them on the great desert,
though he never heard that ever any of them were seen
so sar north besore.
This was small comfort to us; however, we had no
remedy; there was on our lest hand, at about a quarter
of a mjle's distance, a little grove or clump of trees,
which stood close together, and very near the road; I
immediately resolved we would advance to those trees,
and fortify oorselves as well as we could there; for, sirst,
1 considered that the trees would in a great measure cover
us from their arrows; and, in the next place, they could
not eome to charge us in a body; it was, indeed, my
eld Portuguese pilot who proposed it; and who had this
excellency attending him, namely, that he was always
readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in cafes
ef the most danger. We advanced immediately with
what speed we could, and gained that little wood, the
Tartars or thieves, for we knew not what to call them,
keeping their stand, and not attempting to hinder us.
When we came thither, we found, to our great satisfac-
tion, that it was a swampy springy piece of ground,
and', on the other side, a very great spring os water,
which, running out in a little rill or brook, was a little
farther joined by another of the like bigness; and was,
in ihort, the head 01 source of a considerable river, cal-
led afterwards the Wirtska; the trees which grew about
this spring, were not in all above two hundred, but were
very large, and stood pretty thick; so that as soon as we
got in, we saw ourselves persectly sase from the enemy,
unless they alighted and attacked us on foot.
But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, with
indesatigable application, cut down great arms of the
trees, and laid them hanging, not cut quite off, from one
tree to another; so that he made a continued sence almost
round us.
We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy, some
hours, without perceiving they made any offer to stir;
when about two hours besore night, they came down di-
rectly upon us; and, though we had not perceived it,,
we found they had been joined by some more of the same,,
so that they were near fourscore horse, whereof, however,
we sancied some were women. They came on till they
were within half a shot of our little wood, when we sired
one musquet without ball, and called to them in the
Russian tongue, to know what they wanted, and bid
them keep off; but, as if they knew nothing of what we
said, they came on with a double sury directly up to the
wood-side, not imagining we were so barricadoed, that
they could not break in: our old pilot was our captain,
as well as he had been our engineer; and desired of us
not to sire upon them, till they came within pistol-shot,
that we might be sure to kill; and that when we did sire,
we should be sure to take good aim. We bade him
give the word of command; which he delayed so long,
that they were, some of them, within two pikes length
of us when we sired.
We aimed so true (or Providence directed our shot so
sure) that we killed fourteen of them at the sirst volley, ,
and wounded several others, as also several of their horses;
for we had all of us loaded our pieces with two or three
bullets a-piece, at least.
They were terribly surprised with our sire, and retreat-
ed immediately about one hundred rods from us; in which
time we loaded our pieces again, and, seeing them keep
that distance, we sallied out, and caught sour or sive
•f their horses, whose riders, we supposed, were killed;
ami, coming up to ihe dead, we could easily perceive
they were Tartars^ but knew not from, what country, ot
bow they cauie to. make an excursion such an unusual
length.
About an hour after, they made a motion to attack
us again, and rode round our little wood, to see where
else they mi^ht break in; but sinding us always ready to-
f:\rx them, they went osf again, and we resolved not to
stir from the place for that night..
We slept a little, you may be sure; but spent.the most
part of the night in strengthening our.situation, andbar-
ricadoing the entrances into the wood; and, keeping a
strict watch, we waited for day-light, and, when it
came, it gave us. a very unwelcome discovery indeed;
for the enemy, who we thought were discouraged with
the reception they had met with, were now increased to
no less than three hundred,, and had set up eleven or
twelve huts and tents,, as.if they were resolved to besiege
iis; and this little camp they had pitched was upon the
open plain, at about three quarters of a mile from us.
We w-ere, indeed, surprised at this discovery; and now,
T consess, I gave myself over for lost, and all that I had.
The loss of my effects did not lie so near me (though they
vvere very considerable) as the thoughts of salling into
the hands of such barbarians, at the latter end of my
journey, after so many difficulties and hazard as I had
gone through and even in sight.of our port, where we
expected safety and deliverance. As for my partner, he
•tvas raging : he declared, that to lose his goods would lie
Jiis ruin; and he would. ratheE die than be starved; and
pe was for sighting to. the last drop.
The young lord, as gallant as ever: flesh (hewed itself,
xvas for sighting to the last,also ;.and my old pilot was os
the opinion we were able to resist them all,, in the situa-
tion we then were in: and thus we spent the day in de-
lates of what we should do; but, towards^ evening, we
found, that, the number of our. enemies stilli increased:
perhaps, as they were abroad in several parties for prey,
[he first had sent out scouts to call s or help, and to ac-
quaint them of their booty; and we did. not know but
<r,y the morning they might still be a greater number*
so 1 began to enquire ot those people we had brought
from Tobolski, if there was no other, or mere private
ways, by which we might avoid them in the night, and,
perhaps, either retreat to some town, or get help to guard
us over the desert.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord, told
us, if we designed to avoid them, and not sight, he would
engage to carry us off in the night to a way that went
north towards the river Petraz, by which he made no
doubt but we might get away, and the Tartan never the
wiser; but he said, his lord had told him he would not
return, but would rather choose to sighr. I told him, he
mistook his lord; for that he was too wise a man to love
sighting for the sake of it; that I knew his lord was
brave enough by what he had shewed already; but that
his lord knaw better, than to desire to have seventeen
or eighteen men sight sive hundred, unless an unavoidable
necessity forced them to it; and that if he thought it
possible for in to escape in the night, we had nothing
else to do but to attempt it. He answered, if his lord
gave him such order, he would lose his lise if he did not
persorm it. We soon brought his lord to give that
order, though privately, and we immediately prepared
for the putting it in practice.
And sirst, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled
a sire in our little camp, which we kept burning, and
prepared so as to make it burn all night, that the Tar-
tars might conclude we were still there; but, as soon as
it was dark, that is to say, so as we could see the stars,
(for our guide would not stir besore) having all our horses
and camels ready loaden, we followed our new guide,
who, I soon found, steered himself by the pole, or north
star, all the country being level for a long way.
After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began
to be lighter still, not that it was quite dark all night,
but the moon began to rife, so that, in short, it was ra-
ther lighter than we wished it to be; but by six o'clock
next morning, we were gotten near forty miles, though
the truth is, we almost spoiled our horses. Here we
found a Russian village, named Kirmazinflcoy, where we
rested, and heard nothing of the Calmuck Tartars that
day. About two hours besore night we set out again,
and travelled till eight the next morning, though not
quid' lo hastily as besore; and about scvem o'clock we
palled a little river, called Kirtza, and came to a good
Jargc town inhabited by Ruffians,, and very populous,
called Ozoinys: there we heard, that several troops or.
hords of Calmucks had been abroad,upon the desert, but
that we were now completely out of danger of them,
which was to our great satissaction, you may be sure.
Here we were obliged to get some fresh horses, aud hav-
ing need enough of rest; we staid foe days-.and my
partner and I agreed to give the honest Siberian, who
brought us thither, the value of ten pistoles for his con-
ducting us.
In sive days more we came to Veusiima,upon the rivep
Witzogda, which running into the river Dvvina,we were
there very happily near the- end of our travels by tand,
that river being nav igable in seven days passage to Arch-
angel: from hence we came to Lawrenskoy, where the
liyer joins, the third of July; and provided ourselves
with two luggage-boats,'and a barge, for our conve-
nience-, we embarked the seyenth, and arrived all safe at
Archangel trie eighteenth, having been a year, sive
menths, and three days, on the journey, including our
stay of eight months and odd days at Tobolski.
We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the
arrival of the ships, and must have tarried longer, had
pot a Hamburgher come in above a month sooner than,
any of the English ships; when, after some considera-
tion, that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be
as-good a market for our goods as London, we all took,
freight with him; and, having put our goods on board,
it was most natural for me to put my steward on board to-
take care of them; by which means my young lord had.
a sussicient opportunity to conceal himself, never coming
on shore again,'in all the time we staid there; and this
he did, that he might not be seen in the city, where
some of the Moscow merchants woald certainly have
seen and discovered him.
We sailed from Archangel the twentieth os August
the same year; and, after no extraordinary bad vogage,.
arrived in the Elbe, the thirteenth of September: here
tny partner and I found a very good sale for our goods.,
as-well those of China, as the sables, &c . of Siberia ; an&
i dividing
,dividing the produce of our essects, my share amounted
to 347 5L 17s. 3d. notwithstanding so many losses we had
sustained, and charges we had been at.; only remem-
bering that I had included, in this, about 6ool. worth of
diamonds, which I had purchased at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up
the Elbe, in order to go to the Court of Vienna, where
he resolved to seek protection, and where he could cor-
respond with those of his sather'-s friends who were lest
alive. He .did not part without all the testimonies he
could give, of gratitude for the service I had done him,
and his sense of my kindness to the prince his sather.
To conclude, having staid near four months in Ham-
burgh, I came from thence over land to the Hague,
where I embarked in the packet, and arrived in London
the 10th of January, 1705, having been gone from Eng-
land ten years and nine months.
And here, resolving to harass myself no more, I am
preparing for a longer journey than all these, having
lived seventy-two years a lise of insinite variety, and
learned sufficiently to know the value of retirement, and
the blessing of ending our days in peace.
