MADVENTURES OF ROBINSON GRUSOE.

--oo..-oC/.__

(Jone, gather round me, little ones, lFor many things he there had found

And hearken unto me, "hat he could bring ashore,
And you shall bear a tale about Upon the raft that he had made,
A lad that went to sea---- And carry to his store.
About a lad that ran away, Two kittens and a faithful dog,
0h; many years ago, With powder, guns, and shot,
., And lelt his home and parents dear-- Three cheeses and a chest of tools.
Young Robinson Crusoel 'Mong other things he got

Now when this lad grew up a man, And now he bravely went to work,

It came about one day, Made tables, chairs, and stools,
That he was cast upon a rock-- ' And shelves around his little home,
An island far away. On which to lay his tools. '

And there to shield him from the storm, He set a cross up on the beach,

And keep him safe and sound, Lest time should go astray,

He built a house, and thateh'd it o'er, 2And with his knife he cut a notch,
And fenced it round and round. To mark each passing day.

Far ofl' upon a sandy bank He caught and tamed a little kid,
His ship lay all a. wreck; That trotted at his heels;

And oft-times when the sat was low !And with his dog and cats at home,
He got upon the deck. 3 It shared his daily meals. I

"Mutant"

Km??? ;
Yet sometimes he grew very sad, A parrot, that some years before

And then he sat him down He artfully had caught,
Upon the shore, and thought his God Would hop upon his thumb, and shriek
Looked on him with a frown. The lessons it was taught.

And he would gaze upon the sea, And so, to keep it snug, he made

Across the billows wild; A cage to put it in:

And wring his hands and cry aloud, And he made a big umbrella, too,
And weep like any child. And all his clothes of skin.

He thought upon his father's words-- I wot he was the strangest sight
His mother's prayers and tears; That ever you might see;

Howtheywouldgrieve forhim,theirson, In jacket, breeches, cap, and shoes,
Away so many years! A hairy man looked he.

Then he would fall upon his knees, ,With big umbrella o'er his head,
And clasp his hands in prayer, I His sword hung at his side, .

And ask his God, with many tears, His gun and axe upon his back,
His wicked life to spare. He rambled far and wide.

I

At times, with gun upon his back, Now on the island herds of goats
He roamed the island round, Were running wild and free;

But when he tried to catch the things,
Away they all would flee.

Where melons, grapes, and sugar-canes,
All growing. wild he found.
And, so to get them in his power,
He dug pits in the ground;

Atlength he longed when days were fine,
Upon the waves to float;

And there one morn at break of day, So with his tools he went to work,

A goat and kids he found.

The goat he let away again,
For it was fierce and strong;
The little kids he tied with strings,
And took with him along. '

And then from running wild again,
His little flock to keep,

A piece of ground he fenced around,
Where they might feed and sleep.

His crops of barley and of rice,
Now rich and ripe had grown;
For seeds he found upon the wreck,

He long ago had sown.

The corn he pounded into meal,
And made it into bread;

The rice he baked in little cakes,
<<At times to eat instead.

And made a little boat.

He set a mast and sail before,
A rudder, too, behind;

And with his dog and gun on board,
He sped before the wind.

One summer morning as he walked
Abroad, with gun in hand,

He stood aghast as he beheld
A footprint in the sand!

Though many years had passed away,
Since to that lonely place

He came, yet he had never caught
A sight of human face.

He thought of dreadful savages,
All naked, wild, and black;

And paused at every step he took,
To look in tenor back.
He dreamt about them in the night, But ere his enemies had time
. And thought of them by day; A hand on him to lay,
He soareewould stir, lest they by chance He turned and bounded like a roe,
Should come across his way. Away--~away--away.

At last one day he climbed a hill, Across a stream he swam with speed,

Where oft he used to lie, Close followed by his foes;
And took with him his telescope, But he was saved by our good friend
To see what he could spy. The man in hairy clothes!

And looking off towards the shore, A young and comely man he was,

 

A sight he did behold, So timid and so shy,

That set his very hair on end, With tawny skin and hair of jet,
And made his blood run cold. And mild and beaming eye.

A band of painted savages, And oft he paused and looked around,
He saw to his dismay, And knelt as if in fear;

All dancing round a fire, on which But Crusoe made him signs w come,
A human body lay. ' And softly he drew near.

He saw them kill a. helpless man, Then Crusoe named him Friday there,
And one was standing by, And ever called him so,

Allin an agony of fear, Because upon that very day
For he, too, was to die. He saved him from the foe. 'And Friday quickly learned to work, Then Crusoe bade him bring the guns,

For ready hand had he; And prime without delay;
And helped, in time, to build a boat And soon they beat the savages,
And launch it in the sea. And drove them all away.

His master taught him many thhigs, In one canoe upon the sands,

Of God he told him, too, Half dead and strongly bound,
Who made the sun and moon and stars, All ready for to kill and eat,
And watches all we do. A poor old man they found.
A touching sight it was to see, When Friday saw his face, he paused,
Poor Friday knee! to pray-- Another look to take, [wept,
To hear him cry to God for help, Then laughed and cried,and subbed and
In his poor broken way. As if his heart would break. '

Where'er he was, in house or field, lie-clasped the old man round the neck,

He ever was the same; And kissed him o'er and o'er;
Obeyed his master with a smile, And leapt and danced with very joy,
And feared his Maker's name. To see that face once more.

One morning Friday came in haste, He gave him food, hebrought himdrink,
In trembling and in awe, He cut his bonds in twain;

And told his master three canoes The dear old father that he loved,
Upon the beach he saw. Nor thought to see again.
Poor Friday, though his skin was black, Once more on board an English ship,

His heart was warm and kind--
My little ones, a lesson this,
For all to bear in mind.

N ow eight and twenty weary years,
Had Crusoe been ashore,

Upon his island, night and day,
Nor thought to leave it more.

Then oh, what joy was his to see
One morn a spreading sail

Come dancing o'er the waters blue,
Before the swelling gale.

He watched with Friday from a hill,
Though distant many a mile,
Until he saw a boat put 011'
And row towards the isle.

And now at last, his trials o'er.
With grateful heart he trod

And bowed in thanks to God.

His faithful Friday went with him;
His Friday, true and kind,
Who loved him more than all on earth,
He could not leave behind.
<<2
His big umbrella, too, he took,
His hairy cap as well;
And parrot with its noisy tongue,
01' other days to tell.

And then with heavy heart he tumed.
To bid his home adieu;

And soon, as onward sped the ship,
It faded from his view.

And when old England's shore he saw,
Oh, he shed many tears;

For he had been away in all
Full five and thirty years.
