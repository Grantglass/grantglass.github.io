IF ever the flory of any private man's
adventures in the world were worth
making public, and were acceptable
when publiihed, the editor of this ac-
count thinks this will be fo.
The wonders of this man's life exceed
all that (he thinks) is to be found extant j.
the life of one man being fcarce capable
of a greater variety.
The ftory is told with modefty, with
ferioufnefs, and with a religious appli-
cation of events to the ufes to which
wife men always apply them, viz. to
the inftruction of others by this ex-
ample, and to juftify and honour the
wifdom of Providence in all the variety
of our circumftances, let them happen
how they will.

iv THE PREFACE.
The editor believes the thing to be a
juft hiftory of fact; neither is there any
appearance of fiction in it: and though
he is well aware there are many, who on
account of the very fingular prefervations
the author met with, will gtve it the
name of a romance; yet, in which-ever
of thefe lights it fhall be viewed, he i-
magines, that the improvement of it,
as well to the diveriion, as to the inftruc-
tion of the reader, will be the fame; and
as f'uch, he thinks, without farther com-
pliment to the worjd, he does them a
great fervice in the publication.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I Was born at York, in the year 163?) of a repu-
table family. My father was a natire ci Bremen,
who, by merchandizing at Hull for fome time,
gained a very plentiful fortune. He married my
mother at York, who received her firft breath in that
country: and as her maiden name was Bobinfon, I
was called Robinfon Kreutznaer s which not being
eafily pronounced in the Englifh tongue, we are com-
monly known by the name of Crufoe.
I was the youngeft of three brothers. The eideft
was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockiiart's regiment, but
flain by the Spaniards: what became of the other, I
could never learn.
No charge nor pains were wanting in my educa-
tion. My tataer oe'igucd me for the law; yet no-
thing would fern ine but I muft go to fea, both a-
gainft the will of my father, the tears of my me her,
and the entreaties o; 'fiends. One morning my fa-
ther expofhilated ve./ warmly with me. What rea-
fon, f,ys he, have yei: to leave your native country,
where there muft be a more certain profpect of con-
tent and hsppj'.efs, to enter into a wandering con-
dition of uneafincfs and uncertainty? He reconunen-

ded to me Augur's wifh, Neither to dcfire poverty nor
riches; that a middle ftate t>f life was the moft hap-
py, and that the high towering thoughts of fifing
our condition by wandering abroad, were furrotrffiri-
ed with mifery and .danger, and often ended with
confufion and difappointment. I entreat you, nay,
I command you, (fays he), to defift from thefe inten-
tions. Confider your cldeft brother, who laid down
his Jife for his honour, cr rnther lofl it for his dif-
obcdicnce to my will. If you will go, (added he), my
prayers fhall however be offered for your prefervati-
on ; but a time may come, when, defolate, oppref-
fexl, or forfaken, you may wifh you had taken your
poor defpifed father's counfel.- He pronounced
thefe words with fuch a moving and paternal elo-
quence* while floods of tears ran down his aged
check^fthat it fecmed to ftem the torrent of my re-
folutions. But this fooh wore off, and a little after
I informed my mother, that I could not fettle to any
bufrnefs, my refolutions were fo ftrong to fee the
world; and begged flie would gain my father's, con-
fent only to go one voyage; which, if it did not prove
profperous, I would nevSr attempt a fecond. But my
defire was as vain as my folly in afking. My mother
paffionately exprdTed her diflike of this propofal,
telling me, That as Jbe fa-w 1 was bent upon my own.
definition, contrary to their -will and my duty, Jbe
I,ouldfay no more, but leave me to myfelfto do -what-
foever 1 f leafed.
1 was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one
time'being at Hull, I met a fchool-fellow of mine,
going along with his father, who was mafter of a fhip,
to London; and acquainting him with my wandering
defines, he affured me of a free paflagf, and a plenti-
ful fliare of what was neceffary. Thus, withour im-
ploring a bkffing, or taking farewell of my parents,
I took fhipping on the firft of September 1651. We
fet fail foon after; and our fhip had fcarce left the
Humber aftern, when there arofe fo violent a florm,
that.
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3
that, being extremely fea-fick, I concluded die judg-
ments of God defervedly followed me for my difobe-
dience to my dear parents. It was then I called to
mind the good advice of my father; how eafy and
comfortable was'a middle ftate of life.; am! 1 firmly
refolved, if it pleafed God to fet me on dry land
once more, I would return to my parents, implore
their forgivenefs, and brd a final adieu 'to my wan-
dering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the ftorm continued;
but thefe good refolutions decreafed with the danger;
more efpecially when my companion came to me,
clapping me on the moulder: What, Bob! faid he,
fare you was not frightened loft night -withfcarcs a cap-
full of-wind? And do you, cried I, call fitch a vio-
lent ftorin a cap full of wind? A ftorm, .you fool you,
faid he, this is nothing; agoidjhipandfea-roomctl-
•ways baffles fiich afoolijh fqua-wl of-wind as that: But
you're a freflj-iuater failor: Come boy, turn out, fee
•whatfine -weather -we have new, and a. good bowl of
punch will drown all your paft forrows. In fhort, th~
punch was made, I was drunk; and in one night's
time drowned both my repentance and my good re-
'folations, forgetting entirely the vows and-promifes
I made in my diftrefs: and whenever any reflections
would return on me) what by company, and what
by drinking, I foon maftered thofe fits,- as I deriding-
ly called'them. But this only made way for another
trial, whereby I 'could not but fee how much I was
beholden to kind providence.
.;< Upon the Gxth day we came to an anchor in Har-
wich road, where we lay wind bound with feme New-
• caftle fhips; and there being good anchorage, and
our cables found, the feamen forgot their late toil
and danger, and fpent the time as merry as if they
had been on fbore. But on the eighth day there aroiii
a brifk gale of'wind, which prevented our tiding it
up the river; and flifi increafing, our fhip rode fon;-
cailk in, and fhipped feveral large feas.
A i It
It was not long before horror feized the feamen
th.-mfclves, and 1 heard the Mailer exprefs this me-
lancholy ejaculation, Lord have mercy upon ?:j, tue
fiall be all loft and undone! For my part, fiek unto
death, I kept my cabin, till the univerfal and terribly
dreadful apprehenfions of our fpeccly fate made me get
upon deck: and there I was affrighted indeed. The
fea went mo"mains high: I could fee nothing but
diftrefs around us; two Ihiris had cut their mafts ori
board, and another whs foundered: two more that
had loft their anchors, were forced out to the mercy
ot the ocean; and, to fave our lives, we were forced
to cut our foremaft and mainmaft quite away.
Who is there fo ignorant as not to judge of my
dreadful condition? I was but a frefh-water failor,
and therefore it feemed more terrible. Our fhip was
very good, but over-loaded; which made the failors .
often cry out, She -wouldfounder: Words I then was
ignorant of. All this while the florm continuing,
v.nd lather increafing, the mafter and the more fober
part of his men went to' prayers, expecting de.ath
every moment. In the middle of the night one cried
out, We had fpn/ng a leak .- another, That there -was
four foot -water in the hold. I was juft ready to ex-
pire with fear, when immediately all hands were call-
ed to the pump; and the men forced me alfo in that
extremity to (hare with them in their labour. While
thus employed, the mailer efpying fome light colliers,
fired a gun as a fignal of diftrefs; and I not under-
Handing what it meant, and thinking that either the
Jhip broke, or fome dreadful thing happened, fell
into a fwoon. Even in that common condition of
woe, nobpdy minded me, excepting to thruft me a-
fide with their feet, thinking me dead, and it was a
great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when, upon the fignal given,
they ventured -out their boat to fave our lives. All
our pumping had been in vain, and vain had all our
attempts beena had they not come to our fhip's Cde,
and
•
and our men cafh them a rope over the ftern with a
, buoy to it, which after great labour they got hold of,
and we haling them to us, got into their boat, and
left our fhip, which we perceived fink within lefs than
a quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what was
meant by Foundering at fea. . And now the men in-
cefiantly laboured to recover their own fhip; but the
fea ran fo high, and the wind blew fo hard, that
they thought it convenient to hale within fhore;
which, with great difficulty and danger, at laft we
happily effected, landing at a place called Cramer, not
. far from Winterton light-houfe; from whence we all
walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of pity, many
good people furnifhed us with neceflaries to carry us
either to Hull or London.
Strange, that after all this, like the prodigal fon,
I did not return to. my father; who, hearing of the
fhip's calamity, for a long time thought me intombed
in the deep. No doubt but I fhould have jhared in
his fatted calf, as the fcripture expreffeth it: hut my
ill fate ftill pufhed me on, in fpite of the powerful
convictions of reafon and confcience.
When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met
. my old companion, who had given me the invitation
to go on board along with his father. His behavi-
our and fpeech was altered, and in a melancholy man-
ner afked me how I did, telling his father who I was,
and how I had made this voyage for a trial only to
proceed farther abroad. Upon which the old genile-
man turning to me gravely, faid, Young man, you ought
never to go to fea any more, but to take this for a certain
fign tAatyou -will never pro/per inafeafaring condition.
Sir, anfwered /, will you take the fame refolution ?- It
is a different cafe, faid he, it is my calling, and confe-
quently my duty; but as you have made this vsyagefor
• a trial, you fee -what illfuccefs heaven hasfet before your
eyes; andpei-haps ourmiferies have been on your account,
like Jonah in the jhip of Tarfliifh But pray -what are
• you> a.nd on what account did you go to fea? Upon
A 3 which
which I very freely declared my whole flory ; at the
end of which he made this exclamation: Ye facred
powers! what had I committed, that fuch a wretch
fhould enter into my fhip, to heap upon me fuch a
deluge of miferies! But foon recollecting his paffions,
Tn.ng man, faid he, if you do not go back, depend up-
on it, -where-ever you go, you -will meet with difafters
and difappointments till yoilr father's -words are fulfil-
led upon you. And fo we parted.
I thought at firft to return homo; but fhame op-
pofed that good motion, as thinking I fhould be laugh-
ed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So ftrange
is the nature of youth, who are not afhamed to fin,
but yet afhamed to repent; and fo far from being a-
fhamed of thofe actions for which they may be ac-
counted fools, they think it folly to return to their
duty, which is the principal mark of wifdom. In
fhort, I travelled up to London, refolving upon a voy-
age; and a voyage I foon heard of, by my acquaintance
•with a captain who took a fancy to me, to go to the
coaft of Guinea. Having fome money, and appearing
like a gentleman, 1 went on board not as a common
failor or foremaft-man; nay, the commander agreed
1 fhould go that voyage with him without any ex-
pence; that I fhould be his mefs-mate and compa-
nion, and I was very welcome to carry any thing with
me, and make the beft merchandife I could.
I bleflcd my happy fortune, and humbly thanked
my captain for this offer; and acquainting my friends
in Yorkfhire, forty pounds were fent me, the greateft
part of which my dear father and mother contri-
buted to, with which I bought toys and trifles, as the
captain directed me. My-captain alfo taught me navi-
gation, hr-w to keep an account of the fhip's courfe,
take an obferv;>tion, and led me into the knowledge
of feveraLufeful branches of the mathematics. And'
indeed this voyage ma.le me both a failor and a mer-
chant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces
of gold duft for my adventure, which produced, at
my
my return to London, almoft three hundred pounds.
But in this voyage I was extremely fick, being
thrown into a violent calenture through exceffive
heat,, trading upon the coaft from the latitude of
fifteen degrees north even to the line itfelf.
But alas! my d,ear friend the captain foon departed
this lite after his arrival. This was a fenfible grief
•to. me; yet I refolved to. go another voyage with his
mate, 'who had now got command of the fhip. This
proved a very unfuccefsful one; for though I did not
carry quite a hundred pounds of my late acquired
•wealth, (fo that 1 had two hundred pounds left, which
I repoied with the captain's widow, who was an ho-
neft gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in this unhap-
py voyage were very great. For our fhip failing to-
wards the Canary iflands, we we/e chafed by a Sallee
rover; and in fpite of all the hafte we could make, by
crouding as much canvas as our yards could fpread,
or our mafts carry, the pirate gained upon us, fo that
we prepared ourfelves to fight. They had eighteen
guns, and we had but twelve. About three in the
afternoon there was a defperate engagement, where-
i'n many were killed.and wounded on both fides: but
finding oorfelves overpowered with numbers, our
fhip difabled, and ourfelves too impotent to have the
leaft hopes of fuccefs, we were forced to furrender;
and accordingly were all carried prisoners into the
port of Sallee. Our men were fent to the Emperor's
court to be fold there; but the pirate captain taking
notice of me, kept me to be his own flave.
In this condition, I thought myfelf the moftmifer-
able creature on earth, and the prophecy of my father
came afrefh into my thoughts. However, my condi-
tion was better than I thought it to be, as will foon
appear. Some hopes indeed I had that my new pa-
'tron would go to fea again, where he might be taken
by a Spanifh or Portuguefe man of war, and th-en I
fhould be fet at liberty. But in this I w.is miftaken;
for he never took me with him, but left me to look
after
after his little garden, and do the drudgery of his
houfe, and when he returnefl from fea, would make
me lie in the cabin, and look after the fliip. I had
no one that I could cummunicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my efcape; no
Englifhman, Irifhman, or Sectanan here, -but my-
felf; and for two years I could fee nothing practi-
cable, but only pleafed myfelf with the imagination.
After feme length of time, my t>atron, as I found,
grew fo poor, that he could not fit out his fhip as u-
•fual: and then he ufed conftantly, once or twice a-
week, if the'weather was fair, to go out a-fifhing,
taking me and a young Morefco boy to row the boat;
and fo much pleafed was he with me for my dexte-
rity in catching the fifh, that he would often fend
me with a Moor, who was one of his kinfmen, and
the Morefco youth, to catch a difh of fifh for him.
One morning, as we were at the fport, there arofe
fuch a thick fog, that we lofl fight of the fhore: and
rowing we knew not which way, we laboured all the
night, and in the morning found ourfelves in the
ocean, two leagues from land. However, we attain-
ed there at length, and made the greater bafte, be-
caufe our ftomachs were exceeding fharp and hun-
gry. In order to prevent fuch difafters for the future,
my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little ilate-
room or cabin in the middle of the. long-boat, with a
place behind it to fteer and hale home the main
fheet, with other conveniencies to keep him from the
weather, as alfo lockers to put in all manner of pro-
vifions, with a handfome fhoulder-of-mutton fail,
gibing over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us out a-fifhing; and'
one time inviting two or three perfons of diftin&ion
to go with him, made provifion extraordinary,, provi-
ding alfo three fufees with powder and fhot, that they
might have fome fport at fowling along the fca-coaft.
The next morning the boat was made clean, her an-
cient and pendants out, and every thing ready; but
•' "their
their minds-altering, my patron ordered us to go a-
'£fhing, for that his guefts-would certainly fup with
him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance in-
'deed. In order to this I perfuaded the Moor to get
fome provifions on boardr as not daring to meddle
with our patron's; and he taking my advice, we fto-
red jeurfclves with rufk bifcuit, and three jars of wa-
ter. Befidcs, I privately conveyed into the boat a
bottle of Brajidy, fome twine, thread, a hammer, hat-
chet, and a faw; and, in particular, fome bees wax,
which was a great comfort to me, and ferved to make
candles. I then perfuaded Muley (for fo was the Moor
called) to procure fome, powder and fhot, pretending
to kill fea carlieus, which he-innocently and readily
agreed to. In fhort, being provided with all things
neceflary, we failed out, refolving for my own part
to make my efcape, tho' it fhould coft me my life.
When we had paffed the caftle, we fell to fifhing;
.but, though I knew there was a bite, I diffembled the
matter, in order to put further out, to fea. Accord-
ingly we ran a leegue further; when giving the boy
the helm, and pretending to ftopp for lomething, I
feized Muley by furprife, and threw him overboard.
. As he was an excellent fwimmer, he foon arofe, and
made towards the boat; upon which, I took out a
fufee, and prefented it at him: Mi/ley, faid I, I never
yet dejlgned to do yau any harm, andfeek nothing noio
but my redemption, I know you are able enough tofwirn
to flare, and fave your life; hut if you are refelved to
follow mei to the endangering of mine, the very moment
you proceed, I •will JJioot you through the head. The
harmlcfs creature, at theie words, turned himfelf from
me, and I make no doubt got fafe to land. Then turn-
ing to the boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at the
a£Hon; but I put him out of all fear, telling him,
that if he would be true and faithful to me, I would
,do well by him. And> therefore, faid I, you. muftjtroke
• your face to be faithful, and, as the Turks have learned
you,
you,fwear by Mahomet, and the beard of your father,
or elfe I -will throw you into the fea alfo. So innocent
did the child then look, and with fuch an obliging
fmile confented, that I readily believed him, and
from that day forward began to love him entirely.
We then purfued our voyage ; and, left they mould
think me gone to the Streights mouth, I kept to the
fouthward to the truly Barbarian coaft! but, in the
dufk of the evening, I changed my courfe, and fteer-
ed directly S. and by E. that I might keep near the
fhore; and, having a frefh gale of wind, with a plea-
fant fmooth fea, by three o'clock next day I was 150
miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions.
Yet ftill havihg the dreadful apprehenfion of being re-
taken, I continued failing for five days fucceffively, till
fuch time as the wind Chuffing to the fouthward, made
me conclude^ that if any reffel was in chace of me,
they would proceed no • farther. After fo much fa-
tigue and thought, I anchored at the mouth of a lit-
tle river, I knew not what, or where; neither did I
then fee any people. What I principally wanted was
frefh water; and I was refolved about the du'fk to
fwim afhore. But no fooner did the gloomy clouds of
night begin to fucceed the declining day, when we
heard fuch ba-rking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, that one might have thought the very
ftrangeft monfters of nature, or infernal fpirits, had
their refidence there. • Poor Xury, almoft dead with
fear, entreated me not to go on fbore that night-
Suppojing I dont,. Xury, faid I, and'in the morning -we
Jhould fee men -who are -worfe than thofe -Me fear, -what
then? 0 den -we may give dem lie /boot gun, replied Xu-
ry, laughing, and de gun make dim all run away. The
wit, and broken Englifh which the boy had learned
among the captives of our nation, pleafed me entire-
ly; and, to add to his cheerfulnefs, I gave him a dram
of the bottle: we could get but little fleep all the night
for thofe terrible bowlings they made; and, indeed,
we were both very rmjch affrighted, when, by ths
rollings
rollings of the water, and other tokens, we juftly
concluded one of thofe monfters made towards our
boat. I could not fee till it came within two oars
length, when taking my fufee, I let fly at him. Whe-
ther I hit him or no, 1 cannot tell ; .but he made to-
wards the fhore, and the noife of my gun increafed
the ftupendous noife of the monfters.
The next morning I was refolved to go on fhore
to get frefh water, and venture my life among the
beafts or favages, fhould either attack me. Xury faid,
he would take one of the jars, and bring me fome. v I
afked him why he would go, and-not I? The poor
boy anfwered, If -wild mans come, they eat me, you go
•way. A mind fcarcely now to be imitated, fo con-
trary to felf-prefervation, the moft powerful law of
nature! This indeed increafed my affection to the
child. Well, dear Xury, faid I, -we -will both go a/bore,
both kill wild mdns, and theyjhall eat neither of us. So
giving Xury a piece of rufk bread to eat, and a dram,
we waded afhore, sarrying nothing with us but our
arms, and two jars for water. I did not go out of
fight of the boat, as dreading the favages coming
down the river in their canoes; but the boy feeing a
* low defcent or vale about a mile in the country, he
•wandered to it; and then running back to me with
great precipitation, I thought he was purfued by
fome favage or wild beaft; upon which 1 approach-
ed, refolving to perifh or protect him from danger.
As he came nearer to me, I faw fomething hanging
over his moulders, which was a creature he had fhot
like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs;
however, we were glad of it, for it proved whole-
fome and nourifhing meat; but what added to our
joy was, my boy allured me there was plenty of wa-
ter, and that lie fee no -wild mans. And greater ilill
was our comfort, when we found frefh water in the
creek where we were when the tide was out, without
going fo far up into the country.
In this place I began to confider that the Canary
and
and Cape de Verde iflands lay not far off; but having
no inftrument, I knew not what latitude, or when to -
fland off to lea for them ; yet my hopes were, I mould
meet fome of the Englifh trading veflels, who would
relieve and take us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild coun-
try, inhabited only by a few, that lies between the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes.
It is filled with wild beafts, and the Moors ufe it for
hunting chiefly. From this place I thought I faw
the top of the mountain leneriffe in the Canaries;
which made me try twice to attain it; but as often
was I drove back, and fo forced to purfue my fortune
along fhore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a
little point of land, but pretty high; and the tide be-
ginning to flow, we lay ready to go further in. But
Xury, whofe youthful and penetrating eyes were
fharper than mine, in a loft tone, defired me to keep
far from land, left we fhould be devoured. For look
yonder, master, faid he, and fee de dreadful monfter faft
ajleep on de Jide of de hill. . Accordingly looking where
he pointed, I efpied a fearful monfter indeed. It was
a terrible great lion that lay on fhore, covered as it
were by a fh'ade of a piece of the hill. Xury, faid I,
youjballgo on fhore and kill him. But the boy looked
amazed: Me kill him, fays he, he eat me at one mouth;
meaning one mouthful. Upon which I bid him lie
ftill, anci charging my biggeft gun with two flugs,
and a good charge of powder, I took the beft aim I
cculd to ihoot him through the head; but his leg ly-
ing over his nofe, the flug broke his knee-bone.
The linn ;ovaking with the pain, got up, but focn fell
down, "iving the moft hideous groan I ever heard:
but taking my fecond piece, I fhot him through the
head, and then he lay ftruggling for life. Upon this
Xury took heart and defired my leave to go on fhore.
Go then, faid I. Upon which, taking a little gun in
one haud, he fwam to fhore with the other, .>nd co-
ming
Wring clofe to the'lion, put a period to his life, by
(hooting him again through the head.
But this was fpending our ammunition in vain, the
Bern not being good to ea't. Xury Was like a'-cham-
pion, arid comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off
the head of his enemy; but not having ftrength to
perform it, he cut Off and brought me a foot. I be-
thought me however that his ikin would be of ufe.
• This work coft Xury and me a whole-day; when
fpreading it on the top of our cabin, the hot beams of
the fun effectually- dried it in two days time, and it
afterwards ferved me for a bed to lie on.
And now we failed foutherly, living fpcTfingly oft
t>nr provifions, and went no oftener on more than we
were obliged for frefh water. My defign was to make
the river Gambra-or Senegal, or any where about the
'Cape de Verde, in hopes to meet forne European
fnip. If "Providence-did not fo favour me, my neit
courfe was to feek for the ifknds,-or lofe my life a-
mong the Negroes. And in a word, I put my whole
'ftrefs upon this, •" Either that I muft meet with fome
"fhrp, or certainly perifh."
'One day as we were failing along, we fawpeople ftand
on the fhore looking at us; we could alfo percerve
they were black and ftark naked. I "was inclined to
go on fhore, but Xury cried, No, no; however, I ap-
• preached nearer, and\I found they run along the fhore
.by me a good way. They had no weapons in their
•hands, except one, who held a long ftick, which Xu-
ry told me was a lance, with which they could kill at
'a great dirtance. I talked to diem by figns, and made
'them fcnfible I wanted forrrething to eat; they bec-
liorred to me to ftop my boat, while two of them ran
\ip-into-the country, and in lefs than half an hour
'came back, and brought with them two pieces 3f-dry
flefh, arid fome corn, which we kindly accepted: and
to prevent any fears on either fide, they brought the
.ibodtothe fhore, laid it down, then went and flood a
•B great
great way off till we fetched it on board, and then
came clofe to us again.
But wh'ilo we were returning thanks to them, be-
ing all we could afford, two mighty creatures came
from the mountains, one as it were purfuing the ei-
ther with great fury, which we were the rather in-
clined to believe, as they feldom appear but in the
night; and both thefe fwiftly paffing by the negroes,
jumped into the fea, wantonly fwimming about, as
though the diyerfion of the waters had put a ftop to
their fiercenefs. At laft one of them coming nearer
to my boat than I expe£ted or defired, I {hot him di-
re£tly through the head; upon which he funk imme-
diately, yet rifing again, would have willingly made
to the fiSore; but between the wound and theftrang-
ling of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It is impoffible to exprefs the confcernation the
poor negroes were in at the firing of my gun; much
lefs can I mention their furprife, when they perceived
the creature to be flain by it. I made figns to them
to draw near it with a rope, and then gave it to them,
to hale on fhore. It was a beautiful leopard, which
made me defire its fkin: and the negroes feeming to
covet the carcafe, I freely gave it to them. As for
the other Jeopard, it made to fhore, and ran with a
prodigious fwiftnefs out of fight. The negroes ha-
ving kindly furnifhed me with water, and with what -
roots and grains their country afforded, I took my
leave, and, after eleven days fail, came in fight of
the Cape de Verde, and thofe iflands called by its name.
But the great diftance I was from it, and fearing con-
trary winds would prevent my reaching them, I be-
gan to grow melancholy and dejected, when, upon a
fudden, Xury cried out, Mafter! mafter! a flip -with
a. fail! and looked as affrighted as if it was his mafter's
fhip fent in fearch of us. But I foon difcovered flie
was a Pomiguefc fhip, ns I thought, bound to the
coaft of Guinea for negroes. Upon which I ftrove
£of -life to come up to them. But vain had it been,
.
if through their perfpe£Hve glafles they had not per-
ceived me, and Shortened thiir fail to let me come
up. Encouraged at this, I fet up my patron's ancient,
and fired a glm, both as fignals of dtftrefs ; upon which
they very kindly lay to, fo that in three hours time J
came up with them. They fpoke to me in Portuguefe,
Spanifh, and French, but neither of thefe did I un-
derftand; till at length a Scots failor called, and then
I told him I was an Englifhman, who had efcaped
from the Moors at Sallee; upon which they took me
kindly on board, with all my effects.
Surely none can exprefs the inconceivable joy I felt
at this happy deliverance! who, from being a late mi-
ferable and forlorn creature, was not only relieved,
but in favour with the mafter of the fhip, to whom,
in return for my deliverance, I offered all I had. Gid
forbid, faid he, that IJbeuldtake any thing from you.
Every thing /ball be delivered to you -when you come to
Brazil. If 1 have faved your life, it is no more th.in I
JhculdcxpeB to receive myfelffrem any other, -when, in
the fame circumftances, IJbould happen to meet the like
deliverance. Andfcould 1 take from you what yen havet
and leave you at Brazil, -why, this weuld be only taking
auiay a life I have given. My charity teaches me bet-
ter. Tkcfe ejj"ecls you have -will fupport you there, and
provide you a paffage home again. And, indeed, he
acted with the ftricleft jufticii in what he did, taking
my things into his poffeffion, and giving me an exact
inventory, even to my earthen jars. He bought my
boat of me for the fhip's ufe, giving me a note of
, eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil; and if any-
body offered more, he would make it up. He alfo
gave me fixty pieces for my boy Xury. It was with
great reluctance I was prevailed upon to fell the child's
liberty, who had ferved me fo faithfully; but the boy-
was willing himfelf; and it was agreed, that after ten
years he fhould be made free, upon his renouncing
Mahometanifm, and embracing Chriftianity.
Having a pleafant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived
B 2 in
•
in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All-Saints
in twenty-two days, after. And here I cannot forget,
the generous treatment of the captain. lie would take.
nothing for my paflage, gave me twenty ducats for
the leopard's fkin, and thirty for the lion's. Every
thing he caused to be delivered, and what I would
fell-Re bought. In fhort, I made about,220 pieces of
my cargo; and with this ftock.I entered once more,
as I may fay, into the fcene of life.
Being recommended to, an honeft planter, I lived
with him till'fuch time as.I was informed of the man-,
ner of their planting and making fugar; and feeing
how well, they lived, and how, fuddenly they grew
rich, I was filled with.a defire to. fettle among them,.
and refolyed to get my:money, remitted tQ me, and, to.
purchafe a plantation.
To be brief, I bought a fejttlement next door to.,arv
honeft and kind neighbour, born at Lifbon, of Eng-
lifh parents, whofe plantation, joining to. mine, we,
improved it very amicably together. Both our flocks
were low, and for two years we planted only for food:
but the.thifd year we planted fome tobacco, and each,
of us dreffid a large, piece of .ground the eufuing year,
for planting canes. But now I found how much I,
'wanted a.ffiftajice,.and repented the lafs of my dear,
boy Xury,
Having none to aflift me, my father's words came,
into my mind; and I ufed to aflj myfclf, if what I.
fought was only a middle ftation of life, why could it
not as well be obtained in England as here? when I,
pondered on this with,regret, the thoughts of my late
deliverance forfook.me, I had none to converfe.wjth
but my neighbour; no work,tq be. done but by my
own hands; it often made me fay, my condition was
like to that of a man caft upon a defolate ifland. So
unhappy are we in our rene£Uons/fo forgetful of what
good things we receive ,ourfelves, and fo unthankful
for our.deliverance from thpfe calamities that others,
endure...
I .was
T was in fome meafure fettled, before the captain,
•who took me up, departed from the Brazils. One
day I went to him, and told him what ftock I had in
London, defiring his affiftance in getting it remitted;
to which the good gentleman readily confented, but
would only have me fend for half my money, left it
fhould mifcarry; which, if it did, I might flill have
the remainder to fupport me: and fo taking letters of
procuration from me, bid me trouble myfelf no far-
ther about it.
And, indeed, wonderful was his kindnefs towards
me; for he not only procured the money I had drawn
for upon my captain's widow, but fent me over a fer-
vant with a cargo, proportionable to my condition.
He a'.fo fent me over tools of all forts, iron work, and
utenfils neceflary for my plantation, and which pro-
ved of the greateft ufe to me in my bufinefs.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon
fuccefs crowning my profperous labours, I might
have refted happy in that middle flate of life my fa-
ther had fo often recommended; yet nothing would
content me, fuch was my evil genius, but I muft
leave this happy ftation, for a foolifh ambition in ri-
fing; and thus, once more, I caft myfelf into the
deepeft gulf of mifery that ever poor creature fell in-
to. Having lived four years in Brazil, 1 had not only
learned the language, but contracted acquaintance
with the moft eminent planters, and even the mer-
chants of St Salvadore; to whom, once, by way of
tlifcourfe, having given an account of my two voyages
to the coaft of Guinea, and the manner of trading
there for mere trifles, by which we furnifh our plan-
tations with negroes, they gave fuch attention to what
1 faid, that three of them came one morning to me,
and told me they had a fecret propofal to make. Af-
ter enjoining me to fecrecy, (it being an infringement
on the powers of the kings ©f Portugal and .Spain)
they told me they had a mind to fit out a fhip to go
to Guinea, in order to ftock the plantation with ne-
B 3 groes,
groes,,.which, as they could not be publicly fold, tlity -
would divide among them; and if I would go theifv
fupercargain the fhip* to manage the trading part, I.
fhould have an equal fhare of the negroes, without
providing any flock. The thing indeed was fair e-.
nough, had I; been in another condition. But I,..
born-to be my own deftroyer,,cou]d not refift the pro-,
pofal, but accepted the offer, upon condition of their,
looking after my plantation. So making a formal
will, I bequeathed my effects to my good friend the.
captain, as my univerfal hei,r; but obliged him to >
difpofe of my effects as directed, one half of the pro-,
duce to himi'elf, and the other to be fiiipped to Eng-, •
land..
The fhip. being fitted out, and all things ready, we -
fet fail, the firftof September 1659, being the fame day,
eight year I left my father and mother in Yorkfhire.,
We failed northward upon the coaft, in order to gain;
Africa, till we made Cape Auguftine; from whence^
going farther in. the ocean, out of fight of land, .we,
iteered as though we were bound for the ifle Fernand,
de Norenba, Jeaving the iflands-on the eafl; and then,
it was .we met with a terrible tempeft, which conti-
nued- for twelve days fucceffively, fo that the winds
carried us wherefoever they .pleafed. In.this perplex-,
ity. one of our men, died, and. one man and a boy.
were, wafhed. overboard., When the weather cleared
up a little, we found ourfelves eleven degrees north,
latitude, upon the coaft of Guiana. Upon this the,
captain gave reafons ior returning; which I oppofed>
ccunfelling him to Hand away for Barhadpes, which,
as I fuppofed, might be attained in fifteen days. So
altering our courfe, we failed north-weft, and by weft,
in order to reach the leewafd iflaods; but a fecond
ftorm fucceeding, drove us to the weftw-atd ;.fo that;
•we were juflly afraid of falling into the hands of cruel,
favnges, or the paws of devouring beafts of prey. .
In this great diftrefs, one of our men, early in th&
morning, cried out, L^nd^lan^! which he had noj
fpioner cried out, but our fhip ftruck upon a fand, and.;
In a moment the fea broke over her in fuch a man- -
Her, that we expected we fhould all have perifhed •
immediately. We knew nothing where we were, or,
upon what land w« were driven; whether an ifland 1
or the main, inhabited or not- inhabited; and we
could not fo much as. hope that the fhip would hold >
out many minutes, without breaking in pieces, ex*
cept the wind by a miracle fhbuld turn about imme-
diately. While we flood looking. at one another,
expecting death .every moment, the mate lays hold of •
the boat, and with the help of the reft got her flung
over the fliip's fide, and getting all into her, being
eleven of us, committed ourfelves to God's mercy,,,
and the wild fea. And now we faw that this lafl ef-
fort would not be a -fufficient protection -from death;
fb high did the fea,rife, that it was impoffible the boat -
fhould live.. ^s to making fail, we had none ; neither
if we had, cauld we make ufe of any.. So that wheiv
we had rowed, or rather were driven about a league,
and a.half, a raging wave, like a lofty mountain,.,
came rolling.aftern of us, and took us with fuch fu-
ry, that at once it overfet the boat. Thus being ftval-'
lowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to tall'
upon the tremendous ,iame of God : much lefs to im-
plore, in dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy to re-
ceive our departing.fouls..
Men. are generally counted infenfible, when ftrug-
gling in the pangs of death* j but while I was over-
whelmed with water, I had the Ynoft dreadful appre-
henfions imaginable. For the joys-of heaven and the.
torments of hell, feemed to preient themfelves before
me in thefe dying agonies, and even fmall fpace of
time, as it were, between life and death. I was go-
ing,.I .thought, I knew not.whither, in a difm'al gulf
unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more!
Gould I even have thought of annihilation, or a total
•tUflblution of foul a$ well as body, the glpomy thoughts
of
bf having no further being, no knowledge of what Vfg
hoped for, but an eternal quietus, without life ot
fenfe; even that, I fay^ would have been enough to
ftrike me with horror and confofion! 1 drove how*
ever to the laft extremity, while all my companions
were overpowered and intombed in the deep: and it
was with great difficulty I kept my breath till the;
wave fpent itfelf, and retiring back, left me on the
fhore half dead with the water I had taken in. As
foon as I got on my feet, I ran as faft as I could, left
another wave fliould purfue me, and carry me back a-
gain. But, for all the hafte I made, I could not avoid
it; for the fea came after me like a high mountain,
Or furious enemy; fo that my bufmefs was to hold my
breath, and by raifmg myfelf on the water, preferve
it by fwimming. The next dreadful wave buried me
at once twenty or thirty feet deep, but at the fame
time carried me with a mighty force and fwiftnefs to-
ward the- fbore; when raifing myfelf, I held out as
well as poflible, till at length the water having fpent
itfelf, began to return, at which I ftruck forward,
and feeling ground with my feet, I took to my heels
again. Thus being ferved twice more, I was at laft
darned againft a piece of a rock, in fuch a manner as
left me fenfelefs; but recovering a little before the
return of the wave, which, no doubt, would theq
have overwhelmed me, I held faft by the rock till
thofe fucceeding waves abated; and then fetching
another run, was overtaken by a fmall wave, which
was foon conquered. But before any more could o-
vertake me, I reached the main land, where clamber-
ing up the clifts of the fhote, tired and almoft fpent, I
fat down on the grafs, free from the dangers of the
foaming ocean.
No tongue can exprefs the ecftafies and tranfports
that my foul felt at this happy deliverance. It was
like a reprieve to a dying malefactor, with the halter
about his neck, and ready to be turned off. I was
wrapt up in contemplation, and often lifted up my
Tbands, with the profoundeft humility, to the divine,
powers, for faving my life, when the reft of my com-,
panions were all,drowned. And now I began to caft
my eyes around, to. behold what:place I was in, and
•what I had next to do. I could fee no houfe norpeo-
ple: I was wet, yet had no clothes to fhift me^ hun-
gry and thirfty, yethad nothing to eat or drink; no wea-
pon to deftroy any creature for my fuftenance, nor de-
fend myfelf againft devouring beafts; in fliort, I had
nothing but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and,a box half
filled with tobacco. The darkfome night coming up-
<an.me, increafed my fears of being devoured by wild-
creatures; my mind was plunged in defpa.ir,.and ha-
ving no profpecl:, as I thought, of life before me,, L
prepared for another kind of death than what I had.
lately efcaped. I. walked about a furlong to fee if, I.
could find any freffi water, which I did, to my great,
joy; and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger,
fgot up into a thick.bufhy tree, andfeatjng myfelf fo\
that I could not fall, a deep fleep overtook me, and for.
that night buried my forrows in a quiet repoie.
It was broad day the next morning before I awa-
ked; when I not only perceived, the tempef t was.
ceafed, but faw the flup driven almoft as far as the.
rock before mentioned, which the waves had dafhed.
me againft, and which was about a mile from the
place where I was. When I came down from my.
apartment in the tree, I perceived the fliip's boat two .
miles diftant. on my right han.d, lying on more, as
the waves had caft her. I thought to have got to .
her; but there being an inlet of water of about half
•a mile's breadth between it and me, I returned again.
towards the fhip, as hoping to find fomething for my.
rnore immediate fubfiften.ee. About noon, when the
fe'a was calm, that I could come within a quarter of
3 mile of her,''it was to my grief I perceived, that, if.
Vfje had kept on board, all our lives had been faved..
Ti*hefe thoughts, and my folitude, drew tears from.
my,
f
tny eyes, though all in vain. So refolving to get tc>
the fhip, I ftripped and leaped into the water; when
fwimming round her I was afraid I fhould not get
finy thing to lay hold of; but it was my good fortune
to efpy a fmail piece of rope hang down by the fore-
chains, fo low, that, by the help of it, though with
great difficulty, I got into the forecaflle of the fhip.
Here I found that the fhip was bulged, and had a great
deal of water in her hold; her ftern was lifted up a-
gainft a bank, and her head almoft to the water. £11
her quarter, and what was there, were free and dry.
The provifions I found in good order, with which I
crammed my pockets; and, lofing no time, ate while
I was doing other things; I alfo found fome rum, of
which I took a hearty dram ; and now I wanted for
nothing except a boat, which indeed was all, to carry
away what was needful for me.
Neceffity occafions quicknefsof thought. We ha<f
feveral fpare yards, a fpare topmafl or two, and two
or three large fpars of wood. With thefe I fell to
•work, and flung as many of them over board as I
could manage, tying every one of them with a rope
that they might not drive away. This done, I went
down the fhip's fide, and tied four of them fafl toge-
ther at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two
or three fhort pieces of plank upon them crofswife, I
found it would bear me, but not any confiderable
weight. Upon which I went to work again, cutting
a fpare topmaft into three lengths, adding them to
my raft with a great deal of labour and pains. I then
confidered what I fhould load it with, it being not
able to bear a ponderous burden. And this I foon
thought of, firft laying upon it all the planks and
boards I could get; next I lowered down three of the
feamen's chefts, after I had filled them, with bread,
rice, three Dutch cheefes, five pieces of dried goats
flefh, and fome European corn, what little the rats had
fpared; and for liquors, I found feveral cafes of bot-
tles belonging to our fkipper, in which were fome
cordial
£ordial wafers, and four or five gallons of rack, which
4 flowed by themfelves. By this time the tide begin-
ing to flow, I perceived my coat, waiftcoat, and
fhirt fwim away, which I had left on the fhore; as
for my linen breeches and (lockings, I fwam with
them on to the -fhip: but I foon found clothes enough,
though I took no more than I wanted for the prefent.
My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with; and,
after long fearch, I found out the carpenter's cheft,
which I got fafe down on my raft. I then looked for
arms and ammunition, and in the great .cabin found
two good fowling pieces, two piftols, feveral powder-
horns filled, a fmall bag of fhot, and two old rufty
fwords. I likewife found three barrels of powder,
two of which were good, but the third had taken wa-
ter, alfo two orthee broken oars, two faws, an axe,
and a hammer. I then p\it to fea, and in getting to
fhore had three encouragements, i. A fmooth calm
/ea. 2. The tide rifing and fetting in to the fhore.
3. The little wind there was blew towards land. Afr
ter I had failed about a mile, I found the raft to drive
a little diftance from the place where 1 firft landed;
and then I perceived a little opening of the land, with
a ftrong current of the tide running into it; upon
which 1 kept the middle of the ftream. But great
was my concern, when on a fudden the forepart of
my raft ran aground: fo that had I not, with great'
difficulty, for near half an hour, kept my back ftrain-
ing againft the chefts to keep my effects in their
places, all I had would have gone into the fea. But
after fome time, the rifing of the water caufed the
raft to float again, and coming up a little river with
land on both fides, I landed in a little cave, as near
the mouth as poffible, the better to difcover a fail, if
any fuch providentially pafled that way.
Not far off, I efpied a hill of 3 ftupendous height,
furrounded with.lefler hills about it, and thither I was
refolved to go and view the country, that I might fee
«rhat part was beft to fix my habitation in. Accord-
ingly*
"ingly, arming myfelf with a piftol, a fowling-piec^,"
.powder and ball, I afcended the mountain. There
I perceived I was in an ifland, encompafled by the
Tea; no diftant lands to be feen, but sbattering rocks
that ky to the weft: that it feemed to be a barren
•place, and, as I thought, inhabited only by wild
"beafts. I perceived abundance • of fowls, but igno-
rant of what kind, or whether good for nourifhment.
"I fhct one of them at my return, which occafioned a
>confufed Screaming among the other birds; and 'I
found ir, by its colours and beak, to be a kind of a
hawk, but its flefh was perfect carion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on
'shere, which work fpent that day entirely; and fear-
ing that fome cruel beafls might devour me in the
night time while I flept, I made a kind of hut or bar-
ricade with the chefls and boards 1 had brought on
ihorc. That night I flept very-comfortably; and the
next morning my thoughts were employed to make
a further atten-pt on the fhip, and bring away what
neceflaries I could find, "before another ftorm fhould,
'break her :o pieces. Accordingly, I got on board as
"before, and prepared a fecond raft, far more nice thaii
the firfl; upon which I brought away the carpenter's
•>ftores, two or three bags full of nails, a great jack-
fcrew, 3 dozen or two of hatchets, and a grindftone.
1 alto took, away feveral things that belonged to the
.gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, two
.Barrels of mufket bullets, another fowling-piece, a
fmall quantity of powder, -and a large bagful of
fmall fhot. Befides thefe, I took all the men's clothes
.1 could find, a fpare "foretcp tail, a hammock, and
-librae bedding; and thus completing my fecond car-
go, I made all the hafte to fhore I could, fearing fome
wild beaft might deftroy what I had there atready.
But I only found a little wild cat fitting on one of
the chefts, who not feeming to fear me, or the gun
that I prefented at.her, I threw her a piece of bifcuit,
which Q»e inllantly ate, and departed.
When
When I had gotten thefe effects on fhore, I went
to work, in order to make me a ,little tent with the
fail and fome poles which I had cut for that purpofe;
snd having finifhed it, what things might be dama-
ged by the weather I brought in, piling all the empty
thefts and cafks in a circle, the better to fortify
it againft any fudden attempt of man or Beaft. After
this, I blocked up the doors with fome boards, and an
empty cheft turned theJong way out. I then charged
my gun and piftol, and, laying my bed on the ground,
flept as comfortably, till next morning, as though I
had been in a Chriftian country.
Now, though I had enough to fubfift me a long
time, yet defpairing of a fudden deliverance, or that
both ammunition and provifion might be fpent before
fuch thing happened, I coveted as much as I could;
end fo long as the fhip remained in that condition, I
daily brought away one neceflary or other; particu-
larly the rigging, fails, and cordage, fome twine, a
barrel of wet powder, fome fugar, a barrel of meal,
three cafks of rum, and, what indeed was moft wel-
come to me, a whole hogfhead of bread.
The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces,
carried off a hawfer whole, with a great deal of iron
work, and made another raft with the mizen and
fprit-fail-yards; but this being fo unwieldy, by the
loo heavy burden I had upon it, and not being able
fo dexteroufly to guide it, as the former, both my
cargo and I were overturned. For my part, all the
damage I fuftained was a wet fkin; and at low water,
after much labour in diving, I got moft of the cables,
and fome pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had I now been in the ifland, and
eleven times on board, bringing away all that was
nffible; and, I believe, had the weather been calm,
hould have brought away the whole fhip, piece by
piece. As I was going the twelfth time, the wind
began to rife; however, I ventured at low water, and
rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found fevcral ra-
C zors,
zors, fciffars, and fome dozens of knives and forts;
and in another thirty fix pounds in pieces of eight,
filver and gold. An! fimple vanity', faid I, -whom this
•world fo~rmtch dotes on, where is KCIV thy virtue, thy
excellency to me? Yon cannot procure me one thing need-
ful, nor remove me from this defolate ijland to a place
(>f plenty. One of thefe knives; fo meanly ejleemed, is
to me more preferable than all this heap. E'en there-
.fore remain -where thouart, to Jink in the deep as un-
regarded, even as a creature -whofe life is not -worth
freferving. Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it
up in a piece of canvafs^ and began to think of ranking
another raft; but I foon perceived the wind begin to
arife, a frefh gale blowing from the fhore, and the fky
overcaft with clouds and darknefs; fo, thinking a raft
to be in vain, I let myfelf into the water with what
things I had about me, and it was with much difficulty
1 got afhore, when, foon after, it blew a fearful ftorm.
That night I flept very contentedly in my little
tent, furrounded with all my effects; but, when I
looked out in the morning, no mqre fhip was to be
feen. This much furprifed me for the prefent: yet,
•when I confidered I had loft no time, abated no pains,
and had got every thing ufeful out of her, 1 comforted
jnyfelf in the beft manner, and entirely fubmitted to
the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I fhould defend and
fecure myfelf from favages and wild beafts, if any
fuch were in the ifland. At one time, I thought of
.digging a cave, at another I was for erecting a tent;
and, at length, I refolved to do both: The manner
or form of which will not, I hope, be unpleafing to
jdefcribe.
When I confidered the ground where I was, that
it was moorifh, and had no frefh water near it, my
refolutions were to fearch for a foil henlthy and well
watered, where I might not only be fheltered from
the fun's fcorching heat, but be more conveniently
fituated, as well to be fecured from wild men, and
beafts
teads of prey, as more eafily to difcover any diftant
fail, fhould it ever fo happen.
And, indeed, it was not long before I had my defire.
I found a little plain near a riling hill, the front to-
wards which being as fteep as a houfe-fide, nothing
could defcend on me from the top. On the fide of
this rock was a little hollow place, refembling the en-
trance or door of a cave. Juft before this place, on
the circle of the green, I refolved my tent fhould
.ftand. This plain did not much exceed a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, like a delight-
ful green before my door, with a pkafing, though ir-
regular, defcent every way to the low grounds by the
fea-fide, lying on the N. N. W. fide of the hill, fo
that it was fheltered from the exccffive heat of the fun.
After this I drew a femkircle, containing ten yards in
.ks femidiameterr and twenty yards in the whole,
driving down two rows of ftrong ftakes not fix inches
from each other. Then with the pieces of cable
•which I had- cut on- board, I regularly laid them in the
circle between the piles up to their tops, which were
more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove
another row of piles looking within fide againft them,
between two or three feet high, which made me con-
clude it a little impregnable caftle for men and beafis.
And for my better fecurity I would have no door, but
entered in and came out by the help of a ladder,
which I alfo made.
Here was my fence and fortrefs, into which I car-
ried all my riches, ammunition, and ftores. After
which, working on the rock, what with the dirt and
ftones I dug out, I not only railed my ground two
feet, but made a little cellar to my manfion-houfe;
and this coft me many days labour and pains. One
day in particular a fhower of rain falling, thunder and
lightening enfued, which *put me in terror left my
powder mould take fire, and not only hinder my ne-
. ceflary fubfiftence, by killing me food, but even blow
up me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell
C-i- «>•
to making boxes and bags, in order to feparate ir, ha^
ving by me near 150 weight. And thus being efta-
blifhed as King of the ifland, every day I went out
with my gun to fee what I could kill that was fit to
eat. I foo,i perceived numbers of goats, but very fhy;
yet having watched them narrowly, and feeing I coukl
better fhoot off the rocks than when in the low
grounds, I happened to fhoot a fhe-goat fuckling a.
young kid; which not thinking its dam flain, flood
by her unconcerned; and when 1 took, the dead crea-
ture up, the young one followed me even to the in-
clofure. I lifted the kid over the pales, and would
•willingly have kept it alive; but finding it could not
be brought to eat,. I was forced to flay it alfo for myy
own fubfiftenqe.
Thus entered into as ftrange a fcene of life as ever-
any man was in, I had moft melancholy apprehen-<
fions concerning my deplorable condition; and ma-
ny times the tears would plentifully run down my
fats, when lccnfider.ed how I was debarred-from all
communication with humankind. Yet while thefe
defponding cogitations would feem to make me ac-
cufe Providence, other good thoughts would interpofe-
and reprove me after this manner: Well, fuppofing
you. are defolate, is it not better to be fo than totally
perifh? Why were you Cngkd out to be faved, and
the reil dcftroyed? Why fhould you complain, when
not only your life is preferved, but the fhip driven,
even-into your reach, in order to take what was ne-
cfflary out of her tor your fubfiftence? But to pro-
ceed. - It was, by the account I kept, the 301(1 of
September when I firft landed on this ifland. About
twelve days after, fearing left I fhoald lofe my, rec-
koning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath-days,
for want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife
upon a large poll, in great letters, and fet it up, in,
the fimilitude of a crofs, on the fea-fhore where I
Janded, I came on Jbore Sept. 30. 1659. .Every day I
cut a notch with my knife-on. the fides of this fqua,-*-
j and that on Sabbath :was as long again as the
reft; and every firft day of the month as long again
as that long one. In this manner I-kept my callen-.
dar, weekly, monthly, for yearly reckoning of time.
But had I made a more ftrict fearch, (as I did after-
wards), I need not have fet up this mark. For among
the parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and
Captain's mate, I found thofe very things 1 wanted ;.
particularly pens, ink, and paper; alibi-found two
or three compafles, fome mathematical inftruments,-
dials, perfpeclive glaffes, books of navigation, three
Englifh Bibles, and feveral other good books, which
I'.carefuIIy put up. , Here I cannot but call to mind
.oar having a dog and two cats• on board, whom I'.'
made inhabitants with me in my caftle. Though
one might think I had all the neceflaries that were de-
firable, yet flill I found feveral things wanting. Myv
ink was daily wafting: I wanted'needles,-pins, and •
thread to mend or keep;-my clothes together; and
particularly a fpade, pick-axe,.or fhovel,,to.remove
the earth. It was a year before I finifhed my little
bulwark; and having fome intervals of relaxation,
after my daily/wandering abroad for provifion, I drew
up this plan, i alternately, as creditor and debtor, to
.remind me of the miferies and bleffinga of my life,
amdcr fo many various circuraflances.

| O U R N. A L,
SEptember 3oth, 1659,1 unhappy Robinfon-Crufoe,,
having fuflered fhipwreck, was driven on this
defolate Ifland, which I named the Defolate Ifland of
Defpair, the reft being fwallowed up in the tempe-
fluous oceans The next day I fpent in confwieraticn
of my unhappy circumftances, having no profpe£b
> tut of death-, either to be ftarved with hunger, or de-
voured by beafts or mercilefa favages.
Oclob. i. That morning, with great comfort, I be-
held the fhip drove amore. Some hopes I had, that
•when the ftorm was abated, I might be able to get
fome food and neeeflaries out of her; which I coa-
ceived were not damaged, becaufe the fhip did Hand
upright. At this time I lamented the lefs of my com-
panions, and our misfortune in leaving the veflei.
When I perceived the fhip as it were lie dry, I wa-
ded through the fands, th-en fwam aboard), the wea-
ther being very rainy, and with fcarcely any wind.
To the i4th of this month, my time was employ-
ed in making voyages, every tide getting what I
could out of the (hip. The weather very wet and
uncertain.
Odob. 20. My raft and all the goods- thereon were
cverfet; yet I recovered moft again at low water.
Oflob. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day,
when the fhip went in pieces, fo that nothing was
feeu
ften of her but the wreck at low- water. This
1 fecured my goods from the inclemency of the wea--
ther.
Octob. 26. I wandered to fee where I could.find-
a place convenient for my abode. Ifixednpon a rock -
in the evening, marked out a half-moon, intending;
to erect a wall, fortified with piles, lined within with •
pieces of cables, and covered with turf.
Nov. i. I creeled my tent under a rock, and took:
up my lodgings very contendedly in a hammock that•:
•night.
Nov> 2. This day.I fenced myfelf in-with timber,,
chefts, and boards.
Nov. 3. I fhot two wild fowl, refembling ducks,,
•which were good to eat, and in the afternoon made-'
me a table. f
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. Ira the morn-
ing. I allowed my.felf two or three hours to-walk outt
•with my gun; I then worked till near eleven o'clock,,
and afterwards refrefhed myfelf with what I had to >
•at. From twelve to two I would lie down to flcep. -
Extreme fukry weather.. In-the evening go to work--
again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gnu and dog, flVotai
•wild cat with a foft fkin, but her flefh was good for>-
nothing. The fldns-of thofe I killed, I preferved. In
my return, I perceived many wild birds, and was ter--
irified by fome feals which made off-to fea-
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. .7,. Fair weather. I worked till-the izth,',
but omitted the nth, which, according to my calxm»
Jation, I fuppofed to be Sunday.
Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, whkhy h'owevers r
anach cooled the earth; with thunder and lightening,;
rcaufed in me a terrible furprife. The weather clear--
ling, Ifecured my powder in feparate parcels.
Nov. 14.—16. I made little boxes for my powder,,
lodging them in feveral places. I alfo fliot a large
.fowl, which proved excellent.meat.-
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obli-
ged to defift for want of a pick-axe, fhovel, and
wheel-barrow. Iron crows I caufed to fupply the
place of the firft; but with all my art I could not
make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 15: x It was my fortune to find a tree, refem-
bling what life Brazilians call an iron tree. I had like
to have fpoiled my axe with cutting it, being very
Jiard and exceeding heavy, yet, with much labour and
induftry, I made a fort of a fpade out of it.
Nov. 23- Thefe tools being made, I daily carried"
on my bufinefs; eighteen days I allowed for enlarging
my cave, that it might ferve me, not only for a ware-
houfe, but kitchen, parlour, and cellar;. 1 commonly
lay in the tent, unlefs the weather was rainy that I
could not lie dry. So wet would it be at certain iea-
fons, that I was obliged to cover all within the pale
with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning a*
gainft the rock, and load them with, flags and large
leaves of trees, refembling a thatch-.
Dec. 10. No fooner did I think my habitation fi>
nifhed, but fuddenly a g/eat deal of the top broke in,
fo that it was a mercy, I was not buried in-the ruins.
This occafioned a- great deal of pains and trouble to
me, before I could make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. 1 nailed up fome fhelves and drove nails
and Itaples in die wall, and pofts to hang things out
of the way-
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then-
made a fort of a drefler, and another table.
Dec. 24, 2<;.. Rain in abundance.
Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to-light on fome goats, fhot one,
wounded another. I led it home in a ftring, bound
up his leg, and cured it in a little time; at length, it
became fo tame and familiar as to feed before the
door, and follow me where I pleafed. This put me
in mind to bring up tame creatures, in order to fup-
ply me with foad after iny ammunition was fpent.
Dec.
Dec. 28,29, 30. The weather being exceffive Tiot,
Vith, little air, obliged me, for the moft part, to keej?>
vrithin doors.
Jan. i. Still fnltry. However, obliged by necef-
fity, I. went out with my gun, and found a great flore
Of goats in the valleys; they were exceedingly fhy,.
nor could my dog hunt them down.
Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time was to
finifh the wall before defcribed, and fearch the ifland,
I difcovered a kind of pigeons like our houfe-pigeons
in a neft among the rocks. I brought them home*
Hurfed them till they could fly, and then.they left me.
After this, I fhot foine, which proved excellent food;
Some time I fpent vainly in contriving to make a
caftc; I may well fay it was vain, becaufe I could
neither join the ftaves, or fix the heads, {<\as to make
it tight: So, leaving that, I took fome goats tallow
I had by me, and a little okum for the wick, and-
provided myfelf with a lamp, which ferved me in<-
ftead of candles.
But now a very ftrange event happened. For be-
ing in the height of my fearch, what fhould come in*
to my hand, but a bag, which wa& ufed to hold corn
(as I fuppofed) for the fowls: fo immediately refol-
ving to put gunpowder in it,, I fhook all the. hufks
and dirt upon one fide of the rock, little expecting
what the confequenee would be. The rain had fal-
len plentifully a few days before ;and, about a month
after, to my great amazement, fomething began to
look out very green and fiourifhing: and when I
came to view it more nicely, every day as it grew,
I found about ten,or twelve ears of green barley ap-
peared in the very fame fhape and make as that in
•England. \
I can fcarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at
this fight> Hitherto I had looked upon the actions
of this life no otherwife than only as th$ events of
blind chance and fortune. But now, the appear-
ance of this barley, ftourifiiing in a barren foil, and
my.
tny ignorance in not conceiving how it fhould come
there, made me conclude, that miracles -wcre net yd
ceafed: nay, I even thought that God had appointed
-it to grow there without any feed, purely for my
fuftenance in this miferable and defolate ifland. , And
indeed fuch great effect this had upon me, that it of-
•ten made me melt into tears, through a grateful
fcnfe of God's mercies; and the greater flill was my
thankfulnefs, when I perceived about this little field
of barley, fome rice ftalks, alfo wonderfully flourifh-»
ing.
While thus pleafed in mind, I concluded there
muft be more corn in the ifland; and therefore made
a diligent fearoh narrowly among the rocks: but not
being able to find any, on a fudden it came into my
jnind, how I had fhaken the hufks of corn out of the;
bag, and then, my admiration ceafed, with my grati-
tude to the divine Being, as thinking it was but natu-
ral, and not to be conceived a miracle; tho' even the
manner of its prefervation mig^ have made me own
it as a wonderful event of Goiijf kind providence.
It was about the latter endof June when the ears
:of this corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully,
together with zo or 30 ftalks of rice, expelling one
Jay 1 fhould reap the fruit .of my labour; yet four
•years were expired before*! could allow myfelf to eat
any barley bread, and much longer time before! ha«J
iuiy rice. After this, with indefatigable pains and
induftry for three or four months, at laft I finifhed
•my wall on the I4th of April, having no way to go
into it, but by a ladder againft the wall.
April 16. I finifhed my ladder, and.afcended it;
afterwards pulled it up, then let it down on the other
fide, and defcended into my new habitation, where I
.had fpace enough, and ib fortified, that .nothing could
attack me, without fcaling the wails, v • „
But what does all human pains and iaduftry avail,
if thj£ beffing of God do .not crown our iabours? Or,
who can ftand before the Almighty, when he ftreteh-
eth forth his arm? For erne time, as I was at the en-
trance of my cave, there happened fuch a dreadful
earthquake, that not only the roof of the cave came
tumbling about my ears, but the pofts feemed to crack
terribly at the fame time. This put me in great a-
mazement; and running to the ladder, and .getting
over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an earth-
quake, the place I ftood on fuftaining three terrible
(hocks in lefs than three minutes. But judge of my
terror when I faw the top of a great rock roll into the
fea ; I then expe£ted the ifland would be fwallowed
up every moment: And what made the fcene flill
more dreadful, was to fee the fea thrown into the moft
violent agitations and diforders by this tremendous ac-
cident.
For my part, I ftood like a criminal at the place of
execution, ready to expire. At the moving of the
earth, I was, as it were, fea-fick; and very much a-
fraid left the rock, under which was my fence and
habitation, fhould overwhelm me and it in a lafling
tomb.
When the third dreadful fhock had fpent itfelf, my
fpirits began to revive; yet flill I would not venture
to afcend the ladder, but continued fitting, not know-
ing what I fnould do. So little grace had I then, as
only to fay, Lord have mercy upon me! and no fooner
•was the earthquake over, but that pathetic prayer left
me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tempeft a-
rofe, at the fame time attended with a hurricane of
wind. The fea feemed mountains high, and the
waves rolled fo impetuoufiy, that nothing could be
perceived but froth and foam. Three hours did this
ftorm continue, and in fo violent a manner, as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was fucceeded
by abundance of rain. "When the tempeft was over,
I went to my tent; but the rain coming on in a fu-
jtlous manner, I was obliged to take fhelter in the
cave,
cave, where I was forced to cut a channel through
my fortification to let the water out. It continued
raining all that night, and fometime the next day.
Thefe accidents made me refolve, as foon as the wea-
ther cleared up, to build me a little hnt in fome open
place, walled round to defend me from wild crea-
tures and favages; not doubting but, at the next
earthquake, the mountain would fall upon my habita-
tion and me, and fwallow up all in its bowels.
April 16,—20. Thefe days I fpent in contriving
how and in what manner I mould fix my place of a-
bode. All this while I was under the moft dreadful
apprehenfions. When I looked round my habitation,
every thing I found in its proper place. I had feveral
refolutions whether I fhould move or not: but- at
length I refolved to ftay where I was, till I found out
a convenient place where I might pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my refolutions in
practice, I was ftopt for want of tools and inftru-
ments to work with. Moft of my axes and hatchets
were ufelefs, occafioned by cutting the hard timber
that grew on the ifland. It took me up a full week
to make my grindftone of ufe to me; and at laft I
found out a way to turn it about with my foot, by
help of a wheel and a firing.
April 28, 29. Thefe days were fpent in grinding
my tools.
April 30. My bread falling fhort, I allowed myfelf
but one bifcuit a day.
May i. As I walked along the fea-fhore, I found
a barrel of gunpowder, and feveral pieces of the
wreck, which the fea had flung up. Having fecured'
thofe^ I made to the fhip, \vhofe ftern was torn off,
and wamed a great diftance afhore 5 but the reft lay
in the fands. This I fuppofe was occafioned by the
earthquake. I now refolved to keep my old place of
abode: and alfo to go to the fhip that day, but then
found it jmpoffible.
D . Ma
May 3. This day I went on board, and with my
f;iw fnwed off one of the beams, wKlch kept her quar-
ter deck. I then cleared the fand till flood.
May 4. I caught fome fifh, but they were not
•wholefome. The fame day I alfo catched a young
dolphin.
May y. This day I alfo repaired to the wreck, and
tuved another piece of timber; and when the flood
came, I made a float of three great planks, which
were driven afhore by the tide.
May 6, 7, 8, 9. Thefe days I brought off the iron
bolts, opened the deck" with the iron crow, and car-
ried two planks to land, having made a way into the
very middle of the wreck.
May 10, IT, 12, 13, 14. All this time I fpent in
. bringing off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpofe to
cut off fome lead of the roll, but all in vain, for it lay
too low under water. *
• May 16. I omitted going to the wreck this day;
for employing myfelf in looking for pigeons, I out-
ftaid my time. > •„"
'May 17. I perceived feveral pieces of the wreck
blown afliore, which I found belonged to the head of
the fliip.
- May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and
with great difficulty loofened fome things fo much
with the crow, that at the firft blowing tide feveral
cafks floated out, and many of the feamens chefts;
yet that day nothing came to land but pieces of tim-
ber, and a hogfhead which had fome Brazil pork in
it. I continued working to the 15th of June; (ex-
cept neceflary times for food and reft) and had I
known how to have built a boat, I had timber and
planks enough: I had alib near 100 weight of fheet-
lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the fea fide,
I found a large tortoife or turtle, being the firft I had
feen
feen on the ifland, though, as I afterwards found,.
there were many on the other fide of it.
June 17. This day I fpent in cooking it, found in
her threefcore eggs, and her flefh the moft favory
and pleafant I ever fafted in my life.
June 18. I flaid, within this day, there being a con-
tinual rain; and it was fotnething more cliiMy and
cold than ufual.
June 19. Exceeding bad, taken with a trembling
and fhivering,
June 20. Awake all night, my head raeked with
pain, and feverifh.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the
difmal apprehenfions of my condition. Prayed to
God more frequently, but very confufedly.
June 22. Something better, but Hill uneafy in my
mind.
June 23. Again relapfed much as before. ,
June 24. Mended a iecond time.
June 25. A violent ague for feven hours, cold and
hot fits, fucceeded with faint fwer.ts.
June 26. Better, but very weak; yet I fcramblecl
out, fhot a fhe goat, brought it home, and broiled
fome of it: I would willingly have ftevve'd it, and
made foine broth, but had no pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflictei with an ague ^
thirfty, yet could not help myfelf to water : 'Prayed
fb God in thefe words; Lord, in pity, lo-jk upon me:
Lord have mercy upon me; have mercy upon me! Af-
ter this I fell afleep, which I found had much refrefh-
ed me when I awaked. I fell afleep a fecond time, and
fell into this ftrange and terrible fort of dream.
Methought I was fitting on the fame fpot of ground
at the outfide of the wall where I fat when the flomi
blew after the earthquake; and that I faw a man de-
fcending from a great black cloud, and light upon the
ground. He was all over as bright as a flafh of fire
that a little before furrounded him; his countenance
D 2 inconceivably
inconceivably terrible; the earth as it were trembled
•when he ftept upon the ground, and flames of fire
feemed to fill all the air. No fooner I thought him
landed upon the earth, but with a long fpear, or other
weapon, he made towards me; but firft afcending a
riGng ground, his voice added to my amazement, when
I thought 1 heard him pronounce thefe dreadful words,
Unhappy -wretch! feeing all thffe things have not
brought thee to repentance, thonjha/t immediately die,
In pronouncing this dreadful fentence, I thought he
went to kill me with the fpear that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impoffible for me to exprefs
the horrors of my mind at this vifion ; and even when
I awaked, this very dream made a deep impreffion up-
on my mind. The little divine knowledge I had, I
received from my father's imh'uclions, and that was
worn out by an uninterrupted feries of feafaring im-
piety for eight years fpace. Except what ficknefs
forced from me, I do not remember I had one thought
of lifting up my heart towards God; but rather had
a certain ftupidity of foul, not having the leaft fenfe
of fear of the omnipotent Being when in diftreis, nor
of gratitude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when
I was on the defperate expedition on the defert Afri-
can fliore, I cannot remember I had one thought of
what would become of me, or to beg his confolation
and affiftance in my fuflerings and diftreis. When
the Portugal captain took me up, and honourably ufed
me: nay, farther, when I was even delivered from
drowning by efcaping to this ifland, I never looked
upon it as a judgment, but only faid I was an unfor-
tunate dog, and that's all. Indeed, fome fecret tranf-
ports of foul 1 had, which was not through grace, but
only a common ffight of joy, that I was yet alive, when
my companions were all drowned, and no other joy
could I conceive but what is common with the failors
over a bowl of punch, after they have efcaped the
greateft dangers.
The
• The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor
conveniences, might have called upon me for a
thankful acknowledgment to Providence. Indeed,
the growth of my corn touched me with fome fenfe;
but that foon wore off again. The terrible earth-
quake pointed to me, as it were, the finger of God,
but my dreadful amazement continued no longer
than its. duration. But now, when my fpirits began
to fink under the burden of a ftrong .diftemper,
and I could leiforely view the miferk-s of death pre-
fent themfelves before my eyes, then my awakened
confcience began to reproach me with my p;;ft life, in
which I had fo wickedly provoked the juftice of God
to pour down his vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as thefe opprefTed me even in the
violence of my diftemper. Some prayers I uttered,
which only proceeded from my fear of death. But
when I confidered my father's advice and prophecy,
I could not forbear weeping; for, he told me, Tbnft
if I did perfijl in my folly, IJbould not only be deprived
of Cod's blejjing, but'have time enough to rcfitt upon
my defpifing his inftruElions, and this in a •wretched
time, -when none could help me. And now, concluding-
it to be fulfilled, having no foul in the ifland to aJ-
minifter any comfort to me, I prayed earneftly to the .
Lord, that he would help -me in this my great calami-
ty. And this, I think, w.as the firft time I prayed
in fincerity for many years. But now I muft-refura
to my journal.
June 28. Something reft'.(lied with fleep, amllTfe"
fit quite off, I got up. My dream frill occasioned in •
me a great confternaticn; and, fearing that tKe'agu«
might return the fuccceding day, I concluded it
~ time to get fomething to comfort me. I filled a cafe
bottle with wver, and fet it within the reach of rrfy
bed; a.nd, to make it more nourifhing and lefs chilly,
I put fome rum in it. The next thing I did was to
boil me a piece of goat fiefh, of which I ate but-lit-
. tie. I was very weak, however, walked about, dread-
D ~;j ing
ing the return of my diftemper; and at night I Tup-
ped on three of the turtle's eggs, which I roafted and
ate, begging God's bleffing therewith.
After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out
of doors with my gun; but was fo weak, that I fat
down, and looked at the fea, which was fmooth and
calm. While I continued here, thefe thoughts came
into my-mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth and
fea, of which I have feen fo much? From whence
came myfelf, and all other creatures living, and of
what are we made?
Our brings were afluredly created by fome almigh-
ty invifible power, who framed the earth, the fea, and
air, and all therein. But what is that power?
Certainly it muft follow, that God has created it
all. Yet, laid I, if God has made all this, he muft
be the ruler of them all, and what is relating there-
to; for certainly the power that makes, muft indif-
putably have a power to guide and direct them. And
if this be fo (as certainly it muft) nothing can hap-
pen without his knowledge or appointment. Then,
£urely, if nothing happens without God's appointment,
certainly God has appointed thefe my fufferings to
befal me. And here I fixed my firm belief, that it
was his will that it fhould be fo; and then proceeded
to inquire, why fhould God deal with me in this
manner? Or what I had done thus to deferve his in-
dignation,?
Here confcience flew in my face, reprehending me
as a blafphemer; crying, with a loud and piercing
voice, Unworthy -wretch! dare you aft -what you have
done? Loak upon your pajl life, and fee what you have
left undone? Afk thyfelf, why thou wert not long
ago in the mercilefs hands of de.*h? Why not
drowned in Yarmouth roads, or killed in the fight*
when the fhip was taken by the Sallee man of war?
"W by not entombed in the bowels of wild beafts on
the
the African Coaft, or drowned here when all thy com-
panions fuffered fhipwreck in the ocean?
Struck dumb with thefe reflections, I rofe up in a
penfive manner, being fo thoughtful that I could not
gotofleep; and fearing the dreadful return of my
diftemper, it caufed me to remember, that the Brazi-
lians ufe tobacco for almoft all difeafes. I then went
to' my cheft, in order to find fome, where heaven, no-
doubt, directed me to find a cure for both foul and
body; for there I found one of the bibles, which, till
this time/I had neither leifure nor inclination to look
into; I took both the tobacco and that out of the
cbeft, and laid them on the table. Several experi-
ments did I try with the tobacco: Firft, I took a
piece of leaf, and chewed it; but it being very green
and ftrong, almoft ftupified me. Next I fteeped it
in fome rum an hour or two, refolving when I went
to bed to take a dofe of it; and, in the third place, i
burnt fome over a pan of fire, holding my nofe over
it fo long as I could endure it without fuffbcation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head
was giddy and difturbed at the tobacco, I took up
the bible to read. No fooner did I open it, but there-
appeared to me thefe words. Call on me in the day of
trouble, and 1111 ill deliver thee, and thou Jbalt glorify
me.
At firft this fentenee made a very deep impreffion
on my heart; but it foon wore off again, when I
eonfidered the word deliver was foreign to me. And
as the children of .Ifrael faid, when they were pro-
mifed flefh to eat, Can Cod fpread a table in the -wil-
dernefs? in like manner I began to fay, Can God
himfelf deliver me from this defolate iflaud? Howe-
ver, the words would ftiU return to my mind, and
afterwards made a greater impreffion upon me. As
it now was very late, and the tobacco had dozed my
head, I was inclined to fleep; but before I would lie
down, I fell on my knees, and implored the promife
that God had made to me in the holy fcriptures,,
that
that, if I called upon him in. the day of trouble, be
•woulddeliver me. With much difficulty I after drank
the rum, wherein I had fteeped the tobacco 5 which
flying into my head, threw me into fuch a profound
fleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before
I awaked; or rather, 1 btlieve, 1 flept two days, ha-
ving certainly loll a day in my account, and 1 could,
never tell any other way. "When I got up, my fpi-
rits were lively and cheerful; my ftomach much bet-
ter, being very-hungry; and, in short, no fit returned
the next day, which was the 2yth, but 1 found my-
felf much altered for the better.
The 3cth, I went abroad with my gun, but not
far, and killed a fea-fow] or two, refembling a brand-
goofe, which, however, I cared not to eat when I
brought them home, but dined on two more of the
turtle's eggs. In the evening I renewed my medicine»
excepting that I did not take fo large a quantity,?
neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my head over the
fmoke: but next day, which was the ift of July, ha-
ving a little fpice of the cold fit, I again took my me-
. dicine as 1 did the firft time.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In,
this condition, I often .thought of thefe words, 1-wiH
deliver thee; and while ajfome times I would think
of the impoffibility of .it, other thoughts would re-
prehend me, for difregardmg die detiverances I had
received, even from the moft forlorn and diftreffed
condition. I afked myfelf, what regard have I had to
God for his abundant mercies? Have I done my part?
He has delivered me, but 1 have not glorified him; — as
if I had faid, 1 had not owried and been thankful for
thefe as deliverances, and how could I expect greater?
So much did this fenfibly touch my heart, that I gave
God thanks for my recovery from ficknefs in the moll
humble proftration.
July 4. This morning I began ferioufly to ponder
on what is written in the New Teftament, refolving
to read a chapter every morning and night as long
"• as
I
as my thoughts would engage me. As foon as I fet
about this work ferioufly, I found my heart deeply af-.
fccted with the impiety of my paft life j thefe words
that I thought were fpoken to me in my dream revi-
ved, All thefe things have not brought tbee to repen-
tance. After thist I begged of God to affift me with
his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day,
in periiling the fcriptures, 1 came to thefe words, He
it exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance,
and to give remiflidn; Immediately I laid down the
book, and, with uplifted hands to heaven, -loudly
cried, 0 bleJJed'Jefus, tbou fan of David, Jefus, than ex-
alted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance! And
now indeed I prayed with a true fenfe of my conditi-
on, and a more certain hope, founded on the word
of God. Now I had a different fenfe of thefe words,
Call on me, and I will deliver tbee, that is, from the
dreadful load of guilt, which oppreffed my finful
foul, and not from a folitary life, which might rather
be called a ble.Tmg, (feeing I wanted neither food
nor raiment), when compared with living among the
human race, furrounded with fo much oppreffion,
mifery, and affliction: In a word, I came to this con-
clufion, that a deliverance from fin was a much greater
bleffing than a deliverance from affliction. But again
I proceed to my journal.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun,
little and little at a time, having been reduced to the
greateft extremity of vveaknefs. The applications
and experiments 1 ufed were perfectly new; neither
could 1 recommend them to any one's practice. For
though it carried off the fit, it very much weakened
me; and I had frequently convulfions in my nerves
and limbs for fome time. From hence I learned,
that going abroad in rainy weather, efpecially when
it was. attended with ftorms and hurricanes of wind,
was rnofl pernicious to health. I had now been a-
bove ten months in the ifland; and as 1 never had
feen any of ths human kind, 1 therefore accounted •
myfelf
myfelf as fole monarch; and as I grew better, having
fecured my habitation to my mind, I refolved to make
a tour round my kingdom, in order to make new dif-
coveries.
The I5th of July I began my journey. I firft went
to the creek, where I had brought my rafts on fhore;
and travelling farther, found the tide>went no higher
than two miles up, where there was a little brook of
running .water, on the bank of which were many plea-
fant favannas or meadows, plain, fmooth, and cover-
ed with grafs. On the rifing parts, where Iluppofcd -
the water did not reach, I perceived a great deal of
tobacco growing to a very ftrong ftalk. Several other
plants I likewife found, the virtues of which I did not
underftand. I fearched a long time for the Cafiava
root, which I knew the Indians in that climate made
their bread of; but all in vain. There were feveral
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what
they were; likewife I faw feveral fugar-canes, but
imperfect for want of cultivation. With thefe few
difcoveries I came back that night, and ifept content-
edly in my little caflle.
The next.day, being the i6th, going the fame way,
but farther than the day before, I found the country
more adorned with woods and trees. Here I percei-
ved different fruits in great abundance. Melons in
plentjr lay on the ground, and clufters of grapes, ripe
and very rich, fpread over the trees. You may ima-
gine I was glad of this difcovery, yet ate very fpa-
ringly, left I mould throw myfelf into a flux or fever.
The grapes I found of excellent ufe; for when I had
dried them in the fun, which prefefved them as dried
raifins are kept, they proved very wholefome and nou-
rifhing, and ferved me in thofe feafons when no grapes
•were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I afcended up a tree,
and flept very comfortably, though it was the firft
time I had lain out of my habitation. And when the
morning came, I proceeded with great pleafure on
my
my way, travelling about four miles, as I imagined,
by the length of the valley, directing my courfe north
ward, there being a ridge of hills on the fouth and
north fide of me. At the end of this valley I came
to an opening, where the country feemed to defcend
to the weft; there I found a little fpring of frefh wa-
ter, proceeding out of the fide of a hill, with its cryftal
ftreams running directly eaft. And indeed here my
fttnfes were charmed with the moft beautiful landfcape
nature could afford: for the country appeared fo flou-
fifhing, greert, and delightful, that to me it feemed
like a planted garden. I then defcended on the fide
of that delicious vale, when I found abundance of co-
coa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but very wild
and barren at that time. As for the limes, they were
delightful and wholefome, the juice of which I after
ufed to mix in water, which made it very cool and re-
frefhing. And now I was refolved to carry home and
lay up a ftore of grapes, limes, and lemons, againft the
approaching wet feafon. So laying them up in fepa-
rated parcels, and then taking a few of each with me,
I returned to my little caftle, after having fpent three
days in this journey. Beforelgot home,the grapeswere
fo bruifed that they were utterly fpoiled; the limes in-
deed were good, but of thefe I could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags,.I returned
thither again; but, to my great furprife, found all the
grapes fpread about, trod to pieces, and abundance
eaten, which made me conclude there were wild
beafts thereabouts. To prevent this happening again,
I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out branches of the trees, both to.
keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry
in the fun: and having well loaded myfelf with limes
and lemons, I returned once more to my old place of
refidence.
And now contemplating on the fruitfulnefs of this
«alley, the pleafar.tnefs of its fituatjon, its fecurity
from
from florins, rind the delightfulnefs. of the adjacent
woods, I concluded I was fettled in the woift part of
the country, and therefore Was thinking to remove
my habitation. But when I confidered again, that
though it was pleafant, it was off from the fea-fide,
where there was a poffibility, fome time or other, a
fliip might either be driven or fail by"; and that to
inclofe myfelf among hills and woods muf t certainly
put an end to my hopes of deliverance; I refolved to
let my caftle remain where Providence had firft af-
figned it. Yet fo ravifhed was I with this place, that
I made me a little kind of bower, furrounding it with
a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well ftaked,
and filled with butrufhes; and having fpent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was the firft of
Auguft before I began to enjoy my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took
them from the trees, and they proved excellent good
raifins of the fun: the moft of which I carried to my
cave'; and happy for me I did fo, by which I faved
the beft part of my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and though I
had made me a tent like the other, yet having no fhel-
ter of a hill to keep me from ftorms, nor a cave behind
me to,retreat to, I was obliged to return to my old ca-
ftle. The rain continued more or lefs every day, till
the middle of October; and fometimes fo violently,
that I could not ftir out of my cave for feveral days.
This feafon I found.my family to increafe; for one
of my cats that ran away from me, and who I thought
had been dead, returned about Auguft, with three
kittens at her heels, like herfeif; which I thought
firange, becaufe both my cats were females, and the
wild cats of the ifland feemed to be of a different kind
from our European cats; but from thefe cats proceed-
ed fuch numbers, that I was forced to kill and deftroy
them as I would do wild beafts or vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not ftir out,-it
raining
raining incefiantly; when beginning to want food,
I was compelled to venture twice, the firft of which I
fhot a goat, and afterwards found a very large tor-
toife. The manner of my regulating my food was
thus: A bunch of raifins ferved me for breakfaft; a
piece of goat's flefh or turtle broiled for my dinner,
and two or three turtle eggs for my fupper. While
the rain lafted, I daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on to-
wards one fide, till 1 came to the outfide of the hill,
and made a door or way out, which came beyond my
fence or wall, and fo I came in and out this way.
But after I had done this, I was troubled to fee my-
felf thus expofed; though I could not perceive any
thing to fear, a goat being the biggeft creature I had
feen upon this ifland.
Sept. 30. Cafting up my notches on my poft, which
amounted to 365, I concluded tins to he the anniver-
fary of ivy landing; and, therefore, humbly proftra-
ting myfelf on the ground, confeffing my fins, ac-
knowledging God's righteous judgments upon me,
and praying to Jefus Chrift to have mercy upon me, I
fafted for twelve hours till the-going down of the fun;
and then eating a bifcuit and a bunch of grapes, laid
me on the bed, and with great comfort took my
night's repofe. Till this time i never had diflinguifh-
ed trTe Sabbath day; but now I made a longer notch
than ordinary for the days of reft, and divided the
weeks as well as I could, though 1 found I had loft a
day or two in my account. My ink failing foon af-
ter, 1 omitted in my daily memorandum things of an
indifferent nature, and contented myfelf to write
down ouly the moft remarkable events of my iffe.
The r,.iny and dry feaibns appeared now regular to
me, and experience taught me how to provide for
them; yet, in one thing i am going to relate, my ex-
perience very much failed me. You may call to
mind what I have mentioned of fome barley" and rice
which I had fared; about thirty ftalks of the former,
E' and
2nd twenty of the latter; and, at that time, the fun
being in its fouthern pofition, going from me, toge-
ther with the rains, made me conclude it a very pro-
per feafon to fow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece
of ground, with my wooden fpade, and dividing it in.
two parts, fowed about two-thirds of my feed, pre-
ferving by me about a handful of each. And happy
it was I did fo; for no rains falling, it was choked
up, and never appeared above the earth till the wet
feafon came again, and then part of it grew, as if it
had been newly fown.
I was refolved ftill to make another trial; and
feeking for a moifter piece of ground near my bower,
I there fowed the reft of my feed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox; which having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, yielded a
noble crop, and fprung up very pleafantly. I had ftill
faved part of the feed, not daring to venture all;
and by the time I found out the proper feafons to
fow in, and that I might expect every year two feed-
times and two harvefts, my ftock amounted to above
half a peck of each fort of grain.
No fooner were the rains over, but the ftakes
which I had cut from the trees, mot out like willows
the firft year after lopping their heads. I was igno-
rant of the tree I cut them from: but they grew fo
regularly beautiful, that they made a moft lively ap-
pearance, and fo flourimed in three years time, that
I refolved to cut more of them; and thefe foon
growing, made a glorious fence, as afterwards I fhall
obferve.
And now I perceived that the feafons of the year
might generally be divided, not into fummer and
•winter, as in Europe, but into wet and dry feafons, as
in this manner:
^" February, ~)

The wet feafons would continue longer or fhorter
as the winds happened to blow. But having found
the ill confequences of being abroad in the rain, I
took care beforehand to furnifh myfelf with provi-
Cons: and, during the wet months, fat within doors
as much as poffible. At this time I contrived to make
many things that I wanted, though it cofl me much
labour and pains, before I could accomplifh them.
The firfl I tried was to make a bafket; but all the
twigs I could get proved fo brittle, that I could not
then perform it. It now proved of great advantage
to me, that, when a boy, I took great delight ir>
flanding at a bafket maker's in the fame town where
my father lived, to view them at work; and, like o-
ther boys, curious to fee the manner of their work-
ing thefe things, and very officious to affifl, I perfect-
ly learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but
the tools. And it coming into my mind, that the
twigs of that tree of which I made my flakes, might
be as tough as fallow, willow, or ofiers, growing in
England, I refolved to make an experiment, and went
the next day to my country-feat, and found fome fit
for my turn; and after cutting down a quantity with
my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and, when fit
to work with, canicd them to my cave, where I em-
E 2 ployed
I
ployed myfelf in making feveral forts of bafkets, ir»-
fomuch that I could put in whatfoever I pleafed. It
is true, they were not cleverly made, yet they ferved
my turn upon all occafions.
But ftill I wanted two neceflary things. I had no
cnfk to hold my liquor, except two rundlets almoft
full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary fize, and
fome fquare cafe bottles; neither had I a pot to boil
any thing in, only a large kettle, unfit to make broth,
or flew a bit of meat: 1 wanted likewife at the begin-
ning of this dry feafon a tobacco-pipe; but for this I
afterwards found an expedient.
I kept myfelf employed in planting my fecond row
cf ftakes. But remembering that when I travelled up
to the brook, I had a mind to fee the whole ifland, I
now refumed my intention, and taking my dog, gun,
hatchet, two bifcuit-cakes, a great bunch of raifins,
•with a larger quantity of powder and fhot than ufual,
I began my journey. Having pafled the vale where
my bower flood, I came within view of the fea lying
to the weft; when, it being a clear day, I fairly de-
fcried land, extending from the W. to the S. W. a- .
bout 10 or 15 leagues,, as I concluded; but could not
fay whether i: was an ifland or a continent. Neither
could I tell what this place might be 5 only thought it
was part of America, and where I might have been in
a miferable condition, had I landed. Again I conff-
dered, that if this was the Spanifh coaft, certainly,
one time or other, I fhould fee fome fhip pafs by; and
if it was not, the.n it muft be the Savage coaft, between
the Spanifh country and Brazil, which abounds with
cannibals or man-eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this fide of the
ifland much more pleafant than mine; the fields fra-
grant, adorned with fweet flowers and verdant grafs,
together with feveral very fine woods. There were
parrots in plenty, which made me long for one to be
my companion; but it was with, great difficulty I
could
could knock one down with-my ftick 5 and I kept him
at home fome years, before I could get him to call me
by my name.
In the low grounds I found various forts of hares
and foxes as I took them td be, but much different
from thofe in England. Several of thefe I killed, but
never ate them ; neither indeed had I any occafion;
For, abounding with goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes,
I could defy Leadenhall market to furnifh me a bet-
ter table. In this journey I did not travel above two
miles a day, becaufe I took feveral turns and wind-
ings, to fee what difcoveries I could make, returning
weary enough to the place where I defigned to reft all
night, which was either in a tree, or to.a place which
I furrounded with Rakes, that no wild creature might
fuddenly furprife me. When I came to the fea more,
I was amazed t,o fee the fplendor of it. Its ftrand
was covered with fhells of the moft beautiful fifh, and
conftantly abounding with innumerable turtles, and
fowls of many kinds, which I was ignorant of, except
thofe called Penguins. I might have mot as many
as I pleafed, but was fparingof my ammunition, ra-
ther chufing to kill a fhe-goat, which I did with
much difficulty, on account of the flatnefs of the
country.
Now, though this journey produced" the moft pie x-
fing fatisfaclion, yet my habitation was fo much to
my liking, that 1 did not repine at my being feated
on the worft part of the ifland. I continued my jour-
ney, travelling about twelve miles further towards the
eaft, where I fet a great pile on the fhore for a mark,
concluding that my next journey fhould bring me to
the other fide of the illand,. eaft from my caftlc, and
fo round till I came to my poft again. As I had a
conftant view of the country, I thought I could not
mifs my way; but fcarce had I travelled three miles,,
when I descended into a very large valley, fo fur-
rounded with hills covered with wood, that 1 having
no guide but by the fun, nor even then, unlefsl knew
£3' well.
well the pofition of the fun at that time of the day;
and, to add to my misfortune, the weather proving"
very hazy, I was obliged to return to my poll by the
fea fide, and fo backwards the fame way I came. In
this journey my dog furprifed a kid, and would have
killed it, had I not prevented him. As I had ofterr
been thinking of getting a kid or two, and fo raifing.
a breed of tame goats to fupply me after my ammu-
nition was fpent, I took this opportunity of begin-1
ning: and, having made a collar for this little crea-
ture, with a ftring made of rope-yarn, I brought it to
,ny bower, and there inclofed and left him; and, ha-
ving fpent a month in this journey, at length I re-
turned to my old habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my fatisfadtion, when I re-
turned to my -little caftle, and repofed myfelf in my
hammock. After my journey I refted myfelf a week,,
which time I employed in making a cage for my
pretty poll.' I now began to confiderof the poor kid
I had left at the bower, and I immediately went to-
fetch it home. When I came there, I found the young
creature almoft ftarved; I gave it fome food, and tied
it as before: but there was no occafion, for it follow-
ed me like a dog; and, as I conftantly fed it, it be-
came fo loving, gentle, and fond, that it commenced
one of my domeuics, and would never leave me.
The rainy feafon of the autumnal equinox being'
now come, I kept the 3cth of September in the moft
folemn manner, as ufual, it being the third year of
my abode in the ifland. I fpent the whole day in ac-
knowledging God's mercies, in giving him thanks
for making this folitary life as agreeable, and lefs fin*
ful, than that of human fociety 5 and for the com-
munications of his grace to my foul, in fupporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
providence, and hope for his eternal prefence in the
w^rld to come.
In.leed, I often did conCder how much more happy
I was
-1 was, in this ftate of life, than in that accurfed man1
ner of living I formerly ufed: and fometimes wheft
hunting, or viewing the country, the anguifh of my
foul would break out upon me, and my very heart
would fink within me, to think of the woods, the
mountains, the deferts I was in; and how I was a
prifoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts
of the ocean, in an uninhabited wiMernefs, without
hopes, and without redemption: In this condition, I
would often wring my hands, and weep like a child:
And even fometimes in the middle of my work this
fit would take me; and then I would fit down and
figh, looking on the ground for an hour or two toge-
ther, till fuch time as my grief got vent in a flood of
tears. •
One morning, as I was fadly employed in this
manner, I opened my Bible, when immediately I
fixed my eyes upon thefe words, / -will never leave
thee, nor for fake thee! Surely, thought I, thefe
•words are directed to me; or elfe why fhould they
appear juft at a moment when I am bemoaning my
forlorn condition? and if God does not forfake me,
what matters it, finee he can make me more happy
i-n this ftate of life, than if I enjoyed the greateft
fplendor in the world? But while I was going to re-
turn God thanks for my prefcnt ftate, fomething
feemed to fhock my mind, as if' it had thus faid:
Unworthy wretch! can you pretend to be thankfuL
for a condition, from which you would pray to be
delivered! Here I ftopt; and though I could not
fay, I thanked the Divine Majefty for being there,
yet I gave God thanks for placing to my view my
fbrmer wicked courfe of life, and granting me a true
knowledge of repentance. And whenever I opened
or fhut the Bible, I blefled kind Providence, that di-
rected my good friend in England to fend it among
my goods without my order, and for affifting me to
lave it from the power of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my feveral
daily
daily employments were thefe: Firft, My duty to>
Heaven, and diligently reading the holy Scriptures,
which I did twice or thrice every day. Secondly*
Seeking provifion with my gun, which commonly
took me up, when it did not rain, three hours every
morning. Thirdly, The ordering, curing, prefer-
ving, and cooking what I had killed, or catched for
my fupply, which took me up a great part of the day:
for, in the middle of the day, the fun being in its
height, it was fo hot, that I could not ftirout; fb
that I had only but four hours in the evening to work
in: and then the want of tools, of affiftarrce, and flcill,
, wafted a great deal of time to little purpofe. I was
no lefs than two and forty days making a board fit
for a long fhelf, which two fawyers, with their tools
and £»w-pit, would have cut out of the fame tree in
half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was
to be broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and
two more in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it
to a piece of timber. This I hacked and hewed off
each fide, till it became light to move; then I turned
it, made one fide of it fmooth and Hat as a board
from end to end, then turned it downward, cutting
the other fide, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and fmooth on both fides. A-
ny body may judge my great labour and fatigue in
fuch a piece of work; but this I went through with
patience, as alfo many other things that my circum-
llances made neceflary for me to do.
The harveft months, November and December,
were now at hand, in which I had the pleafing profpefit
of a very good crop. But here I met with a new mif-
fortune; for the goats and hares, having tafted of
the fweetnefs of the blade, kept it fo fhort, that it
had not ftrength to fhoot up into a flalk. To pre-
vent this, I inclofed it with a hedge, and by day fhot
fome of its devourers; and my dog, which I had
tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all nighr,
fo
•To frightened thefe creatures, that I got entirely rid
of them.
But, no fooner did I get rid of thefe, than other
enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks of feveral
forts of birds, who only waited till my back was
turned, to ruin me. So much did this provoke me,
that I let fly, and killed three of the malefactors;
and afterwards ferved them as they do notorious
thieves in England, hung them xip in chains as a
terror to others. And, indeed, fo good an effect had
this, that they not only forlook the corn, but all that
part of the ifland, fo long as thefe criminals hung
there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of
December, which was my fecond harveft, I reaped it
with a fcythe, made of one of my broad fwords. t
had no fatigue in cutting down my firft crop, it was
fo flender. The ears I carried home in a baiket, rub-
bing it out with my hands, inftead of threfhing it;
end when my harveft was over, found my half pecfc
of feed produced near two bufhels of rice, and two
bufhcls and a half of barley, And now 1 plainly
forefaw, that, by God's goodnefs, I fhould fee fur-
nifhed with bread; but yet I was concerned, becaufe
I knew not how to grind or make meal of my corn,
nor bread, neither knew how to bake it. I >vould
not, however, tafte any of the crop, but reiblved to
preferve it againft next feafon, and, in the mean
while, ufe my beft endeavours to provide myfelfwitb,
other food.
But where were my labours to end? The want of
a plough to turn up the earth, or fhovel to dig it, I
conquered by making me a wooden fpade. The want
of a harrow I fupplied myfelf, with dragging over the
corn a great bough of a tree. When it was growing,
I was forced to fence it; when ripe, to mow it,
carry it. home, threfh it, part it from the chaff, and
fave it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind ir,
4Geve to drefs it, yeft and fait to make it into bread,
and
and an oven to bake it. This fet my brains on \vork
to find fome expedient for every one of thefe necefla-
ries againft the next harveft.
And now having more feed, my firft care was to
prepare me more land. I pitched upon two large flat
pieces of ground near my caflle, for that purpofe, in
which I fowed my feed, and fenced it with a good
hedge. This took me up three months; by which
time the wet feafon coming on, and the rain keeping
me within doors, I found fcveral occafions to employ
myfelf; and, while at work, ufed to divert myfelf
with talking to my parrot, learning him to know and
fpeak his own name Poll, the firft welcome word I
ever heard fpoke in the ifland. I had been a long
time contriving how to make earthen veflels, which
I wanted extremely; and, when I confulered the
heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could
find any fuch clay, I might botch up a pot, ftrong
enough, whendriG>l in the fun, to bear handling, and
to hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal, and
other things.
To be fhort, the clay I found ; but it would occa-
fion the moft ferious perfon to fmile, to fee what awk- .
ward ways I took, and what ugly mifhapen things I
made; how many either fell out or cracked by ths
violent heat of the fun, and fell in pieces when they
were removed; fo that I think it was two months
time before I could perfect any thing: and even then
but two clumfy things, in imitation of earthen jars.
Thefe, however, I very gently placed in wicker baf-
kets, made on purpofe for them, and between the
pot and the bafkets, fluffed it full of rice and barley
ftraw: and thefe, I prefumed, would hold my dried
corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn was brui-
fed. As for the fmaller things, I made them with
better fuccefs; fuch as little round pots, flat difhes,
pitchers, and pipkins, the fun baking them very
hard.
Yet ftill I wanted one thing abfolutely neceflary,
and
and that was an earthen pot, not only to hold my li-
quid, but alfo to bear the fire, which none of thefe
could do. It once happened, that as I was putting
out my fire, I found therein a broken piece of one of
my vefl'els burnt hard as a rock, and red as a tile.
This made me think of burning fome pots; and ha-
ving no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead,
I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a
pile one upon another. The fire I piled round the
outfide, and dry wood on the top, till I faw the pots
in the infide red-hot, and found that they did not
crack at all; and when I perceived them perfectly red,
I let one of them fland in the fire about five or fix
hours, till the clay melted by the extremity of the
heat, and would have run to glafs, had I fuffered it;
upon which I flacked my fire by degrees, till the red-
nefs abated; and watching them till the morning, I
found I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen
pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn as I could de-
fire.
No joy could be greater than mine at this difcove-
ry. For after this, I may fay, I wanted for no -fort
of earthen ware. I filled one of my pipkins with wa-
ter to boil me fome meat, which it did admirably well,
and with a piece of kid I made me fome good broth,
as well as my circumftances would afford me at that
time.
The next concern I had was to get me a ftone-mor-
tar to beat fome corn in, inftead of a mill to grind it.
Here indeed I was at a great lofs, as not being fit for
a ftone cutter ; "and many days I fpent to find out a
great ftone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for
a mortar, and ftrong enough to bear the weight of a
peftil, that would break the corn without filling it
with fand. But all the ftones of the ifland being of
a mouldering nature, rendered my fearch fruitlefs;
and then I refolved to look out a great block of hard
wood; which having foon found, I formed it with my
axe and hammer, and then with infinite labour made
a
a hollow in it, jufl as the Indians of Brazil make their
canoes. When I had finifhed this, I made a great
peftil of iron wood, and then laid them up againft my
fucceeding harveft.
My next bufinefs was to make me a fieve, to fift
my meal, and part it from the bran and hufk. Having
no fine thin canvafs to fearch the meal through, I
could not tell what to do. What linen I had was
reduced to rags: I had goats hair enough, but nei-
ther tools to work it, nor did I know how to fpin it:
At length I remembered I had fome neckcloths of
callicoe or muflin of the failors, which I had brought
out of the fhip, and with thefe I made three fmall
Ceves, proper enough for the work.
I come now to confider the baking part. The
want of an oven I fupplied by making fome earthen
pans very broad, but not deep. When I had, a-mind
to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, the tiles,
of which I had made myielf j and when the wood was
burnt into live-coals, I fpread them over it, till it be-
came very hot; then fweeping them away, I fet down
my loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots \ipon
them, drew the afhes and coals all around the outfide
of the pots to continue the heat; and in this manner I
baked my barley-loaves, as well as if I had been a .
complete paftry cook, and alfo made of the rice feve-
ral cakes and puddings.
It is no wonder, that all thefe things took me up
the beft part of a year, fince what intermediate time
I had was beftowed in managing my new harveft
and hufbamiry; for in the proper feafon I reaped my
corn, carried it home, and laid it up in the ear in my
large bafkets, till I had time to rub, inftead of
threfhing it. And now indeed my corn increafed fo
much, that it produced me about twenty bufhels of
barley, and as much of rice, that I not only began
to ufe it freely, but was thinking how to enlarge
my
rhvy barns, and refolded to fow as much at a rime as
• would be fufEcient for me for a whole year.
All this while, the profpecT: of land, which I had
feen from the other fide of the ifland, ran in my
mind. 'I ftill meditated a deliverance from this*
.-.place, though the fear of greater misfortunes might
have deterred me from it. For allowing that I had
attained that place, I run the hazard of being killed
j and eaten by the devouring cannibals; and if they
•were not fo, yet I might be flain, as other Euro-
ipeans had been, who fell into their hands. Not-
withftanding all this, my thoughts ran continually
.'upon that more. I now wifhed for my boy Xufy,
;and the long boat, with the fhoulder of mutton farl:
?! went to the fhip's boat, that had been caft a great
~way on the more in the late ftorm. She was remo-
•ved but a little; but her bottom being turned up by
•the impetuofity and fury qf the waves and wind, I
fell to work with all the firength I had, and with le-
vers andx rollers I had cut from the wood, to turn
•her, and repair the damages fhe had fuftained. This
work took me up three or four weeks, when finding
my little ftrength all in vain, I fell to undermining
it by digging away the fand, and fo to make it fall
down, fetting pieces of wood to thruft and guide it
:in the fall. Put after this was done, I was itill un-
able to ftir it up, or to get under it, much lefs to
move it forwards towards the water, and fo I was for-
'ced to give it over.
This difappointment, however, did not frighten me.
I began to think, whether it was not poffible for me
to make a canoe or Perigua, fuch as the Indians
make of the trunk of a tree. But here I lay under par-
ticular inconveniencies; want of tools to make it,
and want of hands to move it in the water when it
was made. However, to work I went upon it,
flopping all the enquiries I could make, with this
•very fimple anfwer I made to myfelf, Let's firft make
F ir,
it, I'll warrant I'll find fome way or other to get it
along when it is done.
I firft cut down a ,cedar-tree, which was five feet
.. .ten inches diameter at the lower part next .the flump,
and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty two feet, after which it leflened for a fpace,
and then parted into branches. Twenty days was I
a hacking and hewing this tree at the bottom, four-
teen more in cutting off the branches and-limbs, and
a whole month in fhaping it like the bottom of a
boat. As for the infide, I was three weeks with a
mallet and ch^flel, clearing it in fuch a manner, as
that it was big enough to carry 26 men, much big-
ger than any canoe I ever faw in my life, and confe-
.quently fiifficient to tranfport me and all my effe6ls
.to that wifhed-fpr fhore I fo ardently defired.
Nothing remained now, 'but, indeed, the greateft
.difficulty,' to get it into the water, it lying about 100
.yards from it. To remedy the firft inconvenience,
which was a rifing hill between this boat and the
creek, with wonderful pains and labour I dug imp
the.furface of the earth, and made a declivity. But
•when this was done, all the ftrength >I had was as in-
fufficient to move it, as it was when I attempted to
move the boat. I then proceeded to meafure the di-
ftance of ground, refolving to make a canal, in or-
der to bring the water to the canoe, fmce I could not
bring the canoe to the water. But as this feemed
to be impracticable to myfelf alone, under the fpace
of eleven or twelve years, it brought me into fome
fort of confideration: fo that 'I concluded this alfp
to be impoffible, and the attempt altogether vain. J
now faw, and not before, wtiat ftupidity it is to be-
gin work before we reckon its cofts, or judge right-
ly our own abilities to go through with its perform-
ance.
In the height of this work, my fourth year e,xpi-
fed, from the time I was caft on this ifland. 'At
this time I did not forget my anniversary; but kept
Jt
It with rather greater devotion than before. For now
my hopes being fruftrated, I looked upon this world
as a thing I had nothing to do with j and very well
might I fay, as father Abraham faid unto Dives, Be-
tween me and th:e there is a gulf fixed. And indeed
I was feparated from its wickednefs too, having nei-
ther the luft of the flefh, the lufl of the eye, nor the"
pride of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king,
and emperor over the whole country I had in poffef-
fibn, without difputc, and without controul: I had'
loadings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abun-
dance, and grapes above meafure. What was air the'
reft to me? The money I had'lay by me as defpica-
ble drofs, which I would freely have given for a grofs
of tobacco pipes, or a hand-mill to grind my corn:'
In a word, the nature and experience of thefe things,
dictated to me this jufl reflection, That the good
things of this world are no farther good to us, than
they are for cur ufe ; and-that whatever we may heap
to .give others* we can but enjoy as much as we
, and no1 more:
Thefe thoughts rerldered my mind more eafy than'
ufu'il. Every time I fat down to meat, I did it with'
thankiulnefs, admiring the providential hand of God,
who, in this vvildernefs, had fpread a table to me. And
now I confidered what F enjoyed, rather than what
I wanted; compared my prefent condition with what
I at firft expected it fhould be; how I fhould have'
done, if I had got nothing out of the fhip; that I
muft have perifhed before I had caught fim or tur-
tles; or lived, had I found them, like a mere fa-
vage, by eating them raw, and pulling them in pie--
ces with my claws, like a beaft. I' next compared'
my ftation to that which I deferved; how undutiful'
I had been to my parents; how deftitute of the fear"
of God; how void of every thing that was good;.
and how ungrateful for thofe abundant mercies I had.
jseceived from heaven, being fed, as it were, by v
. JT i- miracle^.
up t
ufe,
miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed by ravens j:,
and caft on a place where there were no venemous >'
creatures to poifon or devour me; in fhort, making:
God's tender mercies matter of great confolation, I
relinquiOied all fadnefs, and gave way to content-
ment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I;
made laft as long as I could, I ufed to minute down
the days of the month, on which any remarkable thing;
happened. And,
Firft, I obferved, that the fame day I forfook my
parents and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to fea,the fame day afterwards^ in the next year,/
I was taken and made a flave by the Sallee rovers:
That the very day I efcaped out of the wreck of;
the fhip in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the fame -
day, I made my efcape from Sallee in my patron's'
fifhing-boat:
And, that orr the joth of September, being the dayv
of the year I was born on, on that day twenty-fix years -
after, was I miraculoufly faved, and caft afhore on.':
this ifland:
The nex,t thing that wafted after my ink, was the'
bifcuit which I had brought out of the fhip: and,
though 1 allowed myfelf but one cake a day for above'-
a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out of bread for near
a year, before I got any corn of my own.
In the nest place, my clothes began to decay, and -
my linen had been gone long before. However, I>.
had preferved about three dozen of the'failors che-
quered sbirrs,* which proved a great refrefhment to;
me, when the violent beams of the fun would not
fuffer me to bear any of the feamens heavy watch-
coats'; which made me turn tailor, and, after a mi-
ferable botching .manner, convert them to jackets.
To preferve my head, I made me a cap of goat-
fkins, with the hair outwards to keep out the rain;
•which indeed ferved me fo well, that afterwards -I-
made
•Blade me a waiftcoat and open-kneed breeches of the
fame: And then I contrived a fort of an umbrella,
covering it with fkins, which not only kept out the
heat of the fun, but the rain alfo. Thus being eafy
and fettled in-my mind, my chiefeft happinefs was to
converfe with God, in moft heavenly and comfortable;
.ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot fay any extraordi--
nary thing, occurred to me. My chief employment
•was to cure my raifins, and plant my barley and rice,>
of both which 1 had a year's provifion before-hand.
But though I was difappointed in my firfl canoe, I'
made it, at intermediate times, my bufinefs to make'
a fecond, of much inferior fize j and it was two years-
Before I finifhed it. But as I perceived it would no-
wife anfwer my defign-of failing to the other fhore,
my thoughts were confined to take a tour round the
ifland, to fee what further difcoveries I could make.
T-o this intent,.after having moved her to the water,,
and tried how fhe would fail, I fitted up a little mail-
to my boat, and made a fail of the fhip's fail that lay
ty me. I then- made lockers or boxes at the end of:
it, to put in neceflaries, provifions, and ammunition,,
"which would preferve 'them dry either from rain, orr
the fpray of the fea -r and in. the infide of the boar, II
cut me a long hollow place to lay my gun, and to keep
it dry made a flag to hang over it,. My umbrella J'
-fixed in a flcp in the ftern, like a' maft, to keep the-
heat of the fun'off me.- And now refolving to fee the.
circumference of my little kingdomj I victualled my
fhip for the voyage, putting.in two dozen of my bar--
ley-bread loaves,, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a"
little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder and fhot, and:
two watch-coats. It was the 6th of November, in
.the fixth y,ear of my. reign, or captivity, that I fet.
.out on this voyage; which was much longer than L
expe£led, being obliged to put farther out, by reafon
*pf.,the rock's that lay a great way-in the fea. And in-
-E , <kcd-
deed fo much did thefe rocks furprife me, that
for putting back, fearing that if I ventured fafther,_it-
vvould be out of my power to return: In tins uncer*
tainty I came to'an anchor jufl off fhore, to which I
waded with my gun on my fhoulder, and then climb-
ing up a hill, which overlooked that point, I faw the
full extent of it, and fo I refolved to run 'all hazards.
In this profpect from the hill, I perceived a violent
current running to the eaft, coming very clofe to the
point; which 1 the more carefully obferved, thinking
it dangerous, and that when I came to it, I might be •
drove into the fea by its force, and not able to return,
to the ifhnd; and certainly it muft have been fo, had:
I not made this obfervation; for on the other fide was
the like current, with this difference, that it fet off at
a greater diftance; and I perceived there was a ftrong
eddy under the land; fo that my chief bufinefs was to
work out of the firft current, and conveniently get in-
to the eddy. Two days-I ftaid here, the wind blow--
ing very brifkly E. S. E. which being contrary to the •
current, leaves a great breach of the fea upon the
point; fo it was neither fit for me to keep too near the
fhore, on account of the breach; nor ftand at too great.
a diftance, for fear of the ftreams,. That night the
•wind abating, it grew fo calm, that I ventured out;,
and here I may be a monument to all rafh and igno-;
rant pilots: For I was no fooner come to the point, and1
not a~bove the boat's length from fhore, but 1 was got
Into a deep water, with a current like a mill, which*;
drove my boat along fo violently, that it was impoffible
for me to keep her near the edge of it, but forced me •
more and more out from the eddy to theleft of me; and:
all I could do with my padlers was ufelefs, there being
no wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myfelf as quite loft,,
fmce, as the current ran on both fides of the ifland, 1\
was very certain they muft join again, and then I had
pa
* * 1 1
3W hopes but of perifhing for want in the fea, after:
•what provifion I had was fpent, or before, if a ftorm,
fbould happen to arife.
Who can conceive the prefent anguifh of my mind i
nt this calamity? With longing eyes did I look up-
on my little kingdom, and thought the ifland the
pleafantelt place in the univerfe. Happy, thrice hap-
py defert, faid I, fliall I- never fee thee more?
"Wretched creature ! whithtr nm I going? Why did •
I murmur at my lonefome condition, when now li
•would give the whole world to . be thither again?
"While I was thus'complaining, I found myfclf to
be driven about two leagues into the fea ; .however, ti
fraboured till my ftrength was far fpent,,to keep my
boat as far north as poffibly I could, to that fide of
the current where the, eddy lay on.. About noon li
perceived a little breeze of wind fpring up from the
S. S. E. which' overjoyed my heart; and I was ftill
rnore elated, when, in about half an hour, it blew i.
fentle fine galev Had any thick weather fprung up,
:had been loft another way: for having, no compafs
on board, .1 fhould never have found the way to fteer
towards the ifland, if once it had difappeared; but it
proving the contrary, . I-fet up my maft again, fpread
my fail, and ftood away northward, as much as I
could, to get rid of the current. Ami no fooner did
the boat begin to ftretch away, but 1 perceived, by
the clearnefs of the water, a change of the current
•was near; for, where it was ftrong, the water was
foul; and, where it was clear, the current abated.
To the eaft I foon law, about half a mile, a breach
of the fea upon fome rocks, which caufed it again to
feparate; and as the main force of it drove away
;rnore fouthwardly, leaving the rocks to the north-
eaft, fo the other came back by the repulfe of the
rocks, making a fharp eddy, which returned back a-
gain to the north-well with a very fwift ftream.
They who have experienced what it is to be re-
prieved upon the ladder, or to be faved from thieves,
juft
juft going to take away their lives, or fuch as nars;
been in the like calamities with my own, may guefs-
my prefent excefs of joy, how heartily 1 run my boat,
into the ftream of this eddy, and how. joyfully E
fpread my fail to the refrefhing wind, flanding cheer-
fully before it, with a fmart tide under foot. By the.
uffiftance of this eddy, I was carried above a league'
home again, when, being in the wake of the ifl-and,.
betwixt the two currents, I found the water to be in*
a fort of a fland. About four o'clock in the afternoon^
I reached within a league of the ifland,.and perceived*
the points of the rock, which caufed this difafter,:
ftretching out, as I obferved before,.to the fouthward^
which, throwing off the current more fouthwardly,>
had occafioned another eddy to the north. But ha
•ving a fair brifk gale, I ftretched acrofs this edxly, and'
in an hour came within a mile of the more,- where I:
foon landed, to my unfpeakable comfort; and after an
humble proftration, thanking God for my deliverance,,
•with a refolution to lay all thoughts of efcaping afide,-
I brought my boat fafe to a little cove, and laid me'
down to take a welcome repofe. When I awoke, p
•was confidering how 1 might get my boat home; and;
coafting along the fhore, I came to a good bay, which.'
ran up to a rivulet or brook, where, finding a fafe
harbour, I ftowed her as fafe as if fhe hail been in ai
dry .dock made on purpofe for her.
I now perceived myfe-lf not far from the place-'
•where before 1 had travelled on foot; fo taking no.
thing with me, except my g.un and umbrella, I begaiji
my journey, and in the evening came to my bower,.
•where I again laid me down to reft. I had not flepf
long before I was awakened in great-furp.rife, by a
•ftrange voice that called me feveral times, Robiit^.
Robin, Robin Cnifoe, poor Robin! Where are you, Ra*
JiinCtuJoe? -where are you? -where have you been?

as the voice repeated Robin/on Crufoe feveral times,
being terribly affrighted, I ftarted up, in the utmoft •
confufion; and, no fooner were my eyes fully open,
but I beheld my pretty Poll fitting on the top of the
hedge, and foon knew that it was he that calkd me;

prattle I had conftantly taught him. But even though;
I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great while be-

creature got thither, and that he fhouklfixabout that"

oeafcd; and reaching out my hand, and calling fa-
jfiiliafly Poll, the creature came to me, and perched,
upon my thumb, as he was wont, conflantly prating1
to me, with Poor Robinfon Crufee, and how did 1
come here, and where had I been? as if the bird was
overjoyed, to fee me; and fo I took him home along-
••: with me. -
I was now pretty well cured'of my rambling to
fta; yet I could wifh my boat, which had coft me fo>-
much trouble and pains, on this fide the ifland once
more, but which indeed was impracticable. I there-
fore began to lead a very retired life, living near a',
twelvemonth, in a very contented.manner, wanting'
for nothing except converfationv As to mechanic
labours, which my neceffities obliged me to, I fancied:
I could, upon occafionj makfi a tolerable carpenter,
were the poor tools I had to work withal but good.
Befides, as I improved irr my earthen ware, I contri-
ved to make them with a wheel, tvhich I found much *
eafier and better, making my work fhapely, which
before was rude and ugly. But, 1 think I;was never
fo elevated with my own performance or projectrtbart
for
for being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which, though^
it proved an awkward clumfy thing, yet it was very
found, and carried the fmoke perfe£tly well, to my
great fatisfaction,
I alfo improved my wicker ware, making me abun-
dance of neceflary bafkets, which, though not very
handfome, were very handy and convenient to fetch
things home in, as alfo for holding my flores, barley,,
rke, and other provifions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine
after what manner I fhould kill- the goats or birds toj
live on, after it was all gone. Upon which I con-
trived many ways to enlhare the goats, and fee if I
could catch them alive, particularly a fhe goat with
young. At laft I had my defire; fcr, making pit-falls-
and traps, baited with barley and rke, I-found, one-
morning, in one of them, an old he goat, and in the-
otherthree kids, one male the other two females.
So boifterous was the old one, that I could not
bring him away. But I forgot the old proverb, That-
hunger -will tame a lion: For, had I kept him three or-
four days without victuals, and then given him fome
water, with a little corn, he would have been as tame,
as a young kid. The other creatures I bound with.-
ftrings together; but I had great difficulty before I
could bring them to my habitation. It was fome-
time before they would feed; but, throwing them,
fweet corn, it fo much tempted them, that they be-
gan to be tamer. From hence I concluded,- that if t
defigned to furnifh myfelf with goats fiefh, when myr
ammunition was fpent, the tamely breeding them upr
like a flock of fheep, about my fettlement, was the
only method I could take. I concluded alfo I muft
feparate the wild from the tame, or elfe they would
always run wild as they grew up;-and "the beft way
for this, was to have fome inclofed piece of ground,
well fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them
fo effe£tually, that thofe within might not break out,
•r thole, without break in. Sudi an undertaking
•Was very great for one pair of hands; but as there was
an abfoluteneceffity for doing it, my firft care was to
find a convenient piece of ground where there was
4ikely to be herbage for them to eat, water to drink,
.and cover to keep them from the fun.
Here again I gave another inftance of my igno-
rance and inexperience, pitching upon a piece of mea-
dow land fo large, that had I inclofed it, the hedge
or pale muft-have been at leafl two miles about. la-
deed, had it been ten miles, I had time enough to do
•it in ; -but then I did not cortfider that my goats would
be as wild in fo much cotnpafs, as if they had had
• the whole ifland, Mid confequently as .difficult for me
to catch them. This thought came into my head, a£-
,ter I had carried it on, I believe, about fifty yards:
I therefore altered my fcheme, and refolved to inclofe
a piece of ground about 150 yards in, length, and
100 in breadth, fufficient enough for as many as would
maintain me, till fuch time as my .flock increafed, and
then I could add more ground. Trfow vigoroufly pro-
fecuted my work, and it took me about three months
in hedging the firft piece; in which time I tethered
the three -kids in the beft part of it, feeding them as
near me as poffible, to make them familiar: and in.
deed I very often would carry fome ears of barley, or
a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand; by
'which they grew fo tame, that when my inclofure was
finifhed, and I had let them loofe, they would run
after me for a handful of-corn. Thislndeed anfwer-
ed my end; and in a year and a half's time I had a
flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years after, they amounted to forty-three, befides what
1-had taken and killed for my fuftenance. After which
•I inclofed five feveral pieces of ground to feed them
in, with -pens to drive them into, that I might take,
.them as I had occafion.
In this project I likewife found additional bleflings;
ifor I not only had plenty of goats flefh, but milk too,
which,
•which, in my beginning, I did not fo much as think
of. And, indeed, though I never had milked a cow,
.much lefs a goat, or feen butter or cheefe made, yet,
, after feme eflays and mifcarriages, I made me both,
and never afterwards wanted.
How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort
'his creatures, even in the midlr. of their .great eft cala-
mities? How can he fweeten the bittereft providen-
ces, and give us reafon to magnify him in dungeons
and prifons? What a bounteous table was here fpread
• in a wildernefs for me, where I expe£ted nothing at
-firft but to perifh for hunger?
Certainly a Stoic would have fmiled to have feen
me at dinner. There fat my royal majefty, an abfo-
lute prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended by my
dutiful fubjects, whom, if I pleafed, I could either
hang, draw, quarter, give them liberty, or take it
.away. When I dined, I feemed a king, eating alone,
none daring to prefume to do fo till I had done. Poll,
.as if he had been my principal court favourite, was
the only perfon permitted to talk with me. My old,
but faithful dog, now grown exceeding crazy, and
•who had found no fpecies to multiply his kind upon,
continually fat on my right hand; while my two cats
• -fat on each fide of the table, exptcting a bit from my
hand, as a principal mark of my royal favour. Thefe
. were not the cats I had brought from the fhip ;" they
had been dead long before, and interred near my ha-
bitation by mine own hand. But one of them, as I
fuppofe, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their
young I had made tame; the reft run wild into the
woods, and in time grew fo impudent as to return
and plunder me of my ftores, till fucb ,time as J.
. ihot a great many, and the reft left me without trou-
bling me any more. In this plentiful manner did I
live, wanting for nothing but converiation. One
thing indeed concerned me, the want of my boat;

fcer; .hut had any one in England met fuch a figure,
it would either have affrighted them, or made them -
burft into laughter; nay, I could not but fmile my-
felf at my habit, which I think in this place will be
very proper to defcribe. ,
The cap I wore upon my head was great, high, and
fhapelefs, made of a goats-fldn, with a flap or pent-
houfe hanging down behind, not only to keep the
fun from me, but to moot the rain off from running
into my neck, nothing being more pernicious than
the rain falling upon the flefh in thefe climates. I
had a fhort jacket of goats-fkin, whofe hair hung
down fuch a length on either fide, that it reached
down to the calves of my legs. As for fhoes and
flockings, I had none, but made a refemblance of
fomething, I know not what to call them; they were
made like bufldns, and laced on the fides like fpatter-
dafhes, barbaroufly fhaped like the reft of my habit.
I had a broad belt of goats-fkin dried, girt round me
with a couple of thongs, inftead of buckles; on each
of which, to fupply the deficiency of fword and dag-
ger, hung my hatchet and faw. I had another belt,
not fo broad, yet faftened in the fame manner, which
hung over my fhoulder, and at the end of it, under
my left arm, hung two pouches, made alfo of goats-
fkin, to hold my powder and fhot. My bafket I car-
ried on my back, and my gun on my fboulder 5 and
over my head a great clumfy ugly goat-fkin umbrella,
which, however, next to my gun, was the mofl ne-
ceflary thing about me. As for my face, the colour
was not fo fwarthy as the Mulattoes, or as might have
been expected from one who took fo little care of it,
in a climate within nine or ten degrees of the Equinox.
At one time my beard grew fo longthat it hung down
above a quarter of a yard; but as I had both razors
and fciiTars in flore, I cut it all off, and fuffered none
to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan whifkers,
the like of which I had feen worn by fome Turks at
Sallee, no&lpng enougk indeed to hang a hat upon,
G but
butoffuch a monftrous fize, as would have amazeJ
any in England to have feen.
But all this was of no confequence hefe, there be-
ing none to obferve my behaviour or habit. And fo,
without fear and without controul, I proceeded on my
journey, the profccution of which took me up five
or fix days. I firfl travelled along the fea fhore, di-
rectly to the place where I firft brought my boat to an
anchor, to get upon the rocks; but having now no
boat to take care of, I went over land a nearer way to
the fame height that I was before upon; when look-
ing forward to the point of the rock, which lay out,
and which I was forced to double with my boat, I was
amazed to fee the fea fo fmooth and qukt, there be-
ing no ripling motion, nor current, any more than
in other places. This made me ponder fome time to
guefs the reafon of it, when at laft I was convinced,
that the ebb fetting from the weft and joining with
the current of water from fome great river on fhore,
muft be the occafion of thcfe rapid ftreams; and that,
confequendy, as the winds blew more weftwardly,
or more fouthwardly, fo the current came the nearer,
or went the farther from fhore. To fatisfy my curiofi-
ty, I waited there till evening, when the time of ebb
being made, I plainly perceived from the rock the cur-
rent again as before, with this difference, that it ran
farther off, near half a league from the fhore; where-
as, in my expedition, it fet clofe upon it, furioufly
hurrying me and my canoe along with it, which at a-
nother time it would not have done. And now I
was convinced, that, by obferving the ebbing and
flowing of the tide, I might eafily bring my boat
round the ifland again. But when I began to think
of putting it in practice, the remembrance of the late
danger ftruck me with fuch horror, that I. changed
my refolution, and formed another, which was more
fafe, though more laborious; and this was to make an-
other canoe, and fo have one for one fide of the ifland,
_nd one for the other.
had
I had now two plantations in the ifland j the firft
my little fortification, fort, or caflle, with many large
and fpacious improvements: for by this time I had
enlarged the cave behind me with feveral little caves,
one within another, to hold my bafkets, corn, and
ftraw. The piles with which I made my wall were
grown fo lofty and great as obfcured my habitation.
And near this commodious -and pleafant fettlement,
lay my well cultivated and improved corn fields,
which kindly yielded me its fruit in the proper fea-
fon. My fecond plantation was that near my coun-
try-feat, or little bower, where my grapes flourifhed,
and where, having planted many ftakes, I made inclo-
fures for my goats, fo ftrongly fortified by labour and
time, that it was much ftronger than a wall, and con-
fequently impoffible for them to break through. As
for my bower itfelf, I kept it conftantly in repair, and
cut the trees in fuch a manner, as made them grow
thick and wild, and form a moft delightful fhade. In
the centre of this flood my tent, thus erecled. I had
driven four piles in the ground, fpreading over it a
piece of the fhip's fail; beneath which I made me a
fort of a couch with the fkins of the creatures I had
flain, and other things; and having laid thereon one
of the Tailor's blankets, which I had faved from the
wreck of the fhip, and covering myfelf with a great
watch-coat, I took up this place for my country re-
treat.
Very frequently from this fettlement did I ufe to
vifit my boat, and kept her in very good order. And
fometimes I would venture in her a c.aft or two from
fhore, but no farther, left either a ftrong current, a
fudden ftormy wind, or fome unlucky accident, fhould
hurry me from the ifland as before. But now I en-
treat your attention, whilft I proceed to inform you of
a new, but moft furpriting fcene of life which here
hefcl me. . „
You may eafily fuppofe, that, after having been
here fo long, nothing could be more amazing than
G a to
to fee a human creature. One day it happened, that,
going to my boat, I faw the print of a man's naked
loot on the fhore, very evident on the fand, as the
toes, heels, and every part of it. Had I feen an ap-
parition in the moft frightful fhape, I could not-have
been more confounded. My willing ears gave the
ftrideft attention. I caft my eyes around, but could"
fhtisfy neither the one or the other. I proceeded al*
tcrn;itely to every part of the fhore, but with equal
et?et~t; neither could I fee any other mark, though the
fand about it was as fufceptible to take impreffion, ds
that which was fo plainly ftarnped. Thus, ftruck with
confufion and horror, I returned to my habitation,
frightened at every built and tree, taking every thing
for men; and pofleffeJ with the wildeft ideas! That
night my eyes never clofed. I formed nothing but the
nicft difmal imaginations, concluding it muft be the?
mark of the devil's foot which I had feen. For other-
wife how could any mortal come to this ifland?
Where was the fhip that tranfported them? and what
figns of any other footfteps? Though thefe feemed
•very ftrong reafons for fuch a fuppofition, yet (thought
I) why fhould the devil make the print of his foot to-
no purpofe, as I can fee, when he might have taker*
other ways to have terrified me? Why mould he leave
his mark on the other fide of the ifland, and that too
on the fand, where the furging waves of the ocean
might foon have efafed the impreffion. Surely this
action is not confiftent with the fubtility of Satan, faid
I to myfelf; but rather muft be fome darfgerous crea-
ture, fome wild favage of the main land over againft
me, that, venturing too far in the ocean, has been
driven here, either by the violent currents or contrary
•winds; and not caring to flay on this ckfolate ifland,.
has gone back to fea again.
Happy indeed, thought I to myfelf, that none of the
favages had feen me in that place: yet I was not al-
together without fear, left, having found my boat,,
they -
•
they fhould return in humbers and devour me, or at
leaft carry away all my corn, and deftroy my flock of
tame goats. In a word, all my religious hopes vanifh-
ed, as though I thought God could not now protect
me by his power, who had fo wonderfully preferved
rne fo long.
What various chains of providence are there in the
life of man? How changeable are our affections, ac-
cording to different circumftances? We love to-day,
'what we hate to-merrow; we fhun one hour, what
we feek the next. This was evident in me in the mof
t
confpicuous manner: For I, who before had fo much
lamented my condition, in being banifhed from all
humankind, was now even ready to expire, when I
confidered that a man had fet his foot on this defolate
ifland. But, when I confidered my ftation of life, de-
creed by the infinitely wife and good providence of
God, that'! ought not to difpute my Creator's fove-.
reignty, who had an undoubted right to govern and
difpofe of his creatures as he thinks convenient; and
that his juftice and mercy, could either punifh or deli-
ver me: I fay, when I confidered all this, I comfort-
ably found it my duty to truft fincerely in him, pray
ardently to him, and humbly refign myfelf to his di-
vine will.
One morning, lying on my bed, thefe words of the
facred writings came again into my mind, Call upon
me in the day of troublet and I will deliver thee, and
thou Jhalt glorify trie.' Upon this fentence, rifing
more cheerfully from my bed, I offered up my pray-
ers in the moft heavenly manner: and, when I had
done, taking up my Bible to read, thefe words appear-
ed firft in my fight* Wait on the Lord, and be of good
cheer, and he JhallJirengthen thy heart: Waitt I fayt
on the Lord, Such divine comfort did this give me,
as to remove all caufe of fadnefs upon that occafion.
Thus, after a world of apprehenfions and fears, for
three days and nights, I at laft ventured out of my
G 3 cattle,
caftle, and milked my goats, one of which was almoffe
fpoiled for want of it. I next (though in great fear)*
vifited my bower, and milked my flocks there alfo ;.
when, growing bolder, I went down to the fhore again,
and meafuring the print of the foot to mine, to fee
perhaps whether I myfelf had not occafioned that
mark, I found it much fuperior in largenefs; and fo>
returned home, now abfolutely convinced, that either
fome men had been afhore, or that the ifland muft be
inhabited; and therefore that I might be furprifed be-
fore I was aware.
I now began to thing of providing for my fecurity,,
and revolved in my mind many different fchemes for
that purpofe. I firft propofed to cut down my inclo-
fures, and turn my tame cattle wild into the woods,,
that the enemy might not find them, and frequent the
ifland in hopes of killing the fame. Secondly, I was.
for digging up my corn fields for the very fame reafon.
And, lajlly, I concluded to demolifh my bower, left,,
feeing a place of human contrivance, they might come
farther, and find out and attack me in my little caftle.
Such notions did the fear of danger fuggeft to me$
and I looked, I thought, like the unfortunate king
Saul, when not only opprefled by the Philiftines, but
alfo forfaken by God himfelf. And, it is ftrange, that
a little before, having entirely refigned myfelf to the
•will of God, I fhould now have little confidence in
him, fearing thofe more who could kill this fading
body, than he who could deftroy my immortal foul.
Sleep was an utter ftranger to my eyes that night;
yet nature, fpent and tired, fubmitted to a filent re-
pofe the next morning. And then, joining reafon
•with my fear, I confidered, that this delightful and
pleafant ifland might not be fo entirely forfaken as I
might think; but that tke inhabitants from the o-
ther fhore might fail, either with defign, or from ne-
eeflity,. by crofs winds; and* if the latter circum-
ftance,
.1
ftance, I had reafon to believe they would depart the
firft opportunity. However, my fear made me think
of a place for retreat upon an attack. I now repent-
ed that I had made my door to come out beyond my
fortification"; to remedy which, I refolved to make
me a fecond one: I fell to work, therefore, and drove
betwixt that double row of trees, which I planted a-
bout twelve years before, feveral ftrong piles, thick-
ening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and
ftrengthening the foot of it with earth which I
dug out of my cave; I alfo made me feven holes,,
•wherein I planted my rnufkets like cannon, fitting
them into frames refembling carriages. This being,
finifhed with indefatigable induftry, for a great way
every where, I planted flicks of ofier like a wood, a-
bout twenty thoufand of them, leaving a large fpace
between them and my wall, that I might have room
to fee an enemy, and that they might not be fhekered
among the young trees, if they offered to approach
the outer wall. And, indeed, fcarce two years had
pafled over my head, when there appeared a lovely
fhady grove, and in fix years it became a thick wood
perfectly impamble. For my fafety I left no avenue
to go in or out; inftead of which I fet two ladders,
one to a part of the rock which was low, and then
broke in, leaving room to place another ladder upon
that; fo that when 1 took thole down, it was impof-
fible for any man to defcend without hurting himlelf;
and if they had, they would ftill be at the outfide of
my outer wall. But while I took all thefe meafures
of human prudence for my own prefervation, I was
not altogether unmindful of other affairs. To pre-
fecve my flock of tame goats, that the enemy fhould
not take all at once, I looked out for the moft retired
part of the ifland, which was the place where I had
loft myfelf before mentioned, and there finding a clear
piece of land, containing three acres, furrounded
with thick woods, I wrought fo hard, that, in lefs
than a month's time, I fenced it fo well round, that
my
my flocks were very well fecured in it, and I pot
therein two he-goats and ten fhe ones.
All this labour was occafioned purely by fearful
apprehenfionsj on account of feeing the .print of a
man's foot. And not contented yet with what I
had done, I fearched for another place towards the
"weft point of the ifland, where I might alfo retain
another flock. Then wandering on this errand more
to the weft of the ifland than ever I had yet done,
and cafting my eyes towards the fea, methought I
perceived a boat at a great diftance; but could not
poffibly tell what it was for want of my perfpe&ive
glafs. I confidered then it was no ftrange thing to fee
the print of a man's foot; and, concluding them can-
nibals, bleffed God for my being caft on the other fide
of the ifland, where none of the favages, as I thought,
ever came. But when I came down the hill to the
fhore, which was the S. W. point of the ifland, I wa*
foon confirmed in my opinion; nor can any one de-
fcribe my horror and amazement, when I faw the
ground fpread with fculls, hands, feet, and bones of
human bodies; and particularly, I perceived a fpace
like a circle, in the mid ft of which had been a fire,
about which I conjectured thefe wretches fat, and un-
naturally facrificed and devoured their fellow crea-
tures.
The horror and loathfomenefs of this dreadful fpec-
tacle, both confounded my fenfes, and made me dif-
charge from my ftomach in an exceffive manner. I
then returned towards my habitation ; and, in my way
thither, fhedding floods of tears, and falling down on
my bended knees, gave God thanks for making my
nature contrary to thefe wretches, and delivering me
fo long out of their hands.
Though reafon and my long refidence here had af-
fured me, that thefe favages never came up to the
thick woody parts of the country, and that 1 had no
reafon to be apprehenfive of a difcovery; yet fuch an
abhorrence
•
sWiorrence did I ftill retain, that, for two years after,
1 confined myfelf only to my three plantations; I
mean my caftle, country feat, and inclofure in the
•woods. And though, in proccfs of time, my dread-
ful appreherrfions began to wear away, yet my eyes
were more vigilant for fear of being furprifed, and I
was very cautious of firing my gun, left, being heard
by thofe creatures, they fhould proceed to attack me.
I refolved, however, manfully to lofe my life if they
did, aiid went armed with three piftols ftuck in my
girdle; which, added to the defcription I have given
of myfclf before,made me look with a very formidable
appearance.
Thus my circumftances for fc-me time remained
very calm and umliftmbed; and when I compared
my condition to others, I found it far from being
E'.iforsbis. And, indesd, would all perfons cortipnrs
their circumftances, not wkh thofe above them, but
with thoie innumerable unhappy obje£ts beneath
them, I am fure we fhould not hear thofe daily mur-
rnurings and complainings that are in the world.
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed, the
terror which the favages had put me in, fpoilect
fbme inventions for my own conveniencics. One of
my projects was to brew me fome beer; a very whimfi-
Cal one indeed, when it is confidered, that I had nei*
ther cafks fufficient, nor could \ make any to preferve
it in; neither had I hops to make it keep, yeft to>
make it work, nor a copper or kettle to make it
boil. Perhaps, indeed, after fome years, I might
bring this to bear, as I had done other things. But
now my inventions were placed another way; and
day and night I could think of nothing but, how I
might deftroy fome of theie cannibals, when pro-
ceeding to their bloody entertainments; and fo fa-
ving a victim from being facrificed, that he might af-
ter become my fervant. Many were my contrivan-
ces for this purpofe, and as many more obje£tions
occurred, after I hatched them. 1 once contri-
ved
ved to dig a hole under the place where they made
their fire, and put therein five or fix pounds of gun-
powder, which would confequently blow up all thofe
that were near it; but then I was loth to fpend" fo
much upon them, left it fhould not do that certain
execution I could defire, and but only affright, and
not kill them. Having laid this defign afide, I again
propofed to myfelf to lie privately in ambufh, in
fome convenient place, with my three guns double
loaded, and let fly at them in the mid ft of their
dreadful ceremony; and having killed two or three
of them at every fhot, fall upon the reft fuddenly with
my three piftols, and not let one mother's fon efcape.
This imagination pleafed my fancy fo much, that I
ufed to dream of it in the night time. To put my
defign in execution, I was not long feeking for a
place very convenient for my purpofe, where unfeen
I might behold every action of the favages. Here I
placed my two mu&ets, each of which was loaded
•with a brace of flugs, and four or five fmaller bul-
lets about the fize of piftol bullets; the fowling-
piece was charged with near a handful of the largeft"
fwan fhot; and in every piftol were about four bul-
lets. And thus all things being prepared, no fooner
would the welcome light fpread over the element,
but, like a giant refrejbcd -with -wine, as the fcripture
has it, would I iffue forth from my caftle, and from
a lofty hill, three miles diftant, view if I could fee
any invaders approach unlawfully to my kingdom.
But having waited in vain two or three months, it
not only grew very tirefome to me, but -brought ma
into fome confideration, and made me examine my-
felf, what right I had to kill thefe creatures in this
manner.
If (argued I to myfelf) this unnatural cuftom of
theirs be a fin offenfive to heaven, it belongs to the
divine Being, who alone has the vindictive power in
his hands, to fhower down his vengeance upon
.them. And perhaps he does fo, in making them be-
come
come one another's executioners. Or, if not, if God
thinks thefe doings juft, according to the knowledge
they conceive, what authority have-I to pretend to
thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted
thefe actions for fo many ages, perhaps from almoft the
beginning of the creation? They never offe-nded me;
•what right have I then to concern myfelf in their
fhedding one another's blood? And, indeed, I have
fince known, they value no more to kill and devour a
captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox, or eat
mutton. I then concluded, it neceflarily followed,
that thefe people were no more murderers then Chri-
ftians, who many times put whole troops to the fword,
after throwing down their arms. Again I confidered,
that if I fell upon them, I fhould be as much in the
wrong as the Spaniards, who had committed the
greateft barbarities upon thefe people who never had
offended them in their whole lives; as if the kingdom
of Spain was eminent for a race of men without com-
mon compaffion to the miferable, a principal fign of
the mofl. generous temper. Thefe confiderations
made me paufe, and brought me to think I had taken
\vrong meafures in my refolution; I now argued with
myfelf, that it was better for me never to attack, but
to remain undifcovered as long as poffibly I could;
that an oppofite conduct would certainly prove de-
ftructive; for, as it was fcarcely to be fuppofed I could
till ftsm all, I might either be overpowered by the
remaining, or that fome efcaping, might bring thou-
fands tomycertain deftru&ion. And,indeed,religion
took their part fo much as to convince me how contra-
ry it was to my duty to be guilty of fhedding human
blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they are
to one another; that I hid nothing to do with it, but
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I
faid before, to do therein what feemed convenient to
his heavenly wifdom. And, therefore, on my knees I
thanked the Almighty for delivering me from blood-
guiltinefs,
guiltinefs, and begged his protection that I might ne-
ver fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rafhly be-
gun, I never afcended the bill on that occafion after-?
wards; I only removed my boat, which lay on the Q-
ther fide of the ifland, and every thing that belonged
to her, towards the eaft, into a little cove, that there
might not be the leaft fhadow of difcovery of any boat
near, or habitation upon the ifland. My caftle then
became my cell, keeping always retired in it, except
when I went out to milk my fhe-goats, and order my
little flock in the wood, which was quite out of dan-
ger; for fure I was, that thefe favages never came
here with expectations to find any thing, and confe-
quently never wandered from the coaft; however, as
they might have feveral times been on fhore, as well
before as after my dreadful apprehenfions, I looked
back with horror to think in what ftate I might have
been, had I fuddenly met them flenderly armed, with
one gun only loaded with fmall fhot; and how great
would have been my amazement, if, inftead of feeing
the print of one man's foot, I had perceived fifteen or
twenty favages, who, having once fet their eyes upon
me, by the fwiftnefs of their feet, would have left
me no poffibility of efcaping? Thefe thoughts would
fink my very foul, fo that I would fall into a deep me-
lancholy, till fuch time as the confideration of my gra-
titude to the divine Being moved it from my heart.
I then fell into a contemplation of the fecret fprings
of Providence; and how wonderfully we are deliver-
ed, when infenfible of it; and when intricated in un-
certain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or hefuation, what
fecrethintdirecTrs us in the right way, when we intend-
ed to. go out of it; nay, perhaps, contrary to our.bu-
finefs, fenfe, or inclination. Upon which, I fixed with-
in me this as a certain rule, never to difobey thofe fe-
cret impreffions of mind, to the acting or not acting
any thing that offered, for which I yet could affign
no
po reafon. But let it be how it will, the advantage
of this conduct very eminently appeared in the lattei;
part of my abode on this ifland; I am a ftranger in
determining whence thefe fecret intimations of Pro-
vidence derive: yet methinks they are not only fomc
proof of the converfe of fpirits, but alfo of the fs-
cret communications they are fuppofed to have with,
thofe that have not paifed through the gloomy vals
of death. ,
Thefe anxieties of mind, and the care of my pre-
fervation, put a period to all future inventions an4
contrivances, either for accommodation or conveni-
ence. I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a
ftick, fire a gun, er make a fire, left either the noife
fhould be heard, or the fmoke difcover me. And on
this account I ufed to burn my earthen ware private-
ly in a cave which 1 found in the wood, and which.I
made convenient for that purpofe; the principal
caufe that brought me here was to make charcoal, fo
that I might bake and drefs my bread and meat with-
out any danger. At that time a curious accident hap-
pened me, which I fhall now relate.
While 1 was cutting down ibme wood for making
my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very
thick branch of underwood. Curious to look into it,
I attained its mouth, and perceived it fufficient for
me to fland upright in it. But when I had entered,
and took a further view, two rolling fhining eyes,
like flaming ftars, feemed to dart themfelves at me 5
fo that I made all the hafte out that I could, as not
knowing whether it was the devil or a nionfter that
had taken his refidence in that place. Whcn I re-
covered a little from my furprife, I called myfelf a
thoufand fools, for being afraid to fee the devil one
moment, who had now almoft lived twenty years in
the moll retired folitude. And therefore reluming
all the courage I had, Itook up a flaming firebrand, and
in I rumed again. I had not proceeded above three
fteps> when I was more affrighted-than before; fos
H 'then
then I heard a very loud figh, like that of a human
creature in the greateft agony, fucceeded with a bro-
ken noife, refembling words half exprefled, and then
a broken figh again. Stepping back, Lord! (thought
I to myfelf), where am I got? Into what inchanted
place have I plunged myfelf, fuch as are reported to
contain miferable'captives, till death puts an end to
their fprrow? And, indeed, in fuch a great amaze-
ment was I, that it ftruck me into a cold fwcat; and
had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair
would have moved it off. But again encouraging
myfelf with the hopes of God's protection, I pro-
ceeded forward, and, by the light of nay firebrand,
perceived it to be a monftrous he-goat, lying on the
ground, gafping for life, and dying of mere old age.
At firft I ftirred him, thinking to drive him out,
and the poor ancient creature ftrove to get upon his
feet, but was not able; fo I e'en let him lie ftill, to
affright the favages fnould they venture into this cave.
I now looked round me, and found the place but
fmall and fhapelefs. At the farther fide of it I per-
ceived a fort of an entrance, yet fo low, as muft
oblige me to creep on my hands and knees to it; fo,
having no candle, I fufpended my enterprife till the
next day, and then I came provided with two large
ones of my own making.
Having erept upon my hands and feet .through this
ftrait, 1 found the roof rofe higher up, I think about
twenty feet. But furely never mortal faw fuch a glo-
rious light before! The roof and walls of this cave
reflected a hundred thoufand lights to me from my
two candle), as though they were indented with
(hilling gold, precious Itones, or fparkling diamonds.
And indeed it was the moft delightful cavity or grot-
to of its kind that could be defired, though entirely
dark The floor was dry and level, and had a kind
of gravel upon it; no naufeous venomous creatures
to be feen there, neither any damp or wet about it. I
could find no fault but in the entrance, and 1 began
to
to think that even this might be very neceffary for
my defence, and therefore refolved to make it my
moft principal magazine. I brought hither two
fowling-pieces and three mufkets, leaving only five
pieces at my caftle, planted in the nature of cannon.
In a barrel of gun-powder, which I took up out of
the fea, I brought away about fixty pounds of good
powder, which were not damaged; and thefe, with
a great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed from
my caftle to this retreat, now fortified both by art
and nature.
I fancied myfelf now like one of the giants of old,
who were faid to live in caves and holes among the
rocks, inacceffible to any but themfelves, or, at leaft,
moft dangerous to attempt. And now I defpifed
both the cunning and ftrength of the favages, either
to find me out or to hurt me.
But I m.uft not forget the old goat, .who caufed my
late dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave
up the ghoft the day after my difcovery; and it being
very difficult to drag him out, I dug his grave, and
honourably intombed him in the fame place where
'he departed, with as ntuch ceremony as any Welch-
goat that has been interred about the high mountain
Penmenmoure;
I think I was now in the twenty-third year of my
reign, and my thoughts much eailer than formerly,
having contrived feveral pretty amufements and di-
verfions to pafs away the time in a pleafant manner.
By this time my pretty Poll had learned to fpeak
Englifh, and pronounce his words very articulately
and plain; fo that for many hours we ufed to chat
together after a very familiar manner, and he lived
with me no lefs than twenty-fix years. My dog, who
was nineteen years old, fixteen of which he lived with
me, died fometime ago of mere old age. As for my
cats, they multiplied fo faft, that I was forced to kill
or drive them into the woods, except two or three,
which became my particular favourites. Befides
H a thefe,
thefe, I continually kept two or three houfehold kids
about me, whom 1 did learn to feed out of my hand,
and two more parrots who could talk indifferently,
and call Robin (on Crufoe, but not fo excellently as
the firft, as not taking that pains with them. I had
alfo feveral fea-fowls which I had wounded and cut
their wings; and growing tame, they ufed to breed
among the low trees about my caftle-walls; all which
made my abode very agreeable.
But what unforefeen events fuddenly deftroy the
enjoyments of this uncertain ftate of life, when we
leaft expec~k them! It was now the month of Decem-
ber, in the fouthern folftice, and particular time of
my harveft, which required my attendance in the
fields; when going out pretty early one morning, be-
fore it was day-light, there appeared to me, from the
fea-fhore, a flaming light, about two miles from me,
at the eaft end of the ifland, where I had obferved
fome favages had been before, not on the other fide,
but to my great afffiction it was on my fide of the
ifland. s
Struck with a terrible furprife, and my ufual ap-
prebenfions, that the favages would perceive my im-
provements, I returned dire£U'y to my caftle, pulled
up the ladder after me, making all things look as wild
and natural zs poffibly 1 could. In the next'plaoe, I
put myfelf in a pofture of defence, loading my muf-
kets and piftols, and committing myfelf to God's
protection, I refolved to defend myfelf till my laft
breath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence,
I fet my ladder up to the fide of the hill, where there
vas a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after me,
afcended to the top, where laying mvfelf on my bel-
• ly, with my perfpeclive gbfs, I perceived nolefsthan
nine naked favages, fitting round a fmall fire, eating,
as I fuppofed, human flefh, with their two canoes
haled on fhore, waiting for the flood to carry them
off again. You cannot eafily exprefs the confterna-
tion I was in at this fight, efpecially feeing them near
• • me:
.me; but when I perceived their coming muft be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, 1 became more ea:-
fy in my thoughts, being very fully convinced, that I
might go abroad with feeurity all the time of flood,
if they were not before landed. And, indeed, this
proved juft as I imagined; for no fooner did they all
take boat and paddle away, but the tide made N. W.
Before they went off, they danced, making ridiculous
poftures and geftures, for above an hour, all ftark
naked; but whether men or women, or both, I could
not perceive. When I faw them gone, I took two guns
upon my fhoulders, and placing a ccnple of piliola
in my belt, with my great fword hanging by my fide,.
3 went to the hill, where at firft I made a difcovery
of thefe cannibals, and then faw there had been three
canoes more ef the favages on fhore at that place,
which, with the reft, were making ovor to the main!
land.
But nothing could be more horrid to mey when ga*--
ing to the place of facrifice,' the blood, the bones, and;'
other mangled parts of human bodies appeared in my
fight: and fo fired was I with indignation,, that I was
fully refolved to be revenged on the firft that came
there, though I loft my life in the execution. It
then appeared to me, that the vifits which they make
to this ifland are not very frequent, it being fifteen'
months before they came again: but Rill I was very
uneafy, by reafon of the difmal apprehenfions I had
of their furpriCng me unawares; nor dared I offer lev
fire a gun on that fide of the ifland where they ufcd
to appear, left, taking the alarm, the favages might
return with many hundred canoes, and then God
knows in what manner I fhould have made my end.
pih us was I a year or more before I faw any of thefe
devouring cannibals again.
liut to wave this, the following accident, which
demands attention, for a while, eluded the force of
my thoughts in revenging myfelf on thofe Heathens.
H 3
On the i6th of May (according to my wooden ca-
lendar) the wind blew exceeding hard, accompanied
with abundance of lightening and thunder all day,
and fucceeded by a very ftormy night. The feeming
anger of the heavens made me have recourfe to my
Bible. Whilft I was ferioufly pondering upon it, I
was fuddenly alarmed with the noife of a gun, which
I conjectured was fired upon the ocean. Strch an
nnnfual fnrprife made me ftart up in a minute, -when,
with my ladder afcending the mountain as before,
that very moment a flafh of fire prefaged the report
of another gun, which I prefently heard, and found
it was from that part of the fea where the current
drove me away. I could not but then think, that
this muft be a fhip in diftrefs, and that thefe were
the melancholy fignals for a fpeedy deliverance. Great,
indeed, was my forrow upon this occafion; but my
labours to affift them muft have proved altogether
vain and fmitlefs. 'However, I brought together all
the dry wood that was at hand, and making a pretty
large pile,, fet it on fire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun
as foon as it began to blaze, and after that feveral
more from the fame quarter. All night long I kept
up my fire; and when the air deared up, I perceived;
fomething a great way at fea, directly E. but
could not diftinguifh what it was, even with my
glafs, by reafon the weather was fo very foggy out
at fea. However, keeping my eyes dire£tly fixed up-
on it, and perceiving it not to ftir, I prefently conclu-
ded it muft be a fbip at anchor, and fo very hafty I
was to be fatisfied, that, taking my gun, I went to
tha 8. E. part of the ifland, to the fame rocks where
I had been formerly drove away by the current; in
whiph time the weather being perfectly cleared up,
to my great forrow, I perceived the wreck of a fhip
caft away upon thofe hidden rocks I found when I
was out with my boat; and- which, by making a
kind
kind of an eddy, were the occafion of my preferva-
tion.
Thus, what is one man's fafety is another's ruin;
for undoubtedly this fhip had been driven on them in
the night, the wind blowing ftrong at E. N. E. Had
they perceived the ifland, as I now guefled they had
not, certainly, inftead of having fired their guns for
help, they would rather have ventured in their boat,
and faved themfelves that way. I then thought, that
perhaps they had done fo, upon feeing my fire, and
were caft away in the attempt; for I perceived no
boat in the fhip. But then I again imagined, that,
perhaps, they had another veffel in company, which,
upon fignal, faved their lives, and took the boat up:
or that the boat might be driven into the main ocean,
where thefe poor creatures might be in the moft mife-
rable condition. But as all thefe conjectures were
very uncertain, I could do no more than commiferate
their diftrefs, and thank God for delivering me, in par-
ticular, when fo many perifhed in the raging ocean.
When I confidered ferioufly every thing concerning
this wreck, and could perceive no room tofuppofeany
of them faved, I cannot explain, by any poffible force
of words, what longings my foul felt upon this fight,
often breaking out in this manner: O that there had
been but two or three, nay even one perfon faved,
that we might have lived together, converfed with,
and comforted one another! And, fo much were my
defires moved, that when I repeated thefe words,
"Oh! that there had been but one!" my hands
•would fo clench together, and my fingers prefs the
palms of my hands fo clofe, that, Ivad any foft thing
been between, it would have crufhed it involuntarily
while my teeth would ftrike together, and fet againft
each other fo ftrong, that it required fome timefor me
to part them.
Till the lafl year of my being on this ifland, I ne-
. ver knew whether or not any had been faved out of
this
this fhip. I had the affli&ion, fometime after, to fee
the corpfe of a drowned boy come on fhore, at the
end of the ifland which was next the fhipovfeck; there
was nothing on him but a Teaman's waiftcoat, a pair
of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen fhirt j
but no particular mark to guefs what nation he was
of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight, and a to-
bacco pipe,, the laft of which I preferred much more
than I did the firft. And now the catrrtnefs of the fea-
tempted rr>e to-venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to- get fomething neseflary out of the fliip»
but, perhaps, foroe living creature might be on hoard,
whofe life I might preferve. This had fuch an influ-
ence upon-my mind, that immediately I went home,
and prepared every thing neceffary for the voyage,
carrying on board! my boat provifions of all forts, with
a good quantity of rumr frefh water, and a compafs:
ib putting off, I paddled the canoe along the fhore,
till I came at laJt to the north-eaft. part of the ifland,
from whence I was to launch into the ocean; but
here .the currents- ran fo violently, and appeared fo
terrible, that my heart began to- fail me; forefeeing,
that if I was driven into anyofthefe currents, I might
be carried not only out of the reach or fight of the
ifland, but even inevitably loft in the boiling, furges
ef the ocean.
So opprefled was I at thefe troubles, that I gave
over my enterprife, failing to a little creek on the
fhore, where, fteppingout, I fat me down on a rifing-
hill, very penfive and thoughtful. I then perceived
that the tide was turned, and the flood, came on,
•which made it impracticable for me to go out for fo
many hours. Ta be more certain how the fets of
the tides or currents lay when- the flood came in, I
afcended a higher piece of ground, which overlook-
ed the fea both ways; and htre I found, that as the
current of the ebb fet out clofe by the fouth point of
the ifland*. fo the current of the flood fet in clofe by
the fhore of the north iidc,; and all that I had to
dOj,
do, was to keep to the north of the ifland in my re*
turn.
That night I repofed myfelf in my canoe, covered
•with my watch-coat inftead of a blanket, the heavens
being my tefter. I fet out with the firft of the tide
full north, till I felt the benefit of the current, which
carried me at a great rate eaftward, yet not with fuch
impetuofity as before, as to take from me all govern-
ment of my canoe; fo that in two hours time I came
up to the wreck, which appeared to me a moft me-
lancholy fight. It feemed to be a Spanifh veffel by
its building, fluck fafl between two rocks; her ftern
and quarter beaten to pieces by the fca; her mainmaft
and fotemaft were brought off by the board; that is,
broken fhort off. As 1 approached nearer, I percei-
vfd a dog on board, who, feeing me coming, yelped
and cried; and no fooner did I call him, but the poor
creature jumped into the fea, out of which I took
him up, almoft famifhed with hunger and thirft; fo
that when I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous
•wolf eould devour it more greedily: and he drank to
that degree of frem water, that he would have burft
himfelf, had I fuffered him.
The firft fight I met with in the fhip, were two
men drowned in the cook-room or forecaftle, inclo-
fed in one another's arms: hence I very probably
fuppofed, that when the veffel ftruck in the ilorm,
fo high and inceflantly did the waters break in and
over her, that the men, not being able to bear it,
were ftrnnglcd by the conftant rufhiug in of the
waves. There were feveral calks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I could not be pofitive, which lay in
the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the
ebbing out of the water, yet were too large for me to
pretend to meddle with: likewife, I perceived feveral
chefts, which I fuppofed to belong to the feamen,
two of which I got into my boat, without exami-
ning what was in them. Had the ftern of the flap
fixed, and the fore part broken off, I fhould
have
have made a very profperous voyage •, fince, by what
I after found in thefe two chefts, I could not other-
wife conclude, but that the fliip muf t have abundance
of wealth on board; nay, if I muf t guefs by the courfe
fhe fteered, fhe muft have been bound from the Bue-
nos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the fouthern
part of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havan-
nah, in the gulph of Mexico, and fo perhaps to Spain.
What became of the reft of her failors, I could not cer-
tainly tell; and all Her riches figaitied nothing at that
time to any "body.
Searching farther, I found a cafkj containing a~
bout twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with
fome labour, I got into my boat; in a cabin were
feveral mufkets, which I let remain there; but took
away with me a great powder horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it. I took aHb a fire fhovel
and tongs, two brafs kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a grid-iron; all which were ex-
tremely neceffary to me, efpecially the fire fhovel and
tongs. And fo with this cargo, accompanied with
my dog, I came away, the tide fcrving for that pur-
pofe; and the fame evening, about an hour within
night, I attained the ill,mil, after the greateft toil and
fatigue imaginable.
That night I repofed my wearied limbs in the
boat, refolving the r. ext morning to harbour what I
had gotten in my new-found fubterraneous grotto;
ancj not carrying my cargo home to my ancient ca-
ftle. Having refrefhed myfelf, and got all my ef-
fects on fhore, I next proceeded to examine the par-
ticulars; and fo tapping the cafk, I found the liquor
to be a kind of a rum, but not like what we had at
the Brazils, nor indeed near fo good. At the open-
ing of the cheft, feveral things appeared very ufefal
to me; for inftance, I found in one a very fine cafe
of bottles, containing the finer! and bef t forts of cor-
dial waters; each bottle held about three pints, cu-
rioufly tipt with filver. I found alfo two pots full
\ of
of the choiceft fweetmeats, and two more which the
water had utterly fpoiled. There were likewife fe-
veral good fhirts, exceeding welcome to me, and a-
feout one dozen and a half of white linen hanker-
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of which
were abfolutely neceffary for wiping my face in a hot
day; and, in the till, I found three bags of pieces of
eight, about eleven hundred in all, in one of which,
decently wrapt up in a piece of paper, were fix dou-
bloons of gold, and feme fmall bars and wedges of
the fame metal, which I believe .might weigh near a
pound. In the other cheft, which I gueffed to belong
to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumftances that
attended it, I only found fome clothes of very little
value, except about two pounds of fine glazed powder,
in three flafks, kept, as I believe, for charging their
fowling-pieces on any occafion; fo that, on the whole,
I had no great advantage by this voyage. The mo-
ney was indeed as mere dirt to me, ufelefs and un-
profitable, all which I would have freely parted with
for two or three Engjifh pair of fhoes and ftockings,
things that for many years I had not worn, except
lately thofe which I had taken off the feet of thofe un-
fortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, yet not
fo good as Englifh fhoes, either for eafe or fervice. I
alfo found in the feaman's cheft about fifty pieces of
eight in rials, but no gold; fo concluded riiat what I
took from the firft belonged to an officer, the latter
appearing to have a much inferior perfon for its own-
er. However, as defpicable as the money feemedy I
likewife lugged it to my cave, laying it up fecurely,
as I did the reft of my cargo; and after 1 had done
all this, I returned back to my boat, rowing or pad-
dling her along till I came to my old harbour, where
I carefully laid her up, and fo made the beft of my
way to my cartle. When I arrived there, every thing
feemed fafe and quiet; fo that now my only bufinefs
was to repofe myfelf after my wonted manner, and
take
take care of my domeftic affairs. But though I might
have lived very eafy, as wanting for nothing abfolute-
ly needful; yet ftill I was more vigilant than ufual
upon account of the favages, never going much a-
broad; or, if I did, it was to the eaft part of the ifland,
•where I was well allured that the favages never came,
and where I might not be troubled to carry that heavy
load of weapons for my defence, as I was obliged to
do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in
all which time, contrary to my former refolutions, my
head was filled with nothing but projects and defigns,
how I might efcape from this ifland ; and fo much were
my wandering thoughts bent on a rambling difpofi-
tion, that had I had the fame boat that I went from
Sallee in, I fhould have ventured once more to the
uncertainty of the raging ocean.
I cannot however but confider myfelf as one of the
unhappy perfons, who make themfelves wretched by
their diflatisfaction with the fhtions which God has
placed them in; for, not to take a review of my pri-
mitive condition, and my father's excellent advice,
(the going contrary to which was, as I may fay, my
original fin], the following miftakes of the fame na-
ture certainly had been the means of my prefent un-
happy ftation. What butinefs hacl I to leave a fettled
fortune, and well flocked plantation, improving and
increafing, where", by this time, I might have been
worth a hundred thoufand moidores, to turn fuper-
cargo to Cuinea, to fetch negroes, when time and
patience would have fo much enlarged my flock at
home, as to be able to employ thofe whofe more im-
mediate bufinefs it was to fetch them home, even to
my own door?
But as this is commonly the fate of young heads,
fo a fc'rious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily
attends the exercife of future years, when the dear-
bought experience of time teaches us repentance.
Thus was it with me; but notwithftanding the
thoughts
• Jus.

thoughts of my deliverance ran fo ftrongly in my
mind, that it feemed to check all the di£tates of rea-
fon and philofophy. And now to ufher in my kind
reader with great pleafure to the remaining part of
my relation, I flatter myfelf it will not be taken a-
mifs, to give him an account of my firft conceptions
of the manner of efcaping, and upon what foundation
I laid my foolifh fchemes.
Having retired to my caftle, after my late voyage
to the fhip, my frigate laid up and fecured, as ufual,
and my condition the fame as before, except being
richer, though I had as little occafion for riches as
the Indians of Peru had for gold, before the cruel
Spaniards came among them: One night in March,
being the rainy fealbn, in the four and twentieth
year of my folitude, I lay down to fleep, very well
in health, without diftemper, pain, or uncommon
uneafinefs, either of body or mind; yet notwith-
ftanding, I could not compofe myfelf to fleep all the
night long. All this tedious while, it is impoffiblc
to exprefs what innumerable thoughts came into my
head. I traced quite over the whole hiftory of my
life in miniature, from my utmoft remembrance of
things till I came to this ifland; and then proceeded
to examine every action and paflage that had occurred
fince I had taken pofleffion of my kingdom. In my
reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the
happy pofture of my afiairs in the beginning of
my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear, and concern,
fince I had difcovered the print of a foot in the fand;
that while I continued without appprehenfion, I was
incapable of feeling the dread and terror I now fuf-
fered. How thankful rather ought I to have been
for the knowledge of my danger, fince -the greateft
happinefs one can be Dofleffed of is to have fufficient
time to provide againft it? How ftupendous is the
goodnefs of providence, which fets fuch narrow
bounds to the fight and knowledge of human nature,
I i that
that while men walk in the midft of fo many dangers
they are kept ferene and calm, by having the events
of things hid from their eyes, and knowing nothing
of thofe many dangers that furround them, till per-
haps they are diffipated and vanifli away.
When I came more particularly to confider of the
real danger I had for fo many years efcaped; how I
had walked about in the greateft fecurity and tran-
quility, at a time, perhaps, when even nothing but
the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the common ap-
proach of night, had interpofed between me and the
deftru£r.ive hands of the cannibals, who would devour
me with as good an appetite, as I would a pigeon
or curlieu; furely all this, 1 fay, could not but make
me fincerely thankful to my great Preferver, whofe
Cngular protection I acknowledged with the greateft
humility, and without which I muf t inevitably have
fallen into the cruel hands of thofe devourers.
Having thus difcufled my thoughts in the cleared
manner, according to my weak underftanding, I
next proceeded to confider the wretched nature of
thefe deftroying favages, by feeming, though with
great reverence, to enquire, why God fhould give
up any of his creatures to fuch inhumanity, even to
brutality itfelf, to devour its own kind? But as this
was rather matter of abftrufe fpeculation, and as my
miferable fituation made me think this of mine the
moft uncomfortable fituation in the world, I then
began rather to enquire what part of the world thefe
wretches lived in; how far oil' the coaft was from
whence they came; why they ventured over fo far
from home; what kind of boats conveyed them hi-
ther; and why 1 could not order myfelf and my bu-
finefs fo, that I might be as able to attain their coun-
try, as they were to come to my kingdom?
But then, thought I, how fliall 1 manage myfelf
when I come thither? what will become of me if
I fall into the hands of the favages? or how fhall I
efcape from them, if they make an attempt upon me?
and
and fuppofing I mould not fall into their power, what
will I do for provifion, or which way fhall I bend my
courfe! Thefe counter-thoughts threw me into the
greateft horror and confufion imaginable; but then
I ftill looked upon my prefent condition to be the
moft miferable that poffibly could be, and that nothing
could be worfe, except death. For (thought I) could
I but attain the fhore of the main, I might perhaps
meet with fome relief, or coaft it along, as I did with
my boy Xury, on the African fhore, till I came to
fome inhabited country, where I might meet with
fome relief, or fall in with fome Chriftian fhip that
might take me in; and if I failed, why then I could
but meet with death, which would put an end to all
my miferies. Thefe thoughts, I muft confefs, were
the fruit of a diftempered mind, an impatient temper
made defperate, as it were, by long continuance of
the troubles and the difappointments I had met with
in the wreck, where I hoped to have found fome living
perfon to fpeak to, by whom I might have known ifi
what place I was, and of the probable means of my
deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated,
my refignation to the will of heaven was entirely fuf-
pended; fo that I had no power to fix my mind to any
thing, but to the project of-a voyage to the main
land. And indeed fo much was I inflamed upon this
account, that it fet my blood into a ferment, and my
pulfe beat high, as though I had been in a fever, till
nature being, as it were, fatigued and exhaufted with
the very thoughts of it, made me fubmit myfelf to a
CJent repofe.
Jn fuch a fituation, it is very ftrange, that I did not
dream of what I was fo intent upon; but, inftead of
it, my mind" roved on a quite different thing, altoge-
ther foreign. I dreamed, that as I was ifluing from
my caftle, one morning, as cuftomary, 1 perceived
upon the fhore, two canoes, and eleven favages, co-
ming to land, who had brought with them another In-
dian, whom they defigned to make a facrifice of, in
I a order
order to devour; but juft as they were going to give
the fatal blow, methought the poor defigned victim
jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick
grove before my fortification, to abfcond from his e-
nemies; when perceiving that the others did not fol-
low him that way, I appeared to him; that he hum-
bly kneeled down before me, feeming to pray for my
affiftance; upon which I Chewed^ him my ladder,
made him afccnd, carried him to my cave, and he
became my fervant; and when I had gotten this man,
I faid to myfelf, Now furely I may have fome hopes to
attain the main-land; for this fellow will ferve me as
a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I muft go for
provifions; what places, to fhun, what to .venture to,
and what to efcape. But when I awaked, and found
all thefe inexpreffible impreffions of joy entirely va-
nifhed, 1 fell into the greateft dejection of fpirit ima-
ginable.
Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that onefure
way of efcaping was to get a favage; that after I had
ventured my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws
of liis devourers, the natural fenfe he might have of
fuch a prefcrvatioh, might infpire him with a lafting
gratitude and moft fincere affection. But then this
objection reafonably interpofed: How can I effect
this (thought i) without I attack a whole caravan of
them, and kill them all? why mould I proceed on fuch
a defperate attempt, which my fcruples before had
fuggefted to be unlawful? and indeed my heart trem-
bled at the thoughts of fo much blood, tho' it were a
means to procure my deliverance. 'Pis true, I might
reafonably enough fuppofe thefe men to be real enemies
to my life, men who would devour me, was it in their
power; fo that it was felf-prefervation in the highefr.
degree to free myfelf, by attacking them in my own de-
. fence, as lawfully as if they were actually afiaulting
me: though all thefe things, I fay, feemed to me to be
of the greateft weight, yet, as I juft faid before, the
dreadful
dreadful thoughts of fhedding human Mood, ftruck
fiich a terror to my foul, that it was a long time be-
fore I could reconcile myfelf to it.
But how far will the ardency of defire prompt us
on? For, notwithftanding the many difputes and
perplexities I had with myfelf, I at length refolved,
right or wrong, to get one of thefe favages into my
hands, cod what it would, or even though I fhould
lofe my life in the attempt. Infpifed with this firm
refolution, I fet all my wits at work, to find out
what methods I fhould take to anfwer my defign:
this, indeed, was fo difficult a tafk, that I could not
pitch upon any probable means to execute it: I,
therefore, refolved continually to be in a vigilant po-
fture, to perceive when the favages came on fhore,
and to leave the reft to the event, let the opportuni-
ties offer as they would.
Such were my fixed refolutions; and accordingly
I fet myfelf upon the fcout, as often as I could, till
fuch time as 1 was heartily tired of it. I waited for
above a year and a "half, the greatefl part of which
time I went out to the weft, and fouth weft corner
of the ifland, almoft every day, to look for canoes;
but none appeared. This was a very great difcou-
ragement; yet, though I was very much concerned,
'the edge of my defire was as keen as ever, and the
longer it feemed to be delayed, the more eager was
I for it: in a word, I never before was fo careful to
fhun the loathing fight of thefe favages, as I was
no\v eager to be with them: and I thought myfelf
fufficiently able to manage one, two, or three fava-
ges, if I had them, fo as to make them ^ny entire
flaves, to do Vhatfoever I fhould direct them, and
prevent their being able at any time to do me a mif-
chief. Many times did I ufe to pleafe myfelf with
thefe thoughts, with long and ardent expectations;
but nothing prefenting, all my deep proje£ted
fchemes, and numerous fancies, vanifhed away, as
though, while I retained fuch thoughts, the decree
I 3 ~ of
of Providence was fuch, that no favages were to
come near me.
About a year and a half after, when I was ferioufly
mufing of functry other ways how I fhould attain my
end, one morning early I was very much furprifed by
feeing no lefs than five canoes all on fhore together on
my fide the ifland, and the favages that belonged to'
them all landed, and out of my fight. Such a num-
ber of them difconcerted all my meafures ; for, feeing
fo many boats, each of which would contain fix, and
fometimes more, I could not tell what to think of it,
or how to order my meafures, to attack twenty or
thirty men fingle handed: upon which, much difpL-
rited and perplexed, I lay ftill in my caftle; which,
however, 1 put in a proper pofture for an attack; and,
having formerly provided all that was necefiary, was
foon ready to enter upon an engagement, fhould they,
attempt it. Having waited for fome time, my impa-
tient temper would let me bear it no longer; I fet my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as ufual, afcend-
ed up to the top of the hill at two ftages, Handing,,
however, in fuch a manner, that my head did not ap-
pear above the hill, fo that they could not eafily per-
ceive me : .and here, by the affiftance of my perfpeo
tive glafs, I obferved no lefs than thirty in number,
around a fire, feafting upon what meat they had dreff-
ed: how they cooked it, or what it was, I could not
then perfectly tell j but they were all dancing and>
capering about the flames, ufmg many frightful and-
barbarous geftures.
But while, with a curious eye, I was beholding thefe
•wretches, my fpirits funk within me, when I percei-
ved them drag two miferable creatures from the boats*
to act afrefh the dreadful tragedy, as I fuppofed they
had done before. It was not long before one of them
fell upon the ground, knocked down, as I fuppofe,
with a club or wooden fword, for that was their man-
ner; while two or three others went immediately to
work, cutting him open for their cookery, and then
fell.
to devour him as they had done the former;
•while the laft unhappy captive was left by himfelf, till
fach time as they were ready for him. The poor
creature looked round him with a wifhful eye, trem-
bling at the thoughts of death; yet, feeing himfelf a
little at liberty, nature, that very moment, as it were,
infpired him with hopes of life: He ftarted away from
them, and raft, with incredible fwiftnefs, along the
fands, direclly to that part of the coaft where my an-
cient and venerable caftle flood.
You may well imagine, I was dreadfully affrighted,.
upon this occalion, when, as I thought, they purfued
him in a whole body, all running towards my palace.
And now, indeed, I expected, that part of my dream
was goingtobe fulfilled, and that he wo'uld certainly
fly to my grove for protection; but, for the reft of
my dream, I could depend nothing on it, that the fa-
y-ages would purfue him thithers and find him there..
However, my fpirits beginning to recover, I ftill kept,
upon my guard; and I now plainly perceived, there
were but three men out of the number that purfued:
him. I was infinitely pleafed with what fwifcnefs the
poor creature ran from his purfuers, gaining fo much,
ground of them,- that I plainly perceived, could he
thus hold it for half an hour, there was not the leaft
doubt but he would fave his life from the power of his.
enemies.
Between them and my caftle there was a creek, that
very fame which I failed into with all my effects from
the wreck of the ship, on the fteep banks of which I
very much feared the poor viclim would be taken, if
he could not fwim for his efcape': But foon was-I out
of pain for him, when .1 perceived he made nothing
of it, though at full tide, but, with an intrepid cou-
rage, fpurred on by the fenfe of danger, he plunged
into the flood, fwimming over in about thirty ftrokes,
and then landing, ran with the fame incredible ftrength
and fwiftnefs as before. When the three purfuert
Cams to the creek, one of them, who I perceived
could
could not fwim, (happily for his part), returned back
to his company) while the others, with as equal cou-
rage, but much lefs fwiftnefs, attained the other fide,
as though they were refolved never-to give over their
purfuit. And now or never I thought was the time
for me to procure me a fervant, companion, or affift-
ant; and that I was decreed by Providence to be the
inftrument that fhould fave this poor creature's life. J
immediately defcended my two ladders with the great-
eft expedition; I took up my two guns, which, I faid:
before, were at the bottom of them: and, getting upa-
gain with the fame hafte towards the hill, I made near-
er the fea. In a word, taking a fhortcut down the hill.
I interpofed between the purfuers and purfued, halloo-
ing aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back,
was, no doubt, at firft, as much terrified at me as I at
them. I beckoned to him, with my hand, to return
back, in the mean time advancing towards the pur-
fuers, and rufhing on the foremoft, I knocked hint
down with the flock of my piece, and laid him flat
on the ground. I was very unwilling to fire, let the
reft fhould hear, though, at that diftance, I queftioned
whether they could or no; and, being out of fight of
the fmoke, they could not eafily have known what to
make of it. The other favage feeing his fellow fall,
flopped as if he had been amazed; when, advancing
towards him, I could perceive him take his bow from
his back, and, fixing an arrow to it, was preparing to
fhoot at me, and, without difpute, might have lodged
the arrow in my breaft; but, in this abfolutely ne-
ceflary cafe of felf-prefervation, I immediately fired
at him, and fliot him dead, juft as his hand was going
to draw the fatal firing. All this while, the favage who
had fled before ftood ftill, and had the fatisfaction to
fee his enemies killed, as he thought, who defigned
to take away his life: fo affrighted was he with the
fire and noife of my piece, that he ftood as it were
like Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without either
fenfe or motion. This obliged me to halloo to him
.again,
again, making the plaineft figns I could to him to draw
nearer. I perceived he underftood thefe tokens by his
approaching to me a little way, when, as if afraid I
mould kill him too, he flopped again. Several times
did he advance, and as often flop in this manner, till,
coming more to ray view, I perceived him trembling,
as if he was to undergo the fame fate. Upon which
I looked upon him with a fmiling countenance, and
ftill beckoning to him;.at length he came clofe to me,
and kneeled down, kifled the, ground, laid his head
upon it, and taking me by the foot, fet it upon
his head: and this, as I underftood afterwards, was
a token of fwearing to be my flave for ever. I took
him up, and, making much of him, encouraged him
in the beft manner I could. But my work was not
yet finifhed; for I perceived the favage whom I knock-
ed down, was not killed, but ftunned with the blow,
• Snd began to come to himfelf. Upon which I pointed
to my new fervant,. and mewing him that his enemy
was not yet expired, he fpoke fome words to me, but
•which I could not underftand; yet being the firft
found of a man's voice I had heard for above twenty-
five years, they were very pleafing to me. But there
was no time for reflection now, the wounded favage
recovering himfelf fo far as to fit upon the ground,
which made my poor prifoner as much afraid as be-
fore; to put him out of which fear, I p^efented my o-
ther gun at the man, with an intent to fhoot him; but
my favage, for fo I muft now call him, prevented my
firing, by making a motion to me, to lend him my
fword, which hung naked in a belt by my fide. No
fooner did I grant his requeft, but away he runs to his
enemy, and at one blow cut off his head as dexterouf-
ly as the moft accomplifhed executioner in Germany
could have done: for, it feems, thefe creatures make ufe
of wooden fwords made of hard wood, which will bear
edge enough to Cut off heads and arms at one blow.
When this valorous exploit was done, he comes to me
laugh-
laughing, as a token of triumph, delivered me my
fword again, with abundance of furprifing geftures,
laying it along, with the bleeding and ghaftly head of
the Indian at my feet.
The greateft aftonifhment that my new fervant con-
ceived, was the manner of killing the favage at fuch a
diftance, without a bow and arrow: and fuch was his
longing defire to know it, that he firft pointed to the
dead carcafe, and then made figns to me to grant him
leave to go to him. Upon which I bid him go, and,
as well as I could, made him fenfible I granted his
requeft. But when he came there, how wonderfully
was he ftruck with amazement! Firft he turned him
on one fide, then on another, wondering he could
perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding inwardly:
and after fufficiently admiring the wound the bullet
had made in his breaft, he took up his bow and arrows,
and came back again; upon which I turned to go a-
•way, making many figns to him to follow, left the
reft miffing their companions, might come in purfuit
of him. And this I found he underftood very well,
by his making me underftand that his defign was to
bury them, that they might not be feen if it happen-
ed; and which by figns again I made him fenfible I
very much approved of. Immediately he fell to work,
and never was grave-digger more dexterous in the
world than he was; for in an inftant, as 1 might fay,
he fcraped a large hole in the fands with his hands,
fufficient to bury the firft in; there he dragged him,
and without any ceremony he covered him over; in
like manner he ferved the other: fo that I am fure no
undertaker could be more expert in his bufmefs; for
all this was done in lefs than a quarter of an hour. I
then called him away, and inftead of carrying him
direclly to my caftJe at firft, I conveyed him to my
cave on the farther part of the ifland: and fo my
dream was not fulfilled in that particular, that my
grove fhould prove an afylum or fanctuary to him.
Weary
Weary and faint, hungry and thirfty, undoubted-
ly muft this poor creature be, fupported chiefly by
that vivacity of fpirit, and uncommon tranfports of
joy that his deliverance occafioned. Here I gave him
bread and a hunch of raifins to eat, and water to
drink, on which he fed very cheerfully, to his exceed-
ing refrefhment. I then made him a convenient bed,
with a parcel of rice ftraw, and a blanket upon it, (a
bed which I ufed myfelf fometimes), and then point-
• ing to it, made figns for him to lie down to fleep, up-
on which the poor creature went to take a welcome
repofe.
Indeed he was a very comely handfome young fel-
low, extremely well made, with ftraight long limbs,
not too large, tall and well fhaped, and, as near as I
could reckon, about twenty-fix years of age. His
countenance had nothing in it fierce or furly, but
rather a fort of majefty in his face; and yet, efpe-
cially when he fmiled, he had all the fweetnefs and
foftnefs of an European. His hair was not curled
like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and
black, with the moft beautiful, yet carelefs, trefles
fpreading over his fhoulders. He had a very high
and large forehead, with a great viv;city and fpark-
ling fIrarpnefs in his eyes. His fkin was not fo tawny
as the Virginians, Brazilians, or other Americans;
but rather of a bright dun olive colour, that had
fomething agreeable in it, though not very eafy to
give a def'cription of. His face was round and plump,
with a fniall nofe, very different frcm the flatnefs of
the negroes, a pretty fmall mouth, thin lips, fine
teeth, very weil fet, and white as the driven fnow.
In a word, fuch handfome features, and exact fym-
mctry in every part, made me confider, that I had
faved the life of an Indian prince, no lefs graceful
and accomplifhcd than the great Oroonoko, whofe
memorable behaviour and unhappy contingencies of
life have charmed the world, both to admiration of
his perfon, and compaffion to his fufferings.
But
But let him be either prince or 'peafant, all my
happinefs centered in this, that I had now got a good
fervant or companion, to whom, as he deferved, I
was refolved to prove a kind mafter and lafting
friend. He had not, I think, flept above an hour,
•when he awakened again, and while I was milking
my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards
me in my inclofure, and laying himfelf down on the
ground in the loweft proftration, made all the antic
geflures imaginable, to exprefs his thankfulnefs to
me for being his deliverer. I confefs, though the
manner of his behaviour feemed to be ludicrous e-
riough to occafion laughter; yet I wai very much
moved at his affection, fo that my heart melted with-
in me, fearing he might die away in excefs of joy,
like reprieved malefactors; efpecially as I was inca-
pable either to let him blood, or adminifter phyfic.
It were to be wifhed, that Chriftians would take ex-
ample by this Heathen, to have a lafting remem-
brance of the benefits and deliverances they have re-
ceived,*by the kind mediation and powerful interpo-
fition of their benefactors and deliverers; and, it
would likewife be happy for mankind, were there no
occafion to blame many, who, inftead of thankfully
acknowledging favours and benefits, rather abufe and
contemn thofe who have been the inftruments to fave
them from definition.
But, leaving thefejuft reflections, I return to the
'object that occafioned them; for my man, to con-
clude the Lift ceremony of obedience, laid down his
head again on the ground, clofe to my foot, and fet
my other foot upon his head, as he had done before,
making all the figns of fubjection, fervitude, and fub-
miffion imaginable, to let me underftand he would
ferve me as long as his life endured. As I under-
ftood him in many things, I made him fenfible 1 was
very well pleafed with him; and, in a little time, I
began to fpeak to him, and learn him how to talk
to me again. In the firft place, I made him un-
derftand
derftand his name was to be Friday, becaufe it was
upon that day I faved his life: then I taught him to
fay Mailer, which I made him fenfible was to be my
name. I likewife taught him to fay Yes and No,
and to know what they meant. I gave him fome
milk in an earthen pot, making him view me while
I drank it before hirn, and foaked my bread in it; I
gave him a cake of bread, and caufed him foak it like-
wife, to which he readily confented, making figns of
the greateft fatisfactien imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there; but no fooner
did the morning light appear, when I ordered him to
arife, and come along with me, with certain tokens
that I would give him fome clothes like mine, at which
he feemed very glad,~ being ftark naked, without the
leafl covering whatever. As we paffed by the place
where the two men had been interred, my man pointed
directly to their graves, fhewing me the marks that he.
had made to find them again, giving me to underftand,
by figns, that we mould dig them up, anddevourthem.,
At this I appeared extremely difpleafed, exprefled my
utmoft abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the apprehen-
fions of it, beckoning with my hand to come away,
which he did with the greateft reverence and fubmif-
Con. After this I conducted him to the top of the hill,
to view if the reft of the favages were yet remaining
there ; but when I looked through my perfpe£Hveglafs,
I could fee no appearance of them, nor of their canoes;
fb that it was very evident they never minded their de-
ceafed companions whom we had flain; which if they
had, they would furely have fearched for, or left one
boat behind for them to follow, after they returned,
from their purfuit.
Curiofity, and a defire of fatisfaction, animating me
with courage to fee this fcene of barbarity, I took my
man Friday with me, putting a f^ord' into his hand,
with the bow and arrows at his back, which I per-
ceived he could ufe very dextroufly,. caufing him to
K cany
carry one gun for me, and I two for myfelf; and
thus equipped againft all attacks, away we marched
directly to the place of their bloody entertainment.
But when I came there, I was ftruck with the utmoft
horror at fo dreadful a fpectacle, whilft Friday was
no way concerned about it, being no doubt in his
turn one of thefe devourers. Here lay feveral hu-
man bones, there feveral pieces of mangled flefh,
half eaten, mangled and fcorched, whilft ftreams of
blood ran promifcuoufly as waters from a fountain.
As I was mufing on this dreadful fight, Friday took
all the pains he could, by particular figns, to make
me underfland, that they had brought over four
prifoners to feaft upon, three of whom they had
eaten up, and that he was the fourth, pointing to
himfelf: that there having been a bloody battle be-
tween them and his great king, in the juft defence
of whom he was taken prifoner, with many others;
all of thefe were carried off to different places, to be
devoured by their conquerors; and that it was his
misfortune to be brought hither by thefe wretches
for the fame purpofe.
After I was made fenfible of thefe things, I caufed
Friday to gather thofe horrid remains, and lay them
together upon a heap, which I ordered to be fet on
fire, and burnt them to afhes: my man, however, ftill
retained the nature of a cannibal, having a hanker-
ing ftomach after fome of the flefh: but fuch an
extreme abhorrence did I exprefs at the leaft appear-
ance of it, that he durft not but conceal it: for I
made him very fenfible, that if he offered any fuch
thing, I would certainly fhoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to my
caftle, and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which
I had taken out of the poor gunner's, cheft before
mentioned; and which, with a little alteration, fitted
him very well: in the next place, I made him a jer-
kin of goat-fkin, fuch as my fkill was able to ma-
nage, and indeed I thought myfelf then a tolerable
good
good tailor. I gave him alfo a cap, which I made
of a hare's fkin, very convenient and fafhionable.
Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man was "no
lefs proud of his habit, than I was in feeing him in
it. Indeed he went very awkwardly at firft, the
drawers being too heavy on his thighs, not ufed to
bear any weight, and the fleeves of the waiftcoat
failed his moulders, and the inGde of his arms; but
y a little eafing where he complained they hurt him,
and by ufing hunfelf to them, at length he took to
them very well.
My next concern was, where I fhould lodge him:
and that I might do well by him, and yet be perfect-
ly eafy myfelf, I ercifled a tent for him in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in the infide of
the laft, and the outfide of the firft: and as there was
an entrance or door into my cave, I made a formal
framed door-cafe, and a door to open on the inGde;
I barred it up in the night time, taking in my lad-
ders too, fo that, was my man to prove treacherous,
there could be no way to come at me in the infide of
my innermoft wall, without making fo much noife in
fetting over, that it mutt-needs waken me; for my
rft wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, fpreading over my tent, and leaning up to the
fide of the mountain, which was again laid crofs
with fmaller fticks inftead of laths, and thatched over
a great thicknefs with the rice ftraw, which \vas as
ftrong as reeds; and at the hole of the place, left on
purpofe to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a
kind of a trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outfide, would not have opened at all, but have
fallen down, and made a great noife; and as to my
weapons, every night 1 took them all to my bed fide.
But there was no occafion for this precaution; for
furely never mafler had a more fincere, faithful, and
loving fervant than Friday proved to me. Without
paffiofi, fullennefs, or defign, perfectly obliging and
K i engaging,
engaging, his affections were as much tied to me, 39
thofe of a child to his parents; and I might venture to
fay, he would have facrificed his life for the faving
mine, upon any occafion whatfoever. And indeed
the many teftimonies he gave me of this, fufficiemly
convinced me that I had no occafion to ufe thefe pre-
cautions. And here I could not but reflect, with
great wonder, that however it hath pleafed the Al-
mighty in his providence, and in the government of
the creation, to take from fo great a part of the world
of his creatures, the nobleft ufes to which their facul-
ties, .and the powers of their fouls are adapted 5 yet
that he has beftowed upon them the fame reafon, af-
feclions, fentiments of kindnefs, and obligation, paf-
fions of refentment, fincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing and receiving good that he has
given us; and that when he is gracioufly pleafed to
offer them occafions of exerting thefe, they are as
ready,' nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper
ufes for which they were beftowed, than we often.
are. Thefe thoughts would make me melancholy,
efpeciaHy when I confidered how mean a ufe we
make of all thefe, even though we have tbefe powers
enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, and by the
knowledge of his word, as an addition to our under-
ftanding ; and why it has pleafed the heavenly wifdom
to conceal the like faving knowledge from fo many
millions of fouls, who would certainly make a much,
better ufe of it than generally mankind do at this
time. Thefe reflections would fometimes lead me
fo far» as to invade the fovereignty of providence, andr
as it were, arraign the juftice of fuch an arbitrary-
difpofition of things, that mould obfcure' that light
from fome, and reveal it to others, and yet expeft a
like duty from all. But I clofed it up, checking ray
thoughts with this conclufion ; firjl, That we were
ignorant of that right and law by \vhich thefe fhould
be condemned; but tfiat as the Almighty was necef-
ferily, and by the nature of his eflence, infinitely juft
and
and holy; fo it could not be otherwife, but that if
thefe creatures were all deftined to abfence from him-
felf, it was on account of finning againft that light,
which, as the fcripture fays, was a law to themfelves,
and by fuch rules as their confciences would acknow-
ledge to be juft, though the firil foundation was not
difcovered to us> And, fecondly, That ftill as we
were the clay in the hand of the potter, no veflel could
thus fay to him, Why haft thou fafhioned me after
this manner?
I had not been above two or three days returned to
my caftle, but my chief defign was, how I fhould
bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding; and,
to take from him that inhuman relifh he by nature
had been accuftomed to, I thought it my duty to let
him tafte other flefh, which might the rather tempt
him to the fame abhorrence I fo often expreffed a-
gainft their accurfed way of living. Upon which, one
morning I took him out with me, with an intentif -\
to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home, and
drefs it. As I was going, I perceived a fhe-goat ly-
ing down in the fhade, and two young kids fitting by
her. Immediately I catched hold of my man Friday,
and bidding him ftand ftill, and not ftir, I prefented
my piece, and fhot one of the kids. My poor fervant,
who had at a diftance perceived me kill hisadverfary,
and yet did not know by what means, or how it was
done, flood trembling and furprifed, and looked fo a-
mazed, that I thought he would have funk into the
earth. He did not fee the kid I aimed at, or behold I
had killed it, but ripped up his waiftcoat to fee if he
was not wounded, thinking my refolution was to kill
him; for coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnefi-
ly pronouncing many things which I did not under-
ftand the meaning of; which at length I perceived
was, that I would not take.away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that
condition, where nature is upon the fevereft trial,
when the immediate hand of death is ready to put for
K. 3 ever
ever a period to this mortal life: and indeed fo much
corr>paffion had I to this creature, that it was with dif-
ficulty I refrained from tcars. But, however, as ano-
ther fort of countenance was neceflary, and to convince
him that I would do him no harm, I took him, fmi-
ling, by the hand, then Inughed at him, and pointing,
to the kid which I had fL;in, made figns to him to fetch
it, which accordingly he did. No Jefs curious was
he in viewing how the creature was killed, than he
had been before in beholding; the Indian; which, while
he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and pre-
fcntly perceived a great fowl like a hawk,perching upon
a tree within fhot ; and, therefore, to let Friday under-
fland what I was going to do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I
made him* underftnnd that I would fboot and kill that
bird j accordingly I. fired, and bade him look, wheij
immediately he faw the parrot fall down. Again he
I.ood like one amazed, notwithstanding all I had faid
to him; and the more confounded he was, becaufc he
did not perceive me put any thing into my gun. Un*
doubtedly a thing fo utterly ftrange, carrying death
along with it, far or near, either to man or beaft, muft
certainly create the greater aftonifhment to one whe-
never had heard of fuch a thing in his whole life; and
really his amazement continued fo long, that had I al-
lowed it, he would have proftrated hirafelf before me
and my gun, with the greateft worfhip and adoration.
As for the gun in particular, he would not fo much as"
fufler his fingeis to touch it for feveral days after;
but would come and communicate his thoughts to it,
and talk to it, as if the fenfelefs piece had underftood
and anfwered hi'm: all this I could perceive him do,
•when he thought my back was turned, the chief in-
tent of which was, to defire it not to kill him, as I
afterwards came to underhand.
I never ftrove to prevent his admiration, nor hin-
der him from thofe comical geftures he ufed on fuch
occafions';
occafiong; but when his aftonifhment was a little fl-
yer, I made tokens to him to run and fetch the par-
rot that I had mot; which he accordingly did, flaying
fome time longer than ufual, by reafon the bird, not
being quite dead,- had fluttered fome way farther
from the place where fhe fell. In the mean time, as
he-Was looking for her, I took the advantage of char-
ging'my gun again, that fo I might be ready for any
.other mark that offered; but nothing more occured
. at that time. So I brought home the kid, and the
fame evening took off the fkin, and divided the car-
cafe as well as I could. Part of this flefh I ftewed
and boiled, in a pot I had for this purpofe. And then
fpreading my table, I fat down, giving my man fome
of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleafed, and feem-
ed to like it very well; but what was moft furprifing
to him was to fee me eat fait with it: upon which he
made me to underhand, that the fait was very bad for
me: when putting a little into his mouth, hefeemed
to naufeate it in fuch a manner, as to fpit and fputter
at it, and then warned his mouth with' frefh water:
but to fhew him how contrary his opinion was to mine,
I put fome meat into my mouth without fait, and
feigned to fpit and fputter as much fo. the want of it,
as he had done at it: yet all this proved of no figni-
fication to Friday; and it was a long while before he
could endure fait in his meat or broth, and even then
but a very fmall quantity.
Thus, having fed him fufficiemly with boiled meat
and broth at that time, the next day I was refolved
to feaft j^im with a roafted piece of the kid. And
having no fpit to faften it, nor jack to turn it, I made
ufe of that common artifice which many of the people
of England have, that is, to fet two poles upon each
fide of the fire, and one crofs on the top, hanging the
meat thereon with a ftnng, and fo turning round con-
tinually, roaft it in the fame manner as we read
bloody tyrants of old cruelly roafted the holy mar-
tyrs. This prattice cauled. great admiration 'in my
man
man Friday, being quite another way than that to
which the favages were accuftomed. But when he
came to taflc the fweetnefs and tendernefs of the flefh,
he exprefled his entire fatisfa&ion above a thoufand
different ways. And as I could not but underftand
his meaning, you may be fure I was as wonderfully
pleafed, efpecially when he made it alfo very plain to
me, that he would never, while he lived, eat man's
flefh more.
It is now high time I fliould fet my fervant to
work; fo, next day, I put him to beat out fome corn,
and fift it in the fame manner as I had done before.
And really the fellow was very quiet and handy in
the execution of any thing I ordered him to go about.
I made him underftand that it was to make bread for
us to eat, and afterwards let him fee me bake it. In
fhort, he did every thing as I ordered him, in a little
time, as well as 1 could perform it myfelf.
But now confklering that I had two mouths to feed
inftead of- one, it was neceflary that I muft provide
more ground for my harveft, and plant a larger quan-
tity of corn than I commonly ufed to do; upon which
I marked out a larger piece of land, fencing it in, in
the fame manner as I had done before; in the execu-
tion of which I mult give Friday this good word,
that no man could work more hardy, or with better will
than he did: and when I made him fenfible that it
was for bread to ferve him as well as me, he then
very paffionately ma'de me underftand, that he thought
1 had much more labour on his account, than I had
for myfelf; and that no pains or diligence fhould be
wanting in him, if I would but direft him'in thofe
•works wherein he might proceed.
I muft certainly own, that this was the moft plea-
fant year I ever had in the iflaiid; for, after fome time,
Friday began to talk pretty well, and underftand the
names of thofe things which I was wont to call for,
and the places where I ufed to fend him. So that my
long filent tongue, which had been ufelefs fo many
years,
years, except in an exclamatory manner, either for
deliverance or bleffings, now began to be occupied in
teaching, and talking to my man Friday; for indeed
I had fuch a fingular fatisfaction in the fellow him-
felf, fo innocent did hisfimple and unfeigned honefty
appear inore and more to me every day, that I really
began entirely to love him; and for his pnrt, I be-
lieve there was no love loft, and that his nature had
been more charmed-with my exceeding kindnefs, and
his affections more placed upon me, than any other
object whatfoever among his own countrymen. I
once had a great mind to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again: and by this
time having learned him Englifh fo well, that he could
give me tolerable anfwers to any queftion which I
demanded, I afked him, whether that nation to which
he belonged, ever conquered in battle? This queftion
made Friday to fmile, and to which he anfwered yes,
yes, -we al-waysjight the better; as much as to fay, they
always got the better in fight. Upon which we pro-
ceeded on the following difcourfe: You fay, faid I,
that you always fight the better; why then, Friday,
how came you to be taken prifoner?
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much.
Mafter. How, fay you, beat! if your nation beat
them, how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many mans than my nation in.
the place where me was, they take one, two, three
and me: my nation much overheat them in the yon-
der place where me no was, there my nation mans
beat one, two, three great toufaud.
Mafter. Then why did not your men recover you
from the hands of your enemies?
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and me;
they make all go in the canoo; my nation have no
canoo that time.
Mafter. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does
your nation do with the prifoners they take? Do they
carry them away and eat them as thefe have done?
Friday,
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat
up all.
Mafter. To what place do they carry them to be
devoured? .
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Mafter. Do they bring them hhher?
Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other
place. .
Mafter. And have you been with them here, Fri-
day?
Friday. Yes, me been here, (fainting to the north-
•wejl of the i/land, bfing the fide -where they vfed to
land.) ''
Thus having got what account I could from my
man, I plainly underftood, that he had been as bad
as any of the reft of the cannibals, having been for-
merly among the favages who ufed to come on fbore
on the fartheft part of the ifland, upon the/ame bloody
occafions as he was brought hither for: and fome time
after I carried him to that place where he pointed;
and no fooner did he come there, but he prefently
knew the ground, Signifying to me that he was once
there when they ate up twenty men, two women, and
a young child; but as he could not explain the num-
ber in Eng/i/c, he did it by fo many (tones in a row,
making a fign to me to count them.
This paflage 1 have the rather mentioned, becaufe
it led to things more important and ufeful for me to
know: for after 1 had this fatisfactory difcourfe with
him, my next queftion was, how far it was from the
ifland to the fhore, and whether the canoes were not
often loft in the ocean ? to which he anfwered, There
was no danger; that no canoes were ever loft; but
that after a little way out to the fea, there was a
ftrong current, and a wind always one way in the af-
ternoon. This I thought at firft to be no more than
the fets of the tide, of going out or coming in; but
I afterwards underftood it was occafioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko,
in
in the mouth or gulf of which I imagined my king-
dom lay; and that the land which I perceived to the
W. and N. W. muft be the great ifland Trinidad, on
the north of the river. A thoufand queftions (if that
would fatisfy me) did I afk Friday, about the nature
of the country, the fea, the coafts, the inhabitants,
and what nations were neareft them; to which que-
ftions the poor fellow declared all he knew, with the
greateft opennefs, and utmoft fincerity. When I de-
manded of him the particular names of the various
nations of his fort of people, he could only anfwer
me in general, that they were called Carafe. Hence
it was I confidered that thefe muft be the Caribbees,
fo much taken notice of by our maps, to be on that
part of America, which reaches from the mouth of
the river Oroonoko to Guiania, and fo on to St Mar-
tha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that, up a
great way beyond the moon, as much as to fay, beyond
the fetting of the moon, which muft be W. from their
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, fuch as I
was, pointing to my whifkers, and that they kill much
mans. I was not ignorant with what barbarity the
Spaniards treated thefe creatures; fo that I presently
coucluded jt muft be them, whofe cruelties had fpread
throughout America, to be remembered even to fuc-
eeeding generations.
Well, you may be fure, this knowledge, which the
imperfect information of my man had led me to, was
very comfomble to me, and made me fo curious as
to afk him, how I might depart from this ifland, and
get among thofe white men? He told me, Yes, yes, t
might go in two canoes. In two canoes, thought I,
what does my man mean? Surely he means one for
himfelf, and another for me; and if not, how muft
two canoes hold me without being joined, or one
part of my body being put in one, and another in the
other? And, indeed, it was a long while before I un-
derftood his meaning, which was, that it muft be a
large boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear with
the
the waves, and not fo liable to be overwhelmed as
one muft be.
I believe there is no ftate of life but what may be
happy, if people would but endeavour for their part
to make it fo. He is not the happieft man that has
the moft riches, but he that is content with what he
hath. Before I had my fervant, I thought myfelf
miferable till I had him; and now that I enjoyed the
happy benefits of him, I ftill complained, and begged
a deliverance from a place of retirement, eafe, and
plenty, where Providence had fufficiently blefled me.
In a word, from this time I entertained fome hopes,
that one time or other I might find an opportunity to
make my efcape from this ifland, and that this poor
favage might be a great furtherance thereto.
All the time fince my man became fo intelligent as
to underftand and fpeak to me, I fpared no pains .nor
diligence to inftruct him, according to my poor fhare
of knowledge, in the principles of religion, and the
adoration that he ought to pay to the True Cod. One
time, as I very well remember, I afked him who made
him? At firit the innocent creature did not under-
ftand what I meant, but rather thought I afked him
who was bis father? Upon which I took another way
to make him fenfihle, by demanding from him an an-
fwer to this queftion. Friday, faid I, who is it that
made the fea, this ground whereon we walk, and all
thefe hills and woods which we behold? And here,
indeed, I did not mifs of my .intention; for he told
me, it was old Benamuckee (the god whom I fuppofed
thefe favages adored) who lived a great way beyond
all. But as for his attributes, poor Friday was an
utter ftranger. He could .defcribe nothing of this
great per Ton; and all that he could fay was, that he
was very old, much older than the fea and land, the
moon, or the liars. Friday, (faid I again), if this
great and old perfon has made all things in the world,
how comes it to pafs, that all things, as you in par-
ticular, do not adore and worfhip him? Upon this,
looking
looking very grave, with a perfect fweet look of in-
nocence, be replied, Mafter, all things fay 0 to him,
by which it may reafonably be fuppofed he meant ado-
ration. And where, faid I, do the people of your
country go when they die? He anfwered, they all go
to Benamuckee. Wb,at, and thofe people that are eaten
up, do they go there? Benamuckec, laid he, love 'em
dearly; me pray to Benamiickee in de canoe, and Bena-
muchee -wou'd love me -when dey eat me all up.
Such difcourfes as thefe had I with my man, and
fuch made mefenfible, that the true God is wormip-
ped, though' under imperfect fimilitudes; and that
the falfe adoration which the Heathens give to their
imaginary deity, is as great an argument of the divine
eflence, as the moft learned Atheifts/^^/yyi culled)
can bring againft it: for God will be gloriSed in his
works, let the denomination be what it will; and 4
cannot be of that opinion which fome conceive, that
God fhould decree men to be damned for want of a
right notion of faith, in a place where the wifdom ot
the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached';
and therefore cannot but conclude, that fince obedi-
ence is the beft facrifice, thefe poor creatures, acting
by that light and'knowledge which they are poflefli-d
with, may undoubtedly obtain a happy fak'ation,
though not that enjoyment with Chrift, as his faints,
confeflbrs, and martyrs muft enjoy.
But laying thefe determinations afide, rrtore'fit for
•divines than me to difcufs, I began to inftrutr. my
Servant in the faving knowledge ot the {rue Deity, in
which the directions of God's Holy Spirit affifted me.
Llifted up my hands to heaven, and pointing thereto,
told him, that the great Maker of heaven and earth
lived there: that as his'infinite power fafhioned this
world out of a confufed chaos, and made it in that
beautiful frame which we behold, fo he governs and
preferves it by his unbounded knowledge, fovereign
greatnefs, and peculiar providence: that he was omni-
potent, could do every thing for us, give every thing
L to
to us, and take every thing away from us : that he was
a rewarder and punifherof good and evil aclions: that
• there was nothing but what he knew, no thoughts fo
iecret but what he could bring to light; and thus, by
degrees, I opened his eyes, and described to him the
manner of the creation of the world, the fituation of
paradife, the tranfgreffion of our firft parents, the wic-
kednefs of Gotl's peculiar people, and the univerfal
fins and abominations of the whoie earth. When
thefe things were implanted in his mind, I told him,
that as God's juftice was equal to his mercy, he refol-
»ed to deftroy this world, till his Son Jefus Chrift in-
terpofed in our behalf; and,toprocureour redemption,
obtained leave of his heavenly father to come down
from heaven into the world, where he took human na-
ture upon him, inftru&ed us in our way -to eternal
life, and died as a facrifice for our fins; that he was
now afcended into heaven, mediating for our pardon,
delivering our petitions, and obtaining all thofe good
benefits which we afk in his name, by humble and
hearty prayers, all which were heard at the throne of
heaven. As very frequently I ufed to inculcate things
into his mind, Friday one day told me, that if our
great God could hear us beyond the fun, he muft fure-
ly be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived
but a little way off, and yet could not hear them till
they afcended the great mountains where he dwelt, to
fpeak-to him. What, faid I, Friday, did you go thi-
therto fpeak to him too? He anfwered, No, they ne-
ver went that were young men, none but old men cal-
led their Oowa/iakef, meaning the Indian priefts, who
went to fay 0, (fo he called faying their prayers), and
they returned back, and told them what Benamuc-
kec faid. From hence, I could not but obferve how
happy we Chriftians are, who have God's immediate
revelation for our certain guide; and that our faith is
neither mifled, nor our reafon impofed upon, by any
fet of men, fuch as thefe Indian impofters.
But,
But,to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Fri-
day, I told him, that the pretence of their ancient
men going up to the mountain to fay O to their god
Benamuckee was an impofture, and that their bring-
ing back an anfwer was all a fham, if not worfe; for
that, if there was any fuch thing fpoken to them, fure-
ly it muft proceed from an infernal fpirit. And here
I thought it neceffary to enter into a long difcoui fs
with him, which I did after this manner.
Friday, (faid I), you muft know, that before this
world was made, there was an almighty Power exift-
ing, by whofe power all things were made, and whofe
Majgfty fhall have no end. To be glorified and ado-
red by beings of a heavenly nature, he created angels
and arch-angels, that is, glorious fpirits refembling
himfelf, to encompafs his throne, eternally finging
forth his praife in trte rnoft heavenly founds and di-
vine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir, Lu*
cifer bore a great fway, as being then one of the pe-
culiar favourites of thefe celeftial abodes; but he,
contrary to that duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign,
•with unbounded ingratitude to his divine Creator,
not only envied him that adoration which was his
due, but thought to ufurp that throne which he had
neither power to keep, nor title to pretend to. He
raifed a diffenfion and civil war in heaven, and had
a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded fol-
ly! ftupendous pride! thus to hope for victory, and
afpire above his powerful Creator! The Deity, not
fearful of fuch an enemy; yet juftly provoked at this
rebellion, commiffions his arch-angel Michael to lead
forth the heavenly hoft, and give him battle; the
advantage of which was quickly perceived, by Satan's
being overthrown, and the prince of the air, (for fo
the devil was called) with all his fallen angels, driven
headlong into a difmal place, which is called Hell.
The recital of this truth made my man give the
greateft attention, and he exprefied a great fatisfac-
tion by his geftures, that God had fent the devil into
L a, the
the deep hole. And then I defired him to give gfeat
hei d to what I had further to fay.
No fooner (proceeded I) was God freed from, and
the heavens clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father
fpeaks to the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to
his effence, and were equal to him in power and glory,
Come let us make man, (faid he) in our own image, after
our own likencfs> Gen. i. 26. to have dominion over
the creatures of the world which we have created.
And thefe he intended fhould glorify him in heaven,
according to their obedience in this ftate of probation
on earth, which was, as it were, to be the fchool to
train them up for thefe heavenly manfions. N^ow,
(?atan feeing him foiled; yet, that God had not ta-
ken the power from him as prince of the air, which
power Heaven defigned he fhould retain, whereby
his creatures might be tried; in revenge for the dif-
grace he had received, he tempts Adam's wife, Eve,
to tafte of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
which God had forbidden. He appears to her in the
fhape of a ferpent, then a moft beautiful creature,
and tells her, that it was no better than an impofi-
tion which God had put upon her and her hufband,
not to eat of that fair fruit which he had created;
that the tafte thereof would make them immortal like
.God himfelf; and confequently as great and power-
ful as he. Upon which fhe not only eat thereof her-
felf, but made her hufband eat alfo, which brought
them both under the heavenly difplealure.
Here Friday exprefled a great- concern; Ah> poor
jftans! (cried he) ndugkty -wctnans! naughty devil!
make Cad not Idve de tnans, make mans like devil him*
fetf.
Friday, faid I, God ftill loved mankind; and tho'
the devil tempted human nature fo far, he would not
fuffer him to have an abiolute power over them. I
have told you before of his tender love to his people,
till they, like Lucifer, difobeyed his commands and
•rebelledagainfthim; and even then,how Jsfus Chrift,
his
his only Son, came to:fatefinners. jBut ftill every
rpan that liycs in the world is undec temptatipn ani}
triaj. The devil has yet a power, as prince of the"
ftir, to fuggeft evil cogitations into our minds, and
prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory
in our deftruction. "VYhatever evil thoughts we have-
proceed from him; fo that God, in this our diftrefs,
expects we fhould apply ourfelves to him by fervent
prayer for fpeedy redrefs. He is not like Benamiukee,
to let none come near him but Oa-waknkee, but fu/rers
the people as well as prieRs to offer themfelves at his
feet, thereby to be delivered from the power and temp-
tation of the devil.
: But though at firft my man Friday exprefled fbme
concern at the wickednefs of Lucifer, I found it not
fo eafy to imprint the right notions of him in his
mind, as it was about the divine eflencc of God: for
there nature affi.fr.ed me in all my arguments, to (hew-
to him plainly the neccffity of a great firft caufe, and
over-ruling governing power^of a fecrct directing
Providence, and of the equity fcnd reafonableuefs of
paying adoration to our Creator; whereas there ap-
peared nothing of all this in the nption pf an evil-
fpirit,.of his firft beginning, bis nature, and, above allf
, of his inclination to evil actions, and his power to
tempt us to the like. And indeed this unlearned In-
dian, by the mere force of nature, puzzled me wiih
one particular queftion, more than ever I eouid have
expected.
I had, it feems, one day, Been talking to him of
the omnipotent power of God, and his infinite abhor-
rence of fin, infomuch that the fcriptures ftyled him
a. confumingfire to all the workers of iniquity; utul
that it was in his power, whenever lie pleaied, to de-
ftroy all the world in a moment, the greater part of
which are continually oil-ending him.
-, When, with a ferious attention, he had .Mcncd .1
great while to what I faid, after I had been telling
him how the devil was God's enemy in thehcarts of
men, and ufed all his malice and fkill to defeat the
good defigns of Providence, and deftroy the kingdom
of Chrift in the world, and fo forth: Very well, ma-
fter, faid Friday, you fay God is fo ftrong, fo great,
is he not much ftrong, much mightier than the
naughty devil? To be fure, Friday, faid I, God is
more wife, and ftronger than the ferpent: he is above
the devil., which makes us pray to him, that he would
tread down Satan under our feet, enable us to refifl
his violent temptations, and quench his fiery darts.
Why then, anfwered Friday quickly, if Cod, as you
fay, has muck Jirong, much might as the devil, -why Cod
no kill devil, make no more tempt, no more do tvicked.
\'ou may be certain, I was ftrangely furprifed at
this queftion of my man's; and, though an old man»
I was but a young doctor, a-nd confequently very ill
qualified fora cafuift, or a refolver of intricate doubts
hi religion. And, as it required fome time for me to
ftudy for an anfwer, I pretended not to hear him,
nor to afk him what Ije fa-id: But, fo earneft was he
for an anfwer, as not to forget his queftion, which he
repeated in the very fame broken words as above.
"When I had recovered myfelf a little, Friday, faid I,
Cod-will at laft punijh him feverely, being refer-vedfof
judgment, and' is to be ccift into the bottcmlefs pit, t»
remain in fire everlq/ling. But all this did not fatif-
fy Friday; for, returning upon me, he repeated my
vords, RESERVE AT LAST, me no under/land; but,
inhy net kill devil no-w, not kill devil, great, great -whilg
ago? Friiiay, faid I, yeu may as well afk me why
God does not kill you and me, when, by our wicked
actions, we fo much offend his Divine Majefty? Ha
gives us time to repent of our fins, thai thereby we
may obtain pardon. At thefe words, obtain pardon,
Friday mufed a great while ; and, at laft, looking me
ftcdfaftly in the face, Well, -well, -faid he, that's very
liiells foyou, f, devil, all.-wickedmans, all freJervfy
repent, Cod pardon all. «
Indeed, here I was- run down to the lafl extremity,
when
when it became very evident to me, how mere natu-
ral notions will guide reafonable creatures to the
knowledge of a Deity, and to the homage due to the
fupreme being of God; but, however, nothing but
divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jefus
Chrift, and of a redemption purchafed for us, of the
Mediator of the new covenant, and of an interceflbr
at the footftool of God's throne; and, therefore, the
gofpel of our Lord and Saviour Jefus Chrift; that is,
the Word and Spirit of God, promifed for the guide
and fanclifier of his people, are the moft neceflary in-
ftructors of the fouls of men, in the faving knowledge
of the Almighty, and the means to attain eternal hap-
pinefs.-
And now I found it neceflary to put an end to this
difcourfe between my man and me; for which pur-
pofe I rofe up haftily, and made as if I had fome oc-
eafion to go- out, fending Friday for fomething that
was a good way off. I then fell on my knees, and
befeeched God that he would infpire me fo far as to
guide this poor favage in the knowledge of Cbrift, to
anfwer his queftions more clearly, that his confcience
might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his foul
faved. When he returned again, I entered into a
very long difcourfe with him, upon the fubjecl; of the
world's redemption by the Saviour of it, and the
do&rine of repentance preached from heaven, toge-
ther with an holy faitb in our blefled Redeemer Jefuj
Chrift: and then I proceeded to explain to him, ac-
cording to- my weak capacity, the reafon why our Sa-
viour took not on him the nature of angels, but ra-
ther the feed of Abraham; and how the fallen angels
had-no benefit by that redemption; and, laftly, that
he came only to the loft fheep of the houfe of Ifrael,
and the like. God knows I had more fmcerity than
knowledge in all the ways I took for this poor In-
dian's inftru£U0n; and, I muft acknowledge, what I
believe every body that a£b upon the fame principle
will find, that in laying heavenly truths open before
him,
him, I informed and inftructed myfelf in many things,
that either I did not know, or had not perfe£tly con-
fidered before; fo that, however this poor creature
might be improved by my inftruction, certain it is,
. that I myfelf had great reafon to be thankful to Pro-
vidence for fending him to me. His company allayed
my grief, and "made my habitation comfortable; and,.
Trhen I reflected, that the folitary life to which I had
been fo long confined, had made me to look further
towards heaven, by making me the inftrument, under
Providence, to fave the life, and for aught I know,
the foul of this poor favage, by bringing him to the
knowledge of Jefus Chrili, it caufed a fecret joy to
fpread through every part of my foul; and I fre-
quently rejoiced, that ever I was brought to this place,
which I once thought the moft miferable part of th»
world. , .• , '.
In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards
continue, while I abode on the ifland, and for three
years did my man and I live in the greateft enjoyment
of happinefs. Indeed, I believe the favage was' as
good a ChrifHan. asjI.; aiid I hope we were equally
penitent; and.fuch penitents as were comforted an4
reftored by God-'s Holy Spirit; for now we had the
word of the Lord to inftruct us in the right way, as
much as if we had been on the Englifh fhore.
By the conftant application I made of the Scrip-
tures, as I read them to my man Triday, I earneftfy
endeavoured to make him underftand every part of it,
as much as lay in my power. He alfo, on the other
hand, by his very ferious queftions and inquiries,
pnade me a much better proficient in fcripture know-
ledge, than I fhould have been by my own private
reading and fludy. I muft not omit another thing,
proceeding from the experience I had in my retire-
ment: It was that infinite and inexprcflible bleiJing,
the knowledge of God through Jefus Chrift, which
was fo plain and eafy to he underftood, as immediate-
ly to direct me to carry on the great work of fincere
repentance
repentance for my fins, and laying hold of a Saviour
for eternaMife, to a practical flared reformation, and
obedience to all God's inftitutions, without the affift-
ance of a reverend and orthodox divine; and cfpe-
cially by this fame inftruction, fo to enlighten this fa-
vage creature, as to make him fo good a Chriftian,
as very few could exceed him. And there was only
this great thing wanting, that I had no authority to
adminifter the holy facrament, that heavenly partici-
pation of Chrift's body and blood; yet, however, we
refted Ourfelves content, that God would accept our
defires, and according to our faith, have mercy on us.
But what we wanted one way, was made up in a-
nother, and that was univerfal peace in our little
church. We had no. difputes and wranglings about
the nature and equality of the holy, blefled, and un-
divided Trinity; no niceties in dbctrine, or fchemes
of church government; no four and morofe diffen-
ters to impofe more fublimated notions upon us; no
pedant fophiflers to confound .us with unintelligible
myfteries: but, inftead of all this, -we enjoyed the
rnoft certain guide to heaven; that is, the word of
God; befides which, we had the comfortable views
of his Spirit leading us to the truth, and making us
both willing and obedient to the inftcuctioM of his
•word. As the knowledge and ."practice of this are
the principal means of falvation, I cannot fee what
it avails any ChrUtian Church, or man, in the world,
to amufe himfelf with fpeculations anJ opinions, ex-
cept it be to difplay their particular vanity and affec-
tation. ';,
You may well fuppofe, that, by the frequent difr
courfe we had together, my man and me became moft
intimately acquainted, and that there was but very
little that I could fay, but what Friday undcrilood j
and, indeed, he fpoke very fluently, though it was but
broken Englifh. I now took a particular pleafure in
relating all my adventures, efpecially thofe that oc-
curred liuce my being caft on this ifland. I made
him
him underftand that wonderful myftery, as he con-
ceived, of gun powder and bullet, and taught him
how to fhoot. I alfo prefented to him a knife, which
pleafed him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a
frog hanging thereto, like thofe in which we wear
hangers in England; and, inftead of a hanger to put
in the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only
a good, but even a better weapon upon many occafi-
ons. In a word, my man thus accoutred, looked up-
on himfelf as great as Don Quixote, when that ce-
lebrated champion went to combat the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular defcription of
the territories of Europe, and in a particular manner
of Old-England, the place of my nativity. I laid be-
fore him the manner of our worfiupping God, our
behaviour one to another, and how we trade in fhips
to every part of the univerfe. I then told him my
misfortunes in being fhipwrecked, fhowing him, as
near as I could, the place where the fhip lay, which
had been gone long before; but I brought him to the
ruins of my boat, which before my whole ftrength
could not move,' but now was almoft rotten, and
fallen to pieces. I obferved my man Friday to view
this boat with an uncommon curiofity; which, when
he had done, he flood pondering a great while, and
faid nothing. At laft, faid I, Friday, what makes
you ponder fo much? He replied, 0 mafter, me fee
like boat come ta place at my nation.
It was fome time, indeed, before I underftood what
my man meant j but examining ftri£Uy into it, I
plainly found, that fuch another boat, refenfbling mine»
had come upon the country where he dwelt; that is
to fay, by his farther explanation, that the boat was
driven there through violent ftorms and ftrefs of wea-
ther. It then came into my mind, that fome Euro-
pean fhip having been caft away, the poor diftrefled
creatures were forced to have recourfe to the boat to
fave their lives; and being all, as I thought, drown-
ed, I never concerned myfelf to afk any thing con-
cerning
earning them, but my only inquiry was about the
boat, and what defcription my man could give of it.
Indeed Friday anfwered my demands very well,
making every thing very plain to my underftanding;
but beyond meafure was I fatisfied, when he told me,
with great warmth and ardour, 0 majler, we fave
•white mans from drown; upon which I immediately
afked him, if there were any white mans, as he called
them, in the boat; Yes, yes, faid he, the boat full,
very full of-white mans. How many, Friday? faid I.
Hereupon he numbered his fingers, and counted fe-
venteen. And when I afked him what became of
them all, and whether they lived or not? he replied,
Yes, mafter, they all live, they be live among my nation,
This information put frefh thoughts into my head,
that thefe muft be thofe very men who before I con-
cluded had been fwallowed up in the ocean, after they
had left their fhip, that had itruck upon the rocks of
my kingdom, and after efcaping the fury of the deep,
landed upon the wild fhare, and committed them-
felves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which
confequently, as I thought, muft be acted with greater
barbarity to ftrangers, created in me a great anxiety,
and made me ftill more curious to afk Friday'concern-
ing them. He told me he was fure they flill lived there,
having refided among them above four years, and
that the favages gave them victuals to live upon. But
pray, Friday, faid I, whence proceeded all this good
nature and generofity? How came it to pafs that they
did not kill and eat them, to pleafe their devouring
appetites; and occafion fo fplendid an entertainment
among them? No, no, faid Friday, they not kill 'em,
they make brother -with 'em; by which I underftood
there was a truce between them. And then I had a
more favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday's
uttering thefe words : My nation, t' other nation no cat
tnans, but -when mans make war jigkt; as though he
had faid, that neither thofe of his kingdom, nor any
other
other nations that he knew of, ever ate their fellow-
creatures, but fuch as their law of arms allowed to
be devoured; that is, thofe miferable captives, whofe
misfortune it fhould be to be made prifoners of war.
Some confiderable time after, upon a very pleafant
day, in moft ferene weather, my man and I flood up
on the top of a hill, on the eaft fide of the ifland,
whence 1 had once before beheld the continent of
America. I could not tell immediately what was the
matter; for fuddenly Friday fell a jumping and dan-
cing as if he had been mad; and upon my demand-
ing the reafon of his behaviour, 0 joy, faid he, 0glad!
there fee my country, there my nation, there live-white
mans gether. And indeed fuch a rapturous fenfe of
pleafure appeared in his countenance, that his eyes
had an uncommon fparkling ami brightnefs, and fuch
a ftrange eagernefs, as if he had a longing defire to
be in his own country again. This made me not fo
well fatisfied with my man Friday as before; for by
this appearance, I made no difpute, but that if he
could get back thither again, he would not only be
unmindful of what religion I had taught him, but
likewife of the great obligation he owed me for his
wonderful deliverance: nay, that he would not only
inform his countrymen of me, but accompany hun-
dreds of them to my kingdom, and make me a mi-
ferable facrifice like thofe unhappy wretches taken in
battle.
Indeed I was very much to blame to have thefe
cruel and unjuft fufpicions, and muft freely o\vn I
wronged the poor creature very much, who was of a
quite contrary temper. And had he had that difcern-
ing acutenefs which many Europeans have, he would
certainly have perceived, my coldnefs and indifference,
and alfo have been very much concerned upon that
account; 3s I was EOV- more circurnlpect, I had
much leflened my kindnefs and familiarity with him,
and while this jealoufy -continued, I uicd that art-
ful way (now too mucn in fafhion, the occafion, of
itrife
ftrife and difleution) of pumping him daily, thereby
to difcover whether he was deceitful in his thoughts
and inclinations: but certainly he had nothing in
him but what was confiftent with the befl principles,
both as a religious Chriftian and a grateful friend;
and, indeed, I found every thing he faid was fo inge-
nuous and innocent, that I "had no room for fufpicion,
and, in fpite of all uneafinefs, he not only made me
entirely his own again, but alfo caufed me much to
lament that I ever conceived one ill thought of him.
As we were walking up the fame hill another day,
when the weather was fo hazy at fea, that I could
not perceive the continent, Friday, faid I, don't you
wifh yourfelf to be in your own country, your own
nation, among your old friends and acquaintances?
Yes, faid he, me much 0 glg.d te be at my own nation.
And what would you do there, Friday ( Would you
turn wild again, eat mans flefti, and be a favage as
you were formerly? No, no, (anfwered he, full of
concern, and fhaking his head), Friday noio tell them
to live good, tell them pray Cod, tell them to eat corn-
bread, cattle flejh, milk, no eat man again. But Cure-
ly, replied I, if you fhould offer to do all this, they will
kill you; and ro manifeft their contempt of fuch in-
ftruclion, eat you up when they have done. He then
put on a grave, yet innocent and fmooth counte-
nance, faying, No, they no kill me, they willing love
searn: that is, that they would be very willing to
learn: adding withal, that they had learned much of
the bearded mans that-come in the boa.t. Will you,
faid I, go back again, Friday? He fmiled at that, and
told me, that he could not fwim fo far. But, faid I, I
will make a canoe for you: Yes, majlcr, faid he, me
go if you go, me no go ifyoiijlay. I go, Friday! why,
would you have them eat me up, and devour your
kind mafter? No, no, faid he, me make them net eat
inafter, me make they much love IQU-, that is, he would
tell them how I had flain his enemies, and thereby
M faved
faved his life, for which reafon he would make them
love me: and then he related to me, as well as he
was able, bow exceeding kind thofe of his nation
were to the white, or bearded men, as he called them,
who, in their great calamity, were driven into their
country.
It was from this time, indeed, I had ftrong incli-
nations to venture over, and ule my utmoft efforts,
if poffible, to join thefe white bearded men, \vho un-
doubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguefe; for, thought
I, it muft be certainly a better and lafer way to efcape
when there is a good company, than for me alone,
from nn ifland forty miles off the fhore, and without
any affiftance. Some days after, Friday and I being
at work, as ufual, at the fame time diverting ourfelves
with various difcourfes, I told him I had a boat which
I would bellow upon him, whenever he pleafed to re-
turn to his own nation: and to convince him of the
truth of whnt 1 fnid, I took him with me to the other
fide of the ifland, where my frigate lay, and then ta-
king it from under the water, (for 1 always kept it
funk for fear of a difcovery) we both went into it to
fee how it would manage iucli an expedition.
And really never could any be more dexterous in
rowing than my faithful fervant, making the boat go
as faft again as I could. Well, now, Friday, faid I,
fnnll we now go to your fo much defired nation ? But in-
ftead of meeting with that cheerfulnefs I expected, he
looked very dull and melancholy at my faying fo;
which indeed at firft furprifed me, till he maUe.me
fenfible, that his concern was about the'boat's being
too fmall to go fo ar a voyage. Upon which I let
him underftand I had a much bigger ; and, according-
ly, the next day woit to the place where the firft boat
Jay, which I had made, when all the rtrength I had,
or art I could uic, failed me in my attempt to get it
into the water; but now it having Iain in the fun
two and twenty years, and no care being taken of it
all that while, it became in a manner ,otten. My
man
man told me, that fuch a boat would do very well to
the purpofe, fufficient to carry enough vittle, dring,
bread, for that was his manner of talking. In fhort,
my mind being firongly fixed upon my defign of go-
ing over with him to the continent, I very plainly
told him, that we would both go and make a boat full
as big, and more proportionable than that, wherein he
might fafely return to his own nation. >
Thefe words made Friday look fo very penfive,
that I thought he would have fallen at my feet. It
was fome time before he could fpeak a word, which
made me afk him, what was the matter with him?
He replied, in a very foft and moving tone, JVh.it has
poor Friday done" -wby are you angry mad -with poor fcr-
vant? what me done, 0 -what me done? Friday, faid I,
.you never yet have offended me: what makes you
think I am angry with you, when I am not angry at
all? You no angry, no angry, (aid he feveral times; if
•you lie no angry, -why den fend Friday over great water
to my own nation'? \Vhv, iurely, Friday, anfwered I,
did you not wifh to be there, when, from a mountain,
you beheld the place where you was born? and is it
not to fatisfy your defires that I am willing to give
you leave to return thither.? Yes, yes, faid Friday, me
inift) be there fare enough, but me den -wifli mafter there
too: no "wijh Friday there, no mafter there. In fhort,
he could not endure the thoughts of going there with-
out me. I go there, Friday, faid I, what fhall I do
there? He anfwered very quickly, 0 ma/ter, you
do great deal much good,you teachallde -wildmans to be
good tame mans: you learn dem to Is fober, live good
life, to kno-ui God, and pray God. Alas! poor Friday,
faid I, what can I do againft their priefts of Bena-
muckee, or indeed what good can I make your nation
fenlible of, when I myfelf am hut a poor ignorant
man? No, no, mafter, faid he, you It? no ignorant, you
teachee me good, you teachee dem good. You fhall go
without me, Friday, faid, I, for I don't care to ac-
company you thither; I would rather live in this fo-
M 2 liiude
litude than venture among fuch inhuman favages. Go
your way, fince you defire it, and leave me aJone by
myfelf, as I was before I faved your life.
Never was any creature more thunder-ftruck than
Friday was at rheie words. Co me a-way, leave mafter
a-way, faid he, after a long filence, no, no, Friday diei
Friday live not mafter gone; as though he had faid,
I neither can nor will live, if my mafter fends me
irom him. And here I cannot but take notice of the
ftroug ties of friendfhip, which many times farpafs
thofe of confanguinity: For often we find a great dif-
agreement among kindred; and, when there is any
feeming regard for each other, it is very feldom true,
and fcarce ever lafting, if powerful intereft does not
bear the fway; and that alone is often the occafion
of the greateft hatred in the world, which is to defire
the death of parents and relations, for the fake of ac-
quiring their fortunes. But there was no fuch thing
between my fervant and me: inftead of which there
•was the greateft gratitude, and the moft fincere love;
he found me net only his deliverer, but his preferver
and comforter; not a fevere and cruel tyrant, but a
kind, loving, and affable friend. He wanted for no
manner of fuftenance; and, when he was ill, or out
of order, I was his phyfician, not only for his body,
but his foul; and iherefore no wonder was it, that
fuch an innocent creature, long fince divefted of his
former natural cruelty, fhculd have an uncommon
concern at fo cruel a feparation from me, which
pierced him to the very foul, and made him defire e-
ven to die, rather than live without me.
After I had told Fridayi in a very carelefs manner,
that he mould be at his liberty as foon as the boat was
made, the language of his eyes exprefled all imagi-
nable confufion; when, immediately running to one
of his hatchets, vhich he ufed to wear as a defenfive
•weapon, he gives it into my hand, with a heart fo
full, that he could fcarcely fpeak. Friday, faid I,
•what is it you mean? What, muft I do with this?
Qnly
Only kill Friday, faid he, Friday care not live long..
But what muft I kill you for? replied I again. Ak.1
dear mafter, -what made you Friday fave from eat a me
up,fo keep long Friday, make Friday love Cod, and not
love Benamuckee, and new Friday fend auay, never
fee Friday mare. As though the poor creature had
faid, Alas, my deareft kind mafter, how comes it to
pafs, that, after having ventured your precious life to
fave me from the jaws of devouring cannibals like
myfelf, after fuch a tender regard to provide for me
fuch a comfortable nourifhment, and continuing fo
long a kind mafter, and a moft fincere friend; and
after making me forfake the falfe notion of an Indian
deity, and worfhip the true God in fpirit and in
truth-: after all this, how comes it now, that you are
willing to fend me away to my former courfe of li-
ving, by which means undoubtedly we fhall be dead
to each other; but greater muft be my misfortune,
that I fhall never behold my beft friend I have in the
world any more. And this undoubtedly, though he
could not exprefs himfelf fo clearly, muft be his fen-
timents; for the tears ran down his cheeks in fuch a.
plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain
from weeping alfo, when I beheld the poor creature's
affection; fo that [ was forced to comfort him in the
beft manner I could, which 1 did, by telling him, if
he was content to abide with me, I fhould be ever
willing to keep him.
After Friday's grief was fomething abated, more
fully to convince me of his afrection, he faid, O ma~
Jler, me not care to be in my nation, leave you here; me
defire nation lea-rn good, that's all; meaning, that his
defire was for the converfion of that barbarous people.
But as I had no apoftolic miffion, nor any concern
about their falvation; fo'I had not the leall intention
or defire of undertaking it: and the ftrength of my
inclination, in order to efcape, proceeded chiefly from
my late difcourfe with Friday, about theie feventeen ^
white, bearded men, that had been driven upon the
M 3 barbarian
barbarian coaft, whom I defigned to join, as the only
means to further our efcape. To which intent my
mnn and I went to fearch for a proper tree to fell,
•whereof we might make a large periagua or canoe,
to undertake the voyage: arid, indeed, we were not
long in finding one fit for our purpofe, there being
enough of wood in the ifland to have built a fleet of
large veffels, but the thing we principally wanted
was, to get one fo near the water, that we might
launch it after it was finifhed, and not commit fo
horrid a miftake as I had done once before.
Well, after a great fearch for what was beft and
moft convenient, Friday at Ml, whofe judgment in
fuch affairs was much fuperior to mine, pitches upon
a kind of wood the moil fitting for it. To this
day I cannot teM the name of the tree, nor defcribe
k any other way, than only by faying, that it is very
like what we caH/a/?;c, or betwixt that and the Ni-
caragua wood, being much of the fame colour and
fmell. But though my man exceeded me in the
knowledge of the moft proper tree, yet I fhewed him
a much better and cleaner way to make a canoe than
ever he knew before: for h« was for burning the
hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make this
boat; but I then told him how we might do it with
tools, learning him at the fame time how to ufe
them, which indeed he did very dexteroufty; fo that in
a month's labour we finifhed it, making it very hand-
fome, by cutting the outfide into the true fhape o£
a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight before,
•we eould get her into the water, which we did, as it
were, inch by inch, upon great rollers: but when fhe
was in, fhe would have carried twenty men, with alt.
the eafe imaginable.
As I was very well pleafed, you may be fure, at the
launching of this man of war of mine, I was no lefs
amazed to behold with what dexterity my mart,would
manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. Weil,.
Friday, faid I, what do you think of it now? Do you
think
think this will carry us over? Yes, inafter, faid he,
me venture over -we'l, though great bloi,, -wind. But
my dcfign was yet farther, which he was infenfible of;
and that was to make a maft and fail, and to provide
her with an anchor and cable. As to a maft, that
•was no difficult thing at all to procure; fo I fixed
epon a ftraight young cedar-tree, which I found near
the place, great plenty of it abounding in the ifland;
and fetting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti-
cular directions how to fhspe and order it; but as to
the fail, that I managed myfelf. I very well knew I
had fome old ones, or pieces of fails enough, which
had lain fix and twenty years by me; but not being
careful to preferve them, as thinking I fhould have
no occafiort to ufe them any more, when I came to
look them over, I found them almoft all rotten, ex-
eept two; and with thefe I went to work, and after
'a great deal of pains and awkward tedious ftitching
for want of needles, at length I finifhed a three-cor-
nered ugly thing like what we call in England a
fhoulder of mutton fail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little fmall fprit at the top, like thofe which
our longboats ufe, and which I very well knew how
to manage; efpecially fince it was like that which I
had in my patron's fifhing boat, when, with my boy
Xury, I made my efcape from the Barbarian fhore.
It was near two months, I think, before I comple-
ted this work, that is, the rigging, and fitting my
maft and fails; and indeed they were nicely done,
having made a fmall ftay, and a fail, or forefail to it,
to affift, if we fhould turn to the weftward; and,
which was flill more, I fixed a rudder to the ftern 6f
ber, to fteer with ; and though I was but a very inV
different fhipwright, yef, as I was femible of the
great ufefulnefs and abfolute neceffity of a thing like-
this, I applied myfelf to it with fuch a conftant ap-
plication, that at lall I accomplifhed my defign; but
•what with the many dull contrivances I had about it,
and the failure of many things, it coil me as much pains
• •' in.
in ordering as in making the boat. Befides, when alF
this was done, I had my man to teach what belonged
to its navigation: for though he very well underftood
how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter ftran-
ger to a fail and a rudder, and was amazed when he
faw me work the boat ta and again in the fea, by
them, and how the fail gibbed and filled this way or
that way, as the courfe we failed changed. After
fome time, and a little ufe, I made all thefe things
very familiar to him, fo that he became an expert
failor, except in relation to the compafs, and that I
could make him underftand but little of. But, as it
happened, there were fcldom occafion for it, there
being but little cloudy weather, and fcarce ever any
fog in thofe parts; the ftars were always vifible in the
night, and the fhore perfpicuous by day, except in
the rainy feafon, which confined every, one to his
habitation.
Thus entered in the feven and twentieth year ef
my reign, or captivity, which you pleafe, (the laft
three of which, bleffed with the company of my man'
Friday, ought not to be reckoned), I kept the annL-
verfary of my landing here, with the fame thankful.-
nefs to God, for his tender mercies, as I did before j.
and certainly, as I had great caufe for a thankful ac-
knowledgment for my deliverance at firfl, I had
much greater now, for fuch fingular and additional
teftimonies of the care of Providence over me, in all
my diftreffes both of body and mind, and the great
hopes I had of being effectually and fpeedilv: deliver-
ed; for I had a ftrong impreffion upon my mind,
that I fhould not be another year in this ifland. But,
however, 1 ftill continued on with my hufbandry,
digging, planting, and fencing, as ufual ; gathering
and curing my grapes, and doing all other things
that were necefiary.
And now the rainy feafon beginning to come on,
obliged me to keep the longer within doors; but be-
fore this, I brought my new vefl'd into the creek,
where
where I had landed my rafts from the fhip, and ha-
ling her up to the fhore, I ordered my man Friday to
dig a dock fufficient to hold her in, and deep enough
to give her water, wherein fhe might float; and then,
when the tide was out, we made a ftrong dam crofs
the end of it, to keep out the water; by which means
(he lay dry, as to the tide from the fea; and to keep
the rain from her, we thatched her over, as it were,
with boughs of trees, like a houfe; and fo we waited
for the months of November and December, in which
I defigned to venture over the ocean.
No Iboner did the feafonable weather begin to draw
near, but fo much was I elevated with this new de-
Cgned adventure, that I daily prepared for the voy-
age. The firft thing I.thought on was, to lay by a
certain quantity of provifions, as a fufficient ftore for
fuch an expedition, intending in a week or fortnight's
time to open the dock, and launch out the boat for
that purpofe. But one morning as I was very bufy
upon fomething neceflary for this occafion, I called
Friday to me, and bid him go to the fea fhore, and
fee if he could find a turtle or tortoife, a thing which
•we commonly had once a week, as much upon ac-
count of the eggs, as for the lake of the flefh. -He
had not been long gone, but he came running back,
as though he was purfued for life, and as it were flew
over my outward wall, or fence, like one that felt not
the ground, or fteps he fet his feet on; and before I
had time to enquire the reafon of his precipitation,
he cries out, 0 dear ma/ler, 0 forrt-w! for row ! Bad!
0 bad! Why, what's the matter, Friday? faid I. Ot
yonder, yonder, faid he, there lie one, two, or three
canoes! t-wo, three. Surely (thought I) there muft be"
fix, by my man's way of reckoning; but, on a ftricter
inquiry, I found there were but three. Well, Friday,
faid I, don't be terrified, I warrant you we^will not
only defend ourfelves againft 'em, but kill the moft
of thefe cruel favages. But though I comforted him
in the beft manner I could, the poor creature trembled
fo, that I fcarce knew what to do with him: 0, ma.-
Jler> faid he, they come look Friday, cut pieces Friday,
cut a me up. Why, Friday, faid I, they will eat me
up as well as you, a,nd my danger is as great as yours.
But fince it is fo, we muf t refolve to light for our
lives. What fay you? can you fight, Friday? Yes,
faid he very faintly, mejhcot, me kill u-hat I can, but
there come great many number. That's no matter,
faid I again, our guns will terrify thofe that we do not
kill: I am very willing to ftand by you to the laft drop
of my blood. Now, tell me, if you will do the like by
me, and obey my orders in whatfoever I command?
Friday then anfwered, 0 majler, me lofc life for you, me
die -when you bid die. Thus concluding all queflions
concerning his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a
good dram of rum, (of which I had been a very good
hufband), and gave it him to comfort his heart.
After he had drank it, I ordered him to take the two
fowling pieces, which we always carried, and load
them with large fwan fhot, as big as fmall piftol bul-
lets; then I took four mufkets, and loaded them with
two flugs, and five fmall bullets each; charging my
two piftol s each with a brace, I hung my great fword,
as cuftomary, naked to my fide, and gave Friday his
hatchet, as a moft excellent weapon for defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myfelf as any
knight-errant that ever handled a fword and fpesr. I
took my perfpective glafs, and went'up to the fide of
the hill, to fee what I could difcover ; and I perceived
very foon, by my glafs, that there were one and twen-
ty favages, three -prifoners, and three canoes; and
that their chief concern feemed to be the triumphant
banquet upon the three poor human bodies, a thing
which by this time I had obferved was very common
with them. I alfo remarked, that they did not land
at that place from whence Friday made his efcape,
bur nearer to the creek, where the fhore was low,
and where a thick wood came very clofe to the fea.
My foul was then filled with indignation and abhor-
i rence
reiice at fucb. inhuman wretches, which 'put a period
to all my fermer thoughts in their vindication; nei-
ther would I give myfelf time to confider their right
of conqueft, as I had done before; but defeending
from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and told
him, I was refolved to go fpeedily to them and kill
them all; afking him again, in the fame breath, if he
•Would ftand by me? When by this time being reco-
vered from his fright, and his fpirit much cheered with
the dram I had given him, he wns very pleafant; yet
ferioufly telling me, as he did before, When I kiddie,
he -would tife.
And now it was, having fixed my refolution in fo
ftrong a manner, that nothing could diveft my breaft
of its uncommon fury. I immediately divided the
Joaded arms betwixt us. To my man Friday I gave z
piftol to flick in his girdle, with three guns upon his
fhoulder, a weight too great I confefs to'bear; but
•what muft a poor king do, who had but one foldier in
the world? But to fhew I made him bear no more
than what I would lay on myfelr, I ftuck the other
piftol in my girdle, and other three guns upon my
fhoulders; nay fomething more, but that was like
.^Efop'.s burden, a.fmall bottle of rum, which,was
foon lightened to our exceeding refreibment. Thus
we marched out, under a ponderous load of armour,
like two invincible champions, with a quantity of
powder and bullets to ftand our battle, and load again,
when the pieces were difcharged. And now my or-
ders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to keep
dole behind me, and not to ftir, or fhoot, or attempt
any thing till I commanded him; and, in the interim,
not to fpeak fo much as one word. It was in this or-
der I fetched a com pafs to the right hand, of near a
mile, as well to get over the creek, as to attain the
wood; and by this, 1 thought to coine within Shot of
them before 1 coujd lie difcerned, as I found by my
glais, would not be diiikuit to accomplifh.
But
But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men,
even in our greateft fury and ftrongeft inclination?
For while I was taking this march, my refolution be-
gan to abate, not through fear of their numbers, who
were a parcel of naked unarmed wretches, but thofe
reflections occurred to my thoughts: What power
•was I commiffioned with, or what occafion or necef-
fity had I to go and imbrue my hands in human blood,
and murder people thjjt had neither done nor intend-
ed to do me any wrong? They were innocent in par-
ticular as to me; and their barbarous cuftotn was not
only their misfortune, but a fign that God- had left
them in the moft immenfe flupidity; but yet did not
warrant me to be a judge of their actions, much lefs
an executioner of his righteous judgments: That, on
the contrary, whenever he thought fit, he would take,
vengeance on them himfelf, and punifh them in a
national way, according to their national crimes; but
this was nothing at all to me, who had no concern
•with them. Indeed my man Friday might juftify
himfelf, becaufe they were his declared enemies, of
that very fame nation that went to facrifice him before;
and, indeed, it was lawful for him to attack them,
which I could not fay was fo with refpect to me. So
warmly did thefe things prefs upon my thoughts all
the way I went, that I only refolved to place myfelf
fo as to behold their bloody entertainment, without
falling upon them, except fomething more than ordi-
nary, by God's fpecial direction, Ihould oblige me
thereto.
Thus fixed in my refolution, I entered into the
thick wood, (my man Friday following me clofe be-
hind), when, with all poflible warinefs and filence, I
marched till I came to the fldrt of it, on that fide
which was the neareft to them ; for only one end of the
wood interpofed between me and them. Upon which
I called very foftly to Friday; an4 fhewing him a
great tree, that-was juft at the corner of the wood, I
ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word, if
he
I . he could plainly perceive their actions: Accordingly,
he did as I commanded him, and came back with
this melancholy ftory, that they were all about their
fire, eating the flefh of one of their prifoners; and
that another lay bound upon the fand, a little diftant
from them, which they defigned for their next facri-
fice; and this, he told me, was not one of their na-
tion, but one of thofe very bearded men, who was
driven by a ftorm into their country, and of whom
he had fo often talked to me about. You may be fure,
that upon hearing this, my foul was ready to fink
within me; when afcending up into a tree, I faw
plainly, by my glafs, a white man, who lay upon,
the beach of the fea, with his hands and feet ty'd
•with flags, or things refembling rufhes, being cover-
ed with clothes, and feemed to be an European.
From the tree where I took this profpect, I perceived
another tree, and a thicket beyond it, about fifty
yards nearer to them, than where I was; which, by
taking a fmall circle round, I might come at undif-
covered, and then I fhould be within half a fhot of
thefc devourers. And this confideration alone, to be
more perfectly revenged upon them, made me with-
hold my paffion, though I was enraged to the higheft
degree imaginable; when going back about twenty
paces, I got behind fome bufhes, which held all the
way till I came to the other tree; and then I afcend-
ed to a little rifing ground, not above eighteen yards
diftance, and there I had a full view of thefe crea-
tures, and I could perceive all their actions.
Such a fight did then appear, as obliged me not to
lofe a moment's time. No lefs than nineteen of thefe
dreadful wretches fat upon the ground, clofe huddled
together, expreffing all the delight imaginable at fo
barbarous an entertainment; and they had juft fent
other two to murder this poor unhappy Chrijiian, and
bring him limb by limb to their fire; for they were
N juft
juft then going 'to untie the bands from'his feet, in
order for death, as fetters arc knocked off the feet of
malefactors before they go to the place of execution.
Hereupon, immediately turning to my man, Now,
Friday, faid I, mind what I fay, fail in nothing, but
do exactly as you fee me do. All which he promi-
fing he would perform, I'fet down one of my mufkets,
and the fowling piece upon the ground, and Friday
did'the fame by his; and with the other mufket I
took my aim at the favages, bidding him do the like:
Are you ready, faid I? Yes, mqfter, faid he. Why
then fire at them, faid I; and that very moment I
gave fire likewife.
I only killed one, and wounded two; but my man
Friday, taking his aim much better than I, killed
two, and wounded three. You may be fure they
were in a dreadful confternation, at fuch an imex-
jiected difafter; and thofe who yet had efcnped our
penetrating fliot, immediately jumped upon their
feet, but were in fivch confufion, that they knew not
•which way to run or look; not knowing from whence
their deftruction came. We then threw down our
pieces, and took up others, giving a fecond dreadful
volley; but as they were loaded only with fwan-fhot,
or fmall piftol bullets, we perceived only two of them
fall; though many were wounded, who run yelling
and fcreaming about like mad creatures. Now, Fri-
day, faid I, lay down your piece, and take up the
mufker, and follow me. He did fo, with great cou-
rage, when fhewing ourfelves to thefavagts, we .gave'ar
great fhour, and made dire£lly to the poor victim, who
would have been facrificed, had not our firft fire obli-
ged the butchers, with three others, to jump into a ca-
noe. By my order, Friday fired at them, at which
fhot I thought he had killed them all, by reafon of their
falling to the bottom of the boat; however, he killed
two, and mortally wounded a third. In the mean time,
I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor
creature,
creature, and lifting him up, aftced him in the Por-
tugucfe.tongue, What he was? He anfwered me in
Latin,. Cbriftianus; but fo very weak and faint, that
he could fcarce ftand or fpeak. Immediately I gave
;him a dram, and a. piece of bread to cherifh him,
and afked him, What countryman he was? He faid,
Efparuo1ai and then uttered all the thankfulnefs
imaginable for his deliverance.- Signior, (faid I,,
with as .much Spanijh as I was mailer cf), Ictus
talk afterwards, but fight now; here, take this fword
and piftol, and do what you can. And, indeed, he
, did fo with fuctr courage and intrepidity,, that he cut
'"two of. them to pieces in an inftant, the favages not
having the power to fly for their lives. I ordered Fri-
day to run for thofe pieces we had left at the tree,
which he brought me with great fwiftnefs, and then
I gave him my mufket, w.hilp I loaded the reft. Bijt
. now there happened a fierce encounter between the
Spaniard and one of the favages, who had made at
him with one of their wooden (words ; and though
the former was as brave as could be expected, having,
twice wounded his enemy in the head; yet, being
weak and faint, the Indian had thrown him upon, the
ground, and was wrefting my fword out of his hand,
which the Spaniard very wifely quitting drew put his
piftol, and /hot him through the body before I coi^Jd
come near him, though I was running to his ailift-
ance. As to Friday, he purfued the flying wretchfa
with his hatchet, difpatching three, but the reft were
too nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one of
the fowling-pieces, wounded two, who running into
the woodi Friday purfueii and killed oua; bu,t th~e
other, notwithftandiug his wounds, plunged himfelf
into the fea, an,d fwara to thofe two who were left in
the canoe, which, with one wounded, were all that
efcaped out of one and twenty. The account is as

The favages in the canoe worked very hard to get
out of our reach, and Friday was as eager in pur-
fuing them; and, indeed, I was no lefs anxious
about their efcape, left, after the news had been
carried to their people, they fhould return in mul-
titudes, and deftroy us. So being refolved to pur-
fue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and
bid Friday follow me ; but no fooner was I in, than,
to my furprife, I found another poor creature, bound
hand and foot for the flanghter, juft as the Spaniard
had been, with very little life in him. Immediately
I unbound him, and would have helped him up; but
he could neither ftar J nor fpeak, but groaned fo pi-
teoufly, as thinking he was only unbound in order to be
flain. Hereupon 1 bid Friday fpeak to him, and tell him
of his deliverance; when pulling out my bottle, I made
the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with the joyful
news he had received, fo revived his heart, that he fat
up in the boat. As foon as Friday began to hear him
fpeak, and look more fully in his face, it would have
moved any one to tears to perceive his uncommon
tranfports'of joy; for he kiffed, embraced him, hug-
5ed him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
anced, fung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his face and head, then fung and jumped about
again, like a diftracted creature: fo that it was a
great while before I could make him fpeak to me,
or tell me what was the matter with him; but
when
when he came to the liberty of his fpeech, at laft lie
told me it was his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to fee that du-
tiful and tender affection this poor favage had to his
aged parent. He would fit down by him in the boat,
open his breaft, and hold his father's head clofe to his
bofom, half an hour together, to cherifh it: then he
took his arms and ancles, which were ftiff and num-
bed with binding, and chafed and rubbed them with
his hands; by which means, perceiving what the cafe
was, I gave him fome rum, which proved of great be-
nefit to him.
While we were bufy in this action, the favages had
gotten almoft out of fight; and ha'ppy it was we did
not purfue them: For there arofe from the north-
weft, which continued all night long, fuch a violent
ftorm, that I could not fuppofe otherwife but that they
were all drowned. After this, I called Friday to me,
:and afked him, if he had given his father any bread?
He fhook his head, and faid, None, not one bit, me
eat a up all; fo I gave him a cake of bread out of a
little pouch I carried for this end. I likewife gave
him a dram for himfelf, and two or three bunches of
raifins for his father. Both thefe he carried to him,,
for he would make him drink the dram, to comfort
him..
Away he then runs out of the boat as if he was be- -
witched,, with fuch an extraordinary fwiftnefs, that
he was out of fight as it were in an inftant; but,
at his return, I perceived him flacken his pace, be-
caufe he had fomething in. his hand. And this I
found to be, as he approached nearer, an earthen
jug with fome water to his father, with two more
cakes of bread,.which he delivered into my hands.
Being very thirfty myfelf, I drank fome of the wa-
ter, of which when his father had drunk fufficienf-
ly, it more revived his fpirits than all the rum I had
given him.
I then; called Friday. 19.me,, and ordered himt.', •
N 3 carr
carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, and fome wate*,
who was repofing himfelf upon a green place under
the fhade of a tree, but fo weak, that though he
exerted himfelf, he could not ftand upon his feet.
Upon which I ordered Friday to rub and bathe his
ancles with rum, as he did his father's. But every
minute he was employed in this, he would cafl a
wifhful eye towards the boat, where he left his fa-
ther fitting; who fuddenly difappearing, he flew
like lightning to him, and finding he only laid
himfelf down to eafe his limbs, he returned back to
me prefently, and then I fpoke to the Spaniard to
let Friday help him, and lead him to the boat, in
order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where I would
take care of him. Upon which Friday took him
upon his back, and fo carried him to the canoe,
fetting him clofe by his father*; and prefently ftep^
ping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled
it along the (hore fafter than I could walk, though
the wind blew very hard too j and having brought
them fafe to the creek, away he runs to fetch the
other canoe, which he brought to the creek al-
moft as foon as I got to it by land, when Wafting
me over, he took our new guefts out of the boat -t
but fo weak were they, that I was forced to make
a kind of a hand barrow; and when I came to my
eaftle, not being willing to make an entrance into
my wall, we made them a handfome tent, covered
with old fails, and boughs of trees, making two good
beds of rice ftraw, with blankets to lie upon and
cover them. Thus, like an abfolate ling, ever
fubjects who owed their lives lo me, I thought
myfelf very considerable, efpecially as I had now
three religions in my kingdom, my man Friday be-
ing a Proteflant, his father a Pagan, and the Spa-
niard a Papifl: but I gave liberty ef canfcience to
them all.
To get provifions for my poor weak fubjecls, I
ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which
when
when he had done, I cut off the hinder quarters, and
choping it into fmall pieces, boiled and ftewed it,
putting barley and rice into the broth. This I car-
ried into their tent, fet a table, dined with them my-
felf, and encouraged them. Friday was my inter-
preter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who fpoke the language of the favages pretty well.
After dinner I ordered Friday to fetch home all our
arms from the field of battle, and the next day to
bury the dead bodies, which he did accordingly.
And now 1 made Friday enquire of his father whe-
ther he thought thofe favages had efcaped the late
ftorm in their canoe; and if fo, whether they would
not return with a power too great for us to refift?
He anfwered, that he thought it impoflible they
could outlive the ftorm; or if they were driven
fouthwardly, they would come.to a land where they
would as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the fea. And fuppofe they had attained
their own country, the ftrangenefs of their fatal and
bloodly attack, would make them tell their people*
that the reft of therrt were killed by thunder and
lightening, not by the hand of man, but by two
heavenly fpirits (meaning Friday and me) who were
fent from above to deftroy them. And this, he faidy
he knew, becaufe he heard them fay the fame to one
another. And indeed he was in the right on't; for I
have heard fince, that thefe four men gave out, that
whoever went to that inchanted ifland, would be de-
ftroyed by fire from the gods.
No canoes appearing feme time after, as I expected,
my apprehenfions ceafed: In (lead of which my form-
er thoughts of a voyage took place, efpecially when
Friday's father affured me I fhould have good u-
fage in his nation. As to the Spaniard, he toM me,
that fixteen more of his countrymen, and Portu-
guefe, who had been fhipwrecked, made their e-
fcape thither; that though tbey were in union with
the
the favages, yet they were very miferable for want
of provifions and other neceffaries. When I afked
him about the particulars of his voyage, he an-
fivered, that their fliip was bound from Rio de la
Plata to the Havannah; that when the fhip was loft,
only five men perifhed in the ocean; the reft having
faved themfelves iu the boat, were now landed on the
main continent. And what do they intend to do
there? fald I. He replied, they have concerted mea-
fures to efcape, by building a vefl'd, but that they
haxl neither tools nor provifions, fo that all their de-
figns came to nothing. Suppofir.g (faid I) I fhould
make a propofal, and invite them here, would they
not carry me prifoner to New Spain? lie anfwered,
no; for he knew them to be fuch honeft men, as
would fcorn to act fuch inhuman bafenefs to their de-
liverer : That if I pleafed, he and the old favage would
go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring
me an anfwer: That they fhould all fvvear fidelity to
me as their leader, upon the holy facrament; and,
for his :part, he would not only do the fame, but
fland by me to the laft drop of his blood, fhoulil there
be occafion.
Thefe folemn affurances made me refolve to grant
them relief, and to ..fend thefe two over, for that
purpofe: but when every thing was ready, the Spa-
niard, raifed an obje£tion, which carried a great deal
of weight in it: Yau kno-w, Si/, faid ho,.. that ha-
ving been fome time with you, I cannot but be fen/ible
ofyourjiock of rice and corn,.firfficient, perhaps, for its
at prefent, but not for-them, foould they come over pre-
.fently; muc% lefs to vicinal. a vejjel for an intended
voyage. Want might be as great an occafion for them
to difagree and rebel, as the children of Ifrael did a-
gaiuft God himfejf, -whsn they -wanted bread in the
•vuilderncfs. And, therefore, my advice is, to -wait ano'
thcr haryejl, and in the mean time cultivate and im-


prove fome more land, whereby -we may have plenty of
•provifions, in order to execute our dejign.
This-advice of the Spaniard's I approved extreme-
ly; and fo fatisfied was I of his fidelity, that I efteem-
ed him ever after. And thus we all four went to
work upon fome more land, and againft feed-time we
had gotten foonuch cured and trimmed up, fuffici-
ent to fow 22 bufhels of barley on, and i6jars of
rice, which was in fhort all the feed we had to fpare.
As we were four in number, and by this time all in
good health, we feared not a hundred Indians, fhould
they venture to attack us: and while the corn was
growing, I pitched upon fome trees, fit to build us a
large vefiel, in caie the Spaniards came oeer; which
being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now
my privy counlellor, to overfee and direct the work.
I likewife encreafed my flocks of goats, by fhooting
the wild dams, and bringing home their kids to my
inclofure: Nor did I neglect the grape-feafon, but
cured them as ufual, though I had fuch a quantity
now, as would have filled 80 barrels with raifins.
And thus, all of us being employed, they in working,
and I in providing for them, till harveft came, God
almighty blefled the encreafe of it fo much, that from
twenty-two barrels of barley, we threfhed out two
hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice,
fufficient to victual a fhip fit to carry me and all the
Spaniards to any part of America.
Ihus the principal objection being anfwered, by
a fufficient flock of provifion, I fent. my two am-
bafladors over to the main-land, with a regal au-
thority to adminifter the oaths of allegiance and
fidelity, and have an inftrument figned under their
hands, though I never afkcd whether they had pen,
ink, or paper; when giving each of them a mufket,
eight charges of powder and. ball, and provifion e-
noueh
nough for eight days, they failed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce 'a fortnight had paffed over my head; but,
impatient for their return, I laid me down to flcep
ione morniug,! when a flrange accident happened,
•which was ufhered in by my man's coming run-
ning to me, and calling aloud, Mafteri mafter, they
are come, they are come. Upon which, not dream-
jng of any danger, out I jumped from my bed, put
on my .clothes, and hurried through my little grove;
when looking towards the fea, I perceived a boat
about a league and a half diftant, flanding in for
the fhore, • with the wind fair. I beheld they did
not come from the fide where the land lay on, but
from the fouthermoft>end of the iflamj: So thefe
being none of the people we wanted, I ordered Fri-
day to lie ftill, till fuch time as I came down from
the mountain, which, with my ladder, I now afcend-
ed, in order to difcover more fully what they were:
ami now, with the help of my perfpeclive glafs, I
plainly perceived an Englifh fhip, which I conclu-
ded it to be, by the fafhion of its long boat; and, which
filled me with fuch uncommon tranfports of joy, that
I cannot tell how to defcribe; and yet feme fecret
doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know not
what caufe, as though I had reafon to be upon my
•guard. And, indeed, I would have no man contemn
the fecret hints and intimations of danger, which
very often are given, when he may imagine there is
no poifibility of its being real; for, had not I been
warned by this filent admonition, I had been in a
worfe fituation than before, and perhaps inevitably
ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to
approach the fhore, as though, they looked for a
place where they might conveniently land; and at
laft they ran their boat on fhore upon the beach,
about half a mile's diftance; which proved fo much
the happier for me, fince, had they come into the

not only have forced me out of my caftle, but'plim*
dered me of all I had in the world. Now I was fully
convinced they were all Englifhmen, three of-which
were unarmed and bound ; when immediately thefirft
four or five leaped on fhore, and took thofe three out
of the hoat as prifoners; one of whom I could per-
ceive ufed the moft paffionate geftures of entreaty, af-
fliction, and defpair, while the others, in a leffer de-
gree, fhewed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very
much aftonifhed, and I beckoned to Friday, who was
below, to afcend the mountain, and likewife view
this fight. 0 mafter, fays he to me, you fee Englifh
mans eat prifeners as -well as Savage mans. And do
you think they, will eat them, Friday? faid I. Test
laid Friday, they eat a all up. No, no, faid I, Fri->
day, I am much more concerned left they murder
them; but as for eating them up, that I am fure they
will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in
not having the Spaniard and Savage with me, tut
alfo that I could not come within fhot of them un-
perceived, (they having no fire arms among them)
and fave thefe three men, whom I thought they were
goi-ng to kill with their fwords. But fome comfort
it 'was to me, that I perceived they were fet at liber-
ty to go where they pleafed, the rafcally feameft
fcattering about as though they had a mind to fee
the place: and fo long did they negligently ramble,
that the tide had ebbed fb low, as to leave the boat
aground. Nor were the two men that were in her
more circumfpect>: for having drunk a little too
much liquor, they fell faft afleep; but one of them
waking before the other, and perceiving the boat
too fait aground for his ftrength to move it, he hal-
looed out to the reft, who made all poffible expedi-
tion to come to him; but, as Providence ordered
it.
it, all their force was ineffectual to launch her, when
I could hear them fpeak to one another, Why, let
her alone, Jack, can't yc, Jbe'll float next tide; by
which words I was fully convinced they were my
own countrymen. All this while I lay very quiet,
as being fully fenfible it could be no lefs than ten
hours before the boat would be afloat, and then it
would be fo dark, as that they could not eafily per-
ceive me, by which means I fhould be at more li-
berty to hear their talk, and obferve all their mo-
tions: not but that I prepared for my defence: yet
as I had now another fort of enemies to combat
with, I acted with more caution. I took two fu-
fees on my fhoulders, and gave Friday three mufltets;
befides, my formidable goat-fkin coat, and monftrous
cape, made me look as fierce and terrible as Hercules
of old, efpecially when two piftols were ftuck in my
belt, and my naked fword hanging by my fide.
It was my defign at firft not to make any attempt
till it was dark; but it being now two o'clock, in
the very heat of the day, the failors were all ftrag-
gling into the woods, and undoubtedly were Iain
down to fleep. The three poor diftrefied creatures,
too anxious to get any repofe, were, however,
feated under the fhade of a great tree, about a quar-
ter of a mile from me. Upon which, without any
more ado, I approached towards them, with my man
following behind me, and, before I was perceived, I
called aloud to them in Spani/h, What are ye, Gen-
tlemen?
At thefe words, they ftarted up in great confu-
Con, when they beheld the ftrange figure I made;
they returned no anfwer, but feemed as if they would
fly from me; Gentlemen, (faid I in Englifh) don't be
afraid, perhaps you have a friend nearer than you ex-
petl. He muft be from heaven, faid one of thein,
gravely pulling off his bat, for we are paft all help in
this world. All help is from Heavent faid I; butt Sir,
as
as I have perctived every aflion between you and thefe
brutes fince your landing, only inform me how to ajp'jl
you, and I will do it to the utmofl of my power.
. Am I talking with God or man, faid he, in melt-
ing tears. Are you «f human kind, or an angel?
Sir, faid I, my poor habit may tell you I am a man,
and an Englishman, willing to affift you, having but
this fcrvant only: here are arms and ammunition:
tell freely your condition, can we fave you? The
ftory, faid he, is too long to relate, fince our but-
chers are fo near: but, Sir, I was mafter of that fhip,
my men have mutinied, and it is a favour they have
put my mate, this paflenger, and me, on more with-
out murdering us, though we expect nothing but
perifhing here. Are your enemies, gone? faid I. No,
replied he, (pointing to a thicket), there they lie,
while my heart trembles, left, having feen and heard
us, they mould murder us all. Have they fire-arms?
faid I. They have but two pieces, faid he, one of
•which is left in the boat. He alfo toid me, there
were two enormous villains among them, that were
the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed
or feized, might induce the reft to return to their o-
bedience. Well, well, faid I, let us retire farther
under the covering of the woods; and there it was I
made thefe conditions with him.
I. That, while they ftaid in the ifland, they fhould
not pretend to any authority; but fhould entirely
conform-to my orders, and return me the arms which
I Thould put into their hands.
II. That, if the fhip was recovered, they fhould
.afford Friday and myfelf our paflage gratis-to Eng-
land.
When he had given me all the fatisfaction I could
defire, I gave him and his two companions each of
them a gun, with powder and ball fufficient, advi-
fing them to fire upon them as they lay fleeping.
The captain modeftly faid, that he was forry to kill
them j though, on the other hand, to let thefe vil-
O kins
lains efcape, who were the authors of his mifery,
might be the ruin of us all. Well, faid he, do as you'
think fit: and fo accordingly I fired, killing one-of
the captain's chiefeft enemies, and wounding the
other, who eagerly called for aififtance; but the cap.
tain (who had referved his piece) coming up to
him, Sirrah, faid he, 'tis too late to call for affift-
ance, you Jbovld rather cry to God to pardon your vil-
lany; and fo knocked him down with the ftock of
his gun: three others were alfo flightly wounded,
who, at my approach, cried out for mercy. This, the
captain granted, upon condition that they would
fwear to be true to him in recovering the (hip,' which
they folemnly did: however, I obliged the captain to
'keep them bound. After which I fent Friday and the
captain's mate to fecure the boat, and bring away the
oars and fail; when, at their return, three men co-
ming back, and feeing their late diftrefied captain,
now their conqueror, fubmitted to be bound alfo.
And then it was, that having more liberty, I related
the adventures of my whole life, which he heard
with a ferious and wonderful attention. After this,
I carried him and his two companions into my little
fortified caftle, fhewed them all my conveniencies,
;end refrefhed them with fuch provilions as I could
afford. When this was over, we began to confider
.about regaining the fhip: he faid, that there were
twenty-fix hands on board, who, knowing their lives
•were forfeited by the law, for confpiracy and mu-
tiny, were fo very hardened, that it would be dan-
gerous for our fmall company to attack them. This
was a reafonable inference, indeed; but fomething
we muft refolve on, and immediately put in exe-
cution: we, therefore, heaved the boat upon the
beach fo high that fhe could not fhoot off at high
water mark, and broke a hole in her not eafily to be
flopped; fo that all the fignals they gave for the
boat to come on board were in vain. This obliged
them
I
ftiem to fend another boat afhore, with ten men
armed, whofe faces the captain plainly defcried, the
boatfwain being the chief officer; but he faid there
were three honeft lads among them, who were for-
ced into the confpiracy. Hereupon I gave him frefh
courage, (for I had perceived he was in concern); in
the mean while fecuring our prifoners, except two,
whom we took to our affiftance, we thought ourfelves
able enough to adventure a b.ittle. When the Tailors
landed, and beheld their boat in that condition, they
not only hallooed, but fired, for their companions to
hear, yet they received no anfwer. This ftruck them
with horror and amazement, thinking their compa-
nions were murdered, they made as if they wouldr
return to the fliip. I could perceive the captain's
countenance change at this, till," of a fudden three"
men were ordered to look after the boat, while the
other feven leapt on Ihore, in order to fearch for their
companions: and, indeed, they came to the brow of
the hill, near my ancient caftle, from whence they
could fee to a great diftance in the woods, and there
fhouting and hallooing till tired and weary, they at
length feated themfelves under a fpreading tree. My
opinion was, that nothing could be done till night,
when I might ufe fome artifice to get them all out of
the boat; but, of a-fudden, they ftarted up, and made*
to the fea fide; hereupon I ordered Friday and the
captain's mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud
as they could, and fo decoying them into the woods,
come round to me again. And this, indeed, had good'
effect; for they followed the noifc, till coming weft-
ward to the creek, they called for their boat to carry
them over, and taking one of the men out of her,
left two to look after her, having faftened her to the
ftump of a little tree on fhore. Hereupon immedi-
ately the captain and our party pafling the creek, out
of their fight, we furprifedthem both, by the captain's
TuiocTcing down one, and ordering the other to furren-
O i der
der upon pain of death, and who, being the honefteft
of them all, fincerely joined with us. By this time it
was pretty late; when, the reft, returning to their
boat, which they found aground in the creekr the
tide out, and the men gone, they ran about, wring-
ing their hands, crying it was an inchanted ifland,
and that they fhould be all murdered by fpirits or
devils. My men would willingly have fallen upon'
them, but I would not agree to hazard any of our
party. But, to be more certain, Friday and the
captain crawled upon their hands and feet, as near
as pollible; and, when the boatfwain approached in
fight, fo eager was the captain, that he fired, and
killed him on the fpot; Friday wounded the next
man, and a third ran away. Hereupon I advanced
with my whole army; and, it being dark, I ordered
the men we had furprifed in the boat, to call them
by their names, and to parley with them. Accord-
ingly he called out aloud, Tom Smith, Tom Smith!
He aufwered, Who's that? Robinfon! anfwered the
oiher, For Cod's fake, Tom, furrender immediately,
or you're all dead men. Who muft we furrender to?
lays Smith. To our captain and fifty men here, -who
have taken me prifoner, -wounded Will Frye, and kill-
ed the lro.itfwain. Shall we have quarters then? fuid
Le. Hereupon the captain calls out, You, Smith,
you kno-w my voice, furrender immediately, and you
fbull all have your lives grunted, except Will. Atkins.
Hereupon Atkins cries out, What have I done, Cap-
tain, more than the reft, -who have been as bad as me?
but that was a lie, for he was the perfon that laid
hold of him, and bound him. However, he was or-
dered to fubmit to the governor's mercy, tor fuch
was I- called. And fo, laying down their arms, we
bound them all, and feized on their boat.
After this, the captain expoftulated with them,
telling them, that the governor was an Englimman,
who might execute them there; but he thought they
would be feut to Lnghnd, except Will. Atkins, who
was
was ordered to prepare for death, next morning.
Hereupon Atkins implored the captain to intercede
for his life, and the reft begged that they might nor
be fent to England. This anfwered our project for
feizing the fhip. For after fending Atkins, and two
of the worft, fail bound to the cave, and the reflr
being committed to my bower, I fent the captain to
treat with them in the governor's name, offering'
them pardon if they would affift in recovering the
fhip. Upon which they all promifed to ftandby him
till the laft drop of their blood; and whoever a£led
treacheroufly, Jhould be hanged in chains upon the
Leach. They were all releafed on thefe affurances;
and then th« captain repaired the other boat, making
his paflenger captain of Her, and gave him four men
well armed; while himfelf, his mate, and five
more, went in the other boat. By midnight they
came within call of the fhip, when the captain or-
dered Robinfon to hail her, and tell them, that with
great difficulty they had-found the men at laft But
while they were difcourfmg, the captain, his mate,-
and the reft entered, and knocked down the feeond"
mate and carpenter, fecured thofe that were upon'
the deck, by putting them under hatches, while the
other boat's crew entered and fecured the forecaflle;
they then broke into the round-houfe, where the
mate, after fome refiftance, fhor the pirate captain-
through the head, upon- wlnich all the reft yielded'
themfelves prifoners. And thus the fhip being re-
covered, the joyful fignal was fired, which I heard
with the greateft joy imaginable: rior was it long he-
fore he brought the fhip to an anchor at the creek's"
mouth, where coming to me unawares, There, fays
he, my dearcjl friend and deliverer, thtre is ymrjbipt
and we arc your fervants; a comfort fo unfpeakable,
as made me fwoon in his arms, while, with griti-
tude to heaven, we were tenderly embracing each o-
ther.
O 3 , Nothing
Nothing now remaining, but to confult what we
ihould do with the~prifoners, whom he thought it
•was not fafe to take on board. Hereupon, concert-
ing with the captain, I drefled myfelf in one of his
fuits, and fending for them, told them, That as T
was going to leave the ifland with all my people, i£
they would tarry there, their lives fliould be fpared j-
if not, they fhould be hanged at the firft port they
came at. They agreed to Qay. Hereupon I told
•them my whole ilory, charging them to be kind to
the Spaniards that were expecled, gave them all my
arms,, and informing them of every thing neceflary
for their fubfiftcnee, I and my man Friday wenjt on/
boar.i. But the next morning two of the men came
fwimmmg to the fhip's fide, defiring the captain to
t ike them on board, though he hanged them after-
wards, complaining mightily how barbaroufly. the
others ufed them. Upon which I prevailed with the
cnptain to take them in; and being feverely whipt and
pickled, they proved more honeft for the future.
And fo I bid farewell to this ifland, carrying along
virh me my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-
'fkin cap; fetting fail December 12. 1686, ' after
twenty eight years, two months, an'd nineteen days
refidence, that fame day and month that I efcaped>
from Salee, landing in England, June n. 1687, after
five and thirty years abfence from my own country,
which rendered me altogether a ftranger there.
Here I found my firft captain's widow alive, who
had buried a fecond hufband,. but in very mean cir-
cumftances, and whom I made mighty eafy upon my
atcount. Soon after I went down to Yorkfhire,
where all my family were expired, except two
fifterSf. and as many of one of my brother's children.
I found no provifion had been made for me, they
concluding I had been lonjj firsce dead; fo that L
was but in a very flender llation. Indeed the cap-
tain di>l n:e n great kindnefs, by his report to the
owners,) how 1 had delivered their fliip on the dcfo-
late
late ifiand, upon which they made me a prefent of
300 /. Sterling. I next went to Lifbon, taking my
man Friday with me, and there arriving in April, I
Biet the J^ortuguefe captain, who had taken me on
board on the African coaft; but being ancient, he
had left off the fea, and refigned all his bufmefs to
his fon, who followed the Brazil trade. So altered
both of us were, that we did not know each other at
firft, till I difcovered myfelf more fully to him. Af-
ter a few embraces, 1 began to enquire of my con-
cerns; and then the old gentleman told me,- that it
-•was nine years Cnce. he had been at Brazil, where my
partner was then living, but my truftees were both-
dead; that he believed I fhould have a good account
of the product of my plantation; that the imagina-
tion of my being loft, had obliged my truftees to give
an eftimate of my fhare to the procurator-fifcal, who,
in cafe of my not returning, had given one third to
the king, and the reft to the monaftery of St Augu-
iline; but if I put in my claim, or any one for me,
it would be returned, except the yearly product,
•which was given to the poor. I then defired him to
tell me what improvement he thought had been made
of my plantation, and whether he imagined it was.
worth my xvhile to look after, it? He anfwered, he
did not know how much it was improved; but this
he was certain of, that my partner was grown vnftly
rich upon his half of itj and that he had been in-
formed, that the king had 260 moidores per annum
for his third part. He added, that the furvivors of
my truftees were perfons of an ingenuous character;
that my partner could witnefs my title, my name
being regiftered in the country, by which means I
fhould indifputably recover confiderable fums of
money. But, anl'wered I, how could my truftees
tiifpofe of my effects, when I made you only my heir?
This,, he faid, was true; but, there being no affidavit
made of my death, he could not,act as my executor.
-However, he had ordered his fon (then at Brazil) to
act
a& by procuration upon my account,'and he bad ta^
ken pofleffioH of my fugar-houfe, having accounted-
liimfelf for eight years with my partner and truftees
for the profits, of which he would give me a very good
account.
And, indeed, this he performed very faithfully, in-
a few days, making himfelf indebted to me 470 moi-
dores of gold, over and above what haii been loft at
fca, after I had left the place. And then he re-
counted to me what misfortunes he had gone through,
which forced my money out of his hands, to buy
part in a new fhip: but, fays he, you fball not -want,*
tnkc this, and -whcn my fan returns, every farthing
Jball be paid yju. Upon which he put into-my hand
a purfe of 150 moidores in gold, as likewife the inftru-
Bient, containing the title to the fhip which his fon
was in, and which he offered as fecurity for the re-
mainder. But really when I faw fo much goodnefs,,
generality, tendernefs, and real honefty, I had not.
the heart to accept it, for fear he fhould ftraiten-
liimfelf upon my accouiit. It is true, faid he, it may
be Jo; but then the money is yours, not mine, and you-
may have the greatejl occafion for it. However, I.
returned fifty of them back again, promifing, that.
I would freely give him the other hundred when I
got my effects in my hands, and that I defigned to-
go myfelf for that purpofe. But he told me he.
could fave me that trouble, and fo caufed me to en-
ter iny name, with a public notary, as likewife my-
affidavit, with a procuration affixed te it; and this
he ordered me to fend in a letter to one of his ac-
quaintance, a merchant in Brazil •, and, indeed, no-
thing could be more faithfully and honourably ob-
ferved; for, in feven months time, I had a very faith-
ful account of all my effects, what fums of money-
were raifed, what expended, and what remained for-
my life : in a word, 1 found myfelf tobe worth 5coo/.
Sterling, and icoo/. per annum. Nor was this all ;•
for my partner congratulated me upon my being a-
live,
live, telling me how much my plantation was' im-
proved, what negroes were at work, and how many
jive Marias he had faid to the virgin Mary for my
prefervation, defiring me to accept kindly fome pre-
fents he had fent me, which I found fhewed the great-
eft generofity.
No fooner did the fhip arrive, but I rewarded my
faithful captain, by returning him the hundred moi-
dores; and not only forgiving him all he owed me,
1 allowed him yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his
fon, during their lives. And now being refolved to
go to England, I returned letters of thanks to the
prior of tit Auguftine, and in particular to my old
partner, with very fuitable prefents. By the cap-
tain's advice, 1 was perfuaded to go by land to Calais,
and there take paflage for England; when, as it hap-
pened, I got a young Englifh gentleman, a merchant's
Ton at Lifbon, to accompany me, together with two
Englifh, and two Portugueie gentlemen; fo that
with a Portuguefe fervant, an Englifn failor, and my
man Friday, there were nine of us in number.
Thus armed and equipped, we fet out, and came to
Madrid, when the fummer decaying, we hafted to
Navarre, where we were informed, that there was
fcarcely any palling, by reafon of the prodigious
quantity of fnow; fo that we were obliged to abide
near twenty days at Pampeluna, and at laft to take
a guide to conduct us fafe towards Tholoufe. And
now twelve other gentlemen joining with us, toge-
ther with their fervants, we had a very jolty company.
Away our guide led us by the frightful mountains,
and through fo many intricate mazes and winding's,
that we infenfibly pafled them, which, as we travel-
led along, ufhered us into the profpe£l of the fruit-
ful and charming provinces of Languedoc and Gaf-
coigne.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical
and comical. Firft, our guide was encountered by
three
three wolves and a bear, who fet upon him and hfs
horfe, and wounded him in three places; upon,which
my man, riding up to his affiftance, fhot one of them
dead upon the fpot, which made the others retire to
the woods. But the pleafanteft adventure was, ta
behold my man attack the bear. 'Tis fuch a crea-
ture, that if you let him alone, he will never meddle
with you: and this my man very well knew, and fo-
begging leave of me, in broken Englifh, he told us
he would make good laugh. Why, you filly fool, faid
I, he'll eat you up at a mouthful. Eatee me up, re-
plied he, by way of fcorn, me not only eatee him, but
make much good laugh. Upon which, pulling off
his boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after
the monftrous beaft:, he called out, that he wanted
to difcourfe with him; and then throwing ftones on
purpofe to incenfe him, the beaft turns about in fury,
and with prodigious ftrides, fhuffles after him. But
though he was not fwift enough to keep up pace
•with Friday, who made up to us as it were for help;
yet being angry, Ton dog, faid I, immediately take
horfe, and let us Jboot the creature. But he cried,
Dear mafter, no Jboot, me make you lau^h much. And
fo he turned about, making figns to follow, while the
bear ran after him, till coming to a great oak, he
afcended in a minute, leaving his gun at the bottom
of it. Nor did the bear make any difficulty of it,
but afcended like a cat, though his weight was very
great. You muft confider 1 was not a little amazed
at the folly of my man, as not perceiving any thing-
to occafion our laughter, till fuch time as we rode
up nearer, and beheld the beaft mounted upon the
oak, on the beginning of the fame branch, to which
Friday clung at the farther end, where the bear durft
not come. Hereupon Friday cried out, NOVJ majler,
me make much laugh, me make Ac bear dance. Upon
which he fell a fnaking the bough, which made the
creature look behind him, to fee how Ire could re-
treat. Then, as if the bear had underftood his ftam-
mering.
mering Englifh; Why you no come farther, Mr Bear?
faid he, pray, Mr Bear, come farther: and then in-
deed we all burft into laughter, efpecially when we
perceived Friday drop like a fquirrel upon the ground,
leaving the beaft to make the beft of his way down
the tree. And now thinking it the moft convenient
time to fhoot the creature, Friday cried our, 0 dear
majler,nojboot, me float by and by; when taking up
the gun, Me nojhoot yet, faid he, me make once more
much laugh. And, accordingly, he was as good as his
word; for the creature defcending backwards from
the tree very leifurely, before he could lay one foot
on the ground, Friday fhot him through the ear,
ftone dead: and looking to fee whether we were
pleafed, he burft out into a hearty laughter, faying,
So we kill de bear in my country, not -with the gun,
but with much long arrows. Thus ended our diver-
fion, to our great fatisfaction; efpecially in a place
where the terrible howlings ftruck us with a conti-
nual terror. But the fnows now growing very deep
particularly on the mountains, the ravenous creatures
were obliged to feek for fuftenance in the villages,
•where coming by furprife on the country-people,
they killed feveral of them, befides a great number of
their fheep and horfes.
Our guide told us, we had yet one more danger-
ous place to pafs by; and if there were any more
wolves in the country, there we fhould find them.
This was a fmall plain, encompaffed with woods, to
£et through a long lane, to the village where we
were to lodge. When we entered the wood, the fun
was within half an hour of fetting; and a little after
it was fet, we came into the plain, which was not
above two furlongs over, and then we perceived five
great wolves crofs the road, without taking notice
of us, and fo fwift as though they were puifuing af-
ter their prey. Hereupon our guide, 'believing there
were more coming, defired us to be upon our
guard. Accordingly our eyes were very circumfpect,
till
till about half a league farther, we perceived a dead
horfe, and near a dozen of wolves devouring its car-
cafe. My man Friday fain would have fired at them,
but I would not permit him j nor had we gone half
over the plain, but we heard dreadful howlings in a
wood on our left, when prefently we faw an hun-
dred come up againft us, as though they had been
an experienced army. This obliged us to form our-
felves in the beft manner; and then I ordered that
every other man fhould fire, that thcfe who did nor,
might be ready to give a fecond volley, fhould they
advance upon us; and then every man fhould make
ufc of his piftols. But there was no neceffity for
this; for the enemy being terrified, ftopped*at the
noife of the fire; four of them were fhot dead, and
feveral others being wounded, went bleeding away,
as we could very plainly difcover by the fnow. And '•
now remembering what had been often toJd me, that
fuch was the majefty of a man's voice, as to ftrike
terror even into the fierceft creatures, I ordered all
our companions to halloo as loud as poffible: and in
this notion I was not altogether miftaken; for they
immediately turned about upon the firft halloo, and
began to retire; upon which, ordering a fecond vol-
ley in their rear, they galloped into the woods with
great precipitation.
Thus we had fome fmall time to load our pieces
again, and then made all the hafte we could on our
way; 'but we had not rode far, hefore we were
obliged to put ourfelves, in a pofture of defence as,
before, being alarmed with a very dreadful noife in
the fame wood, on our left hand, the fame way as we
were to pafs, only that it was at fome diftance fiom
us. By this time the darkfome clouds began to
fpread over the elements, and the night grow-
ing very dulky, made it fo much the more to our
difadvantage; but flill the noife increafing, we were
fully aflured, that it was the howling and yelling
of thofe ravenous creatures; when prefently three
troops
troops of wolves, on our front, appeared to our fight,
as though a great number of them had a defign to fur-
round us and devour us in fpite of fate' But as they
did not fall upon us immediately, we proceeded on
our journey in asfwift a manner as the roads would
permit our horfes, which was only a large trot. It
was in this manner we travelled, till fuch time as we
difcovered another wood, and had the profpect of its
entrance through which we were to pafs, at the far-
theft fide of the plain. • But furely none can exprefs
the terror we were in, when, approaching the lane,
we perceived a confufed number of the fierceft wolves
flanding, and, as it were, guarding its entrance. Nor
were we long in this amazement, before another oc-
cafion of horror prefented itfelf; for fuddenly we
heard the report of a gun at another opening into the
wood, and, looking that way, out ran a horfe bridled
and faddled, flying with the greateft fwiftnefs, and no
lefs than fixteen or feventeen wolves purfuing after
him, in order to devour the poor creature: and un-
queftionably they did fo, after they had run him
down, not being able to hold out that fwiftnefs with
which he at firft efcaped them.
When we rode up to that entrance from whence
the horfe came forth, there lay the carcafes of another
horfe and two men, mangled and torn by thefe de-
vouring wolves: and undoubtedly one of thefe men
was the perfon who fired the gun which we had heard,
for the piece lay by him; but, alas! mof t of the upper
part of his body and his head were entombed in the
bowels of thefe ravenous creatures.
What courfe to take, whether, to proceed or retreat,
we could not tell; but it was not long before the
wolves themfelves made us come to a refohuion: for
fuch numbers furrounded us, every one of whom ex-
pected their prey, that, were our bodies to be divided
among them, there would not be half .a mouthful a-
piece. But happy, very happy it was for us, that but
P a
a little way from the entrance, there lay fome very
large timber trees, which'I fuppofed had been cut
, down and laid there for fale; amongft which I drew
my little troop, placing ourfelves in a line behind
one long tree, which ferved us for a breaft work, when
defiring them to alight, we ftood in a triangle, or
three fronts, inclofing our horfes in the centre, the
only place where we could preferve them.
Never certainly was there a more furious charge
than what the wolves made upon us in this place;
and the fight of the horfes, which was the principal
prey they aimed at, provoked their hunger, and add-
ed to their natural fiercenefs. They came on us
with a moft dreadful noife, that made the woods ring
again; and beginning to mount the pieces of timber,
T ordered every other man to fire as before direfted:
and, indeed, fo well did they take their aim, that they
killed feveral of the wolves at the firft volley; but
ftill we were obliged to keep a continual firing, by
reafon they came on like devils, pufhing one another
with the gre;ueft fury. But our fecond volley fome-
thing abated their courage, when, flopping a little,
'we hoped they would have made the beil of their
way; however, it did not prove fo, "for others made
a new attempt upon us: and though in four firings
we killed feventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice
as many, yet they feveral times fucceffively came on,
as though they valued not their lives for the fake of
their prey.
Unwilling was I to fpend our laft fhot too fudden-'
ly, and therefore called rny other fervant, and giving
him a horn of powder, bid him" lay a large train
quite along the timber, which he did, while Friday
was charging my fufee and his own, with the greateft
dexterity. By this time the wolves coming up the
timber, I fet fire to the train, by mapping a dif-
charged piftol-clofe on the powder. This fo fcorch->
ed and terrified them, that fome fell down, and
others
others jumped in among us; but thefe we imme-
diately difpatched, when all the reft, frighted with
the light, which the darkfome night caufed to appeal
more dreadful, began at length to retire; upon which,
ordering our laft piftols to be fired at once, giving at
the fame time a great fhout, the wolves were obliged
to have recourfe to their fvviftnefs, and turn tail;
and then we fallied put upon twenty lame ones, cut-
ting them in pieces with our fwords, which obliged
them to howl lamentably, to the terror of their fel-
lows, who refigned to us the field as victorious con-
querors. And, indeed, I queftion whether Alexander
king of Macedonia, in any of his conquefls, had more
occafion for triumph than we had; for he was but at-
tacked by numerous armies of foldiers; whereas our
little army was obliged to combat a legion of devils,
as it were, worfe than the cannibals, who, the fame
moment had they flain us, would have facrificed us,
to fatisfy their voracious appetites.
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beafts, ha-
ving killed threefcore of them, and faved our lives
from their fury. We ftill had a league farther to go,
when, as we went, our ears were faluted with their
moft unwelcome bowlings, and we expected every
moment another attack. But, in an hour's time, we
arrived at the town where we were to lodge; and
here we found the place finally guarded, and all in
terrible confufion, as well they might, for fear of
the bears and wolves breaking into the village, in
order to prey upon their cattle and people. The
next morning we were obliged to take a new guide,
by reafon the other fell very bad of his wounds,
which he had received, as Before mentioned. After
we had reached Tboloufe, we came into a warm,
pleafant, and fruitful country, not infefted with
wolves, nor any fort of ravenous creatures; and
when we told our flory there, they much blamed our
guide, for condu£ting us through the foreft at the
"Pa foot
foot of the mountains, in fuch a fevere feafon, when
the fnow obliged- the wolves to feek for fhelter in the
woods. When we informed them in what manner
we placed ourfelves, and the horfes in the centre, they
exceedingly reprehended us, and told us, it was an
hundred to one, but we had all been deftroyed; for
that it was the very fight of the horfes, their fo much
defired prey, that made the wolves more ragingly fu-
rious than they would have been, which was evident,
by their being at other times really afraid of a gun;
but then being exceeding hungry and furious, upon
that account, their eagernefs to come at the horfes
made them infenfible of their danger; and that, if
we had not, by a continual fire, and at laft by the cun-
ning ftratagem of the train of powder, got the better
of them, it had been great odds if their number had
not overpowered us ; befides, it was a great mercy we
alighted from our horfes, and fought them with that
courage and conduct, which, had we failed to do, e-
very man of us, with our beafts, had been devoured;
and, indeed, this was nothing but truth; for never, in
my life, was I fo fenfible of danger, as when three
hundred devils came roaring upon us, to fhun
whofe unwelcome company, if I was fure to meet a
florm every week, I would rather go a thoufand
leagues by fea.
I think I have nothing uncommon in my paflage
through France to take notice of, fince other travel-
lers of greater learning and ingenuity, have given a
more ample account than my pen is able to fet forth.
From Tholoufe I travelled.to Paris, from thence to
Calais, where I took fhipping, and landed at Dover
the 14th of January, in a very cold feafon.
Thus come to the end of my travels, I foon dif-
covered my new found eftate, and all the bills of
exchange I had brought were currently paid. The
good ancient widow, my only privy counfellor,
thought no pains nor care too great to procure my
advantage; nor had I ever occafion to blame her
fidelity,
fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I
was for leaving my effects in her hands, intending to
fet out for Lifbon, and fo to the Brazils; but as in
the Defolate I/land I had fome doubts about the Ro-
mifh religion, fo I knew there was little encourage-
ment to fettle .there, unlefs I would apoftatize from the
orthodox faith, or live in continual fear of the Inqui-
fition. Upon this account, I refolved to fell my plan-
tation; and, for that intent, I wrote to my old friend
at Lifbon, who returned Tne an anfwer to my great
fatisfaction; which was, that he could fell it to good
account: however, if I thought it convenient to give
him liberty to offer it in my name to the two mer-
chants, the furvivors of my truftees, refiding at fthe
Brazils, who confequently underftood its intrinfic va-
lue, having lived juft upon the fpot, and who I was
fenfible were very rich,, and, therefore, might be the
more willing to purchafe it; he did not in the leaft
doubt, but that I fhould make four or five thoufand
pieces of eight more of it, than I could do, if I dif-
pofed of it in any other manner whatfoever.
You may be fure I could not but agree with this
kind and ingenuous propofal; and immediately I fent
him an order to offer it to them, which he accord-
ingly did; fo that, about eight months after, the fhip
being in that time returned, he gave me a fatisfactory
account, that they not only willingly accepted the
offer, but that they had alfo remitted 33,009 pieces
of eight to a correspondent of their own at Lifbon, in
order to pay for the purchafe.
Hereupon, in return, I figned the inftrument of fale
according to form, which they had fsnt from Lifbon,
and returned it again to my old friend, he having fent
me, for my eftate, bills of three hundred twenty-eight
thoufand pieces of eight, referving the payment of
.Gne hundred moidores per annum, which I had al-
lowed him during life, likewife fifty to his fon during
life alfo, according to my faithful promife, which'the
plantation was to make good as a rent-charge.
P 3 ' "~* And
And thus having led my reader to the knowledge-
of the firft part of my life, fo remarkable for the ma-
ny peculiar providences that attended it, floating in
an ocean of uncertainty and difappointment, of adver-
fity and profperity, beginning foolifhly, and yet end-
ing happily j methinks, now that I am come to a fafe
and pleafant haven, it is time to caft out my anchor,
and, laying up my veflel, bid, for a while, adieu to
foreign adventures. I had no other concerns to look
after, but the care of my brother's two fons, which,
•with the good widow's perfuafions, obliged me to
continue at home feven years. One of thefe children
I bred up a gentleman, and the other an expe-
rienced failor, remarkable for his courage and brave-
ry. Befides this, I married a virtuous young gentle-
woman, of a very good family, by whom I had two
fons and one daughter. But my dear and tender
wife leaving this earthly ftage, (as in the fecond part
of my life you will hear), which rent my foul as it
were afunder, my native country became weary and
tirefome to me: and my nephew happening to come
from the fea, tempted me to venture another voyage
to the Eaft Indies, which I did in the year 1694, at
which time I vifited my ifland, and informed my-
felf of every thing that happened fince my depar-
ture.
One might reafonably imagine, that what I had
faffered, together with an advanced age, and the
fear of lofing, not only what I had gotten, but my
life alfo, might have choaked up all the feeds of youth-
ful ambition and curiofity, and put a lafting period
to my wandering inclinations. But as nothing but
death can fully allay the active part of my life, no lefs
remarkable for the many various contingencies of it;
you will next perceive how I vifited my little king-
dom, faw my fucceflbrs the Spaniards, had an ac-
count of the ufage they met with from the Englifh-
men, agreeing and difagreeing, uniting and fepara-
ting, till at laft they were fubjecled to the Spaniards,
•who -
•who yet ufed them very honourably, together with
the wonderful and fuccefsful battles over the Indians*
•who invaded, and thought to have conquered the
ifland, but were repelled by their invincible courage
and bravery, having taken eleven men and five wo-
men prifoners, by which, at my return, I found about
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I
ftaid twenty days, left them fupplies of all neceflary
things, as alfo a carpenter and fmith, and fhared the
ifland into parts, referving the whole property to my-
felf. Nor will you be infenfible, by the account of
thefe things, of feveral new adventures I have been
engaged in, the battles I have fought, the deliveran-
ces 1 have met with.: and while, in the furprifing re-
lation of fuch remarkable occurrences, I mall de-
feribe many of God's kindeft providences to me in
particular, no lefs confpicuous in the fame goodnefs,
power, and majefty of our great Creator, fhewn, one
way or other, over the face of the earth, if duly ad-
verted to,.

i
WHEN we confrder the puifiant force of Na-
ture, and what mighty influence it has
many times over the temper of the mind, it will be
no fuch great wonder to think, that my powerful
reafon fhould be overcome by a much ftronger in-
clination. My late acquired kingdom ran con-
tinually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed
of
of it in the night; nay, I made it the continual
ject of my talk, even to impertinence, when I was
awake; 1 had fuch vapo'urs in my head, that I ac-
tually fuppofed myfelf at my caftle ; that I not only
perceived Friday's father, but the old Spaniard, and
the wicked failors, but that I talked and difcourfed
•with them about their manner of Hying; that I heard
thefe things related to me, which I found afterwards
to be but too true; and that I executed my judg-
ments with the greateft feverity upon the offenders.
And, indeed, this anticipating all the pleafing joys of
my life, fcarcely afforded me one pleafant hour: my
dear and tender wife could not but take notice of it,
which drew thefe affectionate Beeches from her:
My dear, faid fhe, I am really perfuaded that fame
fecret impulfe from heaven occajlons in you a determi-
nation to fee the i/ltmd again: nor am 1 lefs fenfible,
but your being engaged to me, and thefe dear children,-
is the only hinderance of your departure. I know, my
dear, if I was in the grave, you would not long con-
tinue at homes prevent not your happinefs upon my
account, whofe. only comfort centers in you. All that
I can objeEl is, that fuch an hazardous undertaking
is no way conftflent with a per/on of your yean; but
if you are refilved to go, added fhe, weeping, only per-
mit me to bear you company, and that is all that I defire.
Such endearing tendernefs, graced with the rnoft
innocent, and yet moft powerful charms, brought
me infenfibly into my right underftanding-, and when,
I confidered all the tranfkctions of my life, and par-
ticularly my new engagement; that I had now one
child atready born, and my wife big of another; and
that I had no occafion to feek for more riches, who
atready was bleffed with fufficiency, with much •
Struggling I altered my refolutions at laft, refolving
to apply myfelf to fome bufinefs or other, which
might put a period to fuch wandering inclinations.
Hereupon I bought a .little farm in the county of
Bedford, with a refolution to move thither: upon
this-
this there was a pretty convenient houfe, furrounded
with land, very capable of improvement, which fuit-
ed my temper as to planting, managing and cultivat-
ing. Nor was I long before I entered upon my new
fettlement, having bought ploughs, harrows, carts,
waggons, horfes, cows, and fheep; fo that I now
led the life of a country gentleman, and as happy in
my retirement as the greateft monarch in the world.
And what made me think my happinefs the greater
was, that I was in that middle Jiate of lifei which my
father had fo often recommended, much refembling
the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly
defcribed by the poet in thefe lines:
Free from all vices, free from care,
Age has no fain, anff youth no fnare.
But, in the midft of this my happinefs, I was fud-
denly plunged into the greateft forrbw that I could
poffibly endure: for, when I leaft expected it, my
dear and tender wife was forced to fubmit to the ir-
refiftible power of death, leaving this tranfitory life
for.a better. It is impoffible for me to exprefs the
beauties of her mind, or the lovelinefs of her perfon;
neither can I too much lament her lofs, which my
lateft breath fhall record: her influence.was greater
over me, than the powers of my own reafon, the im-
portunities of friends, the inftruclions of a father, or
the melting tears of a tender and difconfolate mo-
ther: in a word, fhe was the fpirit of all my affairs,
and the center of my enterprifes. But now, fmce
the cruel hand of death had clofed my deareft's eyes,
I feemed in my thoughts a ftranger to the world ; my
privy counfellor being gone, I was like a fhip with-
out a pilot, that could only run before the wind.
And when I looked around me in this bufy world,
one part labouring for bread, and the other fquander-
ing away their eftates; this put me in mind how I had
lived in my little kingdom, where both reafon and
religion
religion dictated to me, that there was fomething
that certainly was the reafon and end of life, whicfi
was far fuperior to what could be hoped for on this
fide the grave. My country delights were now asin-
fipid and dull, as mufic or fcience to thofe who have
neither ta-fte nor ingenuity. In fhort, refolving to
leave off houfe keeping, I left my farm, and, in a few
months, returned to London.
But neither could that great city, fo famous for its
variety of entertainment, afford me any agreeable
delight; a ftate of idlenefs I found to be the very
dregs of life, and moft hurtful to body and foul. It
was now the beginning of the year 1694, at which
time my nephew (who, as I before obferved, had
been brought up to the fea, and advanced to be cap-
tain of a fhip) was returned from a fhort voyage to
Bilboa, the firft he had made in that ftation. He
comes to me one morning, telling me, that fome
merchants of his acquaintance had propofed to him fo-
go a voyage for them, to the Eaft Indies and China,
in the manner of private traders: and now, uncle,
faid he, if you'll accompany me thither, I'll engage to
land you upon your old ijland, to vifit thejiate of your
little kingdom.
Juft before he came in, my thoughts were fixed
to get a patent for its pofleffion, and then to fill it
with .inhabitants. After I had paufed a little while,.
and looked ftedfaftly on him, What devil, 'or fpirit,.
faid I, fent you -with this unlucky errand? He Itarted
at firft; but ^recovering himfelf, when he perceived
I was not offended; Sir, replied he, what I have
propofed 'cannot, I hope, be ftyled unlucky, fince
certainly you muft be defirous to fee your little ter-
ritory, where you reigned with more content than
any of your brother-kings in the univerfe. Nephew,
faid I, if you will leave me there, and call for me as
you come back, I care not if I give my confent:
but he anfwered, that the merchants would not al-
low their veffel, loaden with an infinite value, to re-
turn:
turn there again, which was a month's fail out of the
way : -befides, Sir, faid he, if I fhould mifcarry, was
your requeft granted, why then you would be locked
up as before. This, indeed, carried a great deal of
reafon in it; but we found out a remedy, and that
was to carry a framed floop on board, ready to be
fet up in the ifland, by the affiftance of fome carpen-
ters, which we fhould tarry with us, that might be
fitted in a few days to go to fea. J was not long in
forming my refolution, which over-fwayed my good'
friend the widow's perfuafions, and the natural affec-
tion I bore to my young children. I made my will,
and fettled my' eftate in fuch a manner, that I was
perfectly fure that my poor infants would have juftice
done them. The good widow not only undertook to
make provifion for my voyage, but alfo took the charge
of my domeftic affairs, and to provide for my chil-
dren's education; and indeed no mother could take
more care, or underftood that office better; for which
I lived to reward, and return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January 1694-5, my nephew
being ready to fail, I and Friday went on board in
the Downs on the 8th, having, befide that floop al-
ready mentioned, a very considerable cargo for my
new colony. Firft, I had fome fervants, whom I pro-
pofed to leave there as inhabitants, or to work while
I ftaid there, as they fhould appear willing: there
were two carpenters, a fmith, and a very ingenious
fellow who was Jack of all trades; for he was not on-
ly a cooper byatrade, but alfo he was dexterous at
making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn, likewife
a good turner, and a good pot-maker. I alfo carri-
ed a tailor, who confented to ftay in my plantation,
and proved a moft neceffary fellow in the ifland.
As to my cargo, it confifted of a fufficient quantity
of linen, and Englifh fluffs, for clothing the Spa-
niards that I expected to find there; as likewife
gloves, hats, fhoes, ftockings; together with beds,
\ - bedding,
bedding, and houfehold fluff, efpecially kitchen uten-
fils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brafs, &c. alfo nails,
tools of all forts, ftaples, hooks, hinges, and all ci-
ther things neceflary; all which, I think, coft me a-
bout three hundred pounds. Nor was this all; for
I carried an hundred fpare arms, mufkets, and fufees,
befides fome piflols, a confiderable quantity of feveral
forts of fhot, two brafs cannon, befides fwords, cut-
lafles, and the iron part for fome pikes and halberts.
I made my nephew take wirh us two fmall quarter
deck guns, more than he had occaiion for in his fhip,
to leave behind, if there was a neci-ffity; that fo we
might build a fort there, and man it againft all op-
'pofers whatfoever.
Well, we put out to /ea; and though I can't fay
this voyage was fo unprofperous as my others had
been, yet contrary winds drove us fo far northward,
that we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland,
where we Jay wind bound two and twenty days. Here
indeed our provifions were very cheap, and we add-
ed to our fhip's ftores, by taking in feveral live
hogs, two cows and calves, which I then refolved to
put on fhore in my ifland, if our neceffities did hot
call for them. On the 5th of February we failed
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lafted for
fome days; and 1 think it was about the i.oth of
the fame month, late in the evening, when the mate
informed us that he faw a flafh of fire, and heard
a gun fired; and when he was fpeaking, a boy came
in, and told us, that the boatfwain had heard ano-
ther. Upon which we all ran to the quarter-deck,
from whence in a few moments we perceived a ter-
rible fire at a diftance. We had immediately r&-
courfe to our reckonings, in which we were all of o>-
pinion, that thetc could be no land that way, it ap-
pearing to be at N. N. W- Hereupon we con-
cluded that fome fhip iad taken fire at fea, and that
it could not be far off, by the report of the guns
which we had heard. We_made up directly to it,
and
and in half an hour's time, the wind being fair, we
could plainly perceive a great fhip on fire in the
middle* of the fea. Touched with this unhappy
difafter, and confidering my former circumflances,
when the Portuguefe captain took me up, I imme-
diately ordered five guns to be fired, that the poor
creatures, not feeing us, it being dark, (though we
could perceive their flame), might be fenfible there
was deliverance at hand, and confequently might en-
deavour to fave themfelves in their boat. Nor was
it long before the fhip blew up in the air, and the
fire was extinguifhed in the ocean. Eut fuppofing
them all to be in their boats, we hung out our lan-
terns, and kept firing till eight o'clock in the morn-
ing; when, with our perfpectives, we beheld two
boats, full of people, making towards us, though
the tide was agiinft them: then fpreading out our
ancient, and hanging out a wafr, as a fignal for them
to come on board, in half an hour's time, we came
up to them, and took them all in, there being no
lefs than fixty four men, women, and children. It
was a French merchant fhip of 300 tons, homeward
bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The ma-
fter informed me how, by the negligence of the fleerf-
man, the fleerage was fet on fire: that, at his out-
cry for help, the fire was, as they thought, totally
extinguifhed; but, that fome fparks getting between
the timber, and within the ceiling, it proceeded into
the hold, where there was no refilling it: that then
they got into their boats, as creatures in the laft
extremity, with what provifion they had, together
with oars, fails, and a compafs, intending to go back
to Newfoundland, the wind blowing at 8. E. and by
E. though there were feveral chances againft them,
as florins to overfet and founder them, rains and colds
to benumb and perifh their limbs, and contrary winds
to keep them back and ftarve them; but, laid he,
in this our great diftrefs, we heard the welcome re-
port of your guns, when, with unfpeakabls jov, ta-
Q . 'king
king down our mafts and fails, we were refolved to
lie by till morning; but perceiving your light, we
fet our oars at work to keep our boat a-head, the
.fooner to attain your fhip, the happy inftrument of
our deliverance.
Indeed, no one can exprefs the joy of thefe poor
creatures on this occafion; fear and grief are eafily
fet forth; fighs and tears, with a few motions of the
hands and head, are all the demonftrations of tbefe
paffions; but an excefs of joy, carries in it a thoufand
extravagancies; efpecially, I think, amongft the
French, whofe temper is allowed to be more volatile,
paffionate, fprightly, and gay, than that of other na-
tions. Some were weeping, tearing themfelves in
the greateft agonies of forrow, and running flark
mad about the fhip, while the reft were ftamping
with their feet, wringing their hands, finging,
laughing, fwooning away, vomiting, fainting, with
a few returning hearty thanks to the Almighty, and
crofting themfelves. I think, if I am not miftaken,
our furgeon was obliged to let thirty of them blood.
But among the paflengers, there were two priefts,
the one an old, and the other a young man; but
what amazed me more was, that the oldeft was in
the worf t plight; for no fooner did he perceive him-
felf freed from danger, but he dropt down, as it were
without life, and, to every one's appearance, quite
dead; but the furgeon, chafing and rubbing his arm,
opened a vein, which at firft dropped, and then
flowing more freely, the old man began to open his
eyes, and in a quarter of an hour was well again.
But foon remembering his happy change, the joy of
which whirled his blood about rafter than the veffels
could convey it, he became fo feverifh, as made him
more fit for bedlam than any other place; but the
furgeon giving him a fleepy dofe, he was perfectly
compofed the next morning.
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young
prieft. At his entrance on board the (hip, he fell
on
on his face in the moft humble proftratidn to the Al-
mighty. 1 thought, indeed, he had fallen into a
fwoon, and fo ran to help him up; but he modeftly
told me, he was returning his thanks to the Al-
mighty, defiring me to leave him a few moments,
and that, next to his Creator, he would return me
thanks alto. And, indeed, he did fo, about three
minutes after, with great ferioufnefs and affection,
while the tears ftood in his eyes, which convinced
me of the gratitude of his foul. Nor did he lefs fhew
his piety and wifdom, in applying himfelf to his
country people, and labouring to compofe them, by
the moll powerful reafons, arguments, and perfua-
fions. And when, indeed, thefe people had taken
their night's repofe, in fuch lodgings as our fhip
would allow, we found nothing but the beft of man-
ners, and the moft civil acknowledgments, for which
the French are eminently remarkable. The next day
tbe captain and one of the priefts defired to fpeak with
me, and my nephew the com'man-dw. They tolct usv
that they had faved fome money and valuable things
out of the ruined veiTel, which was at our fervice:
only that they defired to be fet on fliore fome where in
our way. At the firft, my nephew was for accepting
the money; but I (who knew how hard my cafe
would have been, had the Portuguefe captain ferved
me fo) perfuaded him to the contrary; and therefore
told them, that as we had done nothing but what we
were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, and what
we ourfelves might expert from others in fuch calami-
ty; fo we took them up to fave diem, not to plunder
them, or leave them naked upon the --land, to perifti
for want of fubfiftence, and therefore would not accept
their money: but as to landing them, that was a great
difficulty; for, being bound to the Eaft Indies, it
was impoilible wilfully to change our voyage upon
their particular account, nor could my nephew (who
was under charter-party to purfue it by way of Bra/.il)

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
anfwer it to the freighters. All that we could do, was
to put ourfelves in the way of meeting fome fhips
homeward bound from the Weft Indies, th;:t, if pof-
fible, they might get a paflage to France or .England.
Indeed, they were very thankful for our firft kind-
nefs; but were under great concern, efpecially the
paflengers, at their being carried to the Eaft Indies.
They begged, therefore, I would keep on the banks of
Newfoundland, where, probably, they might meet
with fome fhip or Hoop to carry them to Canada,
•whence they' came. As this was but a reafonable
requeft, I was inclined to grant it, Cnce it was no
breach of charter-party, and that the laws of God
and nature obliged us to do what good we could to
our fellow-creatures; and befides, the danger we
ourfelves fhould be in for want of provifions: fo we
confented to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind
and weather would permit; if not, that we fhould
carry them to Martinico in, the Weft Indies. But as
ij happened, in a week's time, we made the banks of
Newfoundland, where the French people hired a bark
to carry them to France. But the young prieft being
defirous to go to the Eaft-Indies, I readily agreed to it,
becauie I liked his converfation, and two'or three of
the French failors alfo entered themfelves on board
our fhip.
Now, directing our courfe for the Weft Indies,
fteering »S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with lit-
tle wind, another adventure happened, to exercife our
humanity. In the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes
north, the Jpth of March 1694-5, we perceived a
fail, (our courfe S. E. and by S.), which bore up
to us, and then fhe appeared to be a large veflel,
having loft her main top-maft, fore-mart, and bolt-
.fprit; when firing a gun, as a fignal of diftrefs, wind
N. N. W. we foon came to fpeak with her. She
was a fhip of Brilol, bound home, from Barbadoes,
out of which road fhe had been forced by a hurricane
to the weftward, in whioh they loft their mafts.
They
They told us, their expectations were to fee the Ba-
hama iflamls, but were driven away by a ftrong
wind at N.N.W. and having no fails to work the fhip
\vith, but the main courfe, and a kind of fquare fail
upon a jury fore-mail, becaufe they could not come
near, the land, were endeavouring to fland for the
Canaries; nay, what was worfe, befides all their fa-
tigue, they were almoft ftarved for want of provifion,
having ate nothing for eleven days; all that they
had aboard was fugar, a barrel of frefh water, and
feven cafks of rum. Jn this fhip were three paffen-
gers, a youth, his mother, and a maid fervant, who
were in a moft deplorable condition for want of food.
If I had not gone on board their fhip, the knowledge
of their mifery had been concealed from me, and they
would have inevitably perifhed, though, indeed, their
fecond mate (who was captain, by reafon the true;
captain was not on board when the hurricane hap-
pened) had before informed me that there were fuch
perfons on board, whom he fuppofed to be dead, be-
ing afraid to enquire after them, becaufe he had no-
thing to give them for relief. Hereupon we refolved
to let them have what we could fpare, ordering the
mate to bring fome of his men on board us, which
he did accordingly; as he and they looked like fke-
leions, when meat was fet before them, I ordered
them to eat fparingly. Bur, however, they foon fell
fick; which obliged the furgeon to mix fomething in
their b;oth, which was to be to them both food and
phyfic. When they were fed, we ordered our mate
to carry them a fack of bread, and four or five
pieces of beef; but the furgeon charged them to fee
it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook-room, to
prevent the men from eating it raw, and-confequent-
Jy killing themfelves with what was defigned for
their relief. But, particularly, I defired the mate to
fee what condition the poor paiTengers were in, and
the furgeou gave -him a pitcher of the fame broih
which lie had prepared for the ineu. And being cu-
rioiS
rious to fee this fcene of mifery myfelf, I took the cap-
tain (as we called the mate of the fhip) in our own
boat, and failed after them.
Here was n fad fight indeed! fcarce were the vic-
tuals half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to
break open the cook-room door. To ftay their fto-
machs, the mate gave them bifcuits, which were
dipped in, and foftened with the liquor of the meat,
which they call Brenife; telling them, it was for
their own fafety, that he was obliged to give them
but a little at a time: and fo feeding them gradually,
their bellies were comfortably filled, and the men did
very well again. But when they came to the poor
gentlewoman in the cabin, who, for feveral days, had
continued without food, giving what fhe had to her
fon, they found her as it were in the arms of death.
•4!he was fitting upon the floor'of the deck, with her
bade up againft the fides, between two chairs, which
•were lamed faft, and her head fhrunk between her
fhoulders, like a fenfelefs corpfe. Nothing was
wanting in my mate to revive and encourage her;
opening her lips, and putting fome broth into her
mouth with a fpoon. But not having ftrength to
fpeak, fhe lifted up her head with much difficulty, in-
timating that it was now too late! at the fame time
pointing to the youth her fon, as though fhe defired
him to do what he could to fave the lad; and, in a
little after, fhe died.
The youth, indeed, was not fo far gone, yet lay
ftretched out in a cabin bed, like one that had fcarce
any life. In his mouth was a piece of an old glove,
the reft of which he had ate up. At firft he vomited
what the mate had given him; but at length began
fcnfibly to revive, though in the greateft concern for
the death of his tender mother.
As to the poor maid, (lie lay by her miftrefs, like
o»e in the laft pangs of death: her limbs were diftort-
rd, one of her hands was clafped round the frame of
a chair, which fhe griped fo hard, that it was with
fome
fome difficulty we feparateci her from it: tier other
arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both toge-
ther, fet faft againft the frame of the cabin table : not
only being ftarved with hunger, but overcome with
grief for the lofs of her miflrefs, whom fhe loved moft
tenderly. It was a great while before the furgeon
could bring her to life, and a much longer time be-
fore fhe came to her fenfes.
After we had failed with them fome days, we fent
them five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogf-
heads of bifcuit, with peafe, flour, and other things;
taking three ca&s of fugar, fome rum, and fome
pieces of eight for fatisfaflion, we left them, but took
the youth and maid with us, with all their goods.
The lad was about feventeen years old, very hand-
fome, modeft, fenfible, and well bred, but mightily
concerned for the lofs of his honoured mother, ha-
ving loft his father at Barbadoes but a few months
before. He befeecbed the furgeon to intercede with
me to take him out of the fhip; for that the failors,
not fparing a fmall fuftenance, had ftarved his mo-
ther. But hunger has no bounds, no right, and
confcquently is incapable of any compaffion. When
the furgeon told him, that our voyage might put
him in bad circumftances, and farther from his
friends; he anfwered, he did not care, fo he was
delivered from that terrible crew: that as the captain
(meaning me) had faved him from death, fo he
was fure~he would do him no harm; and as for
the maid, when (he was reftored to her fenfes, fhe
would be no lefs thankful, let us carry them where
we would. And, indeed, the furgeon fo reprefented
their cafe to me, that I confented, and took them on
board, with all their goods, except eleven hogfheads
cf fugar; but the youth having a bill of lading, I
made the commander oblige himfelf to deliver a let-
ter and the deceafed-widow's goods to Mr Rogers,
a merchant in Briftol; but I believe the fhip was loft
at fea, for we,could never hear what became of her
afterwards.
afterwards. We were now in the latitude of 19
deg. 32 min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage.
But, palling by fcveral little incidents relating to
•wind aml weather, I fhall relate what is moft re-
markable concerning my little kingdom, to which I
•was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in
finding it; for as I came to, and went from it before,
on the fouth and eaft fide of the Maud, as coming
from the Brazils; fo now approaching between the
main and the illand, not having any chart for the
coaft, nor land-mark, it obliged us to go on fliore
feveral iflands on the mouth of the river Oroonoko,
but to no purpofe. This I perceived, that what I
thought was a continent before, was no fuch thing,
but a long ifland, or rather a ridge of fands. On
one of thefe iflands I found fome Spaniards, but they
belonged to the Me de Trinidad, who came hither
in a floop to make fait, and to try to find fome pearl
mufcles. But, at length, I came fair on the fouth fide
of my ifland, and then I prefently knew the counte-
nance of my little kingdom, fo we brought the fhip
fafe to an anchor, broadfide within the little cresk,
where flood my ancient and venerable caftle.
No fooner did I fee the place, but calling for Fri-
day, I afked him where he was? But when he look-
ed a little, he clapped his hands, crying, 0 joy, 0
there, 0 yes, 0 there! pointing to our old abode, and
then fell a dancing and capering as if he was mad,
and I had mucii ado to keep him from jumping into
the fea, to fwim afhore. Friday, faid I, what do you
think, fhall we go fee your father? At the men-
tioning his father's name, the poor affectionate crea-
ture fell a weeping: No, no, fays he, me Jee him no
more, never fee foor father more! he hug ago Ju; die
long ago; he much old man. You don't know that,
Friday, faid I, but fhall we fee any body elfe? He
looks about, and pointing to the hill a'bove my houle,
cries out, We fee, we jce, there much men and
there!
there! which, though I could not perceive them with
my perfpeclive glafs, was true, by what the men
themfelves told me the next day.
When the Englifh ancient was fpread, and three
guns fired as a fignal of friendfhip, we perceived a
fmoke rife from the creek; upon which I ordered
the boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging
out a white flag of truce, I went on fhore, accom-
panied alfo by the young friar, to whom I had rela-
ted the hiftory of the firfl part of my life: befides, we
had fixteen men well armed, in cafe we had met with
any oppofition.
After we had rowed directly into the creek, the
firft man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard,
•vvhofe life I had faved, and whofe face I perfectly
veil knew. I ordered them all to ftay in the boat
for, a while; but Friday perceiving his father at a
diftance, would have jumped into the fea, had they
not let the boat go. No fooner was he on fhore,
but he flew like a fwift arrow out of a bow, to em-
brace his aged father. Certai-.Jy it would melt a
man of the firmeft refolution, into the fofteft tears,
to fee with what uncommon tranfports of joy he f,i-
luted him: he firft kiffed him, then ftroked his face,
took him in his arms, laid him under a fhady tree,
fat down by him, then looked as earneft at him, as
one would do at a picture, for a quarter of an hour
together. After this, he would lie upon the ground,
ftroke his legs, and kifs them, then get up and ftare
at him, as though he was bewitched: but the next
day one could not forbear laughter to fee his behavi-
our, for he would walk feveral hours with his father
along the fhore, leading him by the hand, as though
he was a lady; while, every now and then he would
run to the boat, to get fomething for him, as a
lump of fugar, dram, bifcuit, or fomething or other
that was good. His frolics ran in another channel
in the afternoon; for when he fet old Friday on the
ground, he would dance round him, making comi-
cal
cal poftures and geftures: and all this while would
be telling him one ftory or other of his travels and
adventures.
It was on the icth of April, anno 1695, tnat ^ fet
•"y feet upon the ifland a.fecond time. When my
faithful Spaniard, accompanied by one m6re, gff*
proached the boat, he little knew who I was, till I
difcovered myfelf to him: Seignior, faid I, in Por-
tuguefe, don't you know me? he fpoke never a word,
but giving his mufket to his attendant, £xtended his
arms, and faying fomething in Spanifh, that I did not
then underfland, he came forward, and embraced
me, faying, he was inexcu'fable, not to know his de-
liverer; who, like an angel fent from heaven, had
faved his life. He then beckoned to the man to call
out his companions, afldng me, if I would walk to
my own habitation, and take pofleffion, where I
fhould find fome mean improvements: but indeed
they were extraordinary ones; for they had planted
fo many trees fo clofe together, that the place was
like a labyrinth, which none could find out, except
themfelves, who knew its intricate windings. lark-
ed him the meaning of all thefe fortifications ; he
told me he would give me a large account of what
had paffed fince my departure to this.time, and how
he had fubdued fome Englifh, who thought to be
their murderers, hopijig 1 would not be difpleafed,
fince neceffity compelled them to it. As I knew
they were wicked villains, fo I told him, that I was
not only-far from finding fault with it, but was ra-
ther heartily glad that they had fubdued them.
While we were thus talking, the man whom he had
fent returned, accompanied by eleven more, but in
fuch habits, that it was impoffible to tell what na-
tions they were of. He firft turned to me, and
pointing to them ; Thefe, Sir, faid he, are fome of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodnefs;
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he made
them fenfible who I was: and then indeed they fa-
luted
luted me one by one; not as ordinary men, but as
though they had been ambafladors or noblemen,- and
I a triumphant conqueror j for their behaviour -hot
only agreed with a manlike majeftk gravity, but, at
the fame time was fo obliging and courteous, as made
them admirable to the lail degree.
Before I relate the biftory of the tranfactions of
my kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own
mouth, I muft here infert what I omitted in my for-
mer relation. The matter is thus : Juft before we
weighed anchor to fet fail, there happened a quarrel
on board the fhip, which had like to have occafioned
afecond mutiny, till fuch time as the courageous cap-
tain, taking two of the moft refractory prifoners,
laid them in irons, threatening, as they were con-
cerned in the former diforders, to have them hang-
ed in England, for running away with the fhip.
This frightened fome of the reft, as thinking the cap-
tain would ferve them in the fame manner, though
he feemed to give them good words for the prefent.
But the mate having intelligence of this, made me
acquainted with their fears; fo that, to make them
more eafy, and ourfelves more fafe from their confpi-
racies, I was obliged to go down, and pafs my ho-
nour's word for it, that, upon their good behaviour,
all that was paft mould be pardoned; in tefti"iony of
which I ordered the two men's irons to be taken off",
and themfelves forgiven. But as this had brought
us to an anchor that night, in which there was a calm,
the two men- that had been in irons, ftole each of
them a mufket, and fome other weapons, and taking
the (hip's pinnace, not yet haled up,. ran away to.
their brother rogues. The next mormng we fent
the long boat, with men to purfue them; but all in
vain; the mate, in revenge, would have demolimed
my little cattle, burnt its furniture, and deftroyed
their plantations; but having no orders for it he did
not put it in execution. And thus there were five
Englifhmen ia the iflaud, which caufcd great differ-
ences,
ences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect ac-
count of it in the following manner.
You cannot, Sir, but remember the embafly you
fent me about, and what a difappointment we met
•with, by your abfence, at our return. There is but
little variety in the relation of our voyage, being
blefled with calm weather, and a fmooth fea. Great,
indeed, was the joy of my countrymen to fee me a-
live, having aGed as the principal man on board,
the captain of the fhipwrecked veflel dying before;
, nor was their furprife lefs, as knowing I was taken
prifoner by the favages of another nation, they
thought me long Cnce entombed in their monftrous
bowels. But- when I fhewed them the arms, ammu-
nition, and provifions I had brought for them, they
looked upon me as a fecond Jofeph advanced in
Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to come
along with me. Indeed, they were obliged to trefpafs
upon their friendly favages, by borrowing two of
their canoes, under a pretext for fifhing: and they
came away the next morning, but without any pro-
vifions of their own, except a few roots, which
ferved them inftead of bread. After three weeks
abfence, we arrived at your habitation. Here we
met with three Englifh failors, who, I confefs, gave
us provifions, and that letter of directions you had
left for us, which informed us how to bring up tame
goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make pots; and, in
fhort, every thing that was neceflary for our ufe;
as, in particular, I knew your method beft, fo taking
Friday's father to affift me, we managed all the af-
fairs; nor were the reft of the Spaniards wanting in
their kind offices, dreffing food for the Englifhmen,
who did nothing but ramble and divert themfelves in
the woods, either fhooting parrots, or catching tortoi-
fes. But we had not been iong afhore, before we were
informed of two more Englifhmen, unnaturally turn-
ed out of their common place of refidence by the
three others above mentioned : this made my Spa-
niards
niards and me (whom they now looked upon as
their governor in your abfence) endeavour to per-
fuade them to take them in, that we might be as
one family; but all our entreaties were in vain, fo
that the poor fellows, finding nothing to be done
without induftry, pitched their tents on the north
fide of the ifland, a little inclining to the weft, for
fear of favages. Here they built two huts, one
to lodge, and the other to lay their ftores in; for
my good natured Spaniards giving them fome feeds,
they dug and planted as I had done, and began to
live prettily. But while they were thus comfortably
going on, the three unnatural brutes, their country-
men, in a mere bullying humour, infulted them,
by faying, the governor (meaning you) had given
them pofieffion of the ifland, and d—mn 'em, they
fliould build no houfes upon their ground, without
paying rent. The two honeft men (for fo let me
now diftinguifh them) thought their three country-
men only jefted, and one of them invited them in,
to fee their fine habitations; while the other face-
tioufly told them, that Cnce they built tenements,
with great improvements, they fhould, according to
the cuftom of landlords, give them a longer leafe;
at the fame time defiring them to fetch a fcrivener
to draw the writings. One of the wretches fvvear-
ing he fhould pay for the jeft, fnatches up a fire-
brand, and clapping it to the outfide of their hut,
very fairly fet it on fire, which would foon have con-
fumed it, had not the honeft man thruft him away,
and trod it out with his feet. Hereupon the fellow
returns with a pole, with which he would have
ended his days, had not the poor man avoided the
blow; when, fetching his mufket, he knocked down
the villain that began the quarrel. The other two
coming to affift their fellow, obliged the honeft man
to take his mufket alfo, and both of them prefenting
their pieces, bid the villains fland off; and if they
did not lay down their arms, death mould decide the
R difpute
fdifpute one way or other. This brought them to ar
parley, in which they agreed to take their wounded
man and be gone j but they were in the wrong that
they did not difcrm them when they had the power,
and then make their complaint to me and my Spa-
niards for juftice, which might have prevented their
farther defigns againft them. And indeed fo many
trefpafles did they afterwards commit, by Itreading
down their corn, fhooting their young kids and
goats, and plaguing them night and day, >that
they refolved to come to my caftle, challenge all
the three, and decide their right by one plain
battle, while the Spaniards flood by to fee fair play.
One day it happened, that two of my Spainards (one
of whom underftood Englifh) being in the woods,
v ere met by one of the honeft men, who complain-
ed how barbarous their countrymen had been in
deftroying their corn, killing their milch-goat, and
three kids, which deprived them of their fubfiftence;
that if we did not grant them relief, they muft be
inevitably ftarved; and fo they parted: but when
my'Spaniards came home at night, and fupper being
on the table, one of them began to reprehend the
Englifhmen, but in a very mannerly way; which they
refenting, replied, What bufinefs had their country-
men there without leave, when it was none of their
ground ? "Why, faid my Spaniard, calmly, Inglefe,
they muft not ftarve; but they replied, Let them
ftarve and be d—mn'd, they fhould neither plant nor
build, and d—mn them they fhould be their fer-
vants, and work for them, for the ifland was theirs,
and they would burn all the huts they fhould find
in the land. By this rule, faid my Spaniard, fmiling,
we fhall be your fervants too. Aye, by G—d, and
fo you fhall, replied the impudent rafcal. Upon
which, ftarting up, Will. Atkins cries, Come, Jack,
let's have t'other brufh with them; who dare to
build in our dominions? Thus leaving us fomething
heated with a juft paffion, away they trooped, every
man
man having a gun, piftol, and fword, muttering fome
threatening words, that we could then but imperfect!y
underftand. That night they defigned to murder their
two companions, and flept till midnight in the bower,
thinking to fall upon them in their fleep: nor were
the honeft men lefs thoughtful concerning them;
for, at this juncture, they were coming to find them
out, but in a much fairer way. As foon as the
villains came to the huts, and found nobody there,
they concluded that I and my Spaniards had given
them notice, and therefore fwore to be revenged on
us. Then they demolifhed the poor mens habita-
tion; not by fire, as they attempted before, but
pulled down their houfes, limb from limb, not lea-'
ving flick nor ftone on the ground where they flood;
broke their houfehold fluff in pieces, tore up their
trees, fpoiled their inclofures, and, in fhort, quite
ruined them of every thing they had. Had thefe
people met together^ no doubt but there would have
been a bloody battle; but Providence ordered it for
the better; for juft as the three were got thither,
the two were at our caftle; and, when they left us,
the three came back again, but in a great rage,
fcoffingly telling us what they had done; when one
taking hold of a Spaniard's hat, twirls it round, fay-
ing, And you, Seignior, Jack Spaniard, fa.ill have the
fumefauce, if you don't mend your manners. My Spa-
niard, a grave, but courageous man, knocked him
down with one blow of his fift; at which another
villain fired his piftol, and narrowly miffed his body,
but wounded him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged,
the Spaniard takes up the fellow's mufket whom he
had knocked down, and would have fhot him, if I
and the reft had not come out, and taken their arms
from every one of them.
Thefe Englifhmen, perceiving they had made all of
us their enemies, began to cool; bur, notwithfland-
ing their better words, the Spaniards would rot re-
turn them their arms again, telling them, they would
R 2 do
do them no manner of harm, if they would live
peaceably j but, if they offered any injury to the plan-
tation or caflle, they would fhoot them as they
would do ravenous beafts. This made them fo mad,,
that they went away raging like furies of hell. They
were no fooner gone, but in came the two honeft
men, fired with the jufleft rage, if fuch can be, ha-
ving been ruined as aforefaid. And, indeed, it was
very hard, that nineteen of us fhouhl be bullied
by three villains, continually offending with impu-
nity.
It was a great while, Sir, before we could perfuade
the two Englifhmen from purfuing, and undoubtedly
killing them with their fire arms; but we promifed
them jyftice fhould be done them, and in the mean
time they fliould refide with us in our habitation.
In about live days after, thefe three vagrants, almofl
ftarveii with hunger, drew near our grove, and per-
ceiving me, the governor, and two others, walking
by t'ac fide of the creek, they very fubrniffively de-
fired to be received into the family again. We
told them of their great incivility to us, and of their
unnatural barbarity to their countrymen; but yet
•we would fee to what the reft agreed to, and in half
an hour's time would bring them word. After fome
debate, we called them in, where their two coun-
trymen laid a heavy charge againft them, for not
only ruining, but defigning to ra'urder them, which
they could not deny. But here I was forced to
interpofe as a mediator, by obliging the two Englifh-
men not to hurt them, being naked and unarmed;
and that the other three fhould make them reflitH-
tion, by building their two huts, and fencing their
ground in the fame manner as it was before. Well,
being in a miferable condition, they fubmitted to
this at prefent, and lived fome time regularly enough*
except as to the working part, which they did not
care for, but the Spaniards would have difpenfed
with that, had they continued, eafy and quiet. Their
arms
arms being given them again, they fcarce had them •
a week, when they became as troublefome as ever;
but an accident happening foon after, obliged us to
lay afide private refentments, and look to our com-
mon prefervation.
One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in
health, and yet by no means could I compofe myfelf
to fleep. Upon which, being very uneafy, I got up,
and looked out; but it being dark, I could perceive
nothing but the trees around our caftle. I went to
bed again; but, it was all ^>ne, I could not fleep;
•when one of my Spaniards, hearing me walk about,
aiked who it was up? I aufwere-d, It is I. When
I. told him the occafion ; Sir, faid he, fuch things
are not to be ffighted; for certainly there is feme
mifchief plotting near us. »Where are the Euglifh-
men? faid I. He anfwered, in their huts; for they .
lay feparate from us, Sir, fince the laft mutiny. Well,
faid I, fome kind fpirit gives this information, for
our advantage. Come, let us go abroad, and fee if
any thing offers to juftify our fears. Upon which I
and fome of my Spaniards went up the mountain, not
by the ladder, but through the grove; and then we
were ftruck with a panic fear, on feeing a lighr,
as though it were a fire, at a very little dflance,
and hearing the voice of feveral men. Hereupon we
retreated immediately, and raifing the reft of our
forces, made them fenfible of the impending danger;.
but, with all my authority, I could not make them
flay where they were, fo earneft were they to fee
how things went. Indeed, the darknefs of the night
gave them opportunity enough to view them (by
the light of the fire) undifcovered. As they were
in different parties, and ftraggling over the fhore,
we were much afraid that they fhould find out our
habitations, and deftroy our flocks of goats. To
prevent which, we fent an Englifhman and two Spa-,
niards to drive the goats into the valley where the
<ave lay; or, if there was occafion, into the cave
R 3 itfelf
itfelf. As to ourfelves, refnming our native couragey
and prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we
durft venture to attack an hundred of them; bnr, be-
fore it was yet light, we refolved to fend out Friday's
father as a fpy, who, immediately, (tripping himfelf
naked, gets among them undifcovered, and, in two
hours time, brings word, that they were two parties
of two different nations, who lately having a bloody
battle with one another, happened to land, by mere
chance, in the fame ifland, to devour their miferable
prifoners: That they were entirely ignorant of any
perfon's inhabiting here; but rather, being filled with
rage and fury againft one another, he believed, thary
as foon as day-light appeared, there would be a terri-
ble engagement. Old Friday had fcarce ended his-
relation, when we hean? an uncommon noife, and
perceived, that there was a horrid engagement be-
tween the two armies.
Such was the curiofity of our party, efpecially the
Englifhmen, tint they would not lie elofe, though-
Old Friday told them, their fafety depended upon it;
and that, if we had patience, we mould behold the
favages kill one another. However, they ufed fome
caution, by going further into the woods, and pla-
cing themfelves in a convenient place to behold the
battle.
Never could there be a more bloody engagement,.
nor men of more invincible fpirits, and prudent con-
duct, according to their way and manner of fighting.
It lafted near two hours, till that party which was
neareft to our caftle began to decline, and, at Jaft, to-
fly from their conquerors. We were undoubtedly
put into u great confirmation on this account, left
they fliould run into our grove, and confequently
bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we refolved
to kill the firft that came, to prevent difcovery; and:
that too with our fwonb, and the butt end of our
mufkets, for fear the report of our guns fhould be
heard.
And
And fo indeed, as we thought, it happened: for
three of the vanquifhed army croffing the creek, ran
directly to the place, as to a thick wood, for fhelter;
nor was it long before our fcout gave us notice of it;
as alfo, that the victors did not think fit to purfue
them. Upon this I would not fuffer them to be
flain, but had them fwrprifed and taken by our par-
ty: and afterwards they proved very good fervants
to us, being flout young creatures, and able to do a
great deal of work. The remainder of the conquer-
ed favages fled to their canoes, and put out into the
ocean, while the conquerors, joining together, fhout-
ed by way of triumph: and about three in the after-
noon, they alfo embarked for their own nation.
Thus we were freed at once from the favages and
our fears, not perceiving any of thefe creatures for
fome confiderable time after. We found two and
thirty men dead in the field of battle; fome were
flain with long arrows, which we found flicking in
their bodies; and the reft were killed with great un-
weildy wooden fwords, which denoted their vaft.
ftrength, and of which we found feventeen, befides
bows and arrows: but we could not find one wound-
ed creature among them alive; for they either kill!
their enemies quite, or carry thofe wounded away
with them.
This terrible fight tamed the Englifhmen for fome
time, confidering how unfortunate they might have
been, had they fallen into their hands, who would not
only kill them as enemies, but alfo for food, as we
do cattle; and, indeed, fo much did this naufeate
their flomachs, that it not only made them very Ock,
but more traceable to the common uecefiary buifnefs
of the whole fociety, planting, fowing, and reaping,,
with the greateft Cgns of amity and friendfhip: fo
that now, being all good friends, we began to confider
of circumftances in general; and the firil thing we
thought of, was, whether, as we perceived the fava-
ges haunted tint fide of the ifland, and there being
more
more retired parts of it, and yet as well fuited to our
manner of living, and equally to our advantage, we
ought not rather to move our place of refidence, and
plant it in a much fafer place, both for the fecurity of
our corn and cattle?
After a long debate on this head, it was refolved,
or rather voted, nemine contradicente, not to remove
our ancient caftle, and that for this very good reafon,
that, fome time or other, we expected to hear from our
fupreme governor, (meaning you, Sir). whole mef-
fengers not finding us there, might think the place
demolifhed, and all his fubjects deftroyed by the fa-
vages.
As to the next concern, relating to our corn and
cattle, we conferred to have them removed to the
valley where the cave was, that being mefl proper
and fufficient for both-. But yet, when we confi-
"dered further, we altered one part of our refolution;
which was, to remove part of our cattle thither, and.
plant only part of our corn there; fo that in cafe
one part was deftroyed, the other might be preferved.
Another refolution we took, which really had a great
deal of prudence in it; and that was, in not trufting
the three favages whom we had taken prifoners,.
with any knowledge of the plantations which we
had made in that valley, of what number of cattle we
had there, much lefs of the eave, wherein were kept
feveral arms, and two barrels of powder you left for
us, at your departure from this ifland. But though
we would not change our habitation, we refolved
to make' it more fortified, and more lecret. To this
end, Sir, as you had planted trees at fome diftance
before the entrance of your palace; fo we, imita-
ting your example, planted and filled up the whole
fpace of ground, even to the banks of the creek, nay,
into the very ooze, where the tide flowed, not lea-
ving a place for landing: and among thofe I had
planted, they had intermingled fo many fhort ones,
all of which growing wonderfully faft and thick, a
." litde
little dog fcarcely could find a paffage through them.
ISTor was this fufficient, as we thought; for we did
the fame to all the ground, to the right and left hand
of us, even to the top of the hill, without fo much
as leaving a paflage for ourfelves, except by the lad-
der: which being taken down, nothing but what had
wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us.
And, indeed, this was exceedingly well contrived,
'efpecially to ferve that occafion, for which we after-
wards found it necefiary.
Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement,
having, all this time, not one vifit from the favages.
Indeed, one morning, we had an alarm, which put
us in fome amazemenr; for a few of my Spaniards
being out very early, perceived no lefs than twenty
canoes, as it were coming on fhore; upon which, re-
turning home, with great precipitation, they gave us
the alarm, which obliged us to keep at home all that
day, and the next, going out only in the night-time,
to make our obfervations: but, as good luck would
have it, they were upon another defign, and did not
land that time upon the ifland.
But now there happened another quarrel between
the three wicked EnglifJimen, and fome of my Spa-
niards. The occafion was this: One of them being
enraged at one of the favages, whom he had taken
prifoner, for not being able to comprehend fome-
thing which he was fhewing him, fnatched up a
hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but to kill
him; yet miffing his. head, gave him fuch a barba-
rous cut in the fhoulder, that he had like to have
ftruck off his arm; at which one of my good-natured
Spaniards interpofing between the Englifhman and
favage, befeeched the former not to murder the poor-
creature; but this kindnefs had like to have coft
the Spaniard his life, for the Englifhman ftruck at
him in the fame manner; which he nimbly and
wifely avoiding, returned fuddenly upon hint with his
fhovcl, (being ajl at work about their corn-land), and
very
very fairly knocked the brutifh creature down.
Hereupon, another Englifhman, coming to his fel-
low's affiftance, laid the good Spaniard on the earth;
when immediately two others coming to his relief,
were attacked by the third Englifhman, armed with
an old cutlafs, who wounded them both. This up-
roar foon reached our ears, when we, rufhing out
upon them, took the three Englifhmen prifoners:
and then our next queftion was, what fhould be done
to fuch mutinous and impudent fellows, fo furious,
defperate, and idle, that they were mifchievous to
the higheft degree, and confequently not fafe for the
fociety to let them live among them.
Now, Sir, as I was governor in your abfence, fo
I alfo took the authority of a judge; and, having
them brought before me, I told them, that if they
had been of my country, I would have hanged every
mother's fon of them; but, fmce it was an Englifh-
man (meaning you, kind Sir) to whom we were in-
debted for our prefervation and deliverance, I would,
in gratitude, ufethem with all poffible mildnefs; but,
at the fame time, leave them to the judgment of the
other two Englifhmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their
refentments, would deal impartially by them.
Hereupon, one of his countrymen ftooil up: Sir,
faid he, leave it not to us, for you may be fenfble -we
have reafon tofentence them to the gallows: befides,
Sir, this fellow, Will. Atkins, and the two others,
propofedto us, that we might murder you all in your
Jleep, -which -we would not confent to; but, knowing
their inability, and your vigilance, we did not think
Jit to difcover it before now.
How, Seignior, faid I, do you hear what is alled-
ged againft you? What can you fay to juftify fo hor-
rid an action, as to murder us in cold blood? So far,
Sir, was the wretch from denying it, that he fwore,
•d—n him but he would do it ftill. But what have
we done to you, Seignior Atkins, faid I, or what
will you gain by killing us? What fhall we do
oft
to prevent you? Muft we kill you, or you kill us:
Why will you, Seignior Atkins, (faidl fmiling), put
us to fuch an unhappy dilemma, fuch a fatal neceffi-
ty? But fo great a rage did my fcoffing, and yet fe-
vere jeft, put him into, that he was going to fly at
me, and undoubtedly had attempted to kill me if he
had been poflefled of weapons, and had not been pre-
vented by three Spaniards. This unparallelled and
villanous carriage, made us ferioufly confider what
was to be done. The two Englifhmen and the Spa-
niard, who had faved the poor Indian's life, mightily
petitioned me to hang one of them, for an example
to the others, which mould be him that had twice at-
tempted to commit murder with his hatchet, it being
at that time thought impoffible the poor flave fhould
recover. But they could never gain my confent to
put him .to death, for the reafons above mentioned,
fince it was an Englifhman (even yourfelf) who was
my deliverer: and as merciful counfels are moft pre-
vailing, when earneftly prefled, fo I got them to be
of the fame opinion as to clemency. But, to prevent
their doing us any farther mifchief, we all agreed,
that they fhduld have- no weapons, as fword, gun,
powder, or fhcr, but be expelled from the fociety, to
live as they pleafed, by themfelves; that neither the
two Englifhmen, nor the reft of the Spaniards, fhould
have converfation with them upon any account what-
foever: thr>t they fhould be kept from coming within
a certain diftancc of our caftle; and if they dared to
offer us any violence, either by fpoiling, burning,
killing, or deftroying any of the corn, plantings,
buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the fociety,
we would moot them as freely as we would do beafts
of prey, in whatfoever places we fhould find them.
This fentence feemed very juft to all but them-
felves ; when, like a merciful judge, I called out to
the two honeft Englifhmen, faying, You muft confi-
der they ought not to be ftarved neither; and fince it
will
•will be fome time before they can raifc corn and cat-
tle of their own, let us give them fomc corn to Jaft
them eight months, and for feed to fow, by which
time they'll raife fome for themfelves: let us alfo be-
ftow upon them fix milch-goats, four he ones, and
fix kids, as well for their prefent fupport, as for a
further increafe; with tools neceflary for their wort,
as hatchets, an axe, faw, and other things conveni-
ent to build them huts: all which were agreed to; ,
but before they took them in pofleflion, I obliged
them folemnly to iwear, never to attempt any thing
againft us or their countrymen for the future. Thus
difmiffing them from our fociety, they went away,
fullen and refractory, as though neither willing to go
nor ftay: however, feeing no remedy, they took
What provifion was given them, propofing to chufe
a convenient place, where they might live by them-
felves.
About five days after, they came to thofe limits
appointed, in order for more victuals, and fent me
word by one of my Spaniards, whom they called to,
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them-
felves out an habitation and plantation, at the N. E.
and moft remote part of the ifland. And indeed
there they built themfelves two very handfome cot-
tages, refembling our little caftle, being under the
fide of a mountain, with fome trees atready growing
on three fides of it; fo that planting a few more, it
would be obfcured from fight, unlefs particularly
fought for. When thefe huts were finifhed, we gave
them fome dry goat fkins for bedding and covering;
and upon their giving us fuller aflurances of their
good behaviour for the future, we gave them fome
peafe, barley, and rice for fowing, and whatever
tools we could fpare.
Six months did they live in this feparate condition,
in which they got their firft harveft in, the quantity
of which was but fmall, becaufe they had planted
but little land: for indeed, all their plantations be-
ing
mg to form, made it the more difficult, efpeciaMy as
it was a thing out of their element: and when they
were obliged to make their boards and pots, &c= they
could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy
feafon coming on, put them into a greater perplexity
for want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and prevent
it from fpoiling :. and fo much did this humble them,
that they begged of my Spaniards to help them, to
which the good-natured men readily confented, and,
in four days fpace, worked a great hole in the fide of
the hill for them, large enough for their purpofe, to
fecure their corn and other things from the rain, tho'
not comparable to ours, which had feveral additional
Apartments.
But a new whim poflcfled thefe rogues about three
quarters of a year after, which had like to hare ru-
ined us, and themfelves too: for, it feems being tired
and weary of this fort of living, which made them
work for themfelves, without hopes of changing their
condition, nothing would ferve them, but they would
make a voyage to the continent, and try if they could
feize upon fome of the favages, and bring them over
as flaves, to do their drudgery, while they lived at
eafe and pleafure.
Indeed the project was not fo prepofterous, if they
had not gone farther; but they neither did, nor pro-
pofed any thing, but what had mifchief in the de-
fign, or the event. One morning, thefe three fellows
came down to the limited ftation, and humblj defi-
red to be admitted to talk wiih us, which we readi-
ly granted; they told us, in fhort, that, being tired
of their manner of living and the labour of their
handc, in fuch employments, not being fufficient to
procure the neceflkries of lite, they only deiired one
of the canoes we came over in, with fome arms and
ammunition, for their defence, and they would feck
their fortunes abroad, and never trouble us any more.
To be fure, we were glad enough to get rid of fuch,
wretched plagues; but yet honefty made us ingenu-
S oufly
oufly reprefent to them, by what we curfelves had
fufFered, the certain deftruction they were running
into, either of being ftarved to death, or murdered
by the favages. To this they very 'audacioufly re-
plied, that they neither could nor would work; and
confequently, that they might as well be ftarved a-
broad as at home: and as to their falling into the
hands of the favages, why, if they were murdered,
that was nothing to us, there was an end of them;
neither had they any wives or children to cry after
them; nay, fo intent were they upon their voyage,
that if the Spaniards had not given them arms, fo
they had but the canoe, they would have gone without
them.
Though we could not well fpare our fire-arms, ra-
ther than they fnould go like naked men, we let them
have two mufkets, a piftol, a cutlafs, and three hat-
chets, which were thought very fufficient: we gave
them alfo goats flefli,.a great balket full of dried grapes,
a pot of frefh butter, a young live kid, and a large
canoe fufficient to carry twenty men. And thus,
•with a maft, made of a long pole, and a fail of fix
large goats fkins dried, having a fair breeze, and a
flood tide with them, they merrily failed away, the
Spaniards calling after them Bon vcyujs, no man ever
expecting to fee them more.
When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englifh-
men would often fay one to another, 0 bo-w peace-
ably do "we now live,Jlnce thofe turbulent fellows have
left us? Nothing could be farther from their
thoughts, than to behold their faces any more; and
yet fcarce two and twenty days had pafled over their
heads, but one of the Englifhmen, being abroad a-
planting, perceived, at a diftance, three men, well
armed, approaching towards him. Away he flies
with fpeed to our caftle, and tells .me and the reft,
that we were all undone, for that ftrangers were
landed upon the ifland, and who they were he could
not tell 5 but added, that they were not favages, but
men
'»
men habited, bearing arms. Why then, faid I, we
have the lefs occafion to be concerned, fince, if they
are not Indians, they muft be friends; for 1 am fure
there is no Chrillian people upon earth, but what
will do us good rather than harm. But while we
were confidering of the event, up came the three
Englifhmen, whole voices we quickly knew, and ib
all our admiration of that nature ceafed at once. And
our wonder was fucceeded by another fort of enqui-
ry, which was, what could be the occafion of their re-
turning fo quickly to the ifland, when we little ex-
pected, and much lefs defired their company? But
as this was better to be related by themfelves, I or-
dered them to be brought in, when they gave me
the following relation of their voyage:
After two days fail, or fometfcing lefs, they reach-
ed land, where they found the people coming to give
them another fort of reception than what they ex-
pected or defired: for as the favages were armed
with bows and arrows, they durft not venture on
ftiore, but fleered northward, fix or feven hours, till
they gained an opening, by which they plainly per-
ceived, that the land that appeared from this place,
was not the main land, but the ifland. At their en-
trance into the opening of the fea, they difcovered
another ifland, on the right hand northward, and
feveral more lying to the weftward; but being re-
folved to go on fhore fome where or other, they
put over t& one of the weftern iflands. Here they
found the natives very courteous to them, giving
them feveral roots and dried fifh; nay, even their
women too were as willing to fupply them with what
they could procure them to eat, bringing it a great
way to them upon their heads. Among thefe ho-
fpitable Indians they continued fome days, enquiring
by figns and tokens, what nations lay around them;
and were informed, that there were feveral fierce
and terrible people lived every way, accuftomed to
eat mankind: but for themfelves, they never ufed
S a fuch
fuch diet, except thofe that were taken in battle, and
of them they made a folemn feaft.
The Englifhmen enquired how long it was fince
they had a feaft of that kind? they anfwered, about
two moons ago, pointing to the moon; and then
to two fingers; that, at this time, their king had two
hundred prifoners, which were fattening up for the
flaughter. The Englifhmen were mighty defirous
of feeing the prifoners, which the others miftaking,
thought that they wanted fome of them for their own
food: upon which they beckoned to them, pointing
to the rifing, and then to the felting of the fun;
meaning, that by the time that it appeared in theeaft
'next morning, they would bring them fome: and
indeed they were as good as their word; for by that
time they brought eleven men and five women, juft
as fo many cows and oxen are brought to fea port
towns, to victual a fhip. But as brutifh as thefe
Englifhmen were, their ftomachs turned at the fight.
"What to do in this cafe, they could not tell: to re-
fufe the prifoners, would have been the higheft af-
front offered to the favage gentry; and to difpofe of
them, they knew not in what manner: however, they
refolved to accept them, and fo gave them, in re-
turn, one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife,
and fix or feycn- of their tullets: things which tho'
they were wholly ignorant of, yet feemed entirely
contented with; and dragging the poor wretches in-
to the boat, with their hands bound behind them,
delivered them to the Englifhmen, But this obliged
them to put off as foon as they had thefe prefents,
left the donors fhould have expected two or three of
them to be killed, and to be invited to dinner the
next day: and fo taking leave with all poffible re-
fpecl and thanks, though neither of them underftood
what the others faid, they failed away back to the
firft ifland, and there fet eight of the prifoners at
liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to com-
foit, and have fome ccnverfation with the poor cap-
tives
ti'ves; but it was impoffible to make them fenfible of
any thing; and nothing they could fay, or give or
do fpr them, could make them othenvife perluaded,
but that they were unbound only to be devoured: if
they gave them any food, they thought it was only,
to fatten them for the Daughter; or looked at any
ene more particularly, the poor creature fuppofed
hfelf to be the firft Sacrifice; and even when we
brought them to our ifland, and began to ufe them
with the greateft humanity and kindnets,' yet they
expected every day that their new mailers would dc-
Tour them.
And thus, Sir, did thefe three ftrange wanderers
conrlude their unaccountable relation of their voyage,.
•which was both amazing and entertaining. Here-
upon, I nfked them, where their new family was?
They told me, they had put them into one of their
huts, and they came to beg foma victuals for them.
This, indeed, made us all long to fee them; and
taking Friday's father with us, leaving only two at
our caftlc,, we came down to behold thefe poor crea-
tures.
When we arrived at the h'ur, (they being bound
again by the Englilhmen, for fear of efcaping), we
found them ftark naked, expecting their fatal; tra-
gedy: there were three lufty men, well fhaped, with
ftraight and fair limbs, between thirty and five aiuU
thirty years old ; and five women,.two.of them might
be from thirty to forty, two more not above four and.
twenty ; and the laft a comely tall maiden of about fo
venteen. Indeed, all the women were very agreeable,
both in their proportion and features-, except that
they were tawny, which their modeil behaviour, and
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards
came to be clothed.
This naked appearance, together with their mifer-
able circumilances, was no very comfortable light
to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may ven-
ture. Sir, without flattery, to fay, are men. of the
a 3 J beft
beft behaviour, calmeft tempers, and fweeteft na-
ture, that can poffibly be; for they immediately or-
dered Friday's father to fee if he knew any of them,
or if he underftood what they could fay. No foon-
er did the old Indian appear, but he looked at them
with great ferioufnefs; yet, as they were not of bis
mtion, they were utter ftrangers to him, and none
eould .uivderftand his fpeech or figns, but one wo-
man. This was enough to anfwer the defign,
•winch was to allure them they would not be killed,
being fallen into the hands of Chriftians, who ab-
horred fuch barbarity. "When they were fully fatis-
fied of this, they expreffed their joy by fuch
ftrange gelhires, and uncommon tones, as it is not
pclTibiC for me to ciefcribe. But the woman, their
interpreter, was ordered next to inquire, whether
they were content to be fervants, and would work
for the men, who had brought them hither to fave
their lives? Hereupon, (being at this time unbound)
they fell * capering and dancing, one taking this
thing uppn her fhoulders, and the other that, inti-
mating, that they were willing to do any thing for
them. But now, Sir, hasingf women among us, and
dreading that it might occa/ion fame ftrife, if not
blood, I aflced the three men what they would do,
and'how they intended to ufe thcfe creatures, whe-
ther as fervants or women? One of them very pert-
ly and readily anfwered, they would ufe them as
both. Gentlemen, faid I, as you are your own ma-
fters, I am not going to rcftrain you from that; but»
merhinks, for avoiding diflemions among you, 1
would only defire you to-engage, that none of you
will take more than.one for a woman or a wife, and
that having, taken this one, none elfe fhould prefume
to touch her ; for though we have not a pricflly nu-
thority to marry you, yet it is but r>fafcnable, that
whoever thus takes a woman, fhoukl be obliged to
maintain bee: ifnce nobody elfe has any thing to do
•wiih her: and this, indeed, appeared fo j.uft to all pre,-
fcnt,,
fent, that it was unanimoufly agreed to. The En-
glifhmen then afked my Spaniards, whether they de-
figned to take any of them.? 'but they all anfwered,
No; fome declaring they had already wives in Spain;
and othe.s, that they cared not to join with infidels.
On the reverfe, the Englifhmen took each of them a
temporary wife, and fo fet up a new method of
living. As to Friday's iather, the Spaniards, and
the three favage fervants we had taken in the late
battle, they all lived with me in our ancient caftle;
and indeed we fupplied the main part of the ifland
with food, as neceffity required. But the moft re-
markable part of the ftory is, how thefe Englifhmen,
•who had been fo much at variance, fhould agree a-
bout the choice of thefe women; yet they took a
way good enough to prevent quarreling among
themfelves. They fet the five women in one of
their huts, and going themfelves to the other, drew
lots which fhould have the firft choice. Now, he
that had the firft lot went to the hut, and fetched
out her he chofe, and it is remarkable, that he took
her that was the moft homely and eldeft of the num-
ber, which made the reft of the Englifhmen exceed-
ing merry; the Spaniards themfelves could not but
fmile at it: but, as it happened, the fellow had the
bef t thought, in chufing one fit for application and
bufinefs: and indeed fhe proved the beft wife of all
the parcel.
But when the 'poor creatures perceived themfelves
placed in a row, and feparated one by one, they were
again feized with an unfpeakable terror, as now
thinking -they were going to be flain in earneft: and
when the Englifliman came to take the firft, the reft
fet up a lamentable cry, dafped their arms around
her neck, and hanging about her, took their laft
farewell, as they thought, in fueh trembling ago-
nies, and affe£tionate embraces, as would haj-e
foltened the hardeft heart in the world, and made
the dryeft eyes melt into tears j, nor could they be
psrfuaded,
perfuaded, but that they were going to die, till fuch
time as Friday's father made them fenfible that the
Engliflimen had chofen them for their wives, which
ended all their terror and concern upon this OCCSL-
fion.
Well, after this, the Englifhmen went to work,,
and being affifted by my good natured Spaniards, in
a few hours they ere£ted every one of them a new
hut or tent, for their feparate lodging, fince thofe
they hnd atready were filled with tools, houfehold
fluff, and provifion. They all continued on Ae
north fhore of the ifland, but feparate as before -r
the three wicked ones pitching farther off, and the
two honeft men nearer our caftle; fo that tr-3 ifland
feemed to be peopled in three places, three towns be-
ginning to be built for that purpofe. And here I
cannot but remark, what is very common, that the:
two honeft men had the worft wives, (1 mean as to
induftry, cleanlinefs, and ingenuity), while the
three reprobates enjoyed women of quite contrary
qualities.
But anotKer obfervation I made was, in favour of
the two honeft men, to fhew what difparity there is
between a diligent application to bufinefs, on the
one hand, and a flothful, negligent, and idle tem-
per, on the other. Both of them had the fame par-
eel of ground laid out, and corn to fow, fufficient
for them; but both did not make the fame improve-
ments, either in their cultivation or in their plant-
ing. The two honeft men had a multitude of young-
trees planted about their habitations, fo that when
you approached near them, nothing appeared but a
wood, very pleafing and delightful. Every thing
they did profpered and fiourifhed; their grapes plant-
ed in order, feemed as though managed in a vine-
yard, and were infinitely preterable to any of the o-
thers. Nor were they wanting to find out a place
of retreat, but dug a cave in the moft retired- part
of a thick wood, to fccure th*ir wives and children,
wkb
with their provifion, and chiefeft goods, furrounded
with innumerable flakes, and having a moil fubtile
entrance, in cafe any mifchief fhould happen, either
from their fellow countrymen, or the devouring fa-
vages.
As to the reprobates, (though I muft own they
were much more civilized than before), inftead of a
delightful wood furroimding their dwellings, we
found the words of King Solomon too truly verified;
I went by the vineyard of the ftothful, and it u-as all
overgrown with thorns. In many places their crop
was obfcured by weeds; the hedges having feveral
gaps in them, the wild goats had got in, and eaten
up the corn, and here and there was a dead bufh,
to flop in thofe gaps for the prefent, which was no
more than fhutting the ftable-door after the fteed
was ftolen away. But as to their wives, they (as I
obferved before) were more diligent, and cleanly e-
nough, efpecially in their victuals, being inftrucled'
by one of the honeft men, who had been a cook's
mate on board a fhip: and very well it was fo; for
as he cooked himfelf, his companion and their fa-
milies lived as well as the idle hufbands, who did
nothing but loiter about, fetch turtles eggs, catch
fifli end birds, and do any thing but work, and
lived accordingly; while the diligent lived very hand-
fomely and plentifully, in the moft comfortable man-
ner.
And now, Sir," I come to lay before your eyes, a
fcene q'.'ite different from any thing that ever happen-
ed to us before, and perhaps ever bcfel you in all the
time of your refidence on this ifland. I fhall inform,
you of its original in the following manner.
One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or
fix canoes of Indians on fhore, indifputably upon
their old cuftom of devouring their prifoners. All
that we had to do upon fuch an occafion, was to lie -
concealed, that they, not having any notice of in-
habitants, might depart quietly, after performing
their
their bloody execution: whoever firft difcovered
the favages, was to give notice to all the three
plantations to keep within doors, and then a proper
fcoiit was to be placed to give intelligence of their
departure. But, notwithftanding thefe wife mea-
fures, an unhappy difafler discovered us to the fa-
vages, which was like to have caufed the defolation
pf the whole ifland: for, after the favages were
gone off in their canoes, fome of my Spaniards and
I looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curio-
fity to fee what they had been doing, to our great
amazement, beheld three favages faft afleep on the
ground, who, either being gorged, could not awake
when the others went off, or having wandered too
far into the woods, did not come back in time.
What to do with them at firft, we could not tell;
as for flaves, we had enough of them atready; and as
to killing them, neither Chriftianity nor humanity
would fuffer us to fhed the blood of perfons who ne-
ver did us wrong. We perceived they had no boat
left them to tranfport them to their own nation; and
that, by letting them wander about, they might dif-
cover us, and inform the firft favnges that fhould
happen to land upon the fame bloody occafion,
which information might entirely ruin us; and there-
fore I counfelled my Spaniards to feeure them, and
let them about fome work or other, till we could
better difpofe of them.
Hereupon we all went back, nnd making them a-
wake, took them prifoners. It is impofifble to ex-
prefs the horror they were in, efpecially when bound,
as thinking they were going to be murdered and
eaten, but we foon eafed them of their fear as to that
point. We firft took them to the bower, where
the chief of our country-work lay, as keeping goaOv
planting corn, &c. and then carried them to the two
Englifhmens habitation, to help them in their bufi-
nefs: but happy it was for us all, we did not carry
them to our caftle, as by the fequel will appear.
The
The J.nglifhmen, indeed, found them work to do;
but whether they did not guard them ftrictly, or
that they thought they could not better themfelves, I
cannot tell ; but certainly one of them ran away into
the woods, and they could not hear of him for a long
time after.
Undoubtedly, there was reafon enough to fuppofe
he got home in fome of the canoes, the favages re-
turning in about four weeks time, and going off in
the fpace of two days. You mny be certain, Sir,
this thought could not but terrify us exceedingly,
and make us juftly.conclude, that this favage would
inform his countrymen of our abode in the ifland,
how few and weak we were in compaiifon to their
numbers; and we expe£led it would not. be long
before the Englifhmen would be attacked in their ha-
bitations: but the favages had not feen their places
of fafety in the woods, nor our caftle, which it was a
great happinefs they did not know.
Nor were we miftaken in our thoughts upon this
.occafion; for, about eight months after this, fix ca-
noes, with about ten men in each canoe, came fail-
ing by the north fide of the ifland, which they were
never accuftomed to do before, and landed about an
hour after fun-rife, near a mile from the dwelling of
the two Englifhmen, who, itfeems, had the good for-
tune to difcover them about a league off; ib that it
was an hour before they could attaiii the fliore, and
fome longer time before they could come at them.
And now, being confirmed in this opinion, that they
vere certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the
two flaves which were left, caufing two of the three
men, whom they brought with the women, and who
proved very faithful, to lead them with their wives,
and other conveniencies, into their retired cave in the
wood, and there to bind the two fellows hand and
foot, till they had further orders. They then open-
ed their fences, where they kept their milch goats,
and drove them all out, giving the goats liberty to
. . ramble
ramble in the woods, to make the favages believe
that they were wild ones; but the flave had given a
truer information, which made them come to the
very inclofures. The two frighted men fent the
other flave of the three, who had been with them by
accident, to alarm the Spaniards, and defire their af-
fiftance; in the mean time, they took their arms
and ammunition, and made to the cave where they
had fent their wives, and fecuring their flaves, feated
themfelves in a private place, from whence they
mig-ht behold all the actions of the favages. Nor
had they gone far, when afcending a riling ground,
they could fee a little army of Indians approach to
their beautiful dwelling, and, in a few moments
more, perceive the fame, and their furniture, to their
unfpeakable grief, burning in a confuming flame:
and when this was done, they fpread here and there,
fearching every bum and place for the people, of
•whom, it was very evident, they had information.
Upon which the two Englifhmen, not thinking them-
felves fecure where they flood, retreated about half
a mile higher in the country, rightly concluding,
that the farther the favages lliolled, there would be
jeffer numbers together: upon which they next took
their ftand by the trunk of an old tree, very hollow
and large, whence they refolved to fee what would
offer; but they had not ftoo,ci long there, before two
favages came running directly towards them, as
though having knowledge of their being there, who
feemed refolved to uttr.ck them; a little farther were
.three more, and five more behind them again, all
running the fane way. It cannot be imagined what
perplexity the poor men were in at this fight, think-
ing that if aififtance did not fpeedily come, their
•cave in the wood would be difcovered, and confe-
iquently all therein loft: io they refolved to refift
them there, and, when overpowered, to afcend to
the top of the trers, where they might defend them-
idvts as long as their ammunition Jailed, and fell
their
their lives as dear as poffible to thofe devouring fa-
vages. Thus fixed in their refoludon, they next
confidered, whether they fhould fire at the firft two,
or wait for the three, and fo take the middle party,
by which the two firft and the five laft would be fe-
parated. In this regulation the two favages alfo
confirmed them, by turning a little to another part
of the wood; but the three, and the five after them,
came directly towards the tree. Hereupon they re-
folved to take them in a direft line, as they approach-
ed nearer, becaufe perhaps the firft fhot might hit
them all three; and, upon this -occafion, the man
who was to fire, charged his piec« with three or four
bullets. And thus, while they were waiting, the fa-
vages came on, one of them was the runaway, who
had caufed all the mifchief; fo they refolved he
fhould not efcape, if they both fired at once. But
however, though they did not fire together, they were
ready charged; when the firft that let fly, was too
good a markfman to mifs his aim ; for he killed the
foremoft outright, the fecond (who was the runaway
Indian) fell on the ground, being fhot through the
body, but not dead, and the third was a little wound-
ed on the fhoulder, who, fitting down on the ground,
fell a fcreaming in a moft fearful manner. The noife
of the guns, which not only made the moft refound-
ing echoes, from one fide to another; but raifed
the birds of all forts, fluttering with the moft con-
fufed noife, fo much terrified the five favages behind,
* j/.ihat they flood ftill at firft, like fo many inanimate
Images. 'But when all things were in profound fi-
lence, they .came to the place wiere their companions
lay: and here, not being fenfible that they were
liable to the fame fate, Hood over the wounded
.man, undoubtedly enquiring the occafion of his fad
calamity; and, 'tis as reafonable to fuppofe, he told
them, that it came by thunder and lightening from
the gods, having never feen nor heard of a gun be-
fore, in the whole courfe of their Jives. By this
T time
> \
time the Englifhmeo, having loaded their pieces,
fired both together a fecond time, when feeing them
all fall immediately OH the ground, they thought
they had killed every creature of them. This made
them come up boldly before they had charged their
guns, which, indeed, was a wrong flep; for, when
they came to the place, they found four alive, two
of them very little wounded, and one not at all,
which obliged them to fall upon them with their
mufkets: they firft knocked the runaway favage
on the head, and another that was but a little wound-
ed in the arm, and then put the other languifhing
wretches out of their pain: while he that was not
hurt, with bending knees, and uplifted hands, made
jpitcous moans, and figns to them to fpare his life:
nor, indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch,
but pointed to him to fit down at the root of a tree
hard by; and then, one of the Englifhmen, with a
piece of rope twine he had in his pocket by mere
chance, tying his two feet faf t together, and his two
hands behind him, they left him there, making all
the hafte they could after the other two, fearing they
fhould find out their cave; but though they could
not overtake them, they had the fatisfaction <o per-
ceive them, at a diftance, crofs a valley towards the
fea, ai quite contrary way to their retreat; upon
•which they returned to the tree, to look after their
prifonerj but when they came there, he was gone,
kaving the pieces of rope-yarn, wherewith he was
bound, behind him.
Well, now they were as much concerned as ever,
as not knowing how near their enemies might be, or
in what numbers. Immediately they repaired to their
cave, to fee if all was well there, and found every
thing fafe except the women, who were frighted
upon their hufbands account, whom now they loved
entirely. They had not been long here, before fevcn
of my Spaniards came to afllft them; while the other
ten, their femnts, and Friday's father, were gone to
defend
defend their bower, corn and cattle, in cafe the fa-
vages fhould have rambled fo far. There accom-
panied the feven Spaniards, one of the three favages
that had formerly been taken prifoner; and with
them alfo, that very Indian whom the Englifhmeni
had, a little before, left under the tree; for, it feems,
they patted by that way where the flaughter was
made, and fo carried along with them that poor
wretch that was left bound. But fo many prifoners
now becoming a burthen to us, and fearing the
dreadful confcquence of their efcaping, moft of the
Spaniards and Englilh urged the abfolute neceffity
there was of killing them for our common preferva-
tion: but, Sir, the authority I bore, as a governor,
over-ruled that pie.ce of cruelty; and then I ordered
them to be fent prifoners to the old cave in the valley,
bound hands and feet, with two Spaniards to guard
them.
So much -encouraged were the Englifhmen at the
approach of the Spaniards, and fo great was their fu-
ry againft the favages, for deftroying their habita-
tions, that they had not patience to flay any longer;
but, taking five Spaniards along with them, armed
•with four mufkets, a piftol, and a quarter-ftaff, away
they went in purfuit of their enemies. As they paf-
fed by the place where the favages were flain, it was
very cafy to be perceived that more of them had been
there, having attempted to carry off their dead bodies,
but found it impracticable. From a rifing ground,
our party had the mortification to fee the fmoke that
proceeded from the ruins; when coming farther in
fight of the fhore', they plainly perceived that the fa-
vages. had embarked in their canoes, and were putting,
out to fea. This they were very "forry for, there be-
ing no coming at them to give them a parting falutej
but, however, they were glad enough to get clear of
fuch unwelcome guefts.
Thus the two honeft, but unfortunate, Englifhmen,
ruined a fecond time, and'their improvements
T ^ quite
,.-^_.- ;' t_
quite destroyed, moft of my good-natured Spaniards
helped them to rebuild, and we all affifted them with
needful fupplies ; nay, what is more remarkable, their
three mifchievous countrymen, when they heard it,
(which was after all thefe difafters were over, they li-
ling remote eafhvard) very friendly fympathifed with
them, and worked for them feveral days: fo that, in
a little time, their habitation was rebuilt, their necef-
fities fupplied, and themfelves reflored to their former
tranquillity.
'1 hough the favages had nothing to boaft of in
this adventure, (feveral canoes being driven afhore,
followed by two drowned creatures, having un-
doubtedly met with a florm at fea that very night
they departed) yet it was natural to be fuppofed, that
thofe whofe better fortune it was to attain their na-
tive fliore, would inflame their nation to another
ruinous attempt, with a greater force, to carry all
before them. And, indeed, fo it happened; for, a-
fcout feven months after, our ifland was invaded with
a mofl formidable navy, no lefs than eight and twen-
ty canoes full of favages, .armed with wooden fwords,.
inonftrous clubs, bows and arrows, and fuch like
inftruments of war, landing at the eaft fide of the
ifland.
You may well, Sir, imagine, what confirmation
our men were in upon this account, and how fpeedy
they were to execute their refolution, having only
that night's time allowed them. They knew, that
fince they could not withftand their enemies, con-
cealment was the only way to procure their fafety:
and, therefore, they took down the huts that were
built for the two Englifhmen, and drove their flock of
goats, together with their own at the bower, to the
old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance of
inhabitants as pofllble; and then pofted themfelves,
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men.
As they expected, fo it happened; for, early the next
morning, the Indians, leaving their canoes at the eaft.
end*

about two hundred and fifty in number, as near as
could be g,uefiixl. Our array was but little indeed;
and what was our greater misfortune, we bad nor
arms AwScient fcr them. The account, as to the
men, .Sir, is as follows:
j-7 Spaniards.

I Old Friday.
3 TTie three fjvagcs, ta-

•who proved faithful

3- Other Jlaves, living

5 fflirfiftT, or fo-wifng-
• pie.ce.si taken from the

duced-.
As to our flaves, we gave three of them halberts,
and the other three long (laves, with great iron
fpikes at the end of them, with hatchets by theit
fides: we alfo had hatchets flicking in our girdles,
befides the fire-arms: nay, two of the women, in- .
fpired with Amazonian fortitude, could not be dif-
fuaded from fighting along with their deareft buf-
bands, and if they died, to die with them. Seeing
their refolution, we g,ve them hatchets likewife; but
•what pleafed them belt, were the bows and arrows
(which they dexteroufiy knew how to ufe). that the
Indians had left behind them, after their memorable
battle one againft another.
Over this army, which, though little, was of great
intrepidity, I was conftituted chief general and com-
mander; and .knowing Will, dthins, though exceed-
ing wicked-, yet a man of invincible courage, I gave
him the power of commanding under me: he and
fix men, with their mufkets loaded, with fix or feven
bullets a-piece, were planted juft behind a fmall thick-
et of bufhes, as an advanced guard, having orders
to let the firft pafs by; and then, when he fired into
the middle of them, make a nimble retreat round
T 3 F-rt
part of the wood, and fo come in the rear of tns
Spaniards, who were fhaded by a thicket of trees:
for though the favages came on with the fiercenefs of
lions, yet they wanted the fubtiltyof foxes, being-
out of all manner of order, and fhaggling in heaps
every way: and, indeed, when Will. Atkins, after fifty
of the favages had pafled by, had ordered three of his
men to give fire, fo great was their confternation, to
fee fo many men killed.and wounded, and hear fuch
a dreadful noife, and yet not know whence it came,
that they were frightened to the higheft degree;
•and when the fecond volley was given, they con-
cluded no lefs but that their companions were flain
by thunder and lightening from heaven. In this no-
tion they would have continued, had Will. Atkins
and his men retired, as foon as they fired, according.
to order: or had the reft been near them, to pour
in their fhot continually, there might have been *
complete victory obtained; but flaying to load their
pieces again, difcovered the whole matter. They
were perceived by feme of the feathering favages at *
diftance, who let fly their arrows among them»
•wounded Atkins himfelf, and killed his fellow Eng-
lifhman, and one of the Indians taken with the wo-
men. OuF party did not fail to anfwer them, and in>
their retreat killed about twenty favages. Here I can-
not but take notice of our poor dying flave, who, tho°
ftopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his
ftaff and hatchet defperately and gallantly afiailed the-
purfuers, and killed five of the favages, before his
life fubmitted to a multiplicity of wounds. Nor is-
the cruelty or malice of the Indians to be lefs re-
marked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of.
the two dead bodies with their clubs and wooden
fwords, after a moil wretched manner. As Atkins
retreated, our party advanced, to interpofe between-
him and the favages; but, after three volleys, we
vrere obliged to retreat alfo: for they were fo nume-
rous and defperate, that they came up to our very-
teeth.
teeth, fhot their arrows like a cloud, and their wound-
ed men, enraged with cruel pain, fought like mad-
men. They did not, however, think fit to follow
us, but drawing themfelves up in a circle, they gave
two triumphant fhouts in token of victory, though
they had the grief to fee feveral of their wounded
men bleed to death before them.
After I had, Sir, drawn up our little army toge-
ther upon a rifing ground, Atkins, wounded as he
•was, would have had us attack the whole body of the
favages at once. I was extremely well pleafed with
the gallantry of the man; but, upon confideration, I
replied, You perceiw, Seignior Atkins, how their
•wounded men fight; let them alone till morning, when
they -will be faint, Jliff, and fore, and then -we JbalL
have fewer to combat with. To which Will. Atkins,'
fmiling, replied, That's very true, Seignior, and Jo.
flail 1 too; and that's the renfon I fu on Id fight them-
now I am -warm. We all anfwered, Seignior Atkins,
for your part, you have behaved very gallantly; and,
if you are not able to approach the enemy in the morn-
ing, we will fight for you, till then we think it con^
venient to wait, and fo we tarried.
By the brightnefs of the moon, that night, we per-
eeived the favages in great diforder about their deadT
and wounded men. This made us change our refo-
kition, and refolve to fall upon them ia the night,
if we could give them one volley undifcovered. This
we had a fair opportunity to do, by one of the two
Englifhmen's leading us round,, between the woods
and the fea-fide weftward, and turning fhort fouth,
came privately to a place where the thickeft of them,
were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us fired
among them, and did dreadful execution; and, ia
half a minute after, eight more of us let fly, killing
and wounding abundance of them; and then divi-
ding ourfelves into three bodies* eight perfons in each
body, we marched from among the trees to the very
teeth, of the enemy, fending forth the greateft fhouts'
and
an<l acclamations. The favages hearing a different
noitc: from three quarters at once, flood in the ut-
rnoft confufion; but coming in fight of us, let fly a
volley of arrows, which wounded poor old Friday,
yet happily it diJ not prove mortal. We did not,:
.however, give them a iecond opportunity; but rufliing.
in among them, we fired three feveral ways, and then,
fell to work with our fwords, fhves, hatchets, and'
the butt end of our mufkets, with, a fury not to be
refifted; fo that, with the moil difrnal fcreanung and
howling; they had reeourfe to their feet, to fave their
lives by a fpeecly flight. Normufl we forget the va-
lour of the two women; for they expofcd themfelves-
U> the greatefl dangers, killed many with their arrows,-
and valiantly deftroyed feveral more with their hat-
chets.
In fig-hting thefe two' battles, we were fo much,
tired, that we did not then trouble ourfeives to pur-
fue them to their canoes, in which we thought they
•would prefcntly put to the ocean; but there happen-
ing a dreadful flormat fea, which continuing, all that
night, it not only prevented their voyage, but daflied.
feveral of their boats to pieces againft the beach,
and drove the reft fo high upon the more, that it
required infinite pains to get them off. After our
men had taken fome refrefhment and a little repofe,
they refolwed early in the morning to go towards the
place of their landing, and fee whether they were
gone off-, or in what pofture they remained. This
neceffarily led them to the place of battle, where
feveral of the favages were expiring, a fight no way
pleafing to generous minds, to delight in their mifery,
though obliged to conquer them by the law of arms:
but our own Indian flaves put them out of their pain,
by difpatching them with their hatchets. At length,
coming in view of the remainder of their army, we
found them leaning upon their knees, which were
bended towards their mouth, and the head between
the two hands. Henntpon, coming within mufket-
ihot
fhot of them, I ordered two pieces to be fired with-
out ball, in order to alarm them, that we might
plainly know, whether they had the courage to ven-
ture another battle, or were utterly difpirited from
fuch an attempt, that fo we might accordingly ma-
nage them. And, indeed, the project took very well;
for, no fooner did the favages hear the firft gun, and
perceive the flam of the fecond, but they fuddenly
ftarted upon their feet, in the greater! confternation;
and when ws approached towards them, they ran
yowling and fcreaming away up the hill into the coun-
try.
We could rather, at firft, have wifhed, that the
weather had permitted them to have gone off to the
fea; but when we confidered, that their efcape might
occafion the approach of multitudes, to our utter ruin
and diflblution, we were vqry well pleafed the contra-
ry happened: and Will. Atkins (who, though wound-
ed, would not part from us all this while) advifed us
net to let flip this advantage, but clapping between
them and their boats, deprive them of the capacity of
e.ver returning to plague the ifland: / kno-w, (faid he)
there is but one objeElian you can make, -which is, that
thefe creatures, living like beafts in the -wood, may
make excurftons, rifle the plantationst and dejtroy the
tame goats: but then canfider, -we had better to do
'iuith an hundredmen, whom vie can kill, or make Jlaves
ff, at leifure, than with an hundred nations, whom
it is impojjible -wejhouldfave our/elves from, much lefs
fubdue. This advice, and thefe arguments being ap-
proved of, we fet fire to their boats; and though they
were fo wet that they would not burn entirely, yet
we made them incapable for fwimming in the feas.
As foon as the Indians perceived what we were doing,
many of them ran out of the woods, in fight of us,
and, kneeling down piteoufly, cried out, Oa, Oa, IVa-
ramakoa, intimating, I fuppofe, that, if we would
but fpare their canoes, they would never trouble us
. ''...-..
But
Btit all their complaints, fubmiflions, and entrea-
ties, were in Vain: for felf-prefervation obliging us
to the contrary, we deftroyed every one of them that
had efcaped the fury of the ocean. When the In-
dians perceived this, they raifed a lamentable cry,
and ran into the woods, where they continued ran-
ging aboat, making the woods ring with their la-
mentation. Here we fhould have confidered, that
making thefe creatures thus defperate, we ought, at
the fame tifne, to have fet a fufficient guard upon
the plantations: for the favages, in their ranging
about, found out the bower, deftroyed the fences,,
trod the corn down under their feet, and tore up
the vines and grapes. It is true, we were always able
to fight thefe creatures; but, as they were too fwift
for us, and very numerous, we durft not go out fingle,
for fear of them ; though that too was needlcfs, they
having na weapons, nor any materials to make them;
and, indeed, their extremity appeared in a little time
after.
Though the favages, as already mentioned, had
deftroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &£•
yet we had ftill left OUT ftock of cattle in the valley
by the cave, with fome little corn that grew there,
and the plantation of Will. Atkins nnd his com-
panions, one of whom being killed by an arrow,
they were now reduced to two: it is remarkable,
that this was the fellow who cut thepoor Indian with
his hatchet, and had a defign to murder me and my
countrymen the Spaniards. As our condition was
fo low, we came to the refolution to drive the f:wa-
ges up to the farther part of the ifknd, where no In-
dians landed: to kill as many of them as we could,
till we had reduced their number; and then to give
the remainder fome corn to plant, and to teach them
how to live by their daily labour. Accordingly, we
purfued them with OINF guns, at the hearing cf
•which, they were fo terrified, that they would fall
to thje ground. Every day we killed, and wound-
ed
ed forne of them, and many we found ftarved to
death, fo that our hearts began to relent at the fight
offuch roiferable objects. At laft, with great diffi-
culty, taking one of them alive, and uling him with
kindnefs and tendernefs, we brought him to Old
Friday, who talked to him, and told him, how
good we would be to them, all, giving them corn
and land to plant and live in, and prefent nourish-
ment, provided they would keep within fuch bounds
as fhould be slotted them, and not do prejudice to
others: Co thent faid he, and in/arm yaur countrymen
cfthis; -which, if they will not agree ty} every one of
themfball bejlain.
The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being
reduced to about tHirty-feven, joyfully accepted thti
offer, and earneftly begged for food-, hereupon we
fent twelve Spaniards and two Englifhmen, well arm-
ed, together with Old Friday, and three Indian flaves
who marched to the place where they were. The
flaves were loaded with a large quantity of bread,
and rice cakes, with three live goats: and the poor
Indians being ordered to fit down on the fide of the
hill, they ate die victuals very thankfully, and have
proved faithful to the laft, never trefpaffing beyond
their bounds, where, at this day, they quietly and
happily remain, and where we now and then vifit
them. They are confined to a neck of land about
a mile and a half broad, and three or four in length,
on the fouth-eaft corner of the ifland, the fea being
before, anrl lofty mountains behind them, free froru
the appearance of canoes; and indeed their country-
men have never made any enquiry after them. We
gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives;
have taught them to build huts, make wooden fpades,
piant corn, make bread, breed tame goats, and
milk them, as likewife to make wicker-work, in
which, I mull ingenuoufly confefs, they infinite-
ly outdo us, having made themfelves feveral pretty
neceflaries and fancies, as baikets, fieves, bird ca-
ges,
,
ges, and cupboards, as alfo ftools, beds, and couch-
es, no lefs ufeful than delightful; and now they live
the moft innocent and inoffenfive creatures that ever
were fubdued in the world, wanting nothing but
•wives to make them a nation.
Thus, kind Sir. have I given you, according to
my ability, an impartial account of the various tranf-
actions that have happened in the ifland fince your
departure, to this day: and we have great reafon to
acknowledge the kind providence of heaven in our
merciful deliverance. When you infpect your little
kingdom, you will find in it fome little improvement,
your flocks increafed, and your fubjecls augmented:
fo that from a defolate ifland, as this was before your
wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a vifible pro-
fpect of its becoming a populous and well governed
little kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory.
The end of the Spantfb governor's relation.
The continuation of the life ef Robinfon Crufoe, both
of thofe paffages that happened during the time of
his continuance on the i/land, and after his depar-
ture, till he arrived again in his native country.
THERE is no doubt to fuppofe, but that the pre-
cedent relation of my ^faithful Spaniard was
very agreeable, and no lefs furprifing to me, to the
young prieft, and to all who heard it: nor were thefe
people lefs pleafed with thofe neceflary utenfils that
I brought them, fuch as the knives, fciflars, fpadesj
fhovels, and pick-axes, with which t'hey now adorn
their habitations. So much had they addicted them-
felves to wicker-work, prompted by the ingenuity of
the Indians, who affifted them, that when I viewed
the Englifhmen's colonies, they feemed at a diftance
as though they had lived like bees in a hive: for

Will.
Will. Atkins, who was now become a very indu-
ftrious and fober man, had made himfelf a tent of
baftet-vvork round the outfide; the walls were work-
ed in as a bafket, in pannels or ftrong fquares of
thirty two in number, flanding about feven feet
high,: in the middle was another, not above twen-
ty- two paces round, but much ftronger built, being
of an oclogonal form, and in the eight corners flood
eight ftrong pofts, round the top of which he laid
ftrong pieces, pinned \vith wooden pins, from which
lie raifed a pyramid for the. roof, mighty pretty, I
affure you, .and joined very well together with iron
fpikes, which he made himfelf; for he had made
him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows and
-charcoal for his work, forming an anvil out of one
of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner
would he make himfelf hooks, ftaples, fpikes, bolts,
and hinges. Alter he had pitched the roof of his
innermoft tent, he made it fo firm between the raf-
ters with bafket-work, thatching that over again with
rice ltraw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, that
his houfe was as dry as if it had been tiled or flated.
The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to quite round
this inner apartment, laying long rafters from the
thirty-two angles, to the top-pofts of the inner houfe,
about twenty feet diftant: fo that there was a fpace
like a walk betwixt the outer and inner wall, near
twenty feet in breadth. The inner place he partiti-
oned off with the fame wicker-work, dividing it into
fix neat apartments, every one of which had a door,
firft into trfe entry of the main tent, and another into
the fpace and walk that was round it, not only con-
venient for retreat, but for family neceffaries. Within
the door of the outer circle, there was a paflage di-
rectly to the door of the inner houfe; on either fide
was a wicker-partition, and a door, by which you go
firfl into a large room twenty-two feet wide, and about
thirty long, and through that into another of a fmaJler
length, fo that in the outward circle were ten hand-
U fome
fome rooms, fix of which were only to be come at
through the apartments of the inner tent, ferving as
retiring rooms to the refpetftive chambers of the inner
circle, and four large warehoufes, which went in
through one another, ttvoon either hand of thepaflage
that led through the outward door to the inner tent.
In fhort, nothing could be built more ingenioufly, kept
more neat, or have better conveniences; and here
lived the three families, Will. Atkins, his compa-
nion, their wives and children, and the widow of the
deceafed. As to religion, the men feldom taught
their wives the knowledge of God, any more than
the failors cuftom of fwearing by his name. The
greateft improvement theif wives had, was, they
taught them to fpeak Englifh, fo as to be underftood.
None of their children were then above fix years
old; they were all fruitful enough ; and, I think, the
cook's mate's wife was big of her fixth child.
When I enquired of the Spaniards about their cir-
.cumftances while among the favages, they told me,
that they abandoned themfelves to defpair, reckoning
themfelves a poor and miferable people, that had no
means put into their hands> and confequently muft
foon be ftarved to death. They owned, however,
that they were in the wrong to think fo, and for re-
fufing the affiftance that feafon offered for their fup-
port, as well as future deliverance, confeffing that
grief was a moft infignificant paffion, as it looked
upon things as without remedy, and having no hope
of good things to come; all which verified this noted
proverb,
In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.
Nor did his remarks end here: for, making obfer-
vations upon my improvements, and on my condi-
tion at firft, infinitely worfe than theirs, he told me,
that Englimmen had, in their diftrefs, greater prefence
of
of mind than thofe of any other country that he had
met with; and that they and the Portuguefe were
the worft men in the world to ftruggie under mif-
fortunes. When they landed among the favages,
they found but little provifion, except they would
turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and herbs,
with little fubftance in them, and of which the na-
tives gave them but very fparingly. Many were
the ways they took to civilize and teach the favages, -
but in vain: for they would not own them to be
their inftruclors, whofe lives were owing to their
bounty. Their extremities were very great, many
days being entirely without food, the favages there
being more indolent and lefs devouring than thofe
who had better fupplies. When they went out to
battle, they were obliged to afllft thefc people, in
one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had;
like to have been devoured. They had loft their am-
munition, which rendered their fire-arms ufelefsj
nor could they ufe the bows and arrows that were
given them, fo that while the armies were af a di-
ftance, they had no chance, but when clofe, then
they could be of fervice with halberts and fliarpenecj
flicks, put into the muzzles of their mufkets. They
made themfelves targets of wood, covered with the
fkins of wild heafts; and when one happened to be,
knocked down, the reft of the company fought over
him till he recovered: and then ftanding clofe in a
line, they would make their way through a thoufand
favages. At the return of their friend, who they
thought had been entombed in the bowels of their
enemies, their joy was inconceivable. Nor were they
lefs furprifed at the fight of the loaves of bread I had
fent them, things that they had not feen for feveral
years, at the fame time erofling and blefiing it, as
though it was manna fent from heaven: but when
they knew the errand, and perceived the boat which
was to carry them to the perfon and place from
whence fuch relief came, this (Iruck them with fuch
U 2 a
a furprife of joy as made fome of them faint away,
and others burft out Into tears.
This was the fummary account that I had from
them. I fhall now inform the reader what I next
did for them, and in what condition I left them. As
•we were all of opinion that the favages would fcarce
trouble them any more, fo we had no apprehenfions
on that fcore. I told them I was come purely to e •
ftablifh, and not to remove them; and, upon that
occafion, had not only brought them neceflaries for
convenience and defence, but alfo artificers, and o-
ther perfons, both for their 'neceflary employments,
and to add to their number. They were all to-
gether when I thus talked to them; and before I
delivered to them the ftores I had brought, I afked
them one by one, if they had entirely .forgot their
firft ahimofities, would engage in the ftri&eft friend-
fhip, and fhake hands with one another? On this
Will. Atkins, with abundance of good humour,
faid, they had afflictions enough to make them
all fober, and enemies enough to make them all friends:
as for himfelf, he would live and die among them,
owning, that what the Spaniards had done to him,
his own mad humour had made neceflary for them
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occafion to juflify
their proceedings to me; but they told me, that, fince
Will. Atkins had behaved himfelf fo valiantly in
fight, and at other times fhewed fuch a regard to
the common, intereft of them all, they had not only
forgotten all that was paft, but thought he ought as
much to be trufted with arms and neceflaries as any
of them, which they teftified by making him next
in command to the governor: and they moft hear-
tily embraced the occafion of giving me this folemn
affurance, that they would never feparate their intereft
again a,s long as they lived.
After thefe kind declarations of friendfhip, we ap-
pointed all of us to dine together the next day; upon
this I caufed the fhip's cook and his mate come on
fhore
fhore for that purpofe, to affift in dreffing our din-
ner. We brought from the fhip fix pieces of beef,
and four of pork, together v:ith our punch-bowl,
and materials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them
ten bottles of French claret, and ten of Englifh beer,
which was very acceptable to them. The Spaniards
added to our feaft five whole kids, which being roaft-
ed, three of them were fent as frefn meat to the'
failors on board, and the other two we ate ourfelves.
After our merry and innocent feaft was over, I be-
gan to diftribute my cargoe among them. Firft, I
fave them linen fufficient to make every one of them
Dur fjiirts, and at the Spaniard? requeft made them,
up fix. The thin tnglifh fluffs I allotted to.make
every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to the
climate, and left .them fnch a quantity, as to make
more upon their decay; as alfo pumps, fhoes, hats,
and flockings. It is not to be exprefled, the pleafing
fatisfaction which fat upon the countenances of
thefe poor men, when they perceived what care I
took of them, as if I had been a common father
to them all; and they all engaged never to leave
the ifland, till I gave my confent for their depar-
ture. I then prefented to them the people I brought,
to wit, the tailor, fmith, and the two carpenters;
but my Jack of all trades was the moft acceptable
prefent 1 could make them. My tailor fell imme-
diately to work, and made every one of them a
fhirt; after which, he learned the women how to
few and flitch, thereby to become the more helpful
to their hufbands. Neither were the carpenters
lefs ufeful, taking in pieces their clumfy things,
inflead of which, they made convenient and hand-
fome tables, ftools, bedftcads, cupboards, lockers
and fhelves. But when I carried them to fee "Will.
Atkins's bafket-houfe, they owned they neeer faw
fuch a piece of natural ingenuity before: / am
Juret faid one of the carpenters, the man that built
U 3 this
this hat no need cf us; you need, Sir, do nothing but
give hifn tools.
I divided the tools among them in this manner:
to every man I gave a digging-fpade, a fhovel and a
rake, as having no harrows or ploughs; and to eve-
ry feparate place a pick axe, a crow, a broad axe,
and a faw, with a ftore for a general fupply, fhould
any be broken or worn out- I left them alfo nails,
flaples, hinges, hammers, chiffels, knives, fciflars,
and all forts of tools and iron work; and, for the ufe
of the fmith, gave them three tons of unwrought
iron for a fupply: and as to arms and ammunition,
I ftored them even to profufion; or, at leaft, to equip-
a fufficient little army againft all oppofers whatfoever.
The young man (whofe mother was unfortunately
flarved to death), together with the maid, a pious
and well educated young woman, feeing things fa
well ordered on fhore (for I made them accompany-
me), and eonfidering they had no occafion to go fo
far a voyage as to the Eaft-Indies, they both defired
of me, that I would leave them there, and enter
them among my fubjecls. This I readily agreed tor
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three
little houfes ere£ted, environed with bafket-worfc,
pallifadoed like Atkins's, and adjoining to his planta-
tion. So contrived were their tents, thai each c£
them had a room apart to lodge in, while the mid-
dle tent was not only their ftore-houfe, but their place
for eating and drinking. At this time the two
Englifhmen removed their habitation to their former
place; fo that now the ifland was divided into three
colonies;firft, T,hofe I have juft now mentioned;
fecvndly, That of Will. Atkins, where there were four
families of Englifhmen, with their wives and childien,
the widow and her children: the young man, and
the maid, who, by the way, we made a wife of be-
fore °ur departure; three favages, who were flaVes j
the tail°r> fralth, (who ferved alfo as a gunfmith),
and
ind my otbet celebrated perfon called Jack of all
trades. Thirdly, My chief colony, which confifted
of the Spaniards, with Old Friday, who ftill remained
at my old habitation, which was my capital city:
and furely never was there fuch a metropolis, it now
being hid in fo obfcure a grove, that a thoufand
men might have ranged the ifland a month, and
looked purpofely for it, without being able to find
it, though the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries^
both without and within, in a moft furprifing man-
ner.
But now I think it high time to fpeak of the
young French prieft of the order of St BenediEI,
whofe judicious and pious difcourfes, upon fundry
occafions, merit an extraordinary obfervation; not
can his being a French Papift prieft, I prefume, give
offence to any of my readers, when they have this-
affurance from me, that he was a perfon of the moft
courteous difpofition, extenfive charity, and exalted
piety. His arguments were always agreeable to
reafon, and his converfation the moft acceptable
of any perfon that I had ever yet met with in my
life.
Sir, faid he to me one fay,Jince, under Cod (at the
fame time erofling his breaft) you have not only faved
my life; but, by permitting me to go this voyage, have
granted me the happinefs of free converfation, 1-think
it my duty, as my profeffion obliges me, to. fave what
fouls 1 can, by bringing them to the knowledge of fome
Catholic dsftrine, neceffary tofalvation; and,fence theft
•people are under your immediate government, in gra-
titude, ju/lice, and decency for -what you have done for
tne, IJballoffer no farther points in religion, than -what
fball merit your approbation. Being pleafed with the
modefty of his carriage, I told him he fhould not be
the worfe ufed for being of a different perfuafion, if,
upon that very account, we did not differ in points
of faith, not accent in a part of the country, where
the poor Indians ought to be inftru&ed in the know-
ledge
ledge of the true God, and his fon Jefus Chrift. To
this he replied, that converfation might eafily be fepa-
rated from difputes; that he would difcourfe with me
rather as a gentleman than a religious ; but that,,
if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon my
defiring the fame, I would give him liberty to de-
fend his own principles. He farther added, that he
would do all that became him in Jiis office, as a
prieft as well as a Chriftian, to procure the happi-
nefs of all that was in the fhip: that though he
could not pray with, he would pray for us, on all
occafions; and then he told me feveral extraordi-
nary events of his life, within a few years paft; but
particularly in this laft, which was the moft re-
markable: that, in this voyage, he had the misfor-
tune to be five times fhipped and unfhipped: his firft
defign was to have gone to Martinico; for which, ta-
king fhip at St Malo, he was forced into Lifbon by
bad weather, the veffel running aground in the mouth
of the Tagus: that from thence he went on board
a Portuguefe fhip, bound to the Madeiras, whofe ma-
fter being but an indifferent mariner, and out of his
reckoning, they were drove to Fial, where felling
their commodity, which was corn, they refolved to
take in their loading at the Me of May, and to fail'
to Newfoundland; at the banks of which, meeting a
French fhip bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada*
and from thence to Martinico, in this fhip he em-
barked; the mafter of which dying at Quebec, that
voyage was fufpended: and laftly, fhipping himfelf
for France, this laft fhip was deftroyed by fire, as be-
fore has been related.
At this time we talked no further; but another
morning he comes to me, juft as I was going to vifit
the Englifhmens colony, and tells me, that, as he
knew the profperity of the ifland was my principal
defire, he had fomething to communicate agreeable
to my defign, by which perhaps he might put it,
•more than he yet thought it was, in the way of the
-benedi&ion.

fin

benediction of heaven. How, Sir? faid I, in a fur-
prife, are we not yet in the way of God's bleffing, af-
ter all thefe fignal providences and deliverances, of
•which you" have had fuch an ample relation? He re-
plied, I hope, Sir, you are in the way, and that your
good defign will profper: but ftill there are fome a-
mong you that are not equally right in their actions:
and remember, I befeech you, Sir, that j4chant by
his crime, removed God's bleffing from the camp of
the children of Ifrael; that though fix and thirty were
entirely innocent, yet they became the objects of di-
vine vengeance, and bore the weight of the punifh-
ment accordingly.
So fenfibly w?s I touched with this difcourfe, and,
fo fatisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his
foul, that I defired him to accompany me to the
Englifhmens plantations, which he was very glad of,
by reafon they were the fubjects of what he de-
figned to difcourfe with me about; and while we
•walked on together, he began in the following man-
ner:
Sir, faid he, I muft confefs it is a great unhappi-
nefs that we dilagree in feveral docUinal articles of
religion; but, furely both of us acknowledge this,
that there is a God, who having given us fome
ftated rules for our fervice and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either
by negle£ling what he has commanded, or by doing
what he has forbidden. This truth every Chriftian
owns, that whenever any one prefumptuoufly fins
againft God's command, the Almighty then with-
draws his bleffing from him; every good man there-
fore ought certainly to prevent fuch neglect of, or
fin againft God and his commands. I thanked the
young prieft for expreffing fo great a concern for us,
and defired him to explain the particulars of what he
had obferved, that, according to the parable of
j4chan, I might remove the accurfed thing from
among us. Why then, Sir, faid he, in the firft
place,
place, you have four Englifhmen, who have taken
favage women to their wives, by whom they have
feveral children, though none of them are legally
married, as the law of God and man requires; they»
I fay, Sir, are no lefs than adulterers, and as they
ftill live in adultery, are liable to the curfe of God.
I know, Sir, you may object the want of a prieft, or
clergyman of any kind; as alfo, pen, ink, and
paper, to write down a contra£t of marriage, and
have it figned between them. Hut neither this, nor
what the Spanifh governor has told you of their
chufing by confent, can be reckoned a marriage,
nor any more than an agreement to keep them from
quarrelling among themfelves; for, Sir, the eflence
or facrament of matrimony (fo he called it) not only
Confifts in mutual confent, but in the legal obliga-
tion, which compels them to own and acknowledge
one another, to abftain from other perfons, the men
to provide for their wives and children, and the wo-
men to the fame and like conditions, mutatis mutandis,
on their fide: whereas, Sir, thefe men, upon their
own pleafure, on any occafion, may forfake thofe
women, and marry others, and by difowning their
children, fuffer them utterly to perifh. Now, Sir,
added he, can God be honoured in fuch an unlawful li-
berty as this? how can a bleffing fucceed the beft endea-
vours, if men are allowed to live in fo licentious a way?
I was indeed ftruck with the thing myfelf, and
thought that they were much to blame, that no for-
mal contract had been made, though it had been
but breaking a flick between them, to engage them
to live as man and wife, never to feparate, but love,
cherifh, and comfort one another all their lives;
yet, Sir, fekl I, when they took thefe women, I
was not here; and if it is adultery, it is paft my re-
medy, and I cannot help it. True, Sir, anfwered
the young prieft, you cannot be charged -with that part
of the crime •which -was done in your abjence; but I be-
feech you, dan't flatter your/elf, that you are under no
obligation
obligation now to put a period to it; 'which if you ne-
gleft to do, the guilt 'will be entirely on you alone,Jince
it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to alter
their condition. I muft confefs, I was fo dull, that I
thought he meant I fhould part them, and knowing
that this would put the whole ifland in confufion, I
told him I could not confent to it upon any account
•whatfoever. Sir, faid he, in a great furprife, / da
•not mean that you Jbould feparate, but marry them, by
a. written contrail, figned by both man and woman,
v and by all the -witneJJ'es prefent, which all the European
laws decree to be offufficicnt efficacy. Amazed with
fuch true piety and fincerity, and confidering the va-
lidity of a written contract, I acknowledged all that
he faid to be very juft and kind; and that I would
difcourfe with the men about it; neither could I fee
what reafon they could have not to let hint marry
them, whofe authority in that affair is owned to be as
authentic as if they were married by any of our cler-
gymen in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me was
this, that though thefe Englifh fubje&s of mine had
lived with thefe women feven years, and though
they were of good underftanding, and capable of in-
ftruction, having learned not only to fpeak, but to
read Englifh, yet all this while they had never
taught them any thing of the Chriftian religion, or
the knowledge of God, much lefs in what manner
he ought to be ferved. And is not this an unaccount-
able ueglecl? faid he warmly. Depend upon if, Gad
Almighty -will call them to account for fuch contempt.
And tho' I am not of your religion, yet I Jbould be glad
to fee thefe people releaft-d from the devil's power, and
'befaved by the principles of the Chriftian religion, the
knowledge of God, of a Redeemer, the refurreclion, and
of a future pate. But, as it is not too late, ifyou pleafe
to give me leave to inJiruEl them, I doubt not but I
Jljallfupply this great defeft, by bringing them into the
great
great circle of Chrijiianity, even -while you continue in
the ijland,
I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told
him, with a thoufand thanks, I would grant whatever
he requefted, and defired him to proceed in the third
article, which he did in the following manner:
Sir, faid he, it fhould be a maxim among all Chri-
ftians, That Chriftian knowledge ou%ht to be propoga-
ted by all poj/ible meansi and on all occajions. Upon
this account our church fends mifiionaries into Perfia,
India, and China, men who are willing to die for the
fake of God and the Chriftian faith, in order to bring
poor Infidels into the way of lalvation. Now, Sir, as
here is an opportunity to convert feven and thirty-
poor favages, I wonder how you can pafs by fuch an
occafion of doing good, which is really worth the ex-
pence of a man's whole life. • ,
I muft confefs I was fo confounded at this difcourfe,
that I could not tell how to anfwer him. Sir, faid
he, feeing me in diforder, / frail be very forry if I
have given you offence. No, Sir, faid I, I am rather
confounded; and you know my circumftanccs, that,
being bound to the Eaft Indies in a merchant fhip, I
cannot wrong the owners fo much, as to detain the
fhip here, the men lying at vitluals and wages on
their account. If I ftay above twelve days, I muft
pay 3 /. Sterling per diem demurrage, nor muft the
(hip ftay above eight days more -r fo that I am unable
to engage in this work, unlefs I would leave the
(hip, and be reduced to my former condition- The
prieft, though he owned this was hard upon me, yet
laid it to my conference, whether the blerifng of
faving feven and thirty fouls was not worth venturing
all that I had in the world? Sir, faid I, it is very
true: but as you are an ecclefiaftic, it naturally falls
into your profeffion : why, therefore, don't you rather
offer to undertake it yourfelf, than prefs me to it?
Upon this he turned about, making a very low bow,
I moft humbly thank God and you, Sir, faid he, for
fo blefled a call; and maft willingly undertake fo glo-
rious an office, which will fufficiently compenfate all
the hazards and difficulties I have gone through in a
long and uncomfortable voyage.
While he was thus fpeaking, I could difcover a
rapture in his face, by his colour going and coming;
at the fame time his eyes fparkled like fire, with all
the figns of the moft zealous tranfports. And when
I afked whether he was in earnefl:? Sir, faid he, it
was to preach to the Indians, 1 confented to come a-
long with you; thefe infidels, even in this little
ifland, are infinitely of more worth than my -poor
life: if fo that I fhould prove the happy inftrument
of faving thefe poor creatures fouls, I care not if I
never fee my native country again. One thing I
only beg of yon more, is, that you would leave
Friday with me, to be my interpreter, without
whofe affiftance neither of us will underftand each
other.
This requeft very fenfibly troubled me; firft, upon
Friday's being bred a Proteftant; and, fecondly, for
the affection I bore to him for his fidelity: But, im-
mediately the remembrance of Friday's father coming
into my head, I recommended him to him as having
learned Spanifh, which the prieft alfo underftood:
and fo was thoroughly fatisfied with him.
When we came to the Englifhmen, after I had told
them what neceflary things I had done for them, I
talked to them of the fcandalous life they led, told
them what notice the clergyman had taken of it, and
afked them if they were married men or bachelors?
They anfwered, two of them were widowers, and
the other three fingle men. But, faid I, \yith what
confcience can you call thefe your wives, by whom
you have fo many children, and yet are not lawfully
married? They all faid, that they took them before
the governor as fuch, having nobody elfe to marry
them, which they thought as legal, as if they had
X" 'had
had a parfon. No doubt, faid I, but in the eye of
God you are fo: but unlefs I am aflured of your ho-
neft intent, never to defert thefe poor creatures, I
can do nothing more for you, neither can you ex-
pect God's bleffing while you live in fuch an open
courfe of adutrery. Hereupon, Will. Atkins, who
fpoke for the reft, told me, That they believed their
wives the moft innocent and virtuous creatures in the
•world : that they would never forfake them while they
Tiad breath; and that, if there was a clergyman in the
fhip, they would be married to them with all their
heart. 1 told you before, faid I, that I have a mini-
fter with me, who fhall marry you to-morrow morn-
ing, if you are willing; fo I would have you confult
to-night, with the reft, about it. I told him the
clergyman was a Frenchman, and knew not a word
of Englifh, but that I would act as a clerk between
them. And indeed this bufinefs met with fuch fpee-
dy fuccefs, that they all told me, in a few minutes
after, that they were ready to be formally married, as
foon as I pleafed ; with which informing the prieft, he
was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now remained, but that the women
fhould be made fenfible of the meaning of the thing;
with which being well fatisfied, they, with their huf-
bands, attended at my apartment the next morning:
there was my prieft, habited in a black veft, fome-
thing like a caflbck, with a fafh round it, much re-
fembling a minifterx and I was his interpreter. But
the ferioufnefs of his behaviour, and the fcruples he
made of marrying the women, who were not bap-
tized, gave them an exceeding reverence for his per-
fon; nor indeed would he marry them at all, till he
obtained my liberty to difcourfe both with the men
and women, and then he told them, That, in the
fight of all indifferent men, and in the fenfe of the
laws of fociety, they had lived in open adultery,
which nothing now, but their confent to marry, or
final feparation, could put an end to; and even here
was
was a difficulty with refpect to the laws of Chriftian
matrimony, in marrying a profefled Chriftian to a
heathen idolater, unbaptized; but yet there was
time enough to make them profefs the name of
Gnnft, without which nothing could be done: that,
befides, he believed themfelves very indifferent Chri-
IHans: and confequently had not difcourfed with
their wives upon that fubject; and that unlefs they
nromifed him to do fo, he could not marry them, as
being exprefsly forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily;
But, Lord, Sir! faid Will. Atkins tome, how Jijould
•we teach them religion, who know nothing of it our-
felves' How can -we talk to our -wives of God, Jefus
Chrift, heaven and hell? why they would only laugh
at us, who never yet have praRifed religion, but on the
contrary, all manner of-wickednefs. Will. Atkins, faid
I, cannot you tell your wife fbe is in the wrong,
and that her gods are idols, which can neither hear,
fpeak, nor urderftand; but that our God, who h?s
made, can deftroy all things; that he rewards the
good, and punifnes the wicked; and at laft will
bring us to judgment? cannot you tell her thefe
things ? That's true, faid Atkins, but then fhe'll tell
me, it is utterly falfe, fince 1 am not punifhed and
fcnt to the devil, who hath been fuch a wicked crea-
ture. Thefe words I interpreted to the priefl! O!
faid he, tell him, his repentance will make him a
very good minifter to his fpoufe, and qualify him to
preach on the mercy and long-fuffering of a merciful
Being, who defires not the death of a finner, and
even defers damnation to the .'aft judgment; this
will lead him to the doctrine of, and will make
him an excellent preacher to his wife. I repeated
this to Atkins, who, being more than ordinary af-
fecled with it, replied, 1 know all this, Sir, and a
great deal more ; but how can I have the impudence
to talk thus to my wife, when my confcience wit-
nefies againft me? ALAS! faid he, (with tears in
X 2 his
Tiis eyes, and giving a great figh), as for repenting,
that is for ever paft me. Pail you! Atkins, faid I,
•what do you mean? You know well enough, faid he,
what I mean; / mean it is ten late.
When 1 told the prieft what he faid, the poor af-
fcctionate man could not refrain from weeping; but
recovering himfelf, Pray, Sir, faid he, ajk him if he
is contented that it is tea late; or is be concerned, and
-wi/hes it-were not fo? This queftion I put fairly to
Atkins, who replied in a paffion, How can I le ea-
fy in ajlate which I kr.o-w mitji terminate in my rum?
fir 1 really believe, feme time or other, Ijhall cut my
throat, to put a period both to my life and to the terrors
cf my conjcience.
•At this the clergyman fhook his head. Sir, faid
he, pray tell him it is net too late; Cirift -w'ill give
him repentance, if he has recourfe to the merit of his
fafficn. Does he think he is beyond the ptnver of di-
• vine mercy? there may indeed be a time -when provoked
merry -will n; longer ftrive, but never tea late for men
to repent in this world. I told Atkins every word the
prieft had faid, who then parted from us to talk to
his wife, while we difcourfed with the reft. But
tl.efe were very fhipid in religious matters, yet all
cf them pYomifed to do their/ endeavours to make
their wives turn Chrifthms ; and upon which promi-
fes the prieft married the three couple. But as At-
kins was the only fincere convert, and of more
fei-ife than the reft, my clergyman was earneftly in-
quiring after .him: Sir, faid he, let in -walk out'of
this labyrinth, and 1 dare fay -we jhall find this poor
man preaching to his -wife atready. And indeed we
found it true; for coming to the edge of the wood,
we perceived Atkins and his favage wife fitting under
the fhade of a bufh, in very earneft difcourfe; he
pointed to the fun, to the quarters of the earth, to
himfelf, to her, the woods,.and the trees. Immediately
we could perceive him ftart upon his feet, fall down
upou his knees, and lift up both his hands; at which
the
the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our
great misfortune was, we could not hear one word
that patted between them. Another time he would
embrace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, luffing
her with the greateft tranfports, and then both kneel
down for fome minutes together. Such raptures of
joy did this occafion in my young prieft, that he
could fcarcely contain himfelf: And a little after this,
we obferved by her motion, as frequently lifting up
her hands, and laying them on her breaft, that fhe
was mightily affected with his difcourfe, and fo they
withdrew from our fight.
When we came back, we found them both wait-
ing to be called in; upon which we agreed to exa-
mine him alone, and fo 1 began thus to difcourfe him.
Prithee, Will. Atkins, faid I, what education had
you? What was your father?
IV. A. A better man than ever I fiiall be; he was,
Sir, a clergyman, who gave me good inftruction, or
correction, which I defpifed, like a brute as I was,
and murdered my poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer!
[Here the priejljlarted and lookedpaht is think-
ing lie bad really killed bis father.'}
R. C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I cut net his throat, but broke his
heart, by the mofl unnatural turn of difobedience to
the tendereft and beft of fathers.
R. C. Well, 1 pray God grant you repentance; I
did not afk you to extort a confeffion; but I aflted you,
becaufe I fee you have more knowledge of what is
good, than your companions.
W. A. O, Sir, whenevier I look back upon my paft
life, confcience upbraids me with my father: the CMS
againft our parents make the deepeft wounds, and
their weight lies the heavieft upon the mind.
R. C, You talk,-Will, too feelingly and fenfibly
for me; 1 am not able to bear it.
W. A. You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of it.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do; and every fLore, val-
ley, and tree in this illanti, witnefe the anguifh of my
foul for my undutifulnefs to my kind father; whom I
have murdered likewife; yet my repentance falls in-
finitely fhort of yours. But, Will, how eomes the
fenfe of this matter to touch you juft now?
W. A'. Sir, the work you have fet me about, has oc-
cafioned it; for talking to my wife about God'and'
religion, me has preached rne fuch a fermon, that I
fh?'ll retain it in lafting remembrance.
R. C. No, no, it is your own moving pious argu-
ments to her, has made confidence fling them bacit
upon you. But pray, Atkins,, inform us what paffed
between you and your wife, and in what manner did
you begin..
W. A. I talked to h;r of the laws of marriage, the
reafon of fuch compacts, whereby order and jullice is
maintained; without which^ men would run from-
their wives and children, to the dificlution of families
or inheritances.
A'. C. Well, and what did fhe fey to all this?
W. A. Sir, we began our difcourfe in the following
manner, which I fhail exa&ly repeat according to my
mean capacity, if you think it worth your while to
honour it with your attention..
The DIALOGUE tetween Will. Atkins and bis
Wife in tJie -wood.
Wife.~\TC>\3 tell me ma-rriage God appoint, have
j£ you God in your country?
If. A. Yes, child, God is in every nation;
Wife. No; great old Benamuckee god is in my
country, not yours.
W. A. My dear, God'is in heaven-, which he made;
fcc alfo made the earth, the fea, and all tbat is therein.
U'ift, Why you. not tell me much Jong ago?
W. A..
*
W. A. My dear, I have been a wicked wretch, ba-
ring a long time lived without the knowledge of God
in the world.
Wife. What, not know great God iir own nation?
No do good ting? No fay O to him ? 'that's ftrange!
W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there'was no
God in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God fuffer this? why makee not live
well?
W. A. It is our own faults, child.
•Wife. But if he much great, can makee kill, why no
makee kill when no fcrve him? No be good mans no
cry O to him?
W. A. That's true, my dear, he may ftrike us dead,
but his abundant mercy fpareth us.
Wife. Did riot you tell God tankee for that?
W. A. No, I have neither thanked him for his mer-
ey, nor" feared him for his power.
Wife. Then me not believe your God be good, noE
makee kill, when you makee him angry.
W. A. Alas! muftmy wicked life hinder you from
believing in him?
Wife. How can me tink your God live there?
{pointing to heaven.} bure he no ken what you da
here.
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he hears us fpeak, fees
what we do, and knows what we even think.
Wife. Where then makee power ftrong, when he
hears you curfc, fwear de great damn?
W. A-. My dear this fhews he is indeed a God and
not a man, who has fuch tender mercy.
Wife. Mercy !' what you call mercy?
W. A. He pities and ipares us: as he is our great
Creator, fo is he alfo our tender father.
Wife. So God never angry, never kill wicked, then.
fte no good, no great mighty.
W. A. O my dear, don't fay fo, he is both; and
many,
many times he fhews terrible examples of his judge-
ment and vengeance.
Wife. '.Then you makee de bargain with him; you
<k> bad ting, he no hurt you, he hurt other mans.
W. A. No, indeed, my fins are all prefumptions upon
his goodnefs.
Wife. -Well, and yet no makee you dead? and you
give him no tankee neither?'
W. A. It ia true, I am. an ungrateful, unthankful
dog, that I am.
Wife. Why, you fay he makee you, why makee you
no much better then.
W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myfelf, and
abufed his goodnefs.
Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no makee him
angry, no do bad ting.
W. A. You mean, my dear, that you defire I would
teach you to know God: alas! poor dear creature;
he muft teach thee, and not I. But I'll pray earneftly
to him to direct thee, and to forgive me, a miferable
finner. {Hereupon be -went a little diftance, and kneel-
ing do-wn, prayed earnejUy to Cod to enlighten her mind,
and to pardon his fins; -when this -was dene, they
continued their difcwrfe thus.}
Wife. What.you put down Tsnee for? For what hold
up hand? Who you fpeak to?
W. A. My dear, 1 bowed in token of fubmiffion to
him that made me, and prayed that he would open your
eyes and underftanding.
Wife. And can he do that too? And will he hear
what you fay?
W. A. Yes, my dear, he bids us pray, and has given
us piomile that he will hear us.
Wife. When did he bid you pray? What, do you
hear him fpeak?
W. A. No, my dear, but God has fpoken formerly
to good men from heaven : and by divine revelation
they have written all his laws down in a book.
Wife.
Wife. O where dat good book?
W> A. I have it not now by me: but one time or
other I fhall get it for you to read. Then be embraced
her with great affeflion.
Wife. Pray tell a mee did God teachee them write
that book?
W. A. Yes, and by that rule we know him to be
God.,
Wife. What way, what rule you know him?
W. A. Becaufe he teaches what is good, juil, and
toly; and forbids all wicked and abominable actions
that incur his difpleafure.
Wife, O me fain underftand that, and if he do
all things you fay he do, fnrely he hear me fay O to
him j he makee me good if I wifh to be good;
he no kill me if I love him; me link, believe him
great God; me fay O to him, along with you, my
dear.
Here the poor mdn fell upon his knees, and made her
kneel down by him, praying -with the greateft fervency
that Gad -would injlruEl her by his Holy Spirit; and
that Gad by'hls providence wouldfend them a Bible for
both their in/truSfions. And fuch tuns the early piety
of this new convert, that Jhe made him promife never
to forfake God any more, left, being made dead, as foe
called if, Jhe Jbould not only want her inftruftor, but
himfelf be miferable in a long eternity.
Such a furprifing account as this was, proved very
affecting to us both, but' particularly to the young
clergyman, who was mightily concerned he could
not talk to her himfelf. Sir, faid he, there is fome-
thing more to be done to this woman than to marry
her: I mean that fhe ought to be baptized.. To
this I prefently agreed: Pray, faid he again, afk her
hufband, whether he has ever talked to her of Jefus
Chrift, the falvation of finners, the nature of faith,
and redemption in and by him, of the Holy Spirit,
the refurrection, laft judgment, and a future ftate:
but the poor fellow melted into tears at this quettion,
faying,
faying, that he had faid fomething to her of thefe
things, but his inability to talk of them, made him
afraid left her knowledge of them fhould rather
make her contemn religion, than be benefited by
it: but that, if I would difcourfe with her, it would
be very evident my labour would nnt be in vain.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myfelf as
interpreter between the religious prieft and the wo-
man, I entreated him to go on: but furely never was
fuch A fennon preached by any clergyman in thefe
latter days, with fo much zeal, knowledge, and fin-
cerity; in fhort, he brought the woman to embrace
the knowledge of Chrift, and of redemption by him,
with fo furprifmg a degree of underftandhig, that
fhe made it her own requeft to be baptized. .
He then performed his office in the facrament of
baptifm, fir ft, by faying fome words over to himfelf
in Latin, and then afking me to give her a name, us
being her godfather, and pouring a whole difh full
of water upon the woman's head, he faid, MARY,
I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghoft j fo that none could
know of what religion he was. After this he pro-
nounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman
being made a Chriflian, he married her to Will. At-
kins; which being finifhed, he affectionately exhorted
him to lead a holy life for the future; that fmce the
Almighty, by the convi£tions of his confcience, had
honoured him to be the inftrument of his wife's
converfion, he fhould not dilhonour the grace of
God, that while the favage was converted, the in»
ftrument mould be cafb away. Thus ended a cere-
mony, to me the moft pleafant and agreeable I ever
paffed in my life.
The affairs of the ifland being fettled, I was pre-
paring to go on board, when the young man (whofe
mother was flarved) came to me, faying, that as hq
underfteod I had a clergyman with me, who had
married the Englifhmen with favages, he had a.
match'
match to make between two Chriftians, which he
defired might be finifhed before I departed. Think-
ing that it was he himfelf that had courted his mo-
ther's maid, I perfuaded him not to do any thing
rafhly upon the account of his folitary circumflances;
that the maid was an unequal match for him, both
in refpect to fubftance and years j and that it was very
probable he would live to return to his own country,
•where he might have a far better choice. At thefe
words, fmiling, he interrupted me, thanking me for
my good advice; that as he had nothing to beg of
me, but a fmall fettlement, with a fervant or two, or
fome few neceflaries, fo he hoped I would not be un-
mindful of him when I returned to England, but give
his letters to his friends; and that when he was re-
deemed, the plantation, and all its improvements,
however valuable, fhould be retumed to me again.
But, as for the marriage he propofed, that it was not
himfelf, but that it was between my Jack of all trades,
and the maid Sufan.
I was indeed agreeably furprifedat the mentioning
this match, which feemed very fuitable, the one being
a very ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent,
dexterous, and fenfible houfe-wife, fit to be gover-
nefs of the whole ifland: fo we married them the
fame day; and, as I was her father, and gave her
away, fo I pave her a handfome portion, appoint-
ing her and her hufband a convenient large fpace of
ground for their plantation. The fharing out of the
land I left to Will. Atkins, who really divided it
very juftly, to every perfon's fatisfaction: they only
defired one general writing under my hand for the
whole, which I caufed to be drawn up, figned, and
fealed to them, fetting out their bounds, and giving
them a right to the whole poffeffion of their refpec-
tive plantations, with their improvements, to them and
their heirs, referving all the reft of the ifland as my
own property, and a certain rent for every particular
jilautation, after eleven years. As to their laws and
government;
government, I exhorted them to love one another: and
as to the Indians who lived in a nook by themfelves,
I allotted three or four of them plantations, and the
reft willingly chofe to become fervants to the other
families, by which means they were employed in
ufeful labour, and fared much better than they did
before. Befides, the favages being thus mixed with
the Chriftians, the work of their converfion might
be fet on foot by the latter, in the clergyman's ah-
fence, to our equal fatisfaction. The young priefr,
however, was a little anxious left the Chriftians
fliould not be willing to do their parts in inftructing
thofe poor Indians: I therefore told him, we fhould
call them all together; that he fhould fpeak to the
Spaniards who were Papifts, and I to the Englifh
who were Proteftants, and make them promife that
they would never make any diflinction in religion,
but teach the general true knowledge of God, and
his Son'Jefus Chrift, in order to convert the poor
favages. And this, indeed, they all promifed us ac-
cordingly.
When I came to Will. Atkins's houfe, I found his
baptized wife, and the young woman newly married
to my Jack of all trades, were become great inti-
mates, and difcourfing of religion together. O, Sir,
fays Will. Atkins, when God has finners to reconcile
to-himfelf, he never wants an inftru£tor: I knew I
was unworthy for fo good a work, and therefore
this young woman has been fent hither as it were
from heaven, who is fufficient to convert a whole
iflanci of favages. The young woman blufhed, and
was going to rife: but I defired her to fit flill, and
hoped that God would blefs her in fo good a work:
and then, pulling out a Bible, (which I brought on
purpofe in my pocket for him), Here, Atkins, faid I,
here is an afflftant that perhaps you had not before.
So confounded was the poor man, that it was fome
time before lie could fpeak; at laft, turning to his
wife, My dear, he faid, did I not tell you that God
could
could hear what we faid? Here's the book I prayed
for, when you and I kneeled under the bufh: God
then heard us, and now has fent it. The woman wzs
iurprifed, and thought really God had fent that indi-
vidual book from heaven; but I turned to the young
woman, and defired her to explain to the new convert,
that God may properly be faid to anfwer our petitions,
when, in the courle of his providence, fuch particular
things come to pafs as we petitioned for. This the
young woman did effectually, but furely Will. At-
kins's joy cannot be exprefled; no man being more
thankful for any thing in the world, than he was for
his Bible, nor defired it from a better principle.
After feveral religious difcourfes, I defired the
young woman to give me an account of the anguifh
fhe felt when (he was fbrving to death for hunger -
to which fhe readily confented, and began in the fol-
lowing manner:
"Sir," faid fhe, " all our viSuals being gone,
after I had fafted one day, my ftomach was very
fickifh, and, at the approach of night, I was inclined
to yawmng, and fleepy. When I flept upon the
couch three hours, I awaked a little refrefhed: three
hours after, my ftomach being more and more fickifh,
I lay down again, but could not fleep, being very
faint and ill. Thus I paffed the fecond day with a
ftrange variety, firft hungry, then fick again, with
Teachings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at
Barbadoes, buying plenty of provifions, and dined
heartily. But when I awaked, my fpirits were ex-
ceedingly funk, to find myfelf in the extremity of
famine. There was but one glafs of wine, which
being^ mixed with fugar, I drank up; but for want
.of fubflance to digeft upon, the fumes of it got into
my head, and made me fenfelefs for fome time. The
third day I was fo ravenous and furious, that I could
have eaten a little child if it had come in my way;
during which time, I was as mad as any creature in
* bedlam,
bedlam. In one of thefe fits I fell down, and flruck
my face againft the corner of a pallet bed, where my
miftrefs lay: the blood gufhed out of my nofe, but by
my exceffive bleeding, both the violence of the fever,
and the ravenous part of the hunger abated. After
this, I grew fick again, ftrove to vomit, but could not;
tb/en bleeding a fecond time, I fwooned away as dead;
when I came to myfelf, I had a dreadful gnawing
pain in my ftomach, which went off towards night,
with a longing deiire for food. I took a draught of
water and fugar, but it came up again; then I drank
tester without 1'ugar, and that ftaid with me. I laid
me down on the bed, praying God would take me a-
way; after I had flumbered, I thought myfelf a-dying,
therefore recommended my foul to God, and wifheil
ibmebody would throw me into the fea. All this
while my departing miftrefs lay by me; the la ft bit
of bread flie had, flie gave it to her dear chikl, my
young mailer. The morning after, I fell into a vio-
lent paffion of crying, and after that into hunger. I
efpied the blood that came from my nofe in a bafon,
which I immediately fwallowed up. At night I hail
the ufual variations, as pain in the ftomach, fick,
fleepy, and ravenous ; and I had nb thought but that
I fhould die before morning. - In the morning came
on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time, I
heard my young mafter's lamentations, by which I
imderftood his mother was dead. Soon after, the fai-
lors cried, A fail! a fad! hallooing as if they were
diftrac~led, for joy of that relief, which afterwards we
received from your hands."
Surely never was a more diftinct account of ftar-
ving to death than this. But to return to the difpofi-
tion of things among my people, I did not take any
notice to them of the floop that I had framed, neither
would I leave them the two pieces of brafs cannon,
or the two quarter-deck guns that I had on board,
left, upon any difguft, they mould have feparated,
or
',
or turned pirates, and fo made the ifland a den of
thieves, inftead of a plantation of foher pious people:
but leaving them in a flourifhing condition, with a
promife to fend them further relief from Brazil, as
fhecp, hogs, and cows, (being obliged to kill the ht-
ter at fea, having no hay to feed them), I went on
board the fhip again, the firft of May 1695, after,
having been twenty days among them: and next
morning, giving them a falute of five guns at parting,
we fet fail for the Brazils. The third day, towards
evening, there happening a calm, and the current
being very ftrong, we were drove to the N. N. E. to-
wards the land. Some hours after we perceived the
fea covered as it were with fomething very black, not
•eafily at firft to be difcovered: upon which our chief
mate afcending the fhrouds a little way, and taking a
viewwrth a perfpe£iive glafs, he cries out, an Army!
An army, you fool, faid I, what do you mean ? Nay,
Sir, faid he, don't be angry, I afiure you it is not
only an army, but a fieet too; for I believe there are
a thoufand canoes paddling along, and making with
great hafte towards us.
Indeed every one"of us were furprifed at this rela-
tion: and my nephew the captain could not tell what
to think of ir, but thought we fhould all be devoured.
Nor was I free from concern, when I confidered how
much we were becalmed, and what a ftrong current
fet towards the fhore: bow-even, I encouraged him.
not to be afraid, but bring the fhip to an anchor, as
foon as we were certain that we muft engage them.
Accordingly we did fo, and furled all our fails: as to
the favages, we feared nothing, but only that they
might fet the Ihip on fire; to prevent which I order-
ed them to g«t their boats out, and faften them, one
clofe by the head, and the other by the ftern, well
manned, with fkeets and buckets to extinguifh the
flames, fhould it fo happen. The favages foon came
up with us, but there were not fo many as the mate
had faid, for inftead of a thoufand canoes, there were
Y 2 only-
only one hundred and twenty; too many indeed for
us, feveral of their canoes containing about fixteen or
feventeen men.
As. they approached us, they feemed to be in the
greateft amazement, not knowing what to make of us.
They rowed round the fhip, which occafioned us to
call to the men in the boats, not to fuffer them to
come near them. Hereupon they beckoned to the
favages to keep back, which they accordingly did;
but at their retreat they let fly about fifty arrows a-
mong us, and very much wounded one of our men in
the longboat. I called to them not to fire upon any
account, but handing them down fome deal-boards,
the carpenters made them a kind of a fence to fhield
them from the arrows. In half an hour after they
came fo near aftern of us, that we had a perfect fight
of them; then they rowed a little farther out, till
they came directly along fide of us, and then approach-
ed fo near as they could hear us fpeak: this made
• me order all our men to keep clofe, and get their
guns ready. In the mean time I ordered Friday to
go. out upon deck, and afk them in his language
•what they meant? No fooner did he do fo, but lix
of the favages, who were in the foremoft canoes, floop-
ing down, fhewed us their naked backfides, as much
as to fay in EngliJh,-Kifs our :but Friday quickly
knew what this meant, by immediately crying out
they were going' to fhoot; unfortunately for him,,
poor creature! who fell under the cloud of three hun-
dred arrows, no lefs than feven piercing through his
body, killing one of the beft of fervants, and faithful-
left of companions in all my folitudes and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that
the guns, which before were charged with only pow-
der, to frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with
fmall fhot; nor did the gunners fail in their aim, but
at this broadfide fplit and overfet thirteen or fourteen
of their canoes, which killed numbers of them, and
fet the refl a fwimming: the others, frightened out
of
of their wits, little regarding their fellows drowning,
fcoured away as faft as they could. One poor wretch
pur people took up, fwimming for his life, an hour
after. He was very fullen at firft, fo that he would
neither eat nor fpeak: but I took a way to cure him, by
ordering them to throw him into the fen, which they
did, and then he came fwimming back like a cork,
calling in his tongue, -as I fuppofe, to fave him. SO'
we took him on board, but it was a long time before
we could make him fpeak or underftand Englifh; yet
when we h.id taught him, he told us, they were going
with their kings to fight a great battle: and when ive
afked him, what made them come up to us? he faid,
to maliee de great wonder kok: where, it is to be
noted, that thofe natives, and thofe of Africa, always
add two e's at the end of Englifh words, as makee,
takee, and the like, from which it is a very difficult
thing to make them break off.
Being now under fail, we took our laft farewell of
poor honefl Friday, and interred him with all poffible
decency and folemnity; putting him into a coffin,
and committing him to the deep, at the fame time
cauTing eleven guns to be fired for him. Thus ended
the life of one of the moft grateful, faithful, hondt,
and affe£tionate fervants, that ever any man was blef-
fed with in the world.
Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve
days time we made land in the latitude of five degrees
fouth of the line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in
fight of fhore, when we made cape St Augufline, and
in three days we came to an anchor off the bay cf
All Saints. I had great difficulty here to get leave to
hold correfpondence on (Lore; for neither the figure
of my partner, my two merchant truftees, nor the
fame of my wonderful prefervation in the ifland, could
procure me the favour, tilf fuch time as the prior of
the monaftery of the Auguflines (to whom! had given
500 moidores) obtained leave from the governor, for
pie perfona!Iy, with the captain and one more, toge-
v. Y 3 ther
ther with eight failors, to come on (bore; upon thre.
condition, that we fhould not land any goods out of
the fhip, or carry any perfon away without licence:
I found means however to get on fhore three bales of.
Englifh goods, fuch as fine broad cloths, ftuffs, and
feme linen, which I brought as a prefent for my part-
ner, who had fent me on board aprefent of frefh pro-
vifions, wine, and fweatmeats, worth above thirty
moidores, including fome tobacco, and three or four
fine gold medals. . .
Here I delivered my partner in goods to the value
of lool. Sterling, and obliged him to fit up the floop
I bought, for the ufe of my ifland, in order to fend
them refrefhments: and fo active was he in this mat-
ter, that he had the veflel fmifhed in a few days, to
the mailer of which I gave particular inftructions to
find the place. I foon loaded him with a fmall car-
go: and one of our failors offered to fettle there, upon
my letter to the Spanifh governor, if I would allot
him tools and a plantation. This I willingly grant-
ed, and gave him the favage we had taken prifoner
to be his flave. All things being ready for the voy-
age, my old partner told me, there was an acquain-
tance of his, a Brazil planter, who having fallen'un-
der the difpleafure of the church, and in fear of the
Inquifition, -which obliged him to be concealed, would
be glad of fuch an opportunity to make his efcape,,
with his wife and two daughters; and if I would al-
lot them a plantation in my ifland, he would give
them a fmall flock to begin with, for that the officers
had atready feized his effects and eftate, and left him
nothing but a little "houfhold fluff, and two flaves.
This requeft I prefently granted, concealing him and
his family on board our fhip, till fuch time as the
floop (where all the effects were) was gone out of.
the bay, and then we put them on board, who car-
ried fome materials, and plants for planting fugar-
c.uies, along with them. By this floop, among other
things^! fent my fubje&s 3 milch cows and five calves,,
about
•about 22 hogs, 3 fows big with pig, 2 marcs and a
flone horfe. I alfo engaged three Portugal women
to go for fake of the Spaniards, which, with the per-
fecuted man's two daughters, were fufficienr, fince
the reft had wives of their own, though in. another
country; all which cargo arrived fafe, no doubt to
their exceeding comfort, who, with this addition,
were about fixty or feventy people, befides children.
At this place, my truly honeft and pious clergyman
left me; for a fhip being ready to fet fail for Lifbon,
he afked me leave to go thither; but I affure you, it
was with the greateft reluctancy I parted from a per-
fon, whofe virtue and piety merited the greateit e-
fteem.
From the Brazils, we made direclly over the Atlantic
ocean, to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable
good voyage, fleering for the moft part S. E. We
were on a trading voyage, and had a fupercargo on
board, who was to direct all the fhip's motions after
flie arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a cer-
tain number of days, for ftay, by charter party, at
the feveral ports fhe was to go to. At the Cape, we
only took in frefh water, and then failed for the
coaft of Coromandel: we were there informed, that a
French man of war of 50 guns, and two large mer-
chant fhips, were failed for the Indies,1 but we heard
no more of them.
In our paffage, we touched at the ifland of Mada-
gafcar, where, though the inhabitants are naturally
fierce and treacherous, and'go conftamly armed with
bows and lances,, yet for fome time they treated us
civilly enough ; and, in exchange for knives, fcifiars,
and other trifles, they brought us eleven good fat bulr
locks, which we took partly for prefent frefli victuals,
and the remainder to fait for the fhip's ufe.
So curious was I to view every corner of the world
where I came to, that I went on fhore as often as I
could. One evening when on more, we obferved
i numbers of the people ftand gazing at us at a dir
fiance.
ftance. We thought ourfelves in no danger, -as they
had hitherto ufed us kindly. However, we cut three
boughs out of a tret, fticking them at a dMtance from
us, which, it feems, in that country, is not only a to-
ken of truce and amity, but when poles or boughs
are fet up on the other fide,' it is n fign the truce is
accepted. In thefe treaties, however, there is one
principal thing to be regarded, that neither party
come beyond one another's three poles or boughs; fo
that the middle fpace is not only fecure, but is alfo
allowed as a market for traffic and commerce: when
the truce is thus accepted, they ftick up their javelins
and lances at the firft poles, and come on unarmed;
but, if any violence is offered, away they run to their
poles, take up their weapons, and then the truce is
at an end. This evening, it happened that a greater
number of people than ufual, both men and women,
traded among us for fuch toys as we had, with fuch
great civility, that we made us a little tent of large
boughs of trees, fome of the men refolving to lie
fin fhore all night: But, for my part, I and fome o-
thers took our lodging in the boat, vvith boughs of
trees fpreadover it, having a fail fpread at the bottom
to lie upon. About-two o'clock in the morning, we
vsre awakened by the firing of mufkets, and our
men crying out for help, or elfe they would all be
murdered. Scarce had we time to get the boat afhore,
when our men came plunging themfelves into the
water, with about four hundred of the inlanders at
their heels. We took up feven of the men, three of
them very much wounded, and one left behind killed,
while the enemy poured their arrows fo thick among
us, that we were forced to make a barricade, with
boards lying at the fide of the boat, to fhield us from
danger; and, having got ready our fire arms, we re-
turned them a volley, which wounded feveral of them,
as we could hear by their cries. In this condition
we lay till break of .day, and then making fignals of
diftreis to the fhip, -which my nephew the captain
heard
heard and underftood, he weighed anchor, and flood
as near the fhore as poffible, and then fent another
boat with ten hands in her to affifh us; but we called
to them not to come near, informing them of our
unhappy condition. However, they ventured; when
one of the men taking the end of a tow line in his
one hand, and keeping our boat between him and our
adverfaries, fwam on board us, and made faft our
line to the boat; upon this, ffipping our cables, they
towed us out of the reach of their arrows, and quick-
ly after, a broadfide was given them from the fhip,
which made a moft dreadful havock among them.
When we got on board, we examined into the occa-
fion of this fray ; the men who fled informed us, that
an old woman, who fold milk within the poles, had
brought a young woman with her, who carried roots,
or herbs, the Cght of whom fo much tempted our
men, that they offered rudenefs to the maid, at which
the old woman fet up a great cry 5 nor would the
failors part with the prize, but carried her among
the trees, while the old woman went, and brought a
•whole army down upon them. At the beginning of the
attach, one of our men was lulled with a lance, and the
fellow who began the mifchief, paid dear enough for
his miftrefs, though as yet we did not know what
had' become of him; the reft luckily efcaped. The
third night after the action, being curious to under-
ftand how affairs flood, I took the fupercargd, and
twenty flout fellows with me, and landed about two
hours before midnight, at the fame place where thofe
Indians flood the night before, and there we divided
our men into two bodies, the boatfwain commanding
one, and I another. It was fo dark, that we could
fee nobody, neither did we hear any voice near us:
but by and by the boatfwain falling over a dead bo-
dy, we agreed to halt till the moon mould rife, which
•we knew would be in an hour after. We perceived
here no fewer than two and thirty bodies upon the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Satisfied.
•with'
this difcovery, I was for going on board again;
but the boatfwain and the reft told me, they would
make a vifit to the Indian town, where thofe dogs, fo
they called them, refided, afking me at the fame time
to go along with them; for, they did not doubt,
betides getting a good booty, but they fhould find Tom
Jeffery there, for that was the unhappy man we mif-
fed. But I utterly refufed to go, and commanded
them back, being unwilling to hazard their lives, as
the fafety of the fhip wholly depended upon them.
Notwithftanding all I could fay to them, they all left
me but one, and the fupercargo: fo we three return-
ed, to the boat, where a boy was left, refolving to ftay
till they returned. At parting I told them I fuppofed
rnoft of them would run the fame fate with Tom
Jeffery. To this they replied, Come, boys, come along,
we'll war rant "we'll come offfafe enough: and fo away
they went, notwithstanding all my admonitions, ei-
ther concerning their own fafety, or the prefervation
of the fhip. Indeed, they were gallantly armed, e-
very man having a mufket, bayonet, and a piftol, be-
fides cutlafles, hangers, pole-axes, and hand grana-
does. They came to a few Indian houfes at firft,
which not being the town they expected, they went
farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they con-
cluded that fhe would be a fufficient guide, and fo it
proved; for, after they untied her, flie led them di-
rectly to the town, which confifted of above two hun-
dred houfes, feveral families living in forne of the huts
together. At their arrival, all being in a profound
fteep, the failors agreed to divide themfelves into
three bodies, and fet three parts of the town on
fire at once, to kill thofe that were eft-aping, and
plunder the reft of the houfes. Thus defperately re-
folved, they went to work; but the firft party had
not gone far, before they called out to the reft, that
they had found Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran
up to the place, and found the poor fellow indeed
hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat cut
alnaotl.
almoft from ear to ear: in a houfe that was hard by
the tree they found fixteen or feventeen Indians, who
had been concerned in the fray, two or three of them
being wounded, who were not gone to fleep; this
houfe they fet on fire firft, and, in a few minutes after,
five or fix places more in the town appeared in flames.
The conflagration fpread like wild fire, their houfes
being all of wood, and covered with flags or nrfhes.
The peer affrighted inhabitants endeavoured to run
out to fave their lives, but they were driven back in-
to the flames by the failors, and killed without mer-
cy. At the firft houfe above mentioned, after the boat-
fwain had flain two with his pole-axe, he threw a
hand-granado into the houfe, which buriling, made a
terrible havock, killing and wounding moft of them;
and their king and moil of his train, who were then
in that houfe, fell viclims to their fury, every crea-
ture of them being either fmothered or burnt. All
this while they never fired a gun, left the people fhould
awaken fafter than they could overpower them. But
the fire awakened them fail enough, which obliged
our fellows to keep together in bodies. By this time
the whole town was in a flame, yet their fury rather
increafed, calling out to one another to remember
Tom Jeffery. The terrible light of this conflagration
made me very uneafy, and roufed my nephew the
captain, and the reft of bis men, who knew nothing
of the matter. When he perceived the dreadful fmoke,
and heard the guns go off, he readily concluded his
men were in danger; he, therefore, takes another
boat, and comes ailiore himfeli, with thirteen men
well armed. He was greatly furprifed to fee me and
only two men in the boat, but more fo when I told
him the ftory; but though I argued with him, as I
did with his men, about the danger of the voyage,
the interefts of the merchants and owners, and the
fafety of the fhip, yet my nephew, like the reft, de-
clared, that he would rather lofe the fhip, his voyage,
his life, and all, than his men fhould be loft for want
of
of help: and fo away he went. For my part, feeing
him refolved to go, I had not power to ftay behind.
He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve men
more, and then we marched directly as the flame
guided us. But furely never was fuch a fcene of hor-
ror beheld, or more difmal cries heard, except when
Oliver Cromwell took Drogheda in Ireland, where
he neither fpared man, woman, or child.
The firft object, I think, we met with, was the
ruins of one of their habitations, before which lay
four men and three women killed, and two more
burnt to death among the fire, which was now de-
caying. Nothing could appear more barbarous than
this revenge: none more cruel than the authors of it.
As we went on, the fire increafed, and the cry pro-
ceeded in proportion. We had not gone much far-
ther, when we beheld three naked women, follow-
ed by fixteen or feventeen men, flying with the
greateft fwiftnefs from our men, who fhot one of
them in our fight. When they perceived us, whom
they fuppofed alfo their murtherers, they fet up a moft
dreadful fhriek, and both of them fwooned away in
the fright. This was a fight which might have foft-
ened the hardeft heart: and, in pity, we took fome
ways to let them know we would not hurt them,
•while the poor creatures, with bended knees, and lift-
ed up hands, made piteous lamentations to us to fave"
their lives. I ordered our men not to hurt any of
the poor creatures whatfoever; but being willing to
underftand the occafion of all this, I went among
thefe unhappy wretches, who neither underftood me,
nor the good I meant them. However, being, re-
folved to put an enu to this barbarity, I ordered the
men to follow me. We had not gone fifty yards
before we came up with the boatfwain, with four
of our men at his heels, all of them covered with
blood and uuft, and in fearch of more people to fa-
tiate their vengeance. As foon as we faw them, we
called out, and made them underftand who we were;
upon
•were; upon which they came up to us, fetting up a
halloo of triumph, in token that more help was come.
Noble captain, faid he to my nephew, I'm glad you're
come: we have not half done wiih thefe villanous
hell hound dogs, we'll root out the very nation of
them from the earth, and kill more than poor Tom
has hairs upon his head: and thus he went on till I
interrupted him. Blood-thiffty dog! faid I, will your
cruelty never end? I charge you touch not one crea-
ture more; ftop your hands, and Hand ftill, or yon're
a dead man this moment. Why, .Sir, faid he, you
neither know whom you are protecting, nor what
they have done: but, pray, coma hither, and behold an
inftance of companion, if fuch can merit your cle-
mency, and with that he fhewed me the poor fellow
with his throat cut, hanging upon the tree.
Indeed, here was enough to fill their breafts with
rage, which, however, I thought had gone too far,
agreeable to thefe words of Jacob to his fons Simeon
and Levi; Curfed be their anger, for it -was farce;
and their -wrath, fer it -was cruel. But this fight
made my nephew and the reft as bad as they; nay,
my nephew declared, his concern was only for his
men; as for the people, not a foul of them ought to
live. Upon this, the boatfwain and eight more di-
rectly turned about, and went to finifll the intended
tragedy; J^iieti^eing out of my power to prevent, I
returned Back boll from ths difmal fight, and the pi-
teous cries of thofe unfortunate creatures, who were
Hiade victims to their fury. Indeed, it was an egre-
gious piece of folly in me to return to the boat with
but one attendant; and I had very near paid for it,
having narrowly efcaped forty armed Indians, who
had been alarmed by the conflagration; but having
pafled the place where they flood, I got to the boat,
accompanied with the fupercargo, and fo went on
board, fending the pinnace back again, to affift the
men in what might happen. When I had got to the
Z boat,
boat, the fire was almoft extinguifhed, and the noife
abated; but I had fcarce been half an hour on hoard
the fhip, when I heard another volley given by our
failors, and a great fmoke, which, as I afterwards
found, was our men falling upon thofe houfes and
perfons that ftood between them and the fea: but
here they fpared the wives and children, and killed
only the men, to the number of about fixteen or fe-
venteen. By the time they got to the fhore, the pin-
nace and the fhip's boat were ready to receive them,
and they all got fafe on board, not a man of them
having received the leaft hurt, except two, one of
whom ftrained his foot, and the other burnt his hand
a little; for they met with no refiftance, the poor In-
dians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded.
I was extremely angry with every one of them,
hut particularly with the captain, who, inftead of
cooling the rage of the men, had prompted them on
to farther mifchief: nor could he make me any
other excufe, but, that as he was a man, he could not
mafter his paffions at the fight of one of his mea
fo cruelly murdered. As for the reft, knowing they
were not under my command, they took no notice
of my anger; but rather boafted of their revenge.
According to all their accounts, they killed or de-
ftroyed about one hundred and fifty men, women,
and children, befides burning the town to allies.
They took their .companion Tom Jeffery from the
tree, covered him with fome of the ruins, and fo left
him. But, however, this a&ion of our men might
feem to them juftifiable, yet I always openly con-
demned it with the appellation of the Maffacre of
Madagafcar. For, though they had flain this Jeffe-
ry, yet certainly he was the firfl. aggreflbr, by at-
tempting to violate the chaftity of a ycwij innocent
woman, who venturing down to them, on the faith
of the public capitulation, which was fo treacheroufly
broken, •
While
While vre were under fail, the boatfwain would
often defend this bloody action, by faying, that the
Indians had broke the truce the night before, by/booting
one of our men •without juft provocation; and what if
the poor fellow had taken a little liberty -with the wench,
he ought not to have been murdered in fo villanous a
manner : and that they hadafled nothing but -what the
divine la-ws commiffioned to be done to fuch homicides.
However, I was in the fame mind as before, telling
them that they were murderers, and bid him depend
upon't, that God would blaft their voyage for fuch
an unparallelled piece of barbarity.
When we came into the gulf of Perfia, five of our
men, who ventured on fhore, were either killed or
made flaves by the Arabians, the reft of them having
fcarce time to efcape to their boat. This made me
upbraid them afrefh with the juft retribution of hea-
ven for fuch actions; upon which the boatfwain ve-
ry warmly afked me, Whether thofe men on whom
the tower of Siloam fell, were greater finners than
the reft of the Galileans? and befides, Sir, faid he,
none of thefe five poor men that are loft, were with
us at the maflacre of Madagafcar, as you call it;
and, therefore, your rqjrehenfion is very unjuft, and
your application improper. Befides, added he, you
are continually ufing the men very ill, upon this ac-
count, and being but a paflenger yourfelf, we are
not obliged to bear it; nor can we tell what ill de-
figns you may have to bring us to judgment for it in
England; and, therefore, if you do not leave this dif-
courfe, as alfo not concern yourfelf with any of our
affairs,' I will leave the fhip, and Mot fail among fuch
dangerous company.
All this I heard very patiently; but, it being often
repeated, I at length told him, the concern 1 had on
board was none of his bufinefs: that I was a confi-
derable owner in the fhip, and therefore had a right
to fpeak in common, and that I was no way ac-
countable to him, nor to any body elfc. As no
Z i more
more paffed for fome time after, I thought all had been
over. At this time we were in the road of Bengal,
•where, going on fhere with the fupercargo, one day,
in the evening, as I was preparing to go on board, one
of the men came to me, and told me, I need not
trouble myfelf to co:ne to the boat, for that the
cockfwain and others had ordered him not to carry
-4he on board any more. This infolent meffage
much furprifed me; yet I gave him no anfwer to it,
but went directly and acquainted the fupercargo, en-
treating him to go on board, and, by acquainting the
captain with it, prevent the mutiny which I percei-
ved would happen. " But before I had fpoken this,
the matter was effected on board; for no fooner
was he gone off in the boat, but the boatfwain,
gunner, carpenter, and all the inferior officers, came
to the quarterdeck, defiling to fpeak with the cap-
tain; and there the boatfwain made a long harangue,
exclaiming againft me, as before mentioned, that,
if I had not gone afhore peaceably, for nly own di-
verfion, they, by violence, would have compelled me
for their fatisfaction: that,.as they had fhipped with
the captain,' fo they would faithfully ferve him;
but, if I did not quit the fhip, or the captain oblige
me to it, they would leave the fhip immediately:
hereupon, tuming his face about by way of fignal,
they all cried out, ONE and ALL, ONE and
ALL.
\ou maybe fure, that though my nephew was a
man of great courage, yet he could not be but fur-
prifed at their fudden and unexpe£ted behaviour;
and, though he talked floutly to them, and after-
vrards expoilulated with them, that, in common
juftice to me, who was a confiderable owner in the
fhip, they could not turn me, as it were, out of my
own houfe, which might bring their lives in danger,
fhonld they ever be taken in England; nay, though
he invited the boatfwaih on fhore to accommodate
matters with me ; yet all this, 1 fay, fignified nothing:
they
tfiey would have nothing to do with me; and
they were refolved to go on fhore, if I came on
board. Well, faid my nephew, if you are fo re*
folved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have
done: and fo he came to me, giving me an account
of their refolution, how one and all defigned to for-
fake the fhip when I came on board, for which he
was mightily concerned. I am glad to fee you, ne-
phew, faid I, and rejoice it is no worfe, fince they
have not rebelled againft you : I only defire you to
fend my neceflary things on fhore, with a fuffkient
fum of money, and I will find my way to England,
.as well as I can. Though this grieved my nephew
to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compli-
ance; in fhort, all my neceflarks were fent me, and;
fo this matter was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thoufand leagues farther
off England by fea,' than at my little kingdom, ex-
cept this difference, that I might travel by land over
the Great Mogul's country to Surat, from thence up
to Baflbra, by fea up the rerfian gulf, then take-the
way of the caravans over the Arabian defert to Aleppo
and Scanderoon, there take fhipping: to Italy, and
fo travel by land into France, and from thence crofs
the fea to England.
My nephew kft me two perfons to attend me;
one of them was his fervant, and the other clerk
to the purfer, who engaged to be mine. I took lod-
gings in an Englifh woman's hou'fe, where feveral
French, one Englifh, and two Italian merchants re^
Cded. The handfome entertainment I. met 'with,
here, occafioned me to ftay nine months confidering
what courfe I fhould take. Some Englifh goods I
had with me of great value, befides a thoufand pieces
of eight, and a letter of credence for more, if there
was fuch neceffity. The goods I foon difpofed cf
to advantage, and bought here feveral good di,-
montls, which I could eafily carry about with mtv
One morning the Englifii merchant came to me, as
Z 3 being
being very intimate together, Countryman, faid he, 7
have a project to communicate to you, -which, I hope,
•will fuit lo both our advantage. To lie fliort, Sir,
we are both in a remote part «/ the -world from our
country; but yet in a place ivhere men of Inijlnefs may
get a great deal of money. Now, if you -will put a
thojlfand pounds to my thoufand pounds, \vc -will hire a
Jlup to our fatisfaclion : youjb.illbe captain, 1 -willbe
merchant; and "we'll go a trading voyage to China;
for why fl;ould -use He Jiill like drons, "iuhile the -whole
world is in a continual motion.
This propofal foon got my confent, being very a--
greeable to my rambling genius; and the more fo,
bccaufe I looked upon my countryman to be a very
fincere perfon; it required fome time before we could
pet a vefiel to our mind, and failors to man it ac-
cordingly; at length, we bought a fhip, and got an
Englifh mate, boatfwain, and gunner, a Dutch car-
penter, and three I'ortuguefe foremaft-men; and, for
want of others, made fhift with Indian feamen. We
full failed to Achin, in the ifland of Sumatra, and then
to Siam, where we bartered our wares for fome ar-
rack and opium, .the laft of which bore a great price
among the Chinefe; in a word, we went up to
Suikan, making a very great voyage; and, after
eight months time; I returned to Bengal, very well i
fatisGed with this adventure, having not only got a i
fufficient quantity of money, but an infight of getting
a great deal more.
The next voyage my friend propofed to me, was
to go among the Spice iflands, and bring home a load
of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts, iflands
belonging partly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade
very confiderably. We were not long preparing for
this voyage, which-we made no kfs fuccefsful than
the laft, touching at Bornea, aind feveral other places
which I do not perfectly remember, and returning
Lome in about five months time. We foon fold our
fpices, which were chiefly cloves, and fome nutmegs,
to
to the Perfian merchants, who carried them away for
the gulf; and, in fhort, making five to one advan-
tage, we were loaded with money.
Not long after my friend and I had made up our
accounts, to our entire fatisfaction, there came in a
Dutch coafler from Batavia, of about two hundred
tons. T;.e crew of this veflel pretended themfelves
fo fickly, that there were not hands fufficient to
undertake a voyage; and the captain having given,
out that he intended to go to Europe, public notice
was given that the fhip was to be fold. No fooner
did this come to our ears, but we bought the fhip,
paid the mafter, and took pofleffion. We would alfo
have very willingly entertained fome of the men:
but they having received their fhare of booty, were
not to be found, being altogether fled to Agra, the
great city of the Mogul's refidence; and from thence
were to travel to Surat, and fo by fea to the Perfian
gulf. And indeed they had reafon to fly in this
manner: for the truth of it was, the pretended cap-
tain was the gunner only, and not the commander:
that having been on a trading voyage, they were at-
tacked on ihore by the Malayans, wh'o killed three
men, and the captain; after whofe death the other
eleven men run away with the Ihip to the bay of
Bengal, and left the mate and five men more on
fhore; but of this affair we fhall have occafion to
fpeak at more length hereafter.
However they came by the fhip, we thought we
bought it honeftly; neither did we fufpect any thing
of the matter; when the man fhewed us a bill of
fale for the fhip (undoubtedly forged) to oneEmanuel
Clofterfhoven, which name he went by. And fo
without any more to do, we picked up fome Dutch
and Englifh feamen, refolding for another voyage for
cloves among the Philippine and Molucca iflands; in
fhort, we continued thus five or fix years, trading
from port to port with extraordinary fuccefs; in
the feventh year we undertook a voyage to China,
defigning
defigning to touch at Siam, and buy fome rice ty
the way. In this voyage, contrary winds beat us up
and down for a eonfidersble time among the iflands
in the ftraits of Molucca. No fooner were we clear
of tbofe rugged feas, but we perceived our fhip had
fprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the
river Cambodia, which lies northward of the eulf,
and goes up to Siam.
One day as I was on fhore refrefhing myfelf, there
comes to me an Englifhman, who was a gunner's
mate on board an Englifh Eaft India fhip, riding up
the river, near the city of Cambodia. Sir, foid he, you
may -wonder at my bnfmefs, havingnever feenme in pur
life; but though lam ajtranger, Ikavefomething to tell
you that very nearly concerns yaut and indeed it is the
imminent danger you are in, has moved me to give you
this timely notice. Danger! faid I, what danger? I
know of none, except my fhip being leaky, for which
I defign to have her run aground to-morrow morning.
Sir, faid he, I hope you will be better employed, -when
youfball hear -what I have to fay to you. You know the-
town o/'Cambodia is about i 5 leagues up this river : a-
bout three leagues on this fide of it, there lies two Dutch
and three EnglifhyZ>//j. And -would you venture here,
•without confidering -what ftrength you had to engage
them.? I knew not what he meant by this difcourfe,and
turning fhcrt upon him, Sir, faid I, I know no reafcn I
have to be afraid either of any Englifh or Dutch fhips.
I am no interloper, and what bufinefs have they then,
with me? Well, Sir, faid the man, if you do think your-
felffecure, all as I can fay, you muji take your chance .-
hs-wever, lam very ferry you arefo deaf to good advice;
hit I ajfure you if you do not put tofea immediately, you
•will be attacked by five long boats full of men, hanged
yourfelffor a pirate, if you are taken, and the parti-
cular,! examined after-wards. I thought, Sir, added he,
I might have met -with better reception for fuch a Jin-
gular piece of fervice. Sir, faid 1,1 was never ungrate-
ful to any man: but pray explain yourfelf, and I'll
go on board this minute, whether the leak be flopped
or no. Why, Sir, faid he, to be fhort, becaufe time is
precious, the matter is this: Yon know -well enough that
you -was -with thz flip ,it Samatra, -where your captain
was murdered by the Malayans, -with three of his fai-
hrs; and that either you, or fome -who -were on board
you, ran away with the Jbip, and are fmce turned pi-
rates at fea. Now, Sir, this is the fum of-what I had
to fay; aml I can positively af*ure you, that if you be.
taken, you will be executed without much ceremony;
for undoubtedly you cannot but ie fenfible what little law
merchant Jbips foe-w to pirates, whenever they fall in-
to their unmerciful hands.
Sir, faid I, I thank you for your kind informa-
tion; and though, I am fure, no man could come
more honeflly by the fhip than I have done, yet
knowing their entcrprife, and being fatisfied of your
honcfl intention, I'll be upon my defence. Prithee,
Sir, faid the man, don't talk of being t/fon your defence,
the beji that yon can make is to be out of danger; and
therefore, if you have any regard to your life, and the
lives of your men, take the advantage, without fail, of
putting out to fea at high water; by whieh means, as
you have a whole tide before you, you will lie gone too far
out of their reach before they can come dfuin.
I am mighty well fatisfied, faid I, in this particu-
lar, and of your kindnefs, which merits my greateft
efteem? pray, Sir, what amends fhall I make you?
He replied, 1 know not what amends you are willing
to make, bccaufe you may have fome doubts of its cer-
tainty: tut, to convince you of the truth of what Ifa\-,
I have one offer to make to you. On board one of the
Engifft,jbips, I have nineteen months pay due to me, and
this Dutchman that is with me has /even months pay
due to him, which if you will make good to us, we will
go along with you. Jf you /ballfind, that there is no-
thing in what we have faid, then we /hall dcfirc no-
thing: but, when you are canvinced that we ha vefaved
the
tktjbip, your life, and the lives of the men, -we "will
leave the whole to your generofity.
So reafonable did this every way appear, that I
immediately confented, and we went directly on
board. As foon as we came on board, my partner
calls joyfully out, That they had flopped the leak!
Well, thank God, faid I, but, pray let us weigh
anchor forthwith. Weigh! faid he, what is the
meaning of this hurry? Pray, afk no queftions, faid
I, but all hands to work, without lofing a moment's
time: Upon which, in great furprife, the captain
was called, who immediately ordered the anchor to
be .got up; and though the tide was not quite down,
yet, being affifted with a little land breeze, we ftood
out to fea. I then called my partner into the cabin*
and related the ftory at large, which was confirmed,
and more amplified by the two men I had brought
on board. Scarce had we finifhed our difcodrfe, up-
on this head, but a failor came to the cabbin door,
with a meflage from the captain, that we were
chafed by five floops full of armed men. Ve/y well,
faid I, it is plain now there is fomething in it. And
fo, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a
defign for feizing the (hip, and of executing us for
pirates; and afked them) whether they would faith-
fully ftand by us, and by one another? To which,
they unanimoufly replied, that they would fight to
their laft drop of blood. I then afked the captain,
which way he thought beft for us to manage the
battle ? Sir, faid he, the only method is to keep them off
with our great Jbot as long as tve are able, and then have
recourfe to our/mall arms: and -when both, thefefail us,
then retire to clofe quarters, when perhaps the enemy,
•wanting materials, can neither break apen our l-ulk
beads, nor get in upon us. Mean time the gunner was
ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of
the fteerage, and fo load them with mufket bullets,
and fmall pieces of old iron; and the deck being
cleared, we prepared for the engagement, Hill, how-
ever,
ever, keeping out at fea. The boats followed us
with all the fail they could make, and we could per-
ceive the two foremoft were Englifh, which outfailed
the reft by two leagues, and which we found would
come up with us: hereupon, we fired a gun without
ball, intimating that they fhould bring to, and we
put out a flag of truce, as a fignal for parley; but,
finding them crouding after us, till they came with-
in (hot, we took in our white, and hanging out the
red flag, immediately fired at them with ball: we
then called to them with a fpeaking trumpet, bidding
them at their peril keep off.
But all this fignified nothing; for, depending up-
on the ftrength that followed '.hem, they were refo-
lately bent for mifchief: hereupon, I ordered them to
bring the fhip to, by which means, they lying upon
our broadfide, we let fly at them at once, one of
whom carried away the ftern of the hindermofl boat,
and obliged them not only to take down their fail,
but made them all run to the head of the boat, to
keep them from finking; and fo ihe lay by, having
enough of it. In the mean time, we prepared to
welcome the foremoft boat in the fame manner.
While we were doing this, one of the three hinder-
moft boats came up to the relief of that which was
difabled, and took the men out of her. We again
called to parley with them ; but, in flead of an anfwer,
one of the boats came clofe under our ftern; where-
upon, our gunner let fly his two chace guns, but
miffing) the men in the- boat fhouted, and waving
their .caps, came on with greater fury. To repair
this feeming difgrace, the gunner foon got ready,
and, firing the fecond time, did a great deal of mif-
chief among the enemy. We waved again, and,
bringing our quarter to bear upon them, fired three
guns more, when we found the boat a-fin king, and
feveral men atready in the fea; hereupon, manning
our pinnace, I gave orders to fave as many as they
could, and inftantly to come on board, becaufe the
reft
refl of their boats were approaching: accordingly they
did fo, and took up three of them, one of whom was
almoft paft recovery; and then crouding all the fail
we could, after our men came on board, we flood
out farther to fea, fo that the other three boats gave
Over their chace, when they came up to the firft two.
Thus delivered from imminent danger, we changed
our courfe to the eaftward, quite out of the courfe of
all European fhips.
Being "ow at fea, and inquiring more particularly
of the two feamen, the meaning of all this, the
Dutchman, at once, let us into the fecret. He told
us, that the fellow who fold us the fliip was an ar-
rant thief, who had run away with her; that the
captain was treacheroufly murdered on the coaft of
Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men;
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being obli-
ged to have recourfe to the woods for their fafety,
at length efcaped by means of a Dutch fhip, in its
way to China, which had fent their boat on fhore for
frefh water: That, after this, he went to Batavia,
where two of the feamen belonging to the ^hip (who
had deferted the reft in their travels) arrived, and
there gave an account that the fellow who ran away
with the fhip had fold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates,
•who went a cruifing, and had atready taken one Eng-
lifh, and two Dutch fhips richly laden.
Now, though this was abfolutely falfe, yet, con-
cerning us directly, my partner truly faid, that our
deliverance was to be eftecmed fo much the more,
by reafon, had we fallen into their hands we could
have expected nothing from them but immediate
death, confidering our accufers would have been our
judges: and, therefore, his opinion was, to return
diredly to Bengal, where, being known, we could
prove how honeftly we came by the fhip, of whom
we bought her, and the like, and where we were
fure of fome juftice; at leaft would not be hanged
firft, and judged afterwards. I was at firft of my
partner's
partner's opinion; but when I had more fcrioufly
confidered of the matter, I told him we ran a great
hazard in attempting to return, being on the wrong
fide of the ftraits of Molucca, and that if, upon alarm
given, we fhould be taken by the Dutch of "BatavLi
or Englifh elfewhere, our running away would be a
fufficient evidence to condemn us. This danger in-
deed ftartled not only my partner, but likewife all the
fhip's company; fo we changed our former refolu-
tion, and refolved to go to the coaft of Tonquin, and
fo to that of China, where, purfuing our firft defign
as to trade, we might likewife have an opportunity to
difpofe of the fhip fome way or other, and to return
to Bengal in any country veflel we could procure.
This being agreed to, we fleered away N. N. E. a-
bout 50 leagues off the ufual courfe tothe.eaft, which
put us to fome inconveniencies. As the wind blew
fteadily againft us, our voyage became very tedious,
and we began to be afraid of want of provifion; and
•what was ftill worfe, we apprehended, that as thofe
fhips, from whofe boats we had efcaped, were bound
to China, they might get before us, and have given
frefh information, which might create another vigo-
rous purfuit. Indeed, I could not help being grieved,
when I confidered that I, who had never wronged or
defrauded any perfon in my life, was now purfued
like a common thief; and, if taken, to run the great-
eft danger of being executed as fuch; and, though
innocent, I found myfelf under the neceffity of flying
for my fafety: and thereby efcape, being brought to
fhame, of which I was even more afraid than of death
itfelf. It was eafy to read my dejection in my coun-
tenance. My mind was opprefled, like thofe unhap-
py innocent perfons, who, being overpowered by
blafphemous and perjured evidences, wickedly refol-
ved to take away their lives, or ruin their reputation,
have no other recourfe in this world to eafe their for-
row, but lighs, prayers, and tears. My partner fee-
ing me fo concerned, encouraged me as well as he
A a could;
could; and, after defcribing to me the feveral ports
or that coaft, he told me, he would either put me in
on tie coail of Cochinchina, or elfe in the bay of
Tonquin, from whence we might go to Macao, a
town once poffefled by the Portuguefe, and where ftill
many European families refided.
To this place we fleered, and, early next morning,
came in fight of the coaft; but thought it advifeable
to put into a fmall river where we could, either over
land, or by the fhip's pinnace, knew what veflels
were in any ports thereabouts. This happy ftep pro-
ved cur deliverance; for, next morning, there came
to the bay of Tonquin two Dutch fhips, and a third
without any colours; and, in the evening, two Eng-
lifh fhips'fteered the fame courfe. 'J he river where
we were was but fmall, and run but a few leagues up
the country northward: the country was wild and
barbarous, and the people thieves, having no corre-
fpcndence with any other nation, dealing only in fifh,
oil, and fuch grofs commodities; and one barbarous
cuflom they ftifl retained, that when any veflH was
unhappily fhip-wrecked upon their coaft, they make
the men prifoners or flaves; fo that now we might
fairly fay we were furrounded by enemies both by fea
and land.
As the fhip had been leaky, we took the opportu-
nity, in this place, to fearch her, and to flop up the
places which let in the water. We accordingly
lightened her, and bringing our guns and other
moveable things to one fide, we eflayed to bring her
down, that we might come at her bottom: but, up-
on fecond confederation, we did not think it fafe to
let her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not ufed
to fuch a fight as to fee a fhip lie down on one Cde,
and heel in towards the fhore, not perceiving her
men, who were at work on her bottom, with ftages
and boats on the ofl-fide, prefently imagined the fhip
bad been caft away, and lay faf t on the ground.
Agreeable
Agreeable to this fuppofuion, they furrounded us
with ten or twelve large boats, with a refolution,
undoubtedly, to plunder the fhip, and to carry away
thofe they found alive for flaves to their king. But
•when they perceived our men hard at work on the
fhip's bottom and fide, wafhing, graving, and flop-
ping her, it filled them all with fuch furprife, that
they ftood gazing as though they were confounded.
Nor could we imagine what their defign was; how-
ever, for fear of danger, we handed down arms and
ammunition, to thofe at work, in order to defend
themfdvcs; and, indeed, this precaution was abfo-
]utely neceffory; for, in a quarter of an hour after,
the natives, concluding it was really a Ihipwreck,
and that we were faving our lives and goods, which
they thought belonged to them, came down upon
our men, as though it had been in a line of hmlc.
We lay at prefent but in a very unfit poflure to fight;
and before the ftages could be got down, or the men
in the boat come on board as they were ordered, the
Cochinchinefes were upon them, and two of their
boats boarding our longboat, they began to lay hold
of our men as prifoners. The firft they feized was
a ftout Englifh failor, who never fired his nuifket,
like a fool, as I imagined, but laid it down in the
boat; but he knew what he was doing; for, by main
force, he dragged the Pagan out of the boat into ours
by the two ears, and knocked his brains out againft
the boat's gunnel: a Dutchman that was next him
fnatched up the mufket, and knocked down five
more with the but-end of it; however, this was
doing- very little to their number; but a ftrange un-
exf:cted accident, which rather merits laughter than
any thing elfe, gave our men a complete victory over
them.
It feems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave
the outfide of the Ihip, as well as to pay the fcams,
where he caulked to flop the leaks, had gotten two
kctties juft let down in the boat, one filled with
A a 2 boiling
boiling pitch, and the other with rofin, tallow, oil,
and fuch fluff as the fhipwriglus ufe: the carpenter's
man had a great iron laddie with which he ufed to
fupply the workmen with hot fluff, and as two of
the enemies catered the boat where the fellow ftood,
he faluted them with a full laddie of the hot boiling
liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked,
made them roar out, and jump into the fea. Well
done, Jack, fays tbe carpenter, give them the other
dofe: and fo ftcpping forward himfelf, takes a mop,
nnd dipping it into the pitch pot, he and his man fo
plentifully flung it among them, as that none e-
- leaped being fcahled: upon which, they all made the
beft of their way, crying.and bowling in fuch a
frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never
lieard the like. And, indeed, never was I better
pleafed with any conqueft than I was with this, there
being fo little bloodfhed, and having an averfion to
tilling fuch favage wretches, (more than was ne-
cefiary), as knowing they came on errands, which
their laws and cufboms made them think were juft
-nnd equitable. By this time, all things being in or-
iler, and the fhip fjvimming, they found their mi-
flake, fo they did not venture a fecond attack. Thus
ended our merry fight;'and, having got fome rice,
bread, roots, and fixteen good hogs, on board the
day before, we fet faif, not daring to go into ths bay
of Tonquin, but fleered N. E. towards the ifle of
Formofa, or as though we would go to the Manillas,
or Philippine iflands, for fear of meeting with any
European fhips. When we anchored at the ifle For-
mofa, the inhabitants, not only courteoufly fupplied us
•with provifions and frefh water, but dealt very fairly
and honeflly with us in their bargains nnd agree-
ments. From this place we fleered north, keeping
ftill off the coafl of China, till we were beyond all
its ports where European flaps ufually come; and, at
length, being come to the latitude of thirty degrees,
we refolved to put into the firft trading port we
fhould
fhould come at; and ftanding for the fliore, n boat
came off two leagues to us with an old Portuguefe
pilot on board, who offered his fervice; we very
gladly accepted him, and fent the boat back again.
And now, having the old man on board, 1 talked to-,
him of going to Nanquin, the moft northward part
of the coaft of China. What will you do there?
faid he, fmiling. I told Mm we would fell our car-
go, and purchafe callicoes, raw and wrought filks,
tea, &c. and fo return the fame way back. O, faid
he, you had better put in at Macao, where you may
buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin, and fell
your opium at a greater advance. But, faid I, we are
gentlemen as well as merchants, and defign to fee
the great city of Pekin, and the magnificent court of
the monarch of China. Why then, faid he, you
fhould go to Ningpo, where there is a navigable river
that goes through the heart of that vaft empire, two
hundred and fevcnty leagues from the fea, which
erofles all the rivers, pafles confiderable hills, by the
help of the fluices and gates, and goes even up to the
city of Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you pleafe,
and travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch fhip juft be-
fore bound that way. At the name of a Dutch or
Engliflv fhip, I was ftruck with confufion; they being
as great a terror to me in this veffel, as an Algtrine
man of war is to them in the Mediterranean. The
old man finding me troubled, Sir, faid he, I hope the
Dutch are not now at war with your nation: No,
faid I, but God knows what liberty they may take
•when out of the reach of the law. Why, fays he,
what occafion is there for peaceable merchants to
fear? For, believe me, they never meddle with any
but PIRATES.
At the mentioning of the word pirates, my coun-
tenance turned to that of fcarlet; nor was it poffiDie
for me to conceal it from the old pilot; who taking
notice of it, Sir, faid he, take -what courfe you pkafe,
I'll do you all the fervice I can. Seignior, faid I, I
A a 3 am
am a little concerned at your mentioning pirates, I
hope there are none fuch in thefe Teas, becaufe you
Jee in what a weak condition we are to defend our-
ielves. 0, Sir, faid he, if that's all, don't be concern-
ed, 1 don t remember one in thefe feas thefe fifteen
years, except about a month ago one -was feen in the lay
of biam, butjbe is gene to the fouthward; neither-was
Jbe built for a privateer, but -was run away -with by
a reprobate captain, and fame of his men, the ri"ht
captain having been murdered by the Malayans.
What! faid I, (as though ignorant of what had
happened) did they kill the captain? Aro, faid he, it
ts generally thought the Malayans murdered him; but
•perhaps they might procure them to do it, and therefore
theyjuflly deferve hanging. The rogues -were lately dif-
covered in the bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia,
by Jome Dutchmen -who belonged to thejhip, and had
much ads to efcape the Jive boats that purfued them,
but they have all given fuch an exafl defcription of
the Jl,ip, that -where-ever they find her, they will be
jure to know her; and they have folemnlyfwore to give
110 quarter to the captain or thejeamen, hit hang them
every one up at the yard arm, -without any formal bu-
fwefs of bringing them to a court tfjudicature.
Being fenfible, that, having the old man on
board, he was incapable of doing me any mifchief,
Well, Seignior, faid I, it is for this very reafon I
would have you carry us up to Nanquin, where nei-
ther Englifh nor Dutch fhips come: and I muft tell
you, their captains are a parcel of rafh, proud,' info,
lent rafcals, that neither know what belongs to
juftice, nor how to behnve themfelves as the laws of
God or nature direct; fellows that would prove mur-
derers to punifh robbers, and take upon them to
adjudge innocent men to death, without any proof
to prove them guilty; but perhaps I may live to call
them to account for it, in a place where they may
be taught how juftice is to be executed. And fo
I told him all the ftory of buying the fhip, and how
we
•we were faved by the means of two men: that the
murder of the captain by the Malayans, as alfo the
running away with the fliip, I believed to be true ,
but that we, who bought it, were turned pirates,
•was a mere fiction, to cover their cowardice and
foolifh behaviour, when they attacked us, and the
blood of thofe men we killed in our own juft de-
fence, lay to their door, who fent to attack us by
furprife.
Sir, faid the old man amazed, you have taken the
right courfe tofteer to the north, and, if I might advifc
you, I -would have you fell ycurJLip in China, and buy
or build another in that country; and I'll procure people
to buy the one and fell the other. Well but, Seignior,
faid I, if I fell the fhip in this manner, I may bring
fome innocent perfons into the fame danger as I have
gone through, perhaps worfe, even death itfelf, where-
•by I fhould be as guilty of their murder as villanous
executioners. Tbfit need not trouble you, fays the old
man; I'itfind a way to prevent that sforthefe coyimand-
ers you talk of 1 know very -well, and will inform them
rightly of the matter as you have related, and lamper-
fuaded they will not only believe me, but afl more cau-
tioujlyfor the future. And will you deliver one meflage
from me to them? Yes, faid he, if you -will give it un-
der your hand, that I may prove it is nit of my own pro-
duflion. Hereupon I wrote a large account of their
attacking me in their longboat, the pretended reafon
and unjuft defign of it; that they had done what they
might be afliamed of, and could notanfwer for at any
tribunal in England. But this letter was writ in vain.
Providence ordered things another way. We failed
tlire£Uy for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days
fail, came to an anchor at the foutri weft point of the
great gulph of that place, where we learned, that two
Dutch fhips were gone the length before us, and that
we fhould certainly fall into their hands. We were
all at a great lofs in this exigency, and would very
gladly have been on fhore almoft any where; but our
old
old pilot told me, that if I would fail to the fbutrr-
\vard about two and forty leagues, there was a little
port called Quinchange, where no European fhips e-
ver came, and where we might confider what was fur-
ther to be done. Accordingly, we weighed anchor
the next day, calling only twice on fhore by the way
to g°t frefh water. The country people very cour-
teoufly fold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other pro-
vrfions. After five days fail we came to the port, and
landed with unfpeakable joy. We refolved todifpofe
of ourfelvcs and effefts in any other way poffible, than
enter on board that ill-fated veflel more; for no ftate
can be more miferable than a continued fear, which
is a lite of death, a confoundcr of our underftandings,
that fets the imagination at work to form a thoufand
frightful things that may never happen. And we
fcarce flept one night, without dreaming of halters,
yard-arms, or gibbets; of fighting, being taken, and
being killed; nay fo violent were'our apprehenfions,
th.it we would bruife our hands and heads again ft the
fides of the cabin, as though a£tually engaged. The
ftory ot" the Dutch cruelty at Amboyna often came in-
to our thoughts when awake; and, for my part, I
thought my condition very hard, that, after fo many
difficulties, and fuch fignal deliverances, I fhould be
hanged in my old age, though innocent of any crime
that deferved fuch punifhment; but then religion
would feem to reprefent to me, as though the voice
of it had faid, Confider, O man! what fins you have
been formerly guilty of, which now thou art called
to an account for, to expiate with thy blood! And
as to thy innocence, what art thou more innocent
than thy blefled Redeemer Jefus Chrift, who fuffered
for thy offences, and to whofe providence you ought
to fubmit, let what will happen? After this natural
courage would infpirs me to refift to the laft drop of
blood, and fooner die than fuffer myfelf to be taken
by boorifh, rafcalty Dutchmen, who had arts to tor-
ment beyond death itfelf.
But
But now, thank kind Heaven, being afhore, our
old pilot procured us a lodging and a warehoufe for
our goods; it was a little hut with a large warehoufe
joining to it, all built with canes, and pallifadoed
round with large ones, to keep out pilfering thieves,
which are very numerous in that country. The ma-
giftrates allowed us a little guard during the night,
and we employed a centinel with a kind of halbert for
three pence a day. The fair or mart, we found, had
been over for fome time; however, there remained
in the river four junks and two Japan fhips, the mer-
chants of the latter being on fhore. In the firft place,
our old pilot brought us acquainted with the miffion-
ary Pvoman priefts, who were converting the people
to Chriftianity: two of them were referved, rigid,
and auftere, applying themfelves to the work they
came about with great earneftnefs; but the third,
who was a Frenchman, called father Simon, was of a
freer converfation, not fecmingly fo ferious and grave,
yet no worfe Chriftian than the other two, one of
whom -was a Portuguefe, and the other a Genoefe.
Father Simon, it feems, was appointed to go to Pekin,
the royal feat of the Emperor of the Chinefe; and he
only waited for another prieft, who was ordered from
Macao to accompany him. We never met together,
but he was prompting me to keep him company in
that journey: Sir, faid he, 1 will fhew you the glo-
rious things of this mighty empire, and a city, the ci-
ty of Pekin, far exceeding London or Paris, put them
both together. One day in particular, being at din-
ner with him, I fl-iewed fome inclination to go; which
made him prefs the more upon me and my partner,
to gain our perfect confent. But, fathsr Simon, faid
my partner, whatfatisfaction can you have in our com-
pany, whom you ejleem as heretics, and confequently ob~
jetls not -worthy your regard? Oh! faid he, you may
be as good Catholics in time as thofe I hope to con-
vert to our religion. And fo, faid I, toe Jball have
you preaching to us all the way, i\iftcad of fkafing us
id Ith
•with a. defcription of the country. Sir, faid he, how-
ever our religion may be vilified by fome people, it
is very certain it neither divefts us of good manners
or Chriftian charity; and as we are gentlemen, as
fuch we may converfe together, without making one
another uneafy.
But we fhall leave him a while, to confider our
fliip and the merchandife which we had to difpofe of.
There was but very little trade in the place where we
were; and I was once rcfolved to venture to fail to
the river Kilam, and fo to the city of Nanquin: but
Providence ordered it otherwife, by our old pilot's
bringing a Japan merchant to us, to fee what goods
we had. He immediately bought our opium, for
•which he gave us a very good price in gold by weight,
fome wedges of which were about ten or eleven oun-
ces. It came into my head, that perhaps he might
buy the Qiip too; and I ordered his interpreter to
propofe it to him. He faid nothing then, but fhrunk
up his fhoulders; yet in a few days after he came ac-
companied by a miffionary prieft, who was his inter-
preter, with this propofal, That as he had bought a
great quantity of our goods, he had not money enough
topurch.ife ourjbip; but if Ipleafed, he would hire her,
•with all my men, te go to Japan, and from thence with
another loading to /^'Philippine i/lands, the freight of
both which he would verywi/linglf pay to us before; and
ut their return to Japan, would buy the Jhip. Upon
this we alked the captain and his men, if they were
•willing to go to Japan; te which they unanimoufty
agreed. While this was in agitation, the young man
my nephew left to attend me, told me, That as I did
not care to accept this proffef} of advantage, he would
manage it for me as I p leafed, and render me a faith-
ful account of his fuccefs, which Jhould be wholly mine.
Indeed I was very unwilling to part with him; but
confidering it might be for the young man's good, I
difcourfed my partner about it, who, of his own ge-
nerofity, gave him his fhare of the veflel, fo that I
could.
could do no otherwife than give him mine$ but, how-
ever, we let him have but the property of half of it,
and preferved a power, that when we met in England^
if he had obtained fuccefs, he fhould account to us
for one half of the profits of the fhip's freight, and
the other fhould be his own. Thus having taken a
writing under his hand, away he failed to Japan,
where the merchant dealt very honeftly by him, got
him a licence to come on fhore, fent him loaded to
the Philippines with a Japanefe fupercargo, from
whence he came back again loaded with European
goods, cloves, and other fpiceries. By this voyage he
cleared aconfiderable fom of money, which determi-
ned him not to fell his fhip, but to trade on his own
account: fo he returned to the Manillas, where, get-
ting acquaintance, he made his fhip free, was hired
by the governor privately to go to Acapulco in Ame-
rica, on the,Mexican coaft, with a licence to travel to
the great city of Mexico. This traffic turned out
greatly to account, and my friend finding means to
get to Jamaica, returned nine years after exceeding
rich into England. fe
In parting with the (hip, it conies in courfe to con-
Cder of thofe men who had faved our lires when in
the river of Cambodia : and though, by the way they
were a couple of rogues, who thought to turn pirates
themfelves, yet we paid them what they had before
demanded, and gave each of them a fmall fum of mo-
ney, making the Englifhman a gunner, and the
Dutchman a boatfwain, with which they were verv
well contented. } "i.' *
We were now above icoo leagues farther from
home, than when at Bengal. All the comfort we could
expett was, that there being another fair to be kept
in a month's time, we might not only purchase all
forts of that country's manufaaures, but very poffiblv
find fome Chmefe junks, or veflels from Tonquin, to
be fold, which would carry us and our goods where-
foever we pleafed. Upon thefe hopes, we refolved to
continue;
continue; and, to divert ourfelves, we took feveral
little journies in the country. About ten days after
we parted with our fhip, we travelled to fee the city
of Nanquin. This city lies in latitude 30 deg. north
of the line; it is regularly built, and the ftreets are
exactly ftraighr, and crofs one another in direct lines,
which fets it out to the greateft advantage. At our
return, we found the prieft was come from Macao that
was to accompany father Simon to Pekin. That fa-
ther earneftly folicited me to accompany him, and I
referred him to my partner. In fhort, we both agreed,
and prepared accordingly; and we were fo lucky as to
have liberty to travel among the retinue of one of
their Mandarins, who is a principal magiftrate, and
much reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling through
this miferable country, infinitely populous, but as in-
differently cultivated ; and yet their pride is infinitely
greater than their poverty, infomuch that the priefts
themfelves derided them. As we paffed by the houfe
of one of their country gentlemen, two leagues off of
Nanquin, we had the honour, forfooth, to ride with
the Chinefe fquire about two miles. Never was Don
Quixote fo exactly imitated ! Never fuch a compound
of pomp and poverty feen before!
His habit, made of callico, was dirty, greafy, and
very proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with
all its tawdry trappings, as hanging fleeves, taffels,
&c, though torn and rent in almoft every part: his
veft underneath it was no lefs dirty, but more greafy,
refembling the moft exquifite floven, or greafy but-
cher. His horfe (worfe than Rofinante, or the famous
fteed of doughty Hudibras) was a poor ftarved, de-
crepit thing, that would not fell for thirty (hillings
in England: and yet this piece of worfhipful pomp
was attended with ten or twelve flaves, who guarded
their mafter to his country-feat. We ftopped at a
little village for refrefhment; and when we came by
the country-feat of this great man, we found him fit-
ting
ting under a tree before his door, eating a mefs of
boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in the middle,
and a bag filled with green pepper "ay him, and ano-
ther plant like ginger, together with a piece of lean
mutton in it: this was his Worfhip's repaft; but
pray obferve the ftate of the fool! two women flaves
brought him his food, which being laid before him,
two others appeared to perform their refpe&ive offi-
ces; one fed him with alpoon, while the other fcra-
ped off what fell upon his beard and taffety velr, aad
gave it to a particular favourite to eat. And thus we
left the wretch pleafed with the conceit of our admi-
ring his magnificence, which rather merited our fcom
and deteftation.
At length we arrived nt the great city of Pekin, ac-
companied by two fervants, and the old Portuguefe
pilot, whofe charges we bore, and who ferved us as
zn interpreter by the way. We had fcarce been a
week at Pekin, but he comes laughing to us, 4h!
Seignior Inglife, faid he, tne famething tell you make
your heart glad, but make meforry; for you bring me
here 25 days journey, and now you liuive me go back
alone: and -which way jhall 1 make mv port after,
•without de Jbip, without tie harfff, -withunt pecune?
fo he called money in his broken Latin. He then in-
formed me, that there was a great caravan of Mufco-
vitc and Poliih merchants in the city, who were pre-
-paring to fet out for Mufcovy by land within fix
•weeks; and, that he was certain we would take this
opportunity, and confequently that he muft go home
by himfelf. Indeed this news infinitely furprifed and
pleafed me. Are you certain of this? faid I. Tes,
Sir, faid he, me fare it's true. And fo he told me,
that having met un old acquaintance of his, an Arme-
nian, in thejlreet, -who was among th?m, and -iibo
had coma from Aftracan, with a defign to gs to Ton-
quin, but for certain reafous having altered his r-fi-
lution, he -was now refolved to go with the caravan,
and to return by the river Wolga to Aftracan. Well,
Seignior, faid I, don't be difcontented about your re-
B b turning
turning alone; and, if by this means I can find apaflage
to England, it will be your own fault if you return to
Macao at all. And fo confulting with my partner,
what was beft to be done, he referred it to me as I
pleafed, having our affairs fo well fettled at Bengal,
that, if we could convert the good voyage we had made
in China filks, wrought or raw, he would be fatkfied to
go to England, and fo return to Bengal in the Compa-
ny's fhips. Thus refolved, we agreed, that, if our pi-
lot would go with us, we would bear his charges either
to Mufcow or England; and to give him in a prefent
the fum of 170 pounds Sterling. Hereupon we cal-
led him in, and told him the caufe of his complaint
fhould be removed, if he would accompany us with
the caravan; and, therefore, we defired to know his
mind. At this he fhook his head, Great long jour-
ney, faid he, me no pecune, carry me to Mufcow, or
keep me there. But we foon put him out of that
concern, by making him fenfible of what we would
give him here to lay out to the beft advantage; and,
as for his charges, we would fet him fafe on fhore,
God willing, either in Mufcovy, or England, as he
pleafed, at our own charge, except the carriage of his
goods. At this propofal, he was like a man tranfport-
ed, telling us, he would go with us all the world o-
ver; and we made preparations for our journey; but
it was near four months before all the merchants were
ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went
exprefs to tlie port where we firft put in, to difpofe of
•what goods had been left there, while I accompanied
a Chinefe merchant, who was going to Nanquin, and
there bought 29 pieces of damaik, with about 300
more of other fine filks ; and, by the time my partner
returned to Pekin, I had them all carried thither : our
cargo in filks amounted to 4500 1. Sterling, which,
together with tea, fine calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves,
loaded 18 camels for our fhare, befides what we rode
upon, with two or three fpare horfes, and two more
loaden with provifions: the company now was very
great,
great, making about 400 horfe, and above 120 men,
well armed and provided. We were of feveral nations,
among whom were five Scots merchants inhabiting
in Mufcow, and well experienced in trade.
We fet out from Pekin the beginning of February
our fkyle; and in two days more, we pafled through
the gate of the great China wall, which was creeled
as a fortification againfl the Tartars, being 100 Eng-
lifh miles long. We then entered a country not near
fo populous, chiefly under the power of plundering
Tartars, feveral companies of whom we perceived rid-
ing on poor ftarved horfes, contemptible as themfelves,
without order or difcipline. One time our leader for
the day gave us leave to go a-hunting. But what do
you think we hunted? only a parcel cf iheep, which
indeed exceeded any in the world for wildnefs and
fwiftnefs; but while we were purfuing this game, it
was oar chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who
no fooner perceived us, but one of them blew a horn,
at the found of which there foon appeared a rroop of
forty or fifty more, at about a mile's diftance. flfro
upon, one of the Scots merchants (who knew their
ways) ordered us to advance towards them, and attack
them immediately. As we advanced, they let fly a
volley of arrows, which happily fell a little fliort of us:'
this made us halt a little, to return the compliment
with bullets; and then being led up by the bold Scot,
we fired our piftols in their faces, and drew out Cur
fvvords; but there was no occafion; for they flevylike
timorous fheep, and only three of them remained,
beckoningto the reft tocomebaek. But our braveccm-
rnander gallops up to them by himfelf, fhot one dead,
knocks another offhis horfe, while the third ran away:
and thus ended our battle with the Tartars.
We travelled a month more through the Emperor
of China's dominions; and at length coming to one of
their towns about a day and a half's journey from the
city of Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. 1 he perfon I
fpoke to would have brought me one, but, like a fool,
1 muft go along with him, about two miles from the
r B b a -village.
village. My okl pilot and I walked on foot, forfopth,
for fome'variety, when coming to the' place where the
camels were kept as in a park guarded by Chinefe fol-
iliers, we there agreed and bought one, which the
Chinefe man that came with me led along the road.
But we had not gone far, before we were attacked by
Jive Tartars, mounted on horfeback, two of whom
feized the man, took the camel from him, and rode
away, while the other three approached us, the firft
of whom fuddenly feized me as I was drawing my
fwonl, the fccond knocked me down; but my old
trufty Portuguefe, taking a piftol out of his pocket,
which I knew nothing of, and coming up to the fel-
low that ftruck me, he with one hand pulled him off
his horfe, and then mot him dead upon the fpot; then
taking his fcymitar, he ftruck at the man that ftopt us,
but milling him, cut off one of his horfe's ears, the
pain of which rrudc him throw his rider to the ground.
The poor Chinefe, who had led the camel, feeing the
Tartar down, runs to him, and feizing upon his pole-
axe, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked his
brains oat. But there was anotherTartar to deal with,
who keming neiiher inclined to fight nor fly, and
my okl man having begun to charge his piftol, the
verytfight of it ftruck fuch a terror into the wretc'i,
that away he fcoured, leaving my old pilot, rather my
champion and defender, an abftlute vitlory.
By this time being awakened from rny trance, I be-
gan to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having
quite forgot all that pafled; but my fenfes returning,
and feeling a great pain in my head, and feeing the
blood was running over my clothes, 1 inftantly jump-
ed upon my feet, and grafped my fword in my hand,
with a refolution to take revenge; but no enemies now
remained, except the dead Tartar, with his horfe
Handing by him. The old man feeing me recovered,
whom he thought flain, ran towards me, and embra-
ced me with the greateft tendernefs, at the fame time
examining into my wound, which was far from being
mortal j wkeu we returned to the village, the man de-
manded.
manded payment for bis camel, which I refuting, we
brought the caufe before a Chinefe judge, who acted
with great impartiality: Having heard both fides, he
afked the Chinefe man that went with me, whofe fer-
vant he was? Sir, faid he, I am nobody's, but went
with the ftranger at his requeft: why then, faid the
judge, you were the ftranger's fervant for the time, and
the camel being delivered to his fervant, it is the fame
as though delivered to himfelf, and accordingly he
muf t pay for it. Indeed, the cafe was fo fairly ftated,
that I had nothing to object to it; fo, haying paid for
that I was robbed of, I fent for another, but did net
go myfelf to fetch it, as I had enough of that fport be-
fore.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinefe em-
pire, fo fortified, as fome will tell you, that millions
of Tartars cannot batter down their wall.;; by which
certainly one might think one of our cannons would
do more execution than all their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that city,
we had information that the governor had fent meC-
fengers to every part of the road, to inform the tra-
vellers and caravans to halt, till a guard was fent to
protect thtm from the numerous bodies of Tartars that
lately appeared about the city. This news put us in-
to great conflernation; but, obeying the orders, we
ftopt; and, two days after, there tame two hundred
foldiers from a garriibn of the Chinefe, and three him.-
.dred more from Naum: thus guarded both in trre.
front and rear, with our own men on the flanks, we
boldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat
with ten thoufand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared. .*
Early next morning, in our march from a little
well fituated town called Changu, after having paffed
a river, and entered upon a defert of about 15 cr 16
miles over, we foon beheld, by a cloud of duft that
was railed, that the enemy was approaching. -This .
much difpirited the Chinefe. My old pilot took no-
tice of it, and called out, Seignior Ingiefe, thofe fcL-
lows muft be encouraged, cr they will ruin us all:
B b 3 '- aiul

and I am afraid, if the Tartars attack us, they will all
'"unaway. Why, Seignior, faid I, what fhall be done
in this cafe? Don?, fays he, why, let fifty of our men
advance, and flank them on each wing. I know the
fellows will fight well enough in company. We ac-
cordingly took his advice, and marched, fifty to the
right wing, and the fame number to the left, anct
•with the reft made a line of referve, leaving the lafb
two hundred- men to guard the camels, or to affift us
as occafion required.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward,.
viewing our pofhire, and traverfing the ground on the
front of our line. Hereupon-, we ordered the two-
wings to mo-ve on, ami give them a falute with their
fhot; which accordingly was done. This put a flop
to their proceedings; for immediately wheeling off to
their left, they all marched away, and we faw no
more of them. They had undoubtedly given- an ac-
count to their companions of what reception they
might expect, which made them fo eafity give over
their enterprise.
When we came to the city of Nauru,, we returned^
the governor hearty thanks, and difperfed a hundred
crowns among the foldiers that guarded us. We reli-
ed there one day, and then proceeded on our travels,
»J>aff;ng feveral great rivers and deferts; and on the
j3th of April,- we came to the frontiers of Mufeovy,,
the firft town of which was called Argun*
This happy oecafion,. as I thought, of coming in*- •
to a Chriftiaii country, made me congratulate the
SScots merchant upon it. He fmiled at that, telling;
me not to rejoice too foon; for, fafd he, except the
Ruffian foldiers in garrifon, and a few inhabitants of
the cities upon the road, all the reft of this country,
for above a thoafand miles, is inhabited by the molt
ignorant and barbarous Pagans.
We advanced from the river Arguna, by moderate
journeys, and found convenient garrifons on the roadr
filled with ChrilHan foldiers, for the feeurityof com-
merce, and for the convenient lodgings of travellers;
buc
but the inhabitants of the country were mere Pagans,
•worfhipping the fun, moon, and ftars. We particu-
larly obferved this idolatry near the river Arguna, at
a city inhabited by Tartars and Ruffians, called Neri-
finkey. Being curious to fee their way of Irving,
while the caravan continued to reft themfelves in that
city, I went to one of their villages, -where there was
to be one of their folemn facrifkes. There 1 beheld,
upon the flump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more
ugly than the reprefentation of the devil himfelf: its.
head refembled no living creature; its ears were as
big and as high as goats horns, a crooked nofe, four
cornered mouth, and horrible teeth: it was clothed
in fheeps fkins, had a great Tartar bonnet, with tw&
horns growing through it, and was eight feet high,
•without feet, legs, or proportion. Before this idol
there lay 16 or 17 people, who brought their offerings,
and were making their prayers, while at a diftanca
flood three men, and one bullock, as victims to this
ugly monfter.
Such ftupendous facrifege as this, in robbing the-
true God of bis honour, filled me with tha greateft
aftonifhment and reflection; which foon turning to
rage and fury, I rode up to the image, and cut in
pieces the bonnet that was upon his head with my
fword, fo that it hung down by one of the horns,
while one of my men that was with me, pulled- at it
by his fheep's flcin garment. Immediately an hideous-
howling and outcry ran through the village, and two
or three hundred people coming about our ears, we
were obliged to fly for it.
But I had not done with the monfter; for the ca-
ravan being to reft tbree nights in the town, I told
the Scots merchant what I had'feen, and that 1 was
refolved to take four or five men weU armed with me,
in order to deltroy the idol, and fhew the people how
little reafon they had to truft in a God who could not
fave himfelf, At fkft he laughed at me, reprefenting
the danger of it, and when it was deftroyed, what
time had we to preach to them better things, whofe
zeal
zeal and ignorance was in the higheft degree, and
both unparallelled ? that if I fhould be taken by them,
I fhould be ferved as a poor ruffian, who contemned
their worlhip; that if, to be ftripped naked, and tied
to the top of the idol, there fhot at with arrows till
my body was full of them, and then burnt as a facri-
fice to the monfter: but, Sir, faid he, fince your
zeal carries you fo fir, rather than you fhould be alone
I will accompany you, and bring a flout fellow equal
to yourfelf, if you will, to affift you in this defign:
and accordingly he brought one captain Richardfon,
who, hearing the ftory, readily confented; but my
partner declined it, V:ing altogether out of his way:
and fo we three, and my man-fervant, refolved to ex-
ecute this exploit about midnight; but, upon fecond
thoughts, we deferred it to the next night, by reafoa
that the caravan being to go from thence next morn-
ing, we fhould be out of the governor's power. The
better to effectuate my defign, I procured a Tartar's
fheep fkin robe, a bonnet, with bow and arrows, and
every one of us got the like habits. The firft night
we fpent in mixing combuftible matter with aqua vi-
tx, gun-pounder, £c. having a good quantity of tar in
a little pot: next night we came up to the idol about
eleven o'clock, the moon being up. We found none
guarding it; but we perceived a light in the houfe,
where \ve had fecn the priefts before. One of our men
was for firing the hut, another for killing the people,
and a third for making them prifoners, while the idol
was (kftroyed. We agreed to the latter; fo knock-
ing at the door, we feized the firft that opened it, and
flopping his mouth, and tying his feet, we left him.
•We ferved the other two in the like manner; and then
the Scots merchant fet fire to the competition, which
frightened them fo much, that we brought them all
away prifoners to their wooden god. There we felt
to work with him, daubing him all over \vith tar
mixed with tallow and brimilone, flopping his eyes,
'ears, and mouth full of gun powder, with a great
piece of wild-fire in his bonnet, and.environed it with
dry
dry forage. All this being done, we unloofed and
ungagged the prifoners, and fet the idol on fire, which
the gunpowder blowing up, the fhape of it was de-
formed, rent, and fplit, which the forage utterly con-
fumed; for we ilaid to fee its deftruction, left the ig-
norant idolatrous people fhould have thrown themfelves
into the flame. And thus we came away undifcovered,
in the morning appearing as bufy among our fellow-
travellers, as nobody, could have fufpected any other,
but that we had been in our beds all night.
Next morning we fet out, and had gone but a fmall
diflance from the city, when there came a multitude
of the people of the country to the gates- of the city,
demanding fatisfaction of the Ruffian governor for in-
fulting their priefts, and burning their great Cham Chi-
Thaungu, who dwelt in the fun, and no mortal would
violate his image, but fome Chriflian mifcreants; and
being atready no lefs than thirty thoufand ftrong, they
announced war againft him and all bis Chriftians.
The governor afiured them he was ignorant of the
matter, and that none of his garrifon had been abroad;
that indeed there was a caravan that went away that
morning, and that he would fend after them to en-
quire into it; and whoever were the offenders, fhould
be delivered into their hands. This fatisfied them for
the prefent, but the governor fent to inform us, that
if any of us had done it, we fhould make all the hafte
away poffihle, while he kept them in play as long as
he could. Upon this we marched two days and two
nights, flopping but very little, till at laft we arrived
at a village called Plothus, and hafted to Jarawena,
another of the Czar's colcvues. On the third day,
having entered the defert, and pafled the lake called
Shaks Ufer, we beheld a numerous body of horfe on
the other fide of it to the north, whofuppofed we had
pafled on that fide of the lake; but having either found
their miftake, or being certainly informed of the way
•we took, they came upon us towards the dufk of the
evening, juft as we had pitched our camp between
two little but very thick woods, with a little rivec
running
running before our front, and fome felled trees with
which we covered our rear; a precaution we always
took, and which we had juft finiflied, when the ene-
my came up. They did not fall on us immediately,
but lent three meflengers, demanding the men who
had infulted their priefts, and burnt their god Cham
Cbi'Tkaungu, that they might be burnt with fire, that
if this was complied with, they would peaceably de-
part; but if not, they would deftroy one and all of us.
Our men ftared at one another on receipt of this mef-
fage, but Nobody was the word, as indeed nobody
knew it, but he who did it. Upon which the leader
of the caravan returned for anfwer, That they were
peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of
their priefts and gods; and therefore defired them
not to diflurb us, and put us to the neceffity of defend-
ing ourfelves. But fo far was this from fatisfying them,
that the next morning, coming to our right, they l^t
fly a volley of arrows among us, which happily did
not hurt any, bccaufe we Oieltered ourfelves behind
our baggage. We expected however to come to a
clofer engagement; but were happily faved by a cun-
ning fellow, a Coflack, who obtaining leave of the
leader to go out, mounts his horfe, rides dire£Uy from
our rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tartars,
as though he had been fent exprefs, and tells them a
formal ftory, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham-
Chi-Thaungu, were gone to Siheilka, with a refolu-
tion to burn the god Sbal-Ifar, belonging to the Ton-
guefes. Upon which, believing this cunning Tartar
who was fervant to our Mufcovites, away they drove
to Shiheilka, and in lefs fl'an three minutes were out
of our fight, nor did we. ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we refted
fi'/e days, and then entered into a frightful defert,
which held us twenty three days march, infefled with
feveral fmall companies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars,
who never had the courage to attack us. After we
had pafted over this deferr, we found feveral garrifons
to defend the caravans from the violence of the Tar-
^ tars.
tars. In particular, the Governor of Adinfkoy offered
us a guard of fifty men to the next ftation, if we ap-
prehended any danger. The people here retained
the fame paganifm and barbarity, only they were not
fo dangerous, being conquered by the Mufcovites.
The clothing, both of men and women, is of the
fldns of beafts, living under the ground in vaults and
caves, which have a communication with one another.
They have idols almoft in every family; befides, they
adore the fun and ftars, water and fnow; and the leaft
uncommon thing that happens in the elements, alarms
them as much as thunder and lightning does the un-
believing Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through
this country. When we had got through the defert,
after two days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a
Mufcovite eity, on the great river fo called, which,
we were told, parted Europe from AOa. The inhabi-
tants here were very little better, though intermixed
with the Mufcovites; but the wonder will ceafe, when
I inform my reader of what was obferved to me, that
the Czar rather converts the Tartars with foldiers than
clergymen, and is more proud to make them faith-
ful fubjects, than good Chriftians.
From this city to the river Oby, we travelled over
a pleafant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for
want of good management and people, and thofe few
are moftly Pagans. This is the place where the Muf-
covite criminals are banifhed to, if they are not put
to death. The next city we came to, was the capi-
tal city of Siberia, called Tobolfki, when, having been
almoft feven months on our journey, and winter draw-
ing on apace, my partner and 1 ccnfulted about our
particular affairs, in what manner we fhould difpofe
of ourfelves. We had been told of fledges and rein
deer to carry us over the fnow in the winter feafon, the
fnow being frozen fo hard, that the fledges can run
upon the furface without any danger of going down.
.As I was bound to England, I no\v behoved either to
go with the caravan to Jeroflaw, from thence weft
to
to Narva, and the gulf of Finland, and fo by land or
fea to Denmark; or elfe I muft leave the caravan at a
little town on the Dwina, and fo to Archangel, where
I was certain of fhipping either to England, Holland,
or Hamburgh. One night I happened to get into the
company of an illuftrious but banifhed prince, whofe
company and virtues were fuch as made me propofe to
him a method how he might obtain his liberty. My
dear friend, faid he, as I am here happily free from
iny miferable grcatnefs, -with all its attendants of pride,
ambition, avarice, and luxury, if 1 Jhovld efcape from
this place, thofe pernicious feeds may again revive, to
iny lofting difquietude; therefore let me remain in a
lili'JJ'ed confinement, for 1 am but flf/b, a mete man,
•with paffions and affections as fuch; 0 be not my friend
and tempter too! Struck dumb with furprife, I flood
lilcnt a while; nor was he in lefs diforder, by which,
perceiving he wanted to give Vent to his mind, I de-
fired him to confider of it, and fo withdrew. But,
about two hours after,he came to my apartment: Dear
friend, faid he, though I cannot confent to accompany
you, IJia/l have this fatisfaclion in parting, that
you leave me an honeft man Jlill; but as a tcjiimony
of my affection to you, be pleafed to accept this prefent
of fables.
In return for his compliment, I fent my fervant
next morning to his Lordfhip, with a fniall prefent of
tea, two pieces of China damafk, and four little wed-
ges of gold; but he only accepted the tea, one piece
ofdamafk, and n piece, of gold, for the euriofity of
the Japan ftamp that was upon it. Not long after,
he fent for me, and told me, That what he had re-
fufed himfelf, he hoped, upon his account, 1 would
grant to another, whom he fliould name: In fhorr,
it was his only fun, who was about 200 miles diftance
from him, on the other fide of the Oby, whom he
laid he would fend for, if I gave my confent. This I
loon complied with; upon which he fent his fervants
next day for his Ion, who returned in twenty days
time, bringing feveu horfcs loaded with valuable furs.
At
At nighr, the young lord was conducted incognito into
our apartment, where his father prefented him to me.
. "We then concerted the beft ways for travelling, and
after having bought a confiderable quantity of fables,
black fox-fkins, fine ermines, &c. (which I fold ac
Archangel at a good price), we fet out from this city
the beginning of June, making a fmall caravan, being
about thirty two horfes and camels, of which I repre-
fented the head. My young lord had with him a ve-
ry faithful Siberian fervant, well acquainted with the
roads: we fhunned the principal towns and cities, as
Tirmen, Soli-Kamofkoi, and feveral others, by rea-
fon of their ftrictncfs in examining travellers, kit any
of the banifhed perfons of diftimStion fhould efcape,
Having patted the river Kama, we came to a city oii
the European fide, called Soloy Kamofkoi, where we
found the people moftly Pagans, as before. We then
pafied a defart of about two hundred miles over ; but
in other places, it is near feven hundred. In paffing
this wild place, we were befet by a troop of men on
horfeback, and about five and forty men armed with
bows and arrows. At firft they looked earneftly on
us, and then placed therr.felves in our way. We were
above fixteen men, and drew up a little line before
our camels. My young lord fent out his Siberian fer-.
vant, to know who they were; but, when he approach-
ed them, he neither knew a word they faid, nor would
they admit him to come near them at his peril, but
prepared to fhoot him. At his return, he told us he
believed them to be Calmuck Tartars; and that he
thought there were more of them upon the defart.
This was but a fmall comfort to us ; yet feeing a little
grove, about a quarter of a mile's diftance, we moved
to it, by the old Portuguefe pilot's advice, without
meeting with any oppofition. Here we found a mar-
fhy piece of ground, and a fpring of water running
into a little brook on one fide, which joined another
like it a little farther off, and thcfe two formed the
head of the river called Writfka. As foon as we ar-
C c rived,
rived, we went to work, cutting down great arms ofF
the trees, and laying them hanging (not quite off)
from one tree to another. In this fituation we waited
the motions of the enemy, without perceiving any ad-
.vancement they made towards us. About two hours
before night, being joined by fome others, in all a-
bout fourfcore horfe, among whom we fancied were
fome women, they came upon us with great fury. We
fired without ball, calling to them, in the Ruffian
tongue, to know their bufinefs: but they, either not
knowing, or feeming not to underfland us, came di-
rectly to the wood-fide, not confidering that we were
fo fortified, as that they could not break in. Our old
pilot, the Portuguefe, proved both our captain and en-
gineer, and defired us not to fire, till they came with-
in piftol fhot; and when he gave the word of command
then to take the fureft aim: but he did not bid us
give fire, till they were within two pikes length of us,
and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded feve-
ral, as alfo their horfes, having every one of us load-
ed our pieces with two or three bullets at leaft. So
much were they furprifed at our undauntednefs, that
they retired about an hundred roods from us. In the
mean while, we loaded our pieces again, and fallying
out, fecured four or five of their horfes, whofe riders
we found were killed, and perceived them to be Tar-
tars. About an hour after, they made another at-
tempt, to fee where they might break in; but finding
us ready to receive them, they retired.
All that night we wrought hard, in ftrengthening
our fituation, and barricading the entrances into the
woods; but, when day-light came, we had a very un-
welcome difcovery ; for, the enemy, being encouraged
by their affiftance, had fet up eleven or twelve tents
in form of a camp, about three quarters of a mile from
us. I muft confefs, I was never more concerned in
my life, giving myfelf and all that I had over for loft.
And my partner declared, that as the lofs of his goods
Avould be his ruin, before they fhould be taken from
Jam, he wculd fight to the laft drop of his blood.
As
AS we could not pretentHo force our way, we had
recourfe to a ftratagem; we kindled a large fire,
which burnt all night; and no fooner was it dark, but
we purfued our journey towards the pole, or north
ftar, and travelling all night, by fix o'clock in the
morning we came to a Ruffian village, called Kertza,
andfrom thence came to a large town named Ozonoys,
where we heard that feveral troops of Calmuck Tar-
tars had been abroad upon the defart, but that we were
paft all danger. In five days after we came to Veu-
ilima, upon the river Witzedga; from thence we came
to Lawrenfkoy, on the third of July, where, provid-
ing ourfelves with two luggage boats, and a conve-
nient bark, we embarked the feTenth, and arrived at
Archangel the eighteenth, after a year, five months,
and three days journey, including the eight months
and odd days at Tobolfki. We came from Archan-
gel the twentieth of Auguft in the fame year, and ar-
rived at Hamburgh the thirtieth of September. Here
my partner and I made a very good fale of our goods,
both thofe of China and Siberia; when dividing our
effects, my fhare came to 3475 /. 17 J. 3 d, after all
the loffes we had fuftained, and charges we had been
at. Here the young lord took his leave of me, in
order to go to the court of Vienna,, not only to feek
protection, but to correfpond with his father's friends.
After we had ftaid four months in Hamburgh, I went
from thence over land to the Hague, where embark-
ing in the packet, I arrived in London the tenth of Ja-
nuary r7O5, after ten years and nine months abfence
from England.

Chap. I. Of SOLITUDE.
HOwever folitude is looked upon as a reftraint to
the pleafures of the world, in company and
converfation, yet it is a happy ftateof exemption from a
. C c 2 fea
fea of trouble, an inundation of vanity and vexatior),
i>( confufionanddifappoiritment. While we enjoy our-
felvcs, neither the joy nor forrow of other men affect
i;S: we are then at liberty, wifh the voice of our foul,
to fpeak to God. By this we fhim fuch frequent tri-
vial difcourfe, as even becomes an obftruftion to vir-
tue: and how often do we find, that we had reafoii
to with we had not been in company, or faid nothing
•when we were there? for cither we offend God by
the impiety of our difcourfe, or lay ourfelves open to
the violence of defigning people by our unguarded ex-
preffions; and frequently feel the coldnefs and treach-
ery of pretended friends, when once involved in
trouble and affliction; of fuch unfaithful intimates (I
fhould fay enemies) who rather by f.ilfe'inuendces
would accumulate iniferies upon us, than honeflly af-
fift us when fuffcring under the hard hand of adver-
fity. But in a ftate of folitude, when our tongues can-
jsot be heard, except by the great Majefty of Heaven,
Low happy are we, in.the bleflcd enjoyment of con-
verfing uith our Maker! It is then we make him our
friend, which fets us above the envy and contempt of
•wicked men. When a man converfes with himfelf,
he is fure that he does net convcrfe with an enemy.
Our retreat fhould be to good company, and good
books. I mean not by folitude, that a man fhould
retire into a cell, a defart, or a monaftery: which
•would be altogether an ufclefs and unprofitable re-
itrpint: for as men are formed fo, fociety, and have
an abfolute neceffity and dependence upon one ano-
ther; fo there is a retirement of the foul, with which
it converfes in heaven, even in the midft of men;
;md indeed no man is more fit to fpeak freely, than
lie who can, without any violence to himfelf, refrain
his tongue, or keep filence altogether. As to reli-
gion, it is by this the foul gets acquainted with the
hidden myfteries of the holy writings; here flie finds
thofe flood of tears, in which good men wafli them-
felves day and night, and only makes a vifit to God,
a.nd his holy angels. In this converfation the trueft
peace
peace and moft folid joy are to be found; it is a con-
tinual feafl of contentment on earth, and the means
of attaining everlafting happinefs in heaven.
Chap. II. Of H 0- N E S T Y, ,
HONEsTY is a virtue beloved by good men, arm
pretended to by all perfons. In this there are feveral
degrees: to pay every man his own, is the common
law of honefty; but to do good to all mankind, is
the chancery law of honefty: and this chancery-court
is in every man's breaft, where his confcience is a lord
chancellor. Hence it is, that a mifer, though he pays
every body their own, cannot be an honeft man, when
he does not difcharge the good offices that are in-
cumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous perfon:
for, faith the prophet Ifaiah, chap, xxxii. ver. 7. 8.
The inftruments of a churl are evil: he devifeth wick-
ed devices to deftroy the poor -with lying words, even
•when the needy Jpeaketh right. But the liberal foul
devifeth 'liberal things, and by liberal things jhall he
Jland. It is certainly honefty to do every thing the
law requires; but fhould we throw every poor debt-
or in prifon till he has paid the utmoft farthing, hang
every malefactor without mercy, exact the penalty of
every bond, and the forfeiture of every indenture,
this would be downright cruelty, and not honefty:
and, it is contrary to that general rule, To do to ano-
ther, that -which you -would have done unto you. Some-
times neceftity makes an honeft man a knave; and a
rich man an honeft man, becaufe he has no occafion
to be a knave. The trial of honefty is this: Did
-.you ever want.bread, and had your neighbour's loaf
in keeping, and would ftarve rather than eat it?
Were you ever arrefted, having in your cuftody ano-
ther man's cafh, and would father go to goal, than
break it? if fo, this indeed may'be reckoned honefty.

Chap. .III. Of faring AFF L 1CT10 NS.
AFFLICTIONS nre common to all mankind; and,,
whether they proceed from lofles, difappointments, or
the malice of men, they often bring their advantages
along with them : for this fh-ews man the vanity and
ileceitfu'nefs of ibis life, and is an occafion cf recti-
fying our meafunes, and bringing us to a more mo-
cleft opinion of ourfelves : it tells us, how neceffary
the am fiance of divine grace is unto-us, when life itfelf
becomes a burden, and death even defireablc; but,
•when the greateft oppreffion comes upon us, ws muft
have recourfe to patience, begging of God to give us
that vir:ye; and, the more compoied, we are under a/-
iiy trouble, the more com,rnendabl2 is our wifdom,
and the larger will b.e our recompenfe. Let the pro-
vocation be -what it wjlJ, whether from a good natu-
led and conscientious, or awickc'd, pervecfe, and vex-
atious man; all this wefhould take as from the over-
ruling hand,of God, as a puni/kment for our fins..
Many times injured innocence may be abufed by falfe
Ciths, or the power of wicked, jshjous, or malicious
men ;. but \ve often find it,'lik,e the'palm, ri'fe the
'higher, th.e more it is deprefjed; while the juftice o£
God is eminently, remarkable in punifhing thofe, one.
way or other, whpdefire to endeavour, to procure the
downfal of an innocent man: nor does God fail com-
foiting an affli£ted perfoa, v'ho,,witb tears and prayers,,
iblicits the throne cf Heaven for deliverance and pro-
tection. 7?ni'WfavS, That his.fe;ul-was full cf trouble,

ly David's aflli£tions made him eminently remarkable,
;ib particularly when purfued by King Saul, and hunt--
cd as a partridge over the mountains. But one thing
uhich fl-inds by innocence, is the love of God ;. for,
\S-cre we tQ fuffer difgrace, nay, Rnjgnominious de
itfelf, what conrolf tion does our innocence procure at
our lateft con8i£l, our lafl moments!
Chap. IV. Of the immorality of ranverfation, and. the
vulgar errors of behaviour.
As converfation is a great part of human happinef%
fo it is a plegfa-nt fight to behold a fweet tempered
man, who ts always fit for it, to fee an air of humour
and pleafantnefs fit eyer upon his brow, and even
fomething angelic in his very countenance: whereas,
if we obferve a defigning man, we fhall find a mark
offinvoluntary fadnefs break in upon his joy, and a cer*
tain infurrciftion in the fouf, the natural concomitant
of profligate principles. '; ,
They err very much, who think religion, or a
ftricT;-morality, difcompofes the mind, and renders it
unfit for converfation; for, it rather infpires us to
innocent mirth, without fuch a counterfeit joy as vi-
cious men appear with; and indeed wit is as confif-
t-
ent with religion, as religion is with good manners;
nor is there any thing in the limitation of virtue and
religion that ihould abate the pleafures of this world,
buti on the contrary, rather ferves to increafe them.
On the other hand, many men, b-y their own vice
and intemperance, difqualify themfelves for converfa-
tion. 'Converfation is immoral, where the difcourfg
is indecent, immodeft, fcandalous, flanderous, and a-
bufive: How great is their folly, and how much do
they expofe themfelves, when they affront their bed
friend, even God himfel-f, who laughs at the fool when
bis fear comet h.
The great fcandal-atbeiftical and immoral difcourfe
gives to virtue, ought, methinks, to be punifhed by all
good magiftrates: make a man once ceafe to believe
a God, and he has nothing left to limit his foul.
How incongruous is it to good government, that a
man fhall he punifhed for drunkennefs, and yet have
liberty to affro:it, and even deny the Majefty of Hea-
V-en? when ifT even among men, one gives the lie to
a gentleman in company, or perhaps fpeaks an affronts
ing word, a quarrel will enfue, and a combat, and
perhaps murder be the confequence: at the leaft he
will profecute him at law with the utmoft virulence
and oppreffion..
The next thing to be refrained, is obfcene difcourfe,
•which is the language only of proficients in debauch-
ery, who never repent but in a goal or hofpital; and
whofe carcafes relifh no better than their difcourfe,
till the body becomes too nafty. for the foul to flay a-
ny longer in it.
Nor is falfe talking to be lefs avoided; for lying is
the fheep's clothing hung upon the wolf's back. It- is-
the pharifee's prayer, the whore's bufs, the hypocrite's
paint, the murderer's fmile, the thief's cloke, it is
Joab's embrace, and Judas's kifs; in a word, it is
mankind's darling fin, and the devil's diftinguifhing
character. Some add lies to lies, till it not only comes
to be improbable, but even impoifible too: others lie
for gain, to deceive, delude, and betray: and a third
lies for fport, or for fun. There are other liars, who
are perfonal and malicious; who foment differences^,
and carry tales from one houfe to another, in order to
gratify their own envious tempers, without any regard .
or reverence to truth.
Chap. V. Of the prefentjlate of religion in the -world. -
I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than
religion in the world, more adoration than fupplica-
tion, and more hypocrify than fincerity: and it is ve-
ry melancholy to confider, what numbers of people
there are furnifhed with the powers of reafon and gifts
of nature, and yet abandoned to the groffeft ignorance
and depravity. But it would be uncharitable for us
to imagine (as fome Papifts, abounding with too much
ill nature, the only fcandal to-religion, do) that they
will certainly be in the ftate of damnation after this
life; for how can we think it confiftent with the mer-
ty and goodnefs of an infinite Being, to damn thofe
creatures^
Creatures, when he has not furnifhed them with the
light of his gofpel? or how can fach proud, conceit-
ed, and cruel bigots, prefcribe rules to the jullice and
mercy of God?
We are told by fome people, that the great image
•which King Nebuchadnezzer fet up to be adored by
his people, held the reprefentation of the fun in its
right hand, as the principal object of adoration. But
to wave this difcourfe of Heathens, how many felf-
contradicting principles are there held among Chri«
* llians? and how do we doom one another to the de-
vil, while nil profefs to worfhip the fame Deity, and
to expect the fame falvation?
When 1 was at Portugal, there was held at that
time the court of jaftice of the inquifition. All the
criminals were carried in proceffion to thegreat church,
where eight of them were habited in gowns and caps
of canvafs, whereon the torments of hell were difplay-
ed, and they were condemned and burnt for crimes
againft the catholic faith and blefied Virgin.
I am forry to make any reflection upon ChriftianS .
but, indeed, in Italy the Roman religion feems the
moft cruel and mercenary upon earth; and a very
judicious perfon, who travelled through Italy from
Turkey, tells us, "That there is only the face and
«' outward pomp of religion there; that the church
"protects murderers and affaffins, and then delivers
"the civil magiftrates over to Satan for doing ju-
"ftice; interdicts whole kingdoms, and fliuts up the
"churches for want of paying a few ecclefiaftical
"dues, and fo puts a flop to religion for want of their
"money; that the court of Inquitition burnt two
(< men for fpeaking difhonourably of the blefled Vir-
"gin : and the mifllonaries of China tolerated the
"worfhipping the devil by their new converts: that
"Italy was the theatre, where religion was the grand
"opera; and that the Popifh clergy were no other
'' than the ftage-players."
As tG> religion in Poland, they deny Chrift to be the,
Meffiah, or that the Meffiah has come in the flejh.
And
And as to their Proteftants, they are the followers of
Ladius Socinus, who denied our Saviour's divinity;
and have no concern about the divine infpiration of
the Holy Ghoft.
In Mufcovy their churches are built of wood, and,
indeed, they have but wooden priefts, though of the
Greek church: they pray as much to St Nicholas, as-
Papifts do to the Virgin Mary, for protection in all
their difficulties or afflictions.
As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans
in believing confubftantiation, inftead of tranfubftan-
tiation 5 but, like them, they are much pleafed with
the external gallantry and pomp, more than the true
and real practice of it.
In France I found a world of priefts, the ftreets
every where erouded with them, and the churches full
of women; but furely never was a nation fo full of
blind guides, fo ignorant of religion, and even as
void ofmorals, as thofe people who confefs their fins
to them.
Does it not feem ftrange, that, while all men own
the Divine Being, there fhould be fo many different
opinions as to the manner of paying him obedience in
the Chriftian church? I know not what reafon to
affign for this, except it be their different capacities
and faculties.
And, indeed, upon this account, we have percei-
ved, in all Chriftian countries, what mortal feuds have
been about religion: what wars and bloodfhed have
molefted Europe, till the general pacification of the
German troubles at the treaty of Weftphalia; and,
fince thofe times, what perfecution in the fame coun-
try among the churches of the Lutherans: and fhould
I take a profpect at home, what unhappy divifions are
between Chriftians in this kingdom, about Epifcopa-
cy and Prefbytery, the church of England men and
the Diflenters; oppofmg one another like St Paul and
fit Peter, even to the face; that is, they carry on the
difpute to the utmoft extremity.
It might be a queftion, why there are fuch differen-
ces
ces in religious points, and why thefe breaches fhould
be more hot and irreconcileable ? All the anfwer I can
give to this, is, that we enquire more concerning the
truth of religion, than any other nation in the world;
and the anxious concern we have about it, makes us
jealous of every opinion, and tenacious of our own:
and this is not becaufe we are more furious and rafh
than other people ; but the truth is, we are more con
cerned about them, and being fenfible that the fcrip-
ture is the great rule of faith, the ftandard for life and
doctrine, we have recourfe to it ourfelves, without fub-
mitting to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.
There is another queftion, pertinent to the former,
and that is, What remedy can we apply to this mala
dy? And to this I muft negatively anfwer, Not to be
lefs religious, that we may differ the lefs. This is
ftriking at the very root of all religious differences;
for, certainly, were they to be carried on with a peace-
able fpirit, willing to be informed, our variety of opi-
nions would not have the name of differences; nor
fhould we feparate in communion of charity, though
we did not agree in feveral articles of religion.
Nor is there a lefs ufeful queftion to ftart, namely,
Where will our unhappy religious differences end?
To which, I hope, 1 may anfwer, In Heaven; there
all unchriftian and unbrotherly differences will find a
period; there we fhall embrace many a finner, that
here we think it a dHhonour to converfe with ; and
perceive many a heart we have broken here with cen-
fures, reproachings, and revilings, made whole again
by the balm of the fame Redeemer's blood. Here we
fhall perceive there have been other flocks than thofe of
cur fold; that thofe we have excommunicated, have
been taken into that fuperior communion: and, in a
word, that thofe contradicting notions and principles
which we thought inconfiftent with true religion, we
fhall then find reconcileable to themfelves, to one ano-
ther, and to the fountain of truth. If any man afk
me, Why our differences cannot be ended on earth? I
anfwer, Were we all thoroughly convinced, that then
they
they would be reconciled, we" would put an end to
them before; but this is impoffible to be done: for, ai
mens certain convictions of truth are not equal to one
another, or to the weight or fignificancy of fuc'i vera-
city; fo neither can a general effect of this affair be
expected on this fide of time, on this fide of the grave.
Before I conclude this chapter, I fhall beg leave to
difcourfe a little of the wonderful excellency of nega-
tive religion and negative virtue. The latter feis our,
like the pharilee, with, God, I thank thee; it is a piece
of religious pageantry, the hypocrite's hope: and, in
a word, it is pofitive vice: for it is either a maik to
deceive others, or a mi ft to deceive ourfclves. A
man tbat is clothed with negatives, thus argues: I
am not fuch a drunkard as my landlord, fuch a thief
as my tenant, fuch a fwearer as his neighbour: nei-
ther am I a cheat, an atheift, a rakifh fellow, or a high-
wayman: no! I live a fober, regular, retired life: I
am a good man, I go to church; God, I thank thee.
Now, though a man boafts of his virtue in contradic-
tion to the vices mentioned, yet a perfon had better
have them altogether, than the man himfelf; for he
is fo full of himfelf, fo perfuaded that he is good and
religious enough atready, that he has no thoughts of
any thing, except it be to pull off his hat to God Al-
mighty now and then, and thank him, that he has no
occafion for him ; and has the vanity to think that his
neighbours muft imagine well of him too.
The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet
intoxicated with the pride of his own worth: a good
neighbour and peace-maker in other families, but a
tyrant in his own: appears in church for a fhow, but
never falls upon his knees in his clofet; docs all.his
alms before men, to be feen of them -, eager in the du-
ties of the fecond table, but regardlefs ot the firft; ap-
pears religious, to be taken notice of by men, but
without intercourfe or communication between God
and his own foul: Pray, what is the man? or what
comfort is there of the life he lives? he is infenfible
of
of faith, repentance, and a Chriftian mortified life;
in a wurd, he is perfectly a ftranger to the effential
part of religion.
Let us for a while enter into the private and retired
part of his converfation: What notions has he of his
mif-fpent hours,and of the progrefs of time to the great
centre and gulf qf life, eternity? does he know how-
to put a right value on time, or efteern the life-blood
of his foul, as it really is, and acl in all the moments
of it, as one that muft account for them? If then you
can form an equality between what he can do, and
what he mail receive; Jefs can it be founded upon
his negative virtue, or what he has forborn to do, aml
if neither his negative nor pofitive piety can be equal
to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is to
laft for, what then is to become of the Pharifee, when
he is to Be judged by the fincerity of his repentance,
and rewarded, according to the infinite grace of God,
with a ftate of bleflednefs to an endlefs eternity?
"When the negative man converfes with the invifi-
ble world, he is filled with as much horror and dread
as Felix, when St Paul reafoned to him of temperance,
righteoufnefs, and of judgment to come: for Felix,
though a great philofopher, of great power and reve-
rence, was" a negative man, and he was made fenfible
by the apoftle, that, as a life of virtue and temperance
was its own reward, by giving a healthy body, a clear
head, and a compofed life; fo eternal happinefs muft
proceed from another fpring ; namely, the infinite un-
bounded grace of a provoked God, who having erect-
ed a righteous tribunal, Jefus Chrift would feparate
fuch as by faith and repentance he had brought home
and united to himfelf by the grace of adoption, and
on the foot of his having laid down his life as a ran-
fom for them, had appointed them to falvation, when
all the philofophy, temperance, and righteoufnefs in
the world befides had been ineffectual. And this, I fay,
it was, that made Felix, this negative man, tremble.
Chap. VI. Of lijlening t-j the voice of providence.
THE magnificent and wife king Solomon bids uscry
1> d after
after knowledge, and lift up our voice for un-^erftand-
ing; by which is meant, religious knowledge; for it
follows: Then/halt thou underftand the fear of the
Lord, and find, the knowledge of God. By which un-
doubtedly he meant, to enquire after every thing thgt
he has permitted us to know, and not to feafch into
thofe ways that are unfearchable, and are effectually
locked up from our knowledge. Now, as lijlening to
the voice of providence is my preft nt fubjecl:, I intend,
in the firft place, to write to thofe who own, i. That
there is a God, a firft great moving caufe of all things,
and eternal power, prior, and confequently fuperior
to all created power or being. 2. That this eternal
power, which is God, is the fovereign creator and go-
vernor of heaven and earth.
To avoid all needlefs diftindions, what perfons in
the Godhead exercife the creating, and what the go-
verning power, I offer that glorious text, Pfal. xxxifi.
6, where the whole Trinity is intitled to the whole
creating work: and therefore, in the next place, I
fhall lay down thefe two propofitions.
I. That the eternal God guides by his providence the
whole univerfe, which was created by his power.
II. That this providence manifejis a particular care
ever, and concern in, the governing and direfi-
ing man, the mo/l noble creature upon earth.
It is plain, that natural religion proves the firft, by
intimating the neceffity of a providence guiding and
governing the world, from the confequence of the
wifdom, juftice, prefcience, and goodnefs of the al-
mighty Creator: for otherwife it would be abfurd to
think, that God mould create a world, without any
care or providence over it, in guiding the operations
of nature, fo as to preferve the order of his creation.
Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and
concern of his providence, by the climate's being made
habitable, the creatures fubjected and made nourifh-
ing, and all vegetative life made medicinal; and all
this for the fake of man, whe is made viceroy to the
King of the earth. The fhort defcription I fhall give
of
of providence is this: That it is that operation of the
Kwer, of the wifdoni, juftice, and goodnefs of God,
which he influences, governs", and directs, not on-
ly the means, but the events of all things, which con-
cern us in. this fublunary world; the Ibvereignty of
which we ought always to reverence, obey its mo-
tions, obferve its dictates, and Jiften to its voice. The
prudent man forfeeth the evil, and hideth himfclf;
that is, as 1 take it, there is a fecret providence inti-
mates to us, that fome danger threatens, if we ftrive
not to fliun it.
The fame day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull
againft the royal martyr King Charles I. the fame day
Sir John Hotham was put to death by the parliament
for that very action; the fame day that the King him-
felf Cgned the warrant for the execution of the Earl
of Stafford, the fame day of the month was he bar-
baroufly murdered by the blood-thirftyOliveriari crew;
arkd the fame day that King James II. came to the
cr own againft the bill of exclufion, the fame day he
•was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the throne
filled with King William and Queen Mary.
The voice of fignal deliverances from fudden dan-
gers, is not only a juft call to repentance, but a cau-
tion againft falling into the like danger; but fuch who
are utterly carelels of themfelves after, fhew a lethar-
gy of the worft nature, which feems to me to be a kind
or practical atheifm, or at leaft a living in a contempt
of Heaven, when he receives good at the hand of his
Maker, but is unconcerned from whence it comes,
or to thank the bountiful hand that gave it; neither,
when he receives evil, does it alter his manner of life,
or bring him to any ftate of humiliation.
We have a remarkable ftory of two foldiers being
condemned to death in Flanders. The general being
prevailed upon to fpare one of them, ordered them to
caft dice upon the drum-head for their lives; the firft
having thrown two fixes, the fecond fell a wringing
his hands, having fo poor a chance to .efcape: how-
ever, having thrown, he was furprifed when he alfo
D d 2 threw
threw other two fixes. The officer, appointed to fee
the execution, ordered them to throw again; they
did fo, ind each of them threw fives; at which the
foldiers that flood round, fhouted, and faid neither of
them was to die. Upon this, the officer acquainted
the council of war, who ordered them to throw a
third time, when they threw two fours; the general
being acquainted with it, fent for the men, and par-
doned them: I love, faid he, in fuch extraordinary
cafes, to liften to the voice of providence.
We read in the holy writings, how God fpeaks to
men, by appearance of angels, or by dreams and vi-
iions of the night. As God appeared to Abraham,
Lot, and Jacob; fo angels have appeared to many in
other cafes, as 10 Manoah and his wife, Zechariah, the
Virgin Mary, and to the apoflles; others have been
warned in a dream, as king Abimelech, the falfe pro-
phet Br.laam, and many others.
It is certainly a very great and noble enquiry, What
,'C fhall be after this life? for there is fcarce a doubt,
we
that there is a place referved for the reception of our
fouls after death: for if we are to be, we mull have
a where, which the fcriptures afll-rt by the examples
of Dives and Lazarus. The dodtrine of fpirits was
long believed before our Saviour's time ; for when the
difciples of the lleffed Jefus perceived our Saviour
walking on the L-a, they were much furprifed as tho'
they had feen a fpirit. Nay, in thofe ages of the world,
it was believed that fpirits intermeddled in the affairs
of mankind; and, throughout the Old Teftament, I do
not mul any thing that .in the leaft contradids it. All
the pains and labour that fome learned men have taken,
to confute the llory of the witch of Endor, and the ap-
pearance of an old man perforating Samuel, cannot
make fuch apparitions inconfiflent with nature or reli-
gion : and it is plain, that it was either a good or bad
fpirit, that prophetically told the unfortunate king what
ihould happen the next day; for, faid the fpirit, The
Lord will deliver thee into the hands of the Philiftines;
and tn-nwrro-wjhalt thou and thy fans be -with me.
Abundance
Abundance of ftrange notions poflcfled me, when
I was in the defolate ifland ; efpecially on a moonfhine
night, when every bufli feemed a man, and every tree
a man on horfeback. When I crept into the difmal
cave, where the old goat lay expiring, whofe articu-
late groans even refembled thofe of a man, how was I
furprifed! my blood chilled in my veins, a cold fwea-
ty dew fat on my forehead, my hair ftood upright,
and my joints, like Balfhazzar's knees, ftruck againft
one another. And, indeed, though I afterwards found
what it was, the remains of this furprife did not wear
off for a great while; and I had frequently returns of
thofe vapours on different occafions, and fometimes
without any occafion at all.
One night, afte* having feen feme appearance in
the air, as I had jufl lain down in my bed, one of my
feet pained me; after that came a numbnefs, lucfteed-
ed with a tingling in my blood; when on a fudden I
thought fomething alive lay upon me, from my knee
to above half my leg. Upon this I flung myfelf out
of bed where I thought the creature lay: but finding
nothing, Lord deliver me from an evilfpirit, faid I,
•what can this be? When I lighted a candle, I could
perceive no living creature in the place with me, but
the poor parrot, who being frighted, cried our, Hold
your tongue, and, What's the matter-with you? which,
words I had taught him, by faying fo to him, when, he
made fuch fcreaming noifes as I did not like. Lord,
faid I aloud, furely the devil has been here. Hold jour
tongue, fays Poll. I was then rhad at the bird, and
putting on my clothes, cried, I am terribly frighted.
What's the matter with you? fays Poll. You toad,
faid I, I'll knock your brains out. Hold your tongue,
cried he again, and fo fell a chattering, and calling
Kobinfon Crufoe, as he did before. But, after I had
compofed myfelf, and went to bed again, I began
plainly tofee it was a diflemper that alre&edhiy nerves,
and fo my terrors vanifhed at once.
How intelligences are given or received, we do not
know j nor are we ienfiblc how they are conveyed
D d 3 from
from fpirits embodied, to ours that are in life; or
on the contrary, from us to them : the latter certain
ly is done without the help of the organs, and the
fonr.er is conveyed by the underftanding, and the re-
tired faculties of the foul-
The fpirits, without the help of voices, converfe,
and the more particular difcoveries of the converfe of
fpirits, feem to me as follow; to wit, dreams, voices,
noifes, irnpulfes, hints, apprehenfions, involuntary
fadnefs, &c.
Dreams of old were the ways by whkh God himfelf
was pleafed to warn men what fervices to perform,
and what to flam. Jofeph was dire£ted of God in a
dream to go to Egypt; and fo were the wife men warn-
ed in a dream to depart into their own country ano-
ther way, to avoid the fury of Herod. I am not like
thofe who think dreams are the mere dofings of a de-
lirious head, or the relics of a day's perplexities or
pleafures; but, on the contrary, I mull beg leave to
fay, I never met with any capital mifchief in my life,
but I had fome notice of it by a dream; and, had I
not teen a thoughtlefs unbelieving creature, I might
have taken many a warning, and avoided many of the
evils 1 afterwards fell into, merely by total neglect of
thofe dreams.
I was once prefent at a difpute between a layman
and a clergyman, upon the fubject of dreams. The
firft thought no regard fhould be given unto them:
that their communication from the invifible to the
vifible world was a mere chimera; without any folid
foundation. For, i. faid he, if dreams were from
the agency of any prefcient being, the motives would
be more direct, and the difcoveries more plain; and
not by allegories and emblematic fancies, expreffing
things imperfect and obfcure. 2. Since, with the
notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid
it, it is not likely to proceed from a fpirit, but mere-
ly fortuitous. 3, That the inconftancy of fuch no-
tices, in cafes equally important, proves they did not
proceed from any fuch agent. 4. That as cur moft
diftina
diftincl: dreams had nothing in them of any fignifi-
cancy, it would be irrational and vain to think that
they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were
not always thus warned or fupplied with notice of
good or evil, fo all men are not alike fupplied with
them; and what reafon could we give, why one man
or one woman fhould not have the fame hints as a-
nother?
To all this the clergyman gave anfwer; i. That, as
to the fignification of dreams, and the objections a-
gainfl. them as being dark and doubtful, they are ex-
prcfled generally by hieroglyphical reprefentations,
fimilies, allufions, and figurative emblematic ways, by
which means, for want of interpretation, the thing
was not underftood, and, confequently, the evil not
fhunned. I. That we charge God foolifhly, to fay,
that he has given the notice of evil, without the power
to avoid it; for, if any one had not power to avoid the
evil, it was no notice to him; and it was want of -L
giving due heed to that notice, that men firft neglecl-
ed themfelves, and then charged the Judge of all the
earth with injuflice. 3. That we ought not to find
fault with the inconftancy of thefe notices; but rather
with our weak underftandings, by pretending dreams
were not to be regarded, and negligent when the
voice really fpoke to us for our good. It is a miftake
to fay, dreams have no import at all: we might, with
more reafon, have faid, none that we could perceive
the reafon of, owing to our blindnefs and fupine ne-
gligence, too fecure at one time, and too much a-
larmed at another; fothat the fpirit, which we might
be faid to be converfing with in a dream, was con-
llantly and equally kind and careful j but our powers
are not always in the fame flate of aclion, not equal-
ly attentive to, or retentive of the hints that were
given. And, 5. to anfwer the laft quellion, Why
people are not equally fupplied? This fecmed to be no
queftion; for Providence itfelf might have fome fhare
in the direction of it, and then that providence might
be limited by a fupcrior direction: that as to the
converts
converfe of fpirits3 he could not call it a ftated converfe;
fuch a thing there was, but why there was fo much
of it, and no more, was none of his bufinefs, and that
no fuch difcovery had ever yet been made to mankind.
Nor were we to imagine lefs of waking dreams, tran-
ces, vifions, noifes, hints, impulfes, and all the wak-
ing teftimonies of an invifible world, and of the com-
munication that there is between us and them, which
commonly entertain us with our eyes open.
One time my fancy foared on high, to fee what dif-
coveries I could make in thofe clearer regions. I found
that fuch immenfe bodies as the fun, flars, planets,
and moon, in the great circle of the lower heaven, are
far from being found in the ftudy of nature on the
furface of the earth. Here I faw many things that
we can entertain little or no notion'of, in a ilate of
common life, and the emptinefs of our notion, that
the planets are habitable worlds; that is, created like
ours, for the fubfiftence and exiftence of man and heaft,
and the prefervation of the vegetative and fenfitive
life: No, no, this is, I affure you, a world of fpirits;
for here I faw a clear demonftration of Satan being
the prince of the power of the air, keeping his court
or camp, with innumerable angels to attend him;
but his power is not fo great as we imagine, he" can
tempt us to the crime, but cannot force us to commit
it: Humanum eft peccare. Neither has the devil
power to force the world into a rebellion againft hea-
ven, though his legions are employed.among favage
nations, to fet up their mafter for a god, who make
the heathens either worfhip him in perfon, or by his
reprefentatives, idols and monfters, with the cruel fa-
crifices of human blood. Now, as to the limitations"
of the devil's power, you muft underfhand, thaf, as
there are numbers of evil fpirits employed in mifchief,
fo there are numbers of good "angels fent from the
higher and bleffed abodes to difconcert and oppofe
their meafures; and this every Chriftian, I hope, be-
lieves, when he prays to God, the father of fpirits, to
give
give his angels charge over him while he flurnbereth
and fleepeth. For if by thefe preventing powers the
devil was not retrained, the earth would be fubjected
to dearth, droughts, and famine; the air infected with
noxious fumes; and, in a word, mankind would be
utterly deftroyed, which might oblige our maker (if
I may be allowed the expreffion) to the neceffity of
a newjiai, or elfe have no more creatures to honour
and worfhip him.
As the devil never wanted infinuators, I fhall ob-
ferve, that I learned a way how to make a man dream
of what I pleafcd. For inftance, let us fuppofe one
to be found afleep; let another lay his mouth clofe to
his ear, and whifper any thing fo loftly as not to a-
wake him, the fleeping man fhall dream of what has
been fo whifpered in his ear ; nay, I can allure you,
thofe infinuating devils can do this even when we
are awake, which I call impulfes of the mind: for
from whence, but from thefe infinuators, come our
caufelefs paffions, involuntary wickednefs, or fin ful
defires? Who elfe form ideas in the mind of man
when he is sfleep, or prefent terrible or beautiful fi-
gures to his fancy? Mr Milton reprefems the devil
tempting Eve in the fliape of a toad, lying juft at her
ear, when in her bower me lay faft afleep; and brings
in,Eve telling Adam what an uneafy night's reft flie
had, and relating her dream to him. And likewife
I believe that good fpirits have the fume intercourfe
with us, in warning us againft thofe things that are
evil, and prompting us to that which is good.
Were we to have the eyes of our fouls opened,
through the eyes of our bodies, we fhould fee this ve-
ry immediate region of air which we breath in, throng-
ed with fpirits now invifible, and which otherwife
•would be the moft terrible : we mould view the fecret
tranfactions of thofe meffengers who are employed
when the parting foul takes its leave of the reluctant
body, and perhaps fee things nature would fbrink
back from with the utmoft terror and amazement.
In a word, the curtain of providence for the difpofi-
tion
tions of things here, and the curtain of judgment for
the determination of the ftate of fouls hereafter, would
\)2 alike drawn back; and what heart could fupport
here its future ftate in life, much lefs that of its fu-
ture ftate after life, even good or bad.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about fe-
ven miles diftant from London, a friend that came to
dine with hira, folicited him to go to the city. What,
faid the gentleman, is there any occafion for me? No,
Sir, faid the other, nothing at all, except the enjoy-
ment of your good company ; and fo gave over impor-
tuning him. Juft then a ftrong impulfe of mind ur-
ged the gentleman, -and purfued him like a voice,
•with, Co to London, Co to London. Hark ye, fays
he to his friend, is all well at London? Am I want-
ed there? Or, did you aflc me to go with you on any
particular account? Are all my family well ? Yes, in-
deed, Sir, faid he, I perceived them all very hearty;
and I did not afk you to go to London upon any parti-
cular account whatfoever, except it was for the fake of
your good company. • Again he put off his refdlution:
but ftill the impulfe fuggefted to him, Co to London;
and at length he did fo. When he came there, he
found a letter and meflenger had been there to feek
him, and to tell him of a particular bufinefs, which
was firft and lafl above a thoufand pounds to him, and
which might inevitably been loft, had he not gone to
London that night.
The obeying of feveral hints, or fecret impulfes ar-
gues great wifdom. I knew a man that was under
misfortunes, being guilty of mifdemeanors againil the
government; when, abfconding for fear of his ruin,
all his friends advifing him not to put himfelf in the
hands of the law, one morning as he awaked, he felt
a ftrong impulfe darting into his mind thus, Write a,
letter to them: and this was repeated feveral times to
his mind, and at laft he anfvvered to it, as if it had
been a voice, JVhomJball I-write to? Immediately it
replied, Write to the judge; and this impulfe purfu-
ed him for feveral days, till at length he took pen,
and
and ink, an'd paper, and fat down to write to him;
•when immediately words flowed from his pen, like
ftreams from a fair fountain, that charmed even him-
felf with hopes of fuccefs. In fhort, the letter was
fo ftrenuous in argument, fo pathetic in its eloquence,
and fo perfuafively moving, that when the judge had
read it, he font him an anfwer he might be eafy, he
would endeavour to make that matter light to him;
and, indeed, never left exerting himfelf, till he had
ftopt the profecution, and reftored him to his liberty
and family.
I know a perfon who had fo ftrong an impreffion
upon her mind, that the houfe fhe was in would be
burnt that very night, that fhe could not fleep; the
impulfe fhe had upon her mind prefled her not to go
to bed, which, however, fhe got over, and went to
bed; but was fo terrified with the thought which
run in her mind, that the houfe would be burnt, that
fhe could not go to fleep; but communicating her
apprehenfions to another in the family, they were both
in fuch a fright, that they applied themfelves to fearch
from the top of the houfe to the bottom, and to fee
every fire and candle fafe out, fo that, as they all faid,
it was impoffible any thing could happen in the houfe,
and they fent to the neighbours on both fides to do
the like. Thus far they did well: but had (he obey-
ed the hint which prefled upon herftrangely not to go
to bed, fhe had done much better; for the fire was
actually kindled at that very time, though not bro-
ken cut. About an hour after the whole family was
in bed, the houfe juft over the way, directly oppofite,
was all in flames, and the wind, which was very high,
blowing the flame upon the houfe this gentlewoman
lived in, fo filled it with fmoak and fire, in a few mo-
ments, the ftreet being narrow, that they had not air
to breathe, or time to do any thing, but jump out of
their beds, and fave their lives. Had fhe obeyed the
hint given, and not gone to bed, fhe might have la-
ved feveral things; but the few moments fhe had fpa-
red to her, were but juft fufficient to leap out of bed,
put
put fome clothes on, and get down ftairs, for the houfe
was on fire in half a quarter of an hour.
While I am mentioning thefe things, methinks it
is very hard, that we fhould obey the whifpers of evil
fpirits, and not much rather receive the notices which
good ones are pleafed to give. We never perceive
the misfortune of this, but when in real danger: and
then we cry, My mind mi/gave me -when I -was going
about it: but if fo, why do you flight the caution?
Why not liften to it as to a voice? and then there
had been no reafon to make this complaint.
I remember about 14 or 15 years ago (as to time I
cannot be very pofitive) there was a young clergyman
in tha city of Dublin in Ireland, who dreamed a ve-
ry uncommon dream, That a gentleman had killed
his wife, a relation of his, by ftabbing her in feveral
places; the fright of this awaked him, but finding it
a dream, he compofed himfelf again to fleep, when he
dreamed a fecond time the fame dream. This made
him a little uneafy; but thinking it proceeded from
the impreffion made on his mind by the former, h&
went to fleep again, and dreamed the fame dream a
third time alfo. So troubled was he at this, that he
arofc, and knocked at his mother's chamber, told his
concern, and his apprehenfions that all were not right
at his relation's houfe. Dear fon, fays the good old
gentlewoman, do not mind thefe foolifh dreams: and
I very much wonder, that you, being a perfon in ho-
ly orders, fhould have regard to fuch illufions. Up-
on this he went to bed again, fell afleep, and dreamed
a fourth time as before. And then indeed he put on
his night-gown, and went to Smithfield, the place
where his relation dwelt. Here it was, alas ! he per-
ceived his dream too fadiy fulfilled, by feeing his re-
lation, the young lady, big with child, who was a
Proteftant, ftabbed in feven places, by her barbarous
huIband Mr Euftace, a violent Papift, only for fome
difcourfes of religion that happened the day before.
After the wretch had ftabbed her in three places, he
went to make his efcape out at a window; but fhc cried
out.
ont, My dear! don't leave me, come back, and I Jbatl
be -well again. At which he returned in a hellifh
rage, and gave her four wounds more; when, even in
this condition, rifing from her bed, fhe wrapped her-
felf in her night-gown, and went to the Lord Bifhop
of llapho's chamber-door (the bifhop lodging at that
time in the houfe), My Lord, faid fhe, 0, My Lord,
•make hafte unto me; but as foon as his Lordfhip came
ihe expired in his arms, refigning her precious foul
into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel
wretch her hufband was fhot by the purfuers, too good
a death for one who deferved the gibbet; and the la-
dy was univerfally lamented by all tender and religi-
ous people. And this tragical relation I have men-
tioned, upon the account of that impulfe, or dream,
that the clergyman had at the fatal time of the bloody
aCtion.
It might be expe&ed T AiouW enter upon the fub-
ject of apparitions, and difcourfe concerning the rea-
lity of them; and whether they can revifit the place
of their former exiftence, and refume thofe faculties
of fpeech and fhape as they had when living; but,
as thefe are very doubtful matters, I fhall only make
a few obfervations upon them.
I once heard of a man that would allow the reality
of apparitions, but laid it all upon the devil, thinking
that the fouls of men departed, or good men, did ne-
ver appear. To this very man fomething did appear:
he faid, he faw the fhape of an ancient man pafs by
him in the dufk, who, holding up his hand in a
threatening pofture, cried out, 0, -wicked man, re-
gent, repent! Terrified with this apparition, he con-
fulted feveral friends, who advifed him to take the ad-
f ice. But, after all, it was not an apparition, but a
grave and pious gentleman, who met him by mere
accident, and had been fenfible of his wickednefs;
and who never undeceived him, left it fhould hinder
his reformation. Were we always willing to make
good ufe of Satan's real appearances, I know not
but it would go a great way to banifh him from the
E e vifible
vifible world; for I am very pofitive, he would fel- I
dom vifit us, if he thought his coming would do us \
any good: but fo abfolutely is he at the command of
heaven, that he muft go, even to do the work he ab-
hors.
Some people make a very ill ufe of the general no-
tion, that there are no apparitions nor fpirits at all:
which is worfe than thofe who fancy they fee them up-
on every occafion: for thofe carry their notions far-
ther, even to annihilate the devil, and believe no-,
thing about him, neither of one kind or other: the
next ftep they come to, is to conclude, There is no
Cad, and fo atheifm takes its rife in the fame fink, with
a careleflhefs about futurity. But there is no occa-
fion to enter upon an argument to prove the being of
the Almighty, or to illuftrate his power by words,
who has fo many undeniable teftimonies in the breafts
of every rational being, to prove his eviftence: and
we have fufficient proofs, enough to convince us of
the great fuperintendency of divine providence in the
minuteft affairs of this world; the manifeft exiftence
of the invifible world; the reality of fpirits, and in-
telligence between us and them. What I have faid, I
hope, will not miflead any perfon.or be a means where-
by they may delude themfelves; for I have fpoketi
of thefe things with the utmoft ferioufnefs of mind,-
and with a fincere and ardent defire for the general
good and benefit of the world.

P R. E F A C E.
IF ever the flory of any private man's
adventures in the world were worth
making public, and were acceptable
when publiihed, the editor of this ac-
count thinks this will be fo.
The wonders of this man's life exceed
all that (he thinks) is to be found extant j.
the life of one man being fcarce capable
of a greater variety.
The ftory is told with modefty, with
ferioufnefs, and with a religious appli-
cation of events to the ufes to which
wife men always apply them, viz. to
the inftruction of others by this ex-
ample, and to juftify and honour the
wifdom of Providence in all the variety
of our circumftances, let them happen
how they will.
a' 2 The
The editor believes the thing to be a
juft hiftory of fact; neither is there any
appearance of fiction in it: and though
he is well aware there are many, who on
account of the very fingular prefervations
the author met with, will gtve it the
name of a romance; yet, in which-ever
of thefe lights it fhall be viewed, he i-
magines, that the improvement of it,
as well to the diveriion, as to the inftruc-
tion of the reader, will be the fame; and
as f'uch, he thinks, without farther com-
pliment to the worjd, he does them a
great fervice in the publication.
THE
THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
0 F
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I Was born at York, in the year 163?) of a repu-
table family. My father was a natire ci Bremen,
who, by merchandizing at Hull for fome time,
gained a very plentiful fortune. He married my
mother at York, who received her firft breath in that
country: and as her maiden name was Bobinfon, I
was called Robinfon Kreutznaer s which not being
eafily pronounced in the Englifh tongue, we are com-
monly known by the name of Crufoe.
I was the youngeft of three brothers. The eideft
was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockiiart's regiment, but
flain by the Spaniards: what became of the other, I
could never learn.
No charge nor pains were wanting in my educa-
tion. My tataer oe'igucd me for the law; yet no-
thing would fern ine but I muft go to fea, both a-
gainft the will of my father, the tears of my me her,
and the entreaties o; 'fiends. One morning my fa-
ther expofhilated ve./ warmly with me. What rea-
fon, f,ys he, have yei: to leave your native country,
where there muft be a more certain profpect of con-
tent and hsppj'.efs, to enter into a wandering con-
dition of uneafincfs and uncertainty? He reconunen-
A. dec!
ded to me Augur's wifh, Neither to dcfire poverty nor
riches; that a middle ftate t>f life was the moft hap-
py, and that the high towering thoughts of fifing
our condition by wandering abroad, were furrotrffiri-
ed with mifery and .danger, and often ended with
confufion and difappointment. I entreat you, nay,
I command you, (fays he), to defift from thefe inten-
tions. Confider your cldeft brother, who laid down
his Jife for his honour, cr rnther lofl it for his dif-
obcdicnce to my will. If you will go, (added he), my
prayers fhall however be offered for your prefervati-
on ; but a time may come, when, defolate, oppref-
fexl, or forfaken, you may wifh you had taken your
poor defpifed father's counfel.- He pronounced
thefe words with fuch a moving and paternal elo-
quence* while floods of tears ran down his aged
check^fthat it fecmed to ftem the torrent of my re-
folutions. But this fooh wore off, and a little after
I informed my mother, that I could not fettle to any
bufrnefs, my refolutions were fo ftrong to fee the
world; and begged flie would gain my father's, con-
fent only to go one voyage; which, if it did not prove
profperous, I would nevSr attempt a fecond. But my
defire was as vain as my folly in afking. My mother
paffionately exprdTed her diflike of this propofal,
telling me, That as Jbe fa-w 1 was bent upon my own.
definition, contrary to their -will and my duty, Jbe
I,ouldfay no more, but leave me to myfelfto do -what-
foever 1 f leafed.
1 was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one
time'being at Hull, I met a fchool-fellow of mine,
going along with his father, who was mafter of a fhip,
to London; and acquainting him with my wandering
defines, he affured me of a free paflagf, and a plenti-
ful fliare of what was neceffary. Thus, withour im-
ploring a bkffing, or taking farewell of my parents,
I took fhipping on the firft of September 1651. We
fet fail foon after; and our fhip had fcarce left the
Humber aftern, when there arofe fo violent a florm,
that.
that, being extremely fea-fick, I concluded die judg-
ments of God defervedly followed me for my difobe-
dience to my dear parents. It was then I called to
mind the good advice of my father; how eafy and
comfortable was'a middle ftate of life.; am! 1 firmly
refolved, if it pleafed God to fet me on dry land
once more, I would return to my parents, implore
their forgivenefs, and brd a final adieu 'to my wan-
dering inclinations.
Such were my thoughts while the ftorm continued;
but thefe good refolutions decreafed with the danger;
more efpecially when my companion came to me,
clapping me on the moulder: What, Bob! faid he,
fare you was not frightened loft night -withfcarcs a cap-
full of-wind? And do you, cried I, call fitch a vio-
lent ftorin a cap full of wind? A ftorm, .you fool you,
faid he, this is nothing; agoidjhipandfea-roomctl-
•ways baffles fiich afoolijh fqua-wl of-wind as that: But
you're a freflj-iuater failor: Come boy, turn out, fee
•whatfine -weather -we have new, and a. good bowl of
punch will drown all your paft forrows. In fhort, th~
punch was made, I was drunk; and in one night's
time drowned both my repentance and my good re-
'folations, forgetting entirely the vows and-promifes
I made in my diftrefs: and whenever any reflections
would return on me) what by company, and what
by drinking, I foon maftered thofe fits,- as I deriding-
ly called'them. But this only made way for another
trial, whereby I 'could not but fee how much I was
beholden to kind providence.
.;< Upon the Gxth day we came to an anchor in Har-
wich road, where we lay wind bound with feme New-
• caftle fhips; and there being good anchorage, and
our cables found, the feamen forgot their late toil
and danger, and fpent the time as merry as if they
had been on fbore. But on the eighth day there aroiii
a brifk gale of'wind, which prevented our tiding it
up the river; and flifi increafing, our fhip rode fon;-
cailk in, and fhipped feveral large feas.
A i It
It was not long before horror feized the feamen
th.-mfclves, and 1 heard the Mailer exprefs this me-
lancholy ejaculation, Lord have mercy upon ?:j, tue
fiall be all loft and undone! For my part, fiek unto
death, I kept my cabin, till the univerfal and terribly
dreadful apprehenfions of our fpeccly fate made me get
upon deck: and there I was affrighted indeed. The
fea went mo"mains high: I could fee nothing but
diftrefs around us; two Ihiris had cut their mafts ori
board, and another whs foundered: two more that
had loft their anchors, were forced out to the mercy
ot the ocean; and, to fave our lives, we were forced
to cut our foremaft and mainmaft quite away.
Who is there fo ignorant as not to judge of my
dreadful condition? I was but a frefh-water failor,
and therefore it feemed more terrible. Our fhip was
very good, but over-loaded; which made the failors .
often cry out, She -wouldfounder: Words I then was
ignorant of. All this while the florm continuing,
v.nd lather increafing, the mafter and the more fober
part of his men went to' prayers, expecting de.ath
every moment. In the middle of the night one cried
out, We had fpn/ng a leak .- another, That there -was
four foot -water in the hold. I was juft ready to ex-
pire with fear, when immediately all hands were call-
ed to the pump; and the men forced me alfo in that
extremity to (hare with them in their labour. While
thus employed, the mailer efpying fome light colliers,
fired a gun as a fignal of diftrefs; and I not under-
Handing what it meant, and thinking that either the
Jhip broke, or fome dreadful thing happened, fell
into a fwoon. Even in that common condition of
woe, nobpdy minded me, excepting to thruft me a-
fide with their feet, thinking me dead, and it was a
great while before I recovered.
Happy it was for us, when, upon the fignal given,
they ventured -out their boat to fave our lives. All
our pumping had been in vain, and vain had all our
attempts beena had they not come to our fhip's Cde,
and
•
and our men cafh them a rope over the ftern with a
, buoy to it, which after great labour they got hold of,
and we haling them to us, got into their boat, and
left our fhip, which we perceived fink within lefs than
a quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what was
meant by Foundering at fea. . And now the men in-
cefiantly laboured to recover their own fhip; but the
fea ran fo high, and the wind blew fo hard, that
they thought it convenient to hale within fhore;
which, with great difficulty and danger, at laft we
happily effected, landing at a place called Cramer, not
. far from Winterton light-houfe; from whence we all
walked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of pity, many
good people furnifhed us with neceflaries to carry us
either to Hull or London.
Strange, that after all this, like the prodigal fon,
I did not return to. my father; who, hearing of the
fhip's calamity, for a long time thought me intombed
in the deep. No doubt but I fhould have jhared in
his fatted calf, as the fcripture expreffeth it: hut my
ill fate ftill pufhed me on, in fpite of the powerful
convictions of reafon and confcience.
When we had been at Yarmouth three days, I met
. my old companion, who had given me the invitation
to go on board along with his father. His behavi-
our and fpeech was altered, and in a melancholy man-
ner afked me how I did, telling his father who I was,
and how I had made this voyage for a trial only to
proceed farther abroad. Upon which the old genile-
man turning to me gravely, faid, Young man, you ought
never to go to fea any more, but to take this for a certain
fign tAatyou -will never pro/per inafeafaring condition.
Sir, anfwered /, will you take the fame refolution ?- It
is a different cafe, faid he, it is my calling, and confe-
quently my duty; but as you have made this vsyagefor
• a trial, you fee -what illfuccefs heaven hasfet before your
eyes; andpei-haps ourmiferies have been on your account,
like Jonah in the jhip of Tarfliifh But pray -what are
• you> a.nd on what account did you go to fea? Upon
A 3 which
which I very freely declared my whole flory ; at the
end of which he made this exclamation: Ye facred
powers! what had I committed, that fuch a wretch
fhould enter into my fhip, to heap upon me fuch a
deluge of miferies! But foon recollecting his paffions,
Tn.ng man, faid he, if you do not go back, depend up-
on it, -where-ever you go, you -will meet with difafters
and difappointments till yoilr father's -words are fulfil-
led upon you. And fo we parted.
I thought at firft to return homo; but fhame op-
pofed that good motion, as thinking I fhould be laugh-
ed at by my neighbours and acquaintance. So ftrange
is the nature of youth, who are not afhamed to fin,
but yet afhamed to repent; and fo far from being a-
fhamed of thofe actions for which they may be ac-
counted fools, they think it folly to return to their
duty, which is the principal mark of wifdom. In
fhort, I travelled up to London, refolving upon a voy-
age; and a voyage I foon heard of, by my acquaintance
•with a captain who took a fancy to me, to go to the
coaft of Guinea. Having fome money, and appearing
like a gentleman, 1 went on board not as a common
failor or foremaft-man; nay, the commander agreed
1 fhould go that voyage with him without any ex-
pence; that I fhould be his mefs-mate and compa-
nion, and I was very welcome to carry any thing with
me, and make the beft merchandife I could.
I bleflcd my happy fortune, and humbly thanked
my captain for this offer; and acquainting my friends
in Yorkfhire, forty pounds were fent me, the greateft
part of which my dear father and mother contri-
buted to, with which I bought toys and trifles, as the
captain directed me. My-captain alfo taught me navi-
gation, hr-w to keep an account of the fhip's courfe,
take an obferv;>tion, and led me into the knowledge
of feveraLufeful branches of the mathematics. And'
indeed this voyage ma.le me both a failor and a mer-
chant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces
of gold duft for my adventure, which produced, at
my
my return to London, almoft three hundred pounds.
But in this voyage I was extremely fick, being
thrown into a violent calenture through exceffive
heat,, trading upon the coaft from the latitude of
fifteen degrees north even to the line itfelf.
But alas! my d,ear friend the captain foon departed
this lite after his arrival. This was a fenfible grief
•to. me; yet I refolved to. go another voyage with his
mate, 'who had now got command of the fhip. This
proved a very unfuccefsful one; for though I did not
carry quite a hundred pounds of my late acquired
•wealth, (fo that 1 had two hundred pounds left, which
I repoied with the captain's widow, who was an ho-
neft gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in this unhap-
py voyage were very great. For our fhip failing to-
wards the Canary iflands, we we/e chafed by a Sallee
rover; and in fpite of all the hafte we could make, by
crouding as much canvas as our yards could fpread,
or our mafts carry, the pirate gained upon us, fo that
we prepared ourfelves to fight. They had eighteen
guns, and we had but twelve. About three in the
afternoon there was a defperate engagement, where-
i'n many were killed.and wounded on both fides: but
finding oorfelves overpowered with numbers, our
fhip difabled, and ourfelves too impotent to have the
leaft hopes of fuccefs, we were forced to furrender;
and accordingly were all carried prisoners into the
port of Sallee. Our men were fent to the Emperor's
court to be fold there; but the pirate captain taking
notice of me, kept me to be his own flave.
In this condition, I thought myfelf the moftmifer-
able creature on earth, and the prophecy of my father
came afrefh into my thoughts. However, my condi-
tion was better than I thought it to be, as will foon
appear. Some hopes indeed I had that my new pa-
'tron would go to fea again, where he might be taken
by a Spanifh or Portuguefe man of war, and th-en I
fhould be fet at liberty. But in this I w.is miftaken;
for he never took me with him, but left me to look
after
after his little garden, and do the drudgery of his
houfe, and when he returnefl from fea, would make
me lie in the cabin, and look after the fliip. I had
no one that I could cummunicate my thoughts to,
which were continually meditating my efcape; no
Englifhman, Irifhman, or Sectanan here, -but my-
felf; and for two years I could fee nothing practi-
cable, but only pleafed myfelf with the imagination.
After feme length of time, my t>atron, as I found,
grew fo poor, that he could not fit out his fhip as u-
•fual: and then he ufed conftantly, once or twice a-
week, if the'weather was fair, to go out a-fifhing,
taking me and a young Morefco boy to row the boat;
and fo much pleafed was he with me for my dexte-
rity in catching the fifh, that he would often fend
me with a Moor, who was one of his kinfmen, and
the Morefco youth, to catch a difh of fifh for him.
One morning, as we were at the fport, there arofe
fuch a thick fog, that we lofl fight of the fhore: and
rowing we knew not which way, we laboured all the
night, and in the morning found ourfelves in the
ocean, two leagues from land. However, we attain-
ed there at length, and made the greater bafte, be-
caufe our ftomachs were exceeding fharp and hun-
gry. In order to prevent fuch difafters for the future,
my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little ilate-
room or cabin in the middle of the. long-boat, with a
place behind it to fteer and hale home the main
fheet, with other conveniencies to keep him from the
weather, as alfo lockers to put in all manner of pro-
vifions, with a handfome fhoulder-of-mutton fail,
gibing over the cabin.
In this he frequently took us out a-fifhing; and'
one time inviting two or three perfons of diftin&ion
to go with him, made provifion extraordinary,, provi-
ding alfo three fufees with powder and fhot, that they
might have fome fport at fowling along the fca-coaft.
The next morning the boat was made clean, her an-
cient and pendants out, and every thing ready; but
•' "their
their minds-altering, my patron ordered us to go a-
'£fhing, for that his guefts-would certainly fup with
him that night.
And now I began to think of my deliverance in-
'deed. In order to this I perfuaded the Moor to get
fome provifions on boardr as not daring to meddle
with our patron's; and he taking my advice, we fto-
red jeurfclves with rufk bifcuit, and three jars of wa-
ter. Befidcs, I privately conveyed into the boat a
bottle of Brajidy, fome twine, thread, a hammer, hat-
chet, and a faw; and, in particular, fome bees wax,
which was a great comfort to me, and ferved to make
candles. I then perfuaded Muley (for fo was the Moor
called) to procure fome, powder and fhot, pretending
to kill fea carlieus, which he-innocently and readily
agreed to. In fhort, being provided with all things
neceflary, we failed out, refolving for my own part
to make my efcape, tho' it fhould coft me my life.
When we had paffed the caftle, we fell to fifhing;
.but, though I knew there was a bite, I diffembled the
matter, in order to put further out, to fea. Accord-
ingly we ran a leegue further; when giving the boy
the helm, and pretending to ftopp for lomething, I
feized Muley by furprife, and threw him overboard.
. As he was an excellent fwimmer, he foon arofe, and
made towards the boat; upon which, I took out a
fufee, and prefented it at him: Mi/ley, faid I, I never
yet dejlgned to do yau any harm, andfeek nothing noio
but my redemption, I know you are able enough tofwirn
to flare, and fave your life; hut if you are refelved to
follow mei to the endangering of mine, the very moment
you proceed, I •will JJioot you through the head. The
harmlcfs creature, at theie words, turned himfelf from
me, and I make no doubt got fafe to land. Then turn-
ing to the boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at the
a£Hon; but I put him out of all fear, telling him,
that if he would be true and faithful to me, I would
,do well by him. And> therefore, faid I, you. muftjtroke
• your face to be faithful, and, as the Turks have learned
you,
you,fwear by Mahomet, and the beard of your father,
or elfe I -will throw you into the fea alfo. So innocent
did the child then look, and with fuch an obliging
fmile confented, that I readily believed him, and
from that day forward began to love him entirely.
We then purfued our voyage ; and, left they mould
think me gone to the Streights mouth, I kept to the
fouthward to the truly Barbarian coaft! but, in the
dufk of the evening, I changed my courfe, and fteer-
ed directly S. and by E. that I might keep near the
fhore; and, having a frefh gale of wind, with a plea-
fant fmooth fea, by three o'clock next day I was 150
miles beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions.
Yet ftill havihg the dreadful apprehenfion of being re-
taken, I continued failing for five days fucceffively, till
fuch time as the wind Chuffing to the fouthward, made
me conclude^ that if any reffel was in chace of me,
they would proceed no • farther. After fo much fa-
tigue and thought, I anchored at the mouth of a lit-
tle river, I knew not what, or where; neither did I
then fee any people. What I principally wanted was
frefh water; and I was refolved about the du'fk to
fwim afhore. But no fooner did the gloomy clouds of
night begin to fucceed the declining day, when we
heard fuch ba-rking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures, that one might have thought the very
ftrangeft monfters of nature, or infernal fpirits, had
their refidence there. • Poor Xury, almoft dead with
fear, entreated me not to go on fbore that night-
Suppojing I dont,. Xury, faid I, and'in the morning -we
Jhould fee men -who are -worfe than thofe -Me fear, -what
then? 0 den -we may give dem lie /boot gun, replied Xu-
ry, laughing, and de gun make dim all run away. The
wit, and broken Englifh which the boy had learned
among the captives of our nation, pleafed me entire-
ly; and, to add to his cheerfulnefs, I gave him a dram
of the bottle: we could get but little fleep all the night
for thofe terrible bowlings they made; and, indeed,
we were both very rmjch affrighted, when, by ths
rollings
rollings of the water, and other tokens, we juftly
concluded one of thofe monfters made towards our
boat. I could not fee till it came within two oars
length, when taking my fufee, I let fly at him. Whe-
ther I hit him or no, 1 cannot tell ; .but he made to-
wards the fhore, and the noife of my gun increafed
the ftupendous noife of the monfters.
The next morning I was refolved to go on fhore
to get frefh water, and venture my life among the
beafts or favages, fhould either attack me. Xury faid,
he would take one of the jars, and bring me fome. v I
afked him why he would go, and-not I? The poor
boy anfwered, If -wild mans come, they eat me, you go
•way. A mind fcarcely now to be imitated, fo con-
trary to felf-prefervation, the moft powerful law of
nature! This indeed increafed my affection to the
child. Well, dear Xury, faid I, -we -will both go a/bore,
both kill wild mdns, and theyjhall eat neither of us. So
giving Xury a piece of rufk bread to eat, and a dram,
we waded afhore, sarrying nothing with us but our
arms, and two jars for water. I did not go out of
fight of the boat, as dreading the favages coming
down the river in their canoes; but the boy feeing a
* low defcent or vale about a mile in the country, he
•wandered to it; and then running back to me with
great precipitation, I thought he was purfued by
fome favage or wild beaft; upon which 1 approach-
ed, refolving to perifh or protect him from danger.
As he came nearer to me, I faw fomething hanging
over his moulders, which was a creature he had fhot
like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs;
however, we were glad of it, for it proved whole-
fome and nourifhing meat; but what added to our
joy was, my boy allured me there was plenty of wa-
ter, and that lie fee no -wild mans. And greater ilill
was our comfort, when we found frefh water in the
creek where we were when the tide was out, without
going fo far up into the country.
In this place I began to confider that the Canary
and
and Cape de Verde iflands lay not far off; but having
no inftrument, I knew not what latitude, or when to -
fland off to lea for them ; yet my hopes were, I mould
meet fome of the Englifh trading veflels, who would
relieve and take us in.
The place I was in was no doubt that wild coun-
try, inhabited only by a few, that lies between the
Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes.
It is filled with wild beafts, and the Moors ufe it for
hunting chiefly. From this place I thought I faw
the top of the mountain leneriffe in the Canaries;
which made me try twice to attain it; but as often
was I drove back, and fo forced to purfue my fortune
along fhore.
Early one morning we came to an anchor under a
little point of land, but pretty high; and the tide be-
ginning to flow, we lay ready to go further in. But
Xury, whofe youthful and penetrating eyes were
fharper than mine, in a loft tone, defired me to keep
far from land, left we fhould be devoured. For look
yonder, master, faid he, and fee de dreadful monfter faft
ajleep on de Jide of de hill. . Accordingly looking where
he pointed, I efpied a fearful monfter indeed. It was
a terrible great lion that lay on fhore, covered as it
were by a fh'ade of a piece of the hill. Xury, faid I,
youjballgo on fhore and kill him. But the boy looked
amazed: Me kill him, fays he, he eat me at one mouth;
meaning one mouthful. Upon which I bid him lie
ftill, anci charging my biggeft gun with two flugs,
and a good charge of powder, I took the beft aim I
cculd to ihoot him through the head; but his leg ly-
ing over his nofe, the flug broke his knee-bone.
The linn ;ovaking with the pain, got up, but focn fell
down, "iving the moft hideous groan I ever heard:
but taking my fecond piece, I fhot him through the
head, and then he lay ftruggling for life. Upon this
Xury took heart and defired my leave to go on fhore.
Go then, faid I. Upon which, taking a little gun in
one haud, he fwam to fhore with the other, .>nd co-
ming
Wring clofe to the'lion, put a period to his life, by
(hooting him again through the head.
But this was fpending our ammunition in vain, the
Bern not being good to ea't. Xury Was like a'-cham-
pion, arid comes on board for a hatchet, to cut off
the head of his enemy; but not having ftrength to
perform it, he cut Off and brought me a foot. I be-
thought me however that his ikin would be of ufe.
• This work coft Xury and me a whole-day; when
fpreading it on the top of our cabin, the hot beams of
the fun effectually- dried it in two days time, and it
afterwards ferved me for a bed to lie on.
And now we failed foutherly, living fpcTfingly oft
t>nr provifions, and went no oftener on more than we
were obliged for frefh water. My defign was to make
the river Gambra-or Senegal, or any where about the
'Cape de Verde, in hopes to meet forne European
fnip. If "Providence-did not fo favour me, my neit
courfe was to feek for the ifknds,-or lofe my life a-
mong the Negroes. And in a word, I put my whole
'ftrefs upon this, •" Either that I muft meet with fome
"fhrp, or certainly perifh."
'One day as we were failing along, we fawpeople ftand
on the fhore looking at us; we could alfo percerve
they were black and ftark naked. I "was inclined to
go on fhore, but Xury cried, No, no; however, I ap-
• preached nearer, and\I found they run along the fhore
.by me a good way. They had no weapons in their
•hands, except one, who held a long ftick, which Xu-
ry told me was a lance, with which they could kill at
'a great dirtance. I talked to diem by figns, and made
'them fcnfible I wanted forrrething to eat; they bec-
liorred to me to ftop my boat, while two of them ran
\ip-into-the country, and in lefs than half an hour
'came back, and brought with them two pieces 3f-dry
flefh, arid fome corn, which we kindly accepted: and
to prevent any fears on either fide, they brought the
.ibodtothe fhore, laid it down, then went and flood a
•B great
great way off till we fetched it on board, and then
came clofe to us again.
But wh'ilo we were returning thanks to them, be-
ing all we could afford, two mighty creatures came
from the mountains, one as it were purfuing the ei-
ther with great fury, which we were the rather in-
clined to believe, as they feldom appear but in the
night; and both thefe fwiftly paffing by the negroes,
jumped into the fea, wantonly fwimming about, as
though the diyerfion of the waters had put a ftop to
their fiercenefs. At laft one of them coming nearer
to my boat than I expe£ted or defired, I {hot him di-
re£tly through the head; upon which he funk imme-
diately, yet rifing again, would have willingly made
to the fiSore; but between the wound and theftrang-
ling of the water, he died before he could reach it.
It is impoffible to exprefs the confcernation the
poor negroes were in at the firing of my gun; much
lefs can I mention their furprife, when they perceived
the creature to be flain by it. I made figns to them
to draw near it with a rope, and then gave it to them,
to hale on fhore. It was a beautiful leopard, which
made me defire its fkin: and the negroes feeming to
covet the carcafe, I freely gave it to them. As for
the other Jeopard, it made to fhore, and ran with a
prodigious fwiftnefs out of fight. The negroes ha-
ving kindly furnifhed me with water, and with what -
roots and grains their country afforded, I took my
leave, and, after eleven days fail, came in fight of
the Cape de Verde, and thofe iflands called by its name.
But the great diftance I was from it, and fearing con-
trary winds would prevent my reaching them, I be-
gan to grow melancholy and dejected, when, upon a
fudden, Xury cried out, Mafter! mafter! a flip -with
a. fail! and looked as affrighted as if it was his mafter's
fhip fent in fearch of us. But I foon difcovered flie
was a Pomiguefc fhip, ns I thought, bound to the
coaft of Guinea for negroes. Upon which I ftrove
£of -life to come up to them. But vain had it been,
.
if through their perfpe£Hve glafles they had not per-
ceived me, and Shortened thiir fail to let me come
up. Encouraged at this, I fet up my patron's ancient,
and fired a glm, both as fignals of dtftrefs ; upon which
they very kindly lay to, fo that in three hours time J
came up with them. They fpoke to me in Portuguefe,
Spanifh, and French, but neither of thefe did I un-
derftand; till at length a Scots failor called, and then
I told him I was an Englifhman, who had efcaped
from the Moors at Sallee; upon which they took me
kindly on board, with all my effects.
Surely none can exprefs the inconceivable joy I felt
at this happy deliverance! who, from being a late mi-
ferable and forlorn creature, was not only relieved,
but in favour with the mafter of the fhip, to whom,
in return for my deliverance, I offered all I had. Gid
forbid, faid he, that IJbeuldtake any thing from you.
Every thing /ball be delivered to you -when you come to
Brazil. If 1 have faved your life, it is no more th.in I
JhculdcxpeB to receive myfelffrem any other, -when, in
the fame circumftances, IJbould happen to meet the like
deliverance. Andfcould 1 take from you what yen havet
and leave you at Brazil, -why, this weuld be only taking
auiay a life I have given. My charity teaches me bet-
ter. Tkcfe ejj"ecls you have -will fupport you there, and
provide you a paffage home again. And, indeed, he
acted with the ftricleft jufticii in what he did, taking
my things into his poffeffion, and giving me an exact
inventory, even to my earthen jars. He bought my
boat of me for the fhip's ufe, giving me a note of
, eighty pieces of eight, payable at Brazil; and if any-
body offered more, he would make it up. He alfo
gave me fixty pieces for my boy Xury. It was with
great reluctance I was prevailed upon to fell the child's
liberty, who had ferved me fo faithfully; but the boy-
was willing himfelf; and it was agreed, that after ten
years he fhould be made free, upon his renouncing
Mahometanifm, and embracing Chriftianity.
Having a pleafant voyage to the Brazils, we arrived
B 2 in
•
in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All-Saints
in twenty-two days, after. And here I cannot forget,
the generous treatment of the captain. lie would take.
nothing for my paflage, gave me twenty ducats for
the leopard's fkin, and thirty for the lion's. Every
thing he caused to be delivered, and what I would
fell-Re bought. In fhort, I made about,220 pieces of
my cargo; and with this ftock.I entered once more,
as I may fay, into the fcene of life.
Being recommended to, an honeft planter, I lived
with him till'fuch time as.I was informed of the man-,
ner of their planting and making fugar; and feeing
how well, they lived, and how, fuddenly they grew
rich, I was filled with.a defire to. fettle among them,.
and refolyed to get my:money, remitted tQ me, and, to.
purchafe a plantation.
To be brief, I bought a fejttlement next door to.,arv
honeft and kind neighbour, born at Lifbon, of Eng-
lifh parents, whofe plantation, joining to. mine, we,
improved it very amicably together. Both our flocks
were low, and for two years we planted only for food:
but the.thifd year we planted fome tobacco, and each,
of us dreffid a large, piece of .ground the eufuing year,
for planting canes. But now I found how much I,
'wanted a.ffiftajice,.and repented the lafs of my dear,
boy Xury,
Having none to aflift me, my father's words came,
into my mind; and I ufed to aflj myfclf, if what I.
fought was only a middle ftation of life, why could it
not as well be obtained in England as here? when I,
pondered on this with,regret, the thoughts of my late
deliverance forfook.me, I had none to converfe.wjth
but my neighbour; no work,tq be. done but by my
own hands; it often made me fay, my condition was
like to that of a man caft upon a defolate ifland. So
unhappy are we in our rene£Uons/fo forgetful of what
good things we receive ,ourfelves, and fo unthankful
for our.deliverance from thpfe calamities that others,
endure...
I .was
T was in fome meafure fettled, before the captain,
•who took me up, departed from the Brazils. One
day I went to him, and told him what ftock I had in
London, defiring his affiftance in getting it remitted;
to which the good gentleman readily confented, but
would only have me fend for half my money, left it
fhould mifcarry; which, if it did, I might flill have
the remainder to fupport me: and fo taking letters of
procuration from me, bid me trouble myfelf no far-
ther about it.
And, indeed, wonderful was his kindnefs towards
me; for he not only procured the money I had drawn
for upon my captain's widow, but fent me over a fer-
vant with a cargo, proportionable to my condition.
He a'.fo fent me over tools of all forts, iron work, and
utenfils neceflary for my plantation, and which pro-
ved of the greateft ufe to me in my bufinefs.
Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon
fuccefs crowning my profperous labours, I might
have refted happy in that middle flate of life my fa-
ther had fo often recommended; yet nothing would
content me, fuch was my evil genius, but I muft
leave this happy ftation, for a foolifh ambition in ri-
fing; and thus, once more, I caft myfelf into the
deepeft gulf of mifery that ever poor creature fell in-
to. Having lived four years in Brazil, 1 had not only
learned the language, but contracted acquaintance
with the moft eminent planters, and even the mer-
chants of St Salvadore; to whom, once, by way of
tlifcourfe, having given an account of my two voyages
to the coaft of Guinea, and the manner of trading
there for mere trifles, by which we furnifh our plan-
tations with negroes, they gave fuch attention to what
1 faid, that three of them came one morning to me,
and told me they had a fecret propofal to make. Af-
ter enjoining me to fecrecy, (it being an infringement
on the powers of the kings ©f Portugal and .Spain)
they told me they had a mind to fit out a fhip to go
to Guinea, in order to ftock the plantation with ne-
B 3 groes,
groes,,.which, as they could not be publicly fold, tlity -
would divide among them; and if I would go theifv
fupercargain the fhip* to manage the trading part, I.
fhould have an equal fhare of the negroes, without
providing any flock. The thing indeed was fair e-.
nough, had I; been in another condition. But I,..
born-to be my own deftroyer,,cou]d not refift the pro-,
pofal, but accepted the offer, upon condition of their,
looking after my plantation. So making a formal
will, I bequeathed my effects to my good friend the.
captain, as my univerfal hei,r; but obliged him to >
difpofe of my effects as directed, one half of the pro-,
duce to himi'elf, and the other to be fiiipped to Eng-, •
land..
The fhip. being fitted out, and all things ready, we -
fet fail, the firftof September 1659, being the fame day,
eight year I left my father and mother in Yorkfhire.,
We failed northward upon the coaft, in order to gain;
Africa, till we made Cape Auguftine; from whence^
going farther in. the ocean, out of fight of land, .we,
iteered as though we were bound for the ifle Fernand,
de Norenba, Jeaving the iflands-on the eafl; and then,
it was .we met with a terrible tempeft, which conti-
nued- for twelve days fucceffively, fo that the winds
carried us wherefoever they .pleafed. In.this perplex-,
ity. one of our men, died, and. one man and a boy.
were, wafhed. overboard., When the weather cleared
up a little, we found ourfelves eleven degrees north,
latitude, upon the coaft of Guiana. Upon this the,
captain gave reafons ior returning; which I oppofed>
ccunfelling him to Hand away for Barhadpes, which,
as I fuppofed, might be attained in fifteen days. So
altering our courfe, we failed north-weft, and by weft,
in order to reach the leewafd iflaods; but a fecond
ftorm fucceeding, drove us to the weftw-atd ;.fo that;
•we were juflly afraid of falling into the hands of cruel,
favnges, or the paws of devouring beafts of prey. .
In this great diftrefs, one of our men, early in th&
morning, cried out, L^nd^lan^! which he had noj
fpioner cried out, but our fhip ftruck upon a fand, and.;
In a moment the fea broke over her in fuch a man- -
Her, that we expected we fhould all have perifhed •
immediately. We knew nothing where we were, or,
upon what land w« were driven; whether an ifland 1
or the main, inhabited or not- inhabited; and we
could not fo much as. hope that the fhip would hold >
out many minutes, without breaking in pieces, ex*
cept the wind by a miracle fhbuld turn about imme-
diately. While we flood looking. at one another,
expecting death .every moment, the mate lays hold of •
the boat, and with the help of the reft got her flung
over the fliip's fide, and getting all into her, being
eleven of us, committed ourfelves to God's mercy,,,
and the wild fea. And now we faw that this lafl ef-
fort would not be a -fufficient protection -from death;
fb high did the fea,rife, that it was impoffible the boat -
fhould live.. ^s to making fail, we had none ; neither
if we had, cauld we make ufe of any.. So that wheiv
we had rowed, or rather were driven about a league,
and a.half, a raging wave, like a lofty mountain,.,
came rolling.aftern of us, and took us with fuch fu-
ry, that at once it overfet the boat. Thus being ftval-'
lowed up in a moment, we had hardly time to tall'
upon the tremendous ,iame of God : much lefs to im-
plore, in dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy to re-
ceive our departing.fouls..
Men. are generally counted infenfible, when ftrug-
gling in the pangs of death* j but while I was over-
whelmed with water, I had the Ynoft dreadful appre-
henfions imaginable. For the joys-of heaven and the.
torments of hell, feemed to preient themfelves before
me in thefe dying agonies, and even fmall fpace of
time, as it were, between life and death. I was go-
ing,.I .thought, I knew not.whither, in a difm'al gulf
unknown, and as yet unperceived, never to behold
my friends, nor the light of this world any more!
Gould I even have thought of annihilation, or a total
•tUflblution of foul a$ well as body, the glpomy thoughts
of
bf having no further being, no knowledge of what Vfg
hoped for, but an eternal quietus, without life ot
fenfe; even that, I fay^ would have been enough to
ftrike me with horror and confofion! 1 drove how*
ever to the laft extremity, while all my companions
were overpowered and intombed in the deep: and it
was with great difficulty I kept my breath till the;
wave fpent itfelf, and retiring back, left me on the
fhore half dead with the water I had taken in. As
foon as I got on my feet, I ran as faft as I could, left
another wave fliould purfue me, and carry me back a-
gain. But, for all the hafte I made, I could not avoid
it; for the fea came after me like a high mountain,
Or furious enemy; fo that my bufmefs was to hold my
breath, and by raifmg myfelf on the water, preferve
it by fwimming. The next dreadful wave buried me
at once twenty or thirty feet deep, but at the fame
time carried me with a mighty force and fwiftnefs to-
ward the- fbore; when raifing myfelf, I held out as
well as poflible, till at length the water having fpent
itfelf, began to return, at which I ftruck forward,
and feeling ground with my feet, I took to my heels
again. Thus being ferved twice more, I was at laft
darned againft a piece of a rock, in fuch a manner as
left me fenfelefs; but recovering a little before the
return of the wave, which, no doubt, would theq
have overwhelmed me, I held faft by the rock till
thofe fucceeding waves abated; and then fetching
another run, was overtaken by a fmall wave, which
was foon conquered. But before any more could o-
vertake me, I reached the main land, where clamber-
ing up the clifts of the fhote, tired and almoft fpent, I
fat down on the grafs, free from the dangers of the
foaming ocean.
No tongue can exprefs the ecftafies and tranfports
that my foul felt at this happy deliverance. It was
like a reprieve to a dying malefactor, with the halter
about his neck, and ready to be turned off. I was
wrapt up in contemplation, and often lifted up my
Tbands, with the profoundeft humility, to the divine,
powers, for faving my life, when the reft of my com-,
panions were all,drowned. And now I began to caft
my eyes around, to. behold what:place I was in, and
•what I had next to do. I could fee no houfe norpeo-
ple: I was wet, yet had no clothes to fhift me^ hun-
gry and thirfty, yethad nothing to eat or drink; no wea-
pon to deftroy any creature for my fuftenance, nor de-
fend myfelf againft devouring beafts; in fliort, I had
nothing but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and,a box half
filled with tobacco. The darkfome night coming up-
<an.me, increafed my fears of being devoured by wild-
creatures; my mind was plunged in defpa.ir,.and ha-
ving no profpecl:, as I thought, of life before me,, L
prepared for another kind of death than what I had.
lately efcaped. I. walked about a furlong to fee if, I.
could find any freffi water, which I did, to my great,
joy; and taking a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger,
fgot up into a thick.bufhy tree, andfeatjng myfelf fo\
that I could not fall, a deep fleep overtook me, and for.
that night buried my forrows in a quiet repoie.
It was broad day the next morning before I awa-
ked; when I not only perceived, the tempef t was.
ceafed, but faw the flup driven almoft as far as the.
rock before mentioned, which the waves had dafhed.
me againft, and which was about a mile from the
place where I was. When I came down from my.
apartment in the tree, I perceived the fliip's boat two .
miles diftant. on my right han.d, lying on more, as
the waves had caft her. I thought to have got to .
her; but there being an inlet of water of about half
•a mile's breadth between it and me, I returned again.
towards the fhip, as hoping to find fomething for my.
rnore immediate fubfiften.ee. About noon, when the
fe'a was calm, that I could come within a quarter of
3 mile of her,''it was to my grief I perceived, that, if.
Vfje had kept on board, all our lives had been faved..
Ti*hefe thoughts, and my folitude, drew tears from.
my,
f
tny eyes, though all in vain. So refolving to get tc>
the fhip, I ftripped and leaped into the water; when
fwimming round her I was afraid I fhould not get
finy thing to lay hold of; but it was my good fortune
to efpy a fmail piece of rope hang down by the fore-
chains, fo low, that, by the help of it, though with
great difficulty, I got into the forecaflle of the fhip.
Here I found that the fhip was bulged, and had a great
deal of water in her hold; her ftern was lifted up a-
gainft a bank, and her head almoft to the water. £11
her quarter, and what was there, were free and dry.
The provifions I found in good order, with which I
crammed my pockets; and, lofing no time, ate while
I was doing other things; I alfo found fome rum, of
which I took a hearty dram ; and now I wanted for
nothing except a boat, which indeed was all, to carry
away what was needful for me.
Neceffity occafions quicknefsof thought. We ha<f
feveral fpare yards, a fpare topmafl or two, and two
or three large fpars of wood. With thefe I fell to
•work, and flung as many of them over board as I
could manage, tying every one of them with a rope
that they might not drive away. This done, I went
down the fhip's fide, and tied four of them fafl toge-
ther at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two
or three fhort pieces of plank upon them crofswife, I
found it would bear me, but not any confiderable
weight. Upon which I went to work again, cutting
a fpare topmaft into three lengths, adding them to
my raft with a great deal of labour and pains. I then
confidered what I fhould load it with, it being not
able to bear a ponderous burden. And this I foon
thought of, firft laying upon it all the planks and
boards I could get; next I lowered down three of the
feamen's chefts, after I had filled them, with bread,
rice, three Dutch cheefes, five pieces of dried goats
flefh, and fome European corn, what little the rats had
fpared; and for liquors, I found feveral cafes of bot-
tles belonging to our fkipper, in which were fome
cordial
£ordial wafers, and four or five gallons of rack, which
4 flowed by themfelves. By this time the tide begin-
ing to flow, I perceived my coat, waiftcoat, and
fhirt fwim away, which I had left on the fhore; as
for my linen breeches and (lockings, I fwam with
them on to the -fhip: but I foon found clothes enough,
though I took no more than I wanted for the prefent.
My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with; and,
after long fearch, I found out the carpenter's cheft,
which I got fafe down on my raft. I then looked for
arms and ammunition, and in the great .cabin found
two good fowling pieces, two piftols, feveral powder-
horns filled, a fmall bag of fhot, and two old rufty
fwords. I likewife found three barrels of powder,
two of which were good, but the third had taken wa-
ter, alfo two orthee broken oars, two faws, an axe,
and a hammer. I then p\it to fea, and in getting to
fhore had three encouragements, i. A fmooth calm
/ea. 2. The tide rifing and fetting in to the fhore.
3. The little wind there was blew towards land. Afr
ter I had failed about a mile, I found the raft to drive
a little diftance from the place where 1 firft landed;
and then I perceived a little opening of the land, with
a ftrong current of the tide running into it; upon
which 1 kept the middle of the ftream. But great
was my concern, when on a fudden the forepart of
my raft ran aground: fo that had I not, with great'
difficulty, for near half an hour, kept my back ftrain-
ing againft the chefts to keep my effects in their
places, all I had would have gone into the fea. But
after fome time, the rifing of the water caufed the
raft to float again, and coming up a little river with
land on both fides, I landed in a little cave, as near
the mouth as poffible, the better to difcover a fail, if
any fuch providentially pafled that way.
Not far off, I efpied a hill of 3 ftupendous height,
furrounded with.lefler hills about it, and thither I was
refolved to go and view the country, that I might fee
«rhat part was beft to fix my habitation in. Accord-
ingly*
"ingly, arming myfelf with a piftol, a fowling-piec^,"
.powder and ball, I afcended the mountain. There
I perceived I was in an ifland, encompafled by the
Tea; no diftant lands to be feen, but sbattering rocks
that ky to the weft: that it feemed to be a barren
•place, and, as I thought, inhabited only by wild
"beafts. I perceived abundance • of fowls, but igno-
rant of what kind, or whether good for nourifhment.
"I fhct one of them at my return, which occafioned a
>confufed Screaming among the other birds; and 'I
found ir, by its colours and beak, to be a kind of a
hawk, but its flefh was perfect carion.
When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on
'shere, which work fpent that day entirely; and fear-
ing that fome cruel beafls might devour me in the
night time while I flept, I made a kind of hut or bar-
ricade with the chefls and boards 1 had brought on
ihorc. That night I flept very-comfortably; and the
next morning my thoughts were employed to make
a further atten-pt on the fhip, and bring away what
neceflaries I could find, "before another ftorm fhould,
'break her :o pieces. Accordingly, I got on board as
"before, and prepared a fecond raft, far more nice thaii
the firfl; upon which I brought away the carpenter's
•>ftores, two or three bags full of nails, a great jack-
fcrew, 3 dozen or two of hatchets, and a grindftone.
1 alto took, away feveral things that belonged to the
.gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, two
.Barrels of mufket bullets, another fowling-piece, a
fmall quantity of powder, -and a large bagful of
fmall fhot. Befides thefe, I took all the men's clothes
.1 could find, a fpare "foretcp tail, a hammock, and
-librae bedding; and thus completing my fecond car-
go, I made all the hafte to fhore I could, fearing fome
wild beaft might deftroy what I had there atready.
But I only found a little wild cat fitting on one of
the chefts, who not feeming to fear me, or the gun
that I prefented at.her, I threw her a piece of bifcuit,
which Q»e inllantly ate, and departed.
When
When I had gotten thefe effects on fhore, I went
to work, in order to make me a ,little tent with the
fail and fome poles which I had cut for that purpofe;
snd having finifhed it, what things might be dama-
ged by the weather I brought in, piling all the empty
thefts and cafks in a circle, the better to fortify
it againft any fudden attempt of man or Beaft. After
this, I blocked up the doors with fome boards, and an
empty cheft turned theJong way out. I then charged
my gun and piftol, and, laying my bed on the ground,
flept as comfortably, till next morning, as though I
had been in a Chriftian country.
Now, though I had enough to fubfift me a long
time, yet defpairing of a fudden deliverance, or that
both ammunition and provifion might be fpent before
fuch thing happened, I coveted as much as I could;
end fo long as the fhip remained in that condition, I
daily brought away one neceflary or other; particu-
larly the rigging, fails, and cordage, fome twine, a
barrel of wet powder, fome fugar, a barrel of meal,
three cafks of rum, and, what indeed was moft wel-
come to me, a whole hogfhead of bread.
The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces,
carried off a hawfer whole, with a great deal of iron
work, and made another raft with the mizen and
fprit-fail-yards; but this being fo unwieldy, by the
loo heavy burden I had upon it, and not being able
fo dexteroufly to guide it, as the former, both my
cargo and I were overturned. For my part, all the
damage I fuftained was a wet fkin; and at low water,
after much labour in diving, I got moft of the cables,
and fome pieces of iron.
Thirteen days had I now been in the ifland, and
eleven times on board, bringing away all that was
nffible; and, I believe, had the weather been calm,
hould have brought away the whole fhip, piece by
piece. As I was going the twelfth time, the wind
began to rife; however, I ventured at low water, and
rummaging the cabin, in a locker I found fevcral ra-
C zors,
zors, fciffars, and fome dozens of knives and forts;
and in another thirty fix pounds in pieces of eight,
filver and gold. An! fimple vanity', faid I, -whom this
•world fo~rmtch dotes on, where is KCIV thy virtue, thy
excellency to me? Yon cannot procure me one thing need-
ful, nor remove me from this defolate ijland to a place
(>f plenty. One of thefe knives; fo meanly ejleemed, is
to me more preferable than all this heap. E'en there-
.fore remain -where thouart, to Jink in the deep as un-
regarded, even as a creature -whofe life is not -worth
freferving. Yet, after all this exclamation, I wrapt it
up in a piece of canvafs^ and began to think of ranking
another raft; but I foon perceived the wind begin to
arife, a frefh gale blowing from the fhore, and the fky
overcaft with clouds and darknefs; fo, thinking a raft
to be in vain, I let myfelf into the water with what
things I had about me, and it was with much difficulty
1 got afhore, when, foon after, it blew a fearful ftorm.
That night I flept very contentedly in my little
tent, furrounded with all my effects; but, when I
looked out in the morning, no mqre fhip was to be
feen. This much furprifed me for the prefent: yet,
•when I confidered I had loft no time, abated no pains,
and had got every thing ufeful out of her, 1 comforted
jnyfelf in the beft manner, and entirely fubmitted to
the will of Providence.
My next thoughts were, how I fhould defend and
fecure myfelf from favages and wild beafts, if any
fuch were in the ifland. At one time, I thought of
.digging a cave, at another I was for erecting a tent;
and, at length, I refolved to do both: The manner
or form of which will not, I hope, be unpleafing to
jdefcribe.
When I confidered the ground where I was, that
it was moorifh, and had no frefh water near it, my
refolutions were to fearch for a foil henlthy and well
watered, where I might not only be fheltered from
the fun's fcorching heat, but be more conveniently
fituated, as well to be fecured from wild men, and
beafts
teads of prey, as more eafily to difcover any diftant
fail, fhould it ever fo happen.
And, indeed, it was not long before I had my defire.
I found a little plain near a riling hill, the front to-
wards which being as fteep as a houfe-fide, nothing
could defcend on me from the top. On the fide of
this rock was a little hollow place, refembling the en-
trance or door of a cave. Juft before this place, on
the circle of the green, I refolved my tent fhould
.ftand. This plain did not much exceed a hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, like a delight-
ful green before my door, with a pkafing, though ir-
regular, defcent every way to the low grounds by the
fea-fide, lying on the N. N. W. fide of the hill, fo
that it was fheltered from the exccffive heat of the fun.
After this I drew a femkircle, containing ten yards in
.ks femidiameterr and twenty yards in the whole,
driving down two rows of ftrong ftakes not fix inches
from each other. Then with the pieces of cable
•which I had- cut on- board, I regularly laid them in the
circle between the piles up to their tops, which were
more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove
another row of piles looking within fide againft them,
between two or three feet high, which made me con-
clude it a little impregnable caftle for men and beafis.
And for my better fecurity I would have no door, but
entered in and came out by the help of a ladder,
which I alfo made.
Here was my fence and fortrefs, into which I car-
ried all my riches, ammunition, and ftores. After
which, working on the rock, what with the dirt and
ftones I dug out, I not only railed my ground two
feet, but made a little cellar to my manfion-houfe;
and this coft me many days labour and pains. One
day in particular a fhower of rain falling, thunder and
lightening enfued, which *put me in terror left my
powder mould take fire, and not only hinder my ne-
. ceflary fubfiftence, by killing me food, but even blow
up me and my habitation. To prevent which, I fell
C-i- «>•
to making boxes and bags, in order to feparate ir, ha^
ving by me near 150 weight. And thus being efta-
blifhed as King of the ifland, every day I went out
with my gun to fee what I could kill that was fit to
eat. I foo,i perceived numbers of goats, but very fhy;
yet having watched them narrowly, and feeing I coukl
better fhoot off the rocks than when in the low
grounds, I happened to fhoot a fhe-goat fuckling a.
young kid; which not thinking its dam flain, flood
by her unconcerned; and when 1 took, the dead crea-
ture up, the young one followed me even to the in-
clofure. I lifted the kid over the pales, and would
•willingly have kept it alive; but finding it could not
be brought to eat,. I was forced to flay it alfo for myy
own fubfiftenqe.
Thus entered into as ftrange a fcene of life as ever-
any man was in, I had moft melancholy apprehen-<
fions concerning my deplorable condition; and ma-
ny times the tears would plentifully run down my
fats, when lccnfider.ed how I was debarred-from all
communication with humankind. Yet while thefe
defponding cogitations would feem to make me ac-
cufe Providence, other good thoughts would interpofe-
and reprove me after this manner: Well, fuppofing
you. are defolate, is it not better to be fo than totally
perifh? Why were you Cngkd out to be faved, and
the reil dcftroyed? Why fhould you complain, when
not only your life is preferved, but the fhip driven,
even-into your reach, in order to take what was ne-
cfflary out of her tor your fubfiftence? But to pro-
ceed. - It was, by the account I kept, the 301(1 of
September when I firft landed on this ifland. About
twelve days after, fearing left I fhoald lofe my, rec-
koning of time, nay, even forget the Sabbath-days,
for want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved with a knife
upon a large poll, in great letters, and fet it up, in,
the fimilitude of a crofs, on the fea-fhore where I
Janded, I came on Jbore Sept. 30. 1659. .Every day I
cut a notch with my knife-on. the fides of this fqua,-*-
j and that on Sabbath :was as long again as the
reft; and every firft day of the month as long again
as that long one. In this manner I-kept my callen-.
dar, weekly, monthly, for yearly reckoning of time.
But had I made a more ftrict fearch, (as I did after-
wards), I need not have fet up this mark. For among
the parcels belonging to the gunner, carpenter, and
Captain's mate, I found thofe very things 1 wanted ;.
particularly pens, ink, and paper; alibi-found two
or three compafles, fome mathematical inftruments,-
dials, perfpeclive glaffes, books of navigation, three
Englifh Bibles, and feveral other good books, which
I'.carefuIIy put up. , Here I cannot but call to mind
.oar having a dog and two cats• on board, whom I'.'
made inhabitants with me in my caftle. Though
one might think I had all the neceflaries that were de-
firable, yet flill I found feveral things wanting. Myv
ink was daily wafting: I wanted'needles,-pins, and •
thread to mend or keep;-my clothes together; and
particularly a fpade, pick-axe,.or fhovel,,to.remove
the earth. It was a year before I finifhed my little
bulwark; and having fome intervals of relaxation,
after my daily/wandering abroad for provifion, I drew
up this plan, i alternately, as creditor and debtor, to
.remind me of the miferies and bleffinga of my life,
amdcr fo many various circuraflances.

ftge and door in the rock, which came out beyond^
the pale of my fortification'. I next proceeded to make
a chair and" table, and'fo began to ftudy fuch mecha-

| O U R N. A L,
SEptember 3oth, 1659,1 unhappy Robinfon-Crufoe,,
having fuflered fhipwreck, was driven on this
defolate Ifland, which I named the Defolate Ifland of
Defpair, the reft being fwallowed up in the tempe-
fluous oceans The next day I fpent in confwieraticn
of my unhappy circumftances, having no profpe£b
> tut of death-, either to be ftarved with hunger, or de-
voured by beafts or mercilefa favages.
Oclob. i. That morning, with great comfort, I be-
held the fhip drove amore. Some hopes I had, that
•when the ftorm was abated, I might be able to get
fome food and neeeflaries out of her; which I coa-
ceived were not damaged, becaufe the fhip did Hand
upright. At this time I lamented the lefs of my com-
panions, and our misfortune in leaving the veflei.
When I perceived the fhip as it were lie dry, I wa-
ded through the fands, th-en fwam aboard), the wea-
ther being very rainy, and with fcarcely any wind.
To the i4th of this month, my time was employ-
ed in making voyages, every tide getting what I
could out of the (hip. The weather very wet and
uncertain.
Odob. 20. My raft and all the goods- thereon were
cverfet; yet I recovered moft again at low water.
Oflob. 25. It blew hard, and rained night and day,
when the fhip went in pieces, fo that nothing was
feeu
ften of her but the wreck at low- water. This
1 fecured my goods from the inclemency of the wea--
ther.
Octob. 26. I wandered to fee where I could.find-
a place convenient for my abode. Ifixednpon a rock -
in the evening, marked out a half-moon, intending;
to erect a wall, fortified with piles, lined within with •
pieces of cables, and covered with turf.
Nov. i. I creeled my tent under a rock, and took:
up my lodgings very contendedly in a hammock that•:
•night.
Nov> 2. This day.I fenced myfelf in-with timber,,
chefts, and boards.
Nov. 3. I fhot two wild fowl, refembling ducks,,
•which were good to eat, and in the afternoon made-'
me a table. f
Nov. 4. I began to live regularly. Ira the morn-
ing. I allowed my.felf two or three hours to-walk outt
•with my gun; I then worked till near eleven o'clock,,
and afterwards refrefhed myfelf with what I had to >
•at. From twelve to two I would lie down to flcep. -
Extreme fukry weather.. In-the evening go to work--
again.
Nov. 5. Went out with my gnu and dog, flVotai
•wild cat with a foft fkin, but her flefh was good for>-
nothing. The fldns-of thofe I killed, I preferved. In
my return, I perceived many wild birds, and was ter--
irified by fome feals which made off-to fea-
Nov. 6. Completed my table.
Nov. .7,. Fair weather. I worked till-the izth,',
but omitted the nth, which, according to my calxm»
Jation, I fuppofed to be Sunday.
Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, whkhy h'owevers r
anach cooled the earth; with thunder and lightening,;
rcaufed in me a terrible furprife. The weather clear--
ling, Ifecured my powder in feparate parcels.
Nov. 14.—16. I made little boxes for my powder,,
lodging them in feveral places. I alfo fliot a large
.fowl, which proved excellent.meat.-
Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obli-
ged to defift for want of a pick-axe, fhovel, and
wheel-barrow. Iron crows I caufed to fupply the
place of the firft; but with all my art I could not
make a wheel-barrow.
Nov. 15: x It was my fortune to find a tree, refem-
bling what life Brazilians call an iron tree. I had like
to have fpoiled my axe with cutting it, being very
Jiard and exceeding heavy, yet, with much labour and
induftry, I made a fort of a fpade out of it.
Nov. 23- Thefe tools being made, I daily carried"
on my bufinefs; eighteen days I allowed for enlarging
my cave, that it might ferve me, not only for a ware-
houfe, but kitchen, parlour, and cellar;. 1 commonly
lay in the tent, unlefs the weather was rainy that I
could not lie dry. So wet would it be at certain iea-
fons, that I was obliged to cover all within the pale
with long poles, in the form of rafters, leaning a*
gainft the rock, and load them with, flags and large
leaves of trees, refembling a thatch-.
Dec. 10. No fooner did I think my habitation fi>
nifhed, but fuddenly a g/eat deal of the top broke in,
fo that it was a mercy, I was not buried in-the ruins.
This occafioned a- great deal of pains and trouble to
me, before I could make it firm and durable.
Dec. 17. 1 nailed up fome fhelves and drove nails
and Itaples in die wall, and pofts to hang things out
of the way-
Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then-
made a fort of a drefler, and another table.
Dec. 24, 2<;.. Rain in abundance.
Dec. 26. Very fair weather.
Dec. 27. I chanced to-light on fome goats, fhot one,
wounded another. I led it home in a ftring, bound
up his leg, and cured it in a little time; at length, it
became fo tame and familiar as to feed before the
door, and follow me where I pleafed. This put me
in mind to bring up tame creatures, in order to fup-
ply me with foad after iny ammunition was fpent.
Dec.
Dec. 28,29, 30. The weather being exceffive Tiot,
Vith, little air, obliged me, for the moft part, to keej?>
vrithin doors.
Jan. i. Still fnltry. However, obliged by necef-
fity, I. went out with my gun, and found a great flore
Of goats in the valleys; they were exceedingly fhy,.
nor could my dog hunt them down.
Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time was to
finifh the wall before defcribed, and fearch the ifland,
I difcovered a kind of pigeons like our houfe-pigeons
in a neft among the rocks. I brought them home*
Hurfed them till they could fly, and then.they left me.
After this, I fhot foine, which proved excellent food;
Some time I fpent vainly in contriving to make a
caftc; I may well fay it was vain, becaufe I could
neither join the ftaves, or fix the heads, {<\as to make
it tight: So, leaving that, I took fome goats tallow
I had by me, and a little okum for the wick, and-
provided myfelf with a lamp, which ferved me in<-
ftead of candles.
But now a very ftrange event happened. For be-
ing in the height of my fearch, what fhould come in*
to my hand, but a bag, which wa& ufed to hold corn
(as I fuppofed) for the fowls: fo immediately refol-
ving to put gunpowder in it,, I fhook all the. hufks
and dirt upon one fide of the rock, little expecting
what the confequenee would be. The rain had fal-
len plentifully a few days before ;and, about a month
after, to my great amazement, fomething began to
look out very green and fiourifhing: and when I
came to view it more nicely, every day as it grew,
I found about ten,or twelve ears of green barley ap-
peared in the very fame fhape and make as that in
•England. \
I can fcarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at
this fight> Hitherto I had looked upon the actions
of this life no otherwife than only as th$ events of
blind chance and fortune. But now, the appear-
ance of this barley, ftourifiiing in a barren foil, and
my.
tny ignorance in not conceiving how it fhould come
there, made me conclude, that miracles -wcre net yd
ceafed: nay, I even thought that God had appointed
-it to grow there without any feed, purely for my
fuftenance in this miferable and defolate ifland. , And
indeed fuch great effect this had upon me, that it of-
•ten made me melt into tears, through a grateful
fcnfe of God's mercies; and the greater flill was my
thankfulnefs, when I perceived about this little field
of barley, fome rice ftalks, alfo wonderfully flourifh-»
ing.
While thus pleafed in mind, I concluded there
muft be more corn in the ifland; and therefore made
a diligent fearoh narrowly among the rocks: but not
being able to find any, on a fudden it came into my
jnind, how I had fhaken the hufks of corn out of the;
bag, and then, my admiration ceafed, with my grati-
tude to the divine Being, as thinking it was but natu-
ral, and not to be conceived a miracle; tho' even the
manner of its prefervation mig^ have made me own
it as a wonderful event of Goiijf kind providence.
It was about the latter endof June when the ears
:of this corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully,
together with zo or 30 ftalks of rice, expelling one
Jay 1 fhould reap the fruit .of my labour; yet four
•years were expired before*! could allow myfelf to eat
any barley bread, and much longer time before! ha«J
iuiy rice. After this, with indefatigable pains and
induftry for three or four months, at laft I finifhed
•my wall on the I4th of April, having no way to go
into it, but by a ladder againft the wall.
April 16. I finifhed my ladder, and.afcended it;
afterwards pulled it up, then let it down on the other
fide, and defcended into my new habitation, where I
.had fpace enough, and ib fortified, that .nothing could
attack me, without fcaling the wails, v • „
But what does all human pains and iaduftry avail,
if thj£ beffing of God do .not crown our iabours? Or,
who can ftand before the Almighty, when he ftreteh-
eth forth his arm? For erne time, as I was at the en-
trance of my cave, there happened fuch a dreadful
earthquake, that not only the roof of the cave came
tumbling about my ears, but the pofts feemed to crack
terribly at the fame time. This put me in great a-
mazement; and running to the ladder, and .getting
over the wall, I then plainly knew it was an earth-
quake, the place I ftood on fuftaining three terrible
(hocks in lefs than three minutes. But judge of my
terror when I faw the top of a great rock roll into the
fea ; I then expe£ted the ifland would be fwallowed
up every moment: And what made the fcene flill
more dreadful, was to fee the fea thrown into the moft
violent agitations and diforders by this tremendous ac-
cident.
For my part, I ftood like a criminal at the place of
execution, ready to expire. At the moving of the
earth, I was, as it were, fea-fick; and very much a-
fraid left the rock, under which was my fence and
habitation, fhould overwhelm me and it in a lafling
tomb.
When the third dreadful fhock had fpent itfelf, my
fpirits began to revive; yet flill I would not venture
to afcend the ladder, but continued fitting, not know-
ing what I fnould do. So little grace had I then, as
only to fay, Lord have mercy upon me! and no fooner
•was the earthquake over, but that pathetic prayer left
me.
It was not long after, when a horrible tempeft a-
rofe, at the fame time attended with a hurricane of
wind. The fea feemed mountains high, and the
waves rolled fo impetuoufiy, that nothing could be
perceived but froth and foam. Three hours did this
ftorm continue, and in fo violent a manner, as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was fucceeded
by abundance of rain. "When the tempeft was over,
I went to my tent; but the rain coming on in a fu-
jtlous manner, I was obliged to take fhelter in the
cave,
cave, where I was forced to cut a channel through
my fortification to let the water out. It continued
raining all that night, and fometime the next day.
Thefe accidents made me refolve, as foon as the wea-
ther cleared up, to build me a little hnt in fome open
place, walled round to defend me from wild crea-
tures and favages; not doubting but, at the next
earthquake, the mountain would fall upon my habita-
tion and me, and fwallow up all in its bowels.
April 16,—20. Thefe days I fpent in contriving
how and in what manner I mould fix my place of a-
bode. All this while I was under the moft dreadful
apprehenfions. When I looked round my habitation,
every thing I found in its proper place. I had feveral
refolutions whether I fhould move or not: but- at
length I refolved to ftay where I was, till I found out
a convenient place where I might pitch my tent.
April 22. When I began to put my refolutions in
practice, I was ftopt for want of tools and inftru-
ments to work with. Moft of my axes and hatchets
were ufelefs, occafioned by cutting the hard timber
that grew on the ifland. It took me up a full week
to make my grindftone of ufe to me; and at laft I
found out a way to turn it about with my foot, by
help of a wheel and a firing.
April 28, 29. Thefe days were fpent in grinding
my tools.
April 30. My bread falling fhort, I allowed myfelf
but one bifcuit a day.
May i. As I walked along the fea-fhore, I found
a barrel of gunpowder, and feveral pieces of the
wreck, which the fea had flung up. Having fecured'
thofe^ I made to the fhip, \vhofe ftern was torn off,
and wamed a great diftance afhore 5 but the reft lay
in the fands. This I fuppofe was occafioned by the
earthquake. I now refolved to keep my old place of
abode: and alfo to go to the fhip that day, but then
found it jmpoffible.
D . Ma
May 3. This day I went on board, and with my
f;iw fnwed off one of the beams, wKlch kept her quar-
ter deck. I then cleared the fand till flood.
May 4. I caught fome fifh, but they were not
•wholefome. The fame day I alfo catched a young
dolphin.
May y. This day I alfo repaired to the wreck, and
tuved another piece of timber; and when the flood
came, I made a float of three great planks, which
were driven afhore by the tide.
May 6, 7, 8, 9. Thefe days I brought off the iron
bolts, opened the deck" with the iron crow, and car-
ried two planks to land, having made a way into the
very middle of the wreck.
May 10, IT, 12, 13, 14. All this time I fpent in
. bringing off great quantities of iron and timber.
May 15. Took with me two hatchets on purpofe to
cut off fome lead of the roll, but all in vain, for it lay
too low under water. *
• May 16. I omitted going to the wreck this day;
for employing myfelf in looking for pigeons, I out-
ftaid my time. > •„"
'May 17. I perceived feveral pieces of the wreck
blown afliore, which I found belonged to the head of
the fliip.
- May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck, and
with great difficulty loofened fome things fo much
with the crow, that at the firft blowing tide feveral
cafks floated out, and many of the feamens chefts;
yet that day nothing came to land but pieces of tim-
ber, and a hogfhead which had fome Brazil pork in
it. I continued working to the 15th of June; (ex-
cept neceflary times for food and reft) and had I
known how to have built a boat, I had timber and
planks enough: I had alib near 100 weight of fheet-
lead.
June 16. As I was wandering towards the fea fide,
I found a large tortoife or turtle, being the firft I had
feen
feen on the ifland, though, as I afterwards found,.
there were many on the other fide of it.
June 17. This day I fpent in cooking it, found in
her threefcore eggs, and her flefh the moft favory
and pleafant I ever fafted in my life.
June 18. I flaid, within this day, there being a con-
tinual rain; and it was fotnething more cliiMy and
cold than ufual.
June 19. Exceeding bad, taken with a trembling
and fhivering,
June 20. Awake all night, my head raeked with
pain, and feverifh.
June 21. Sick unto death, and terrified with the
difmal apprehenfions of my condition. Prayed to
God more frequently, but very confufedly.
June 22. Something better, but Hill uneafy in my
mind.
June 23. Again relapfed much as before. ,
June 24. Mended a iecond time.
June 25. A violent ague for feven hours, cold and
hot fits, fucceeded with faint fwer.ts.
June 26. Better, but very weak; yet I fcramblecl
out, fhot a fhe goat, brought it home, and broiled
fome of it: I would willingly have ftevve'd it, and
made foine broth, but had no pot.
June 27. All this day I was afflictei with an ague ^
thirfty, yet could not help myfelf to water : 'Prayed
fb God in thefe words; Lord, in pity, lo-jk upon me:
Lord have mercy upon me; have mercy upon me! Af-
ter this I fell afleep, which I found had much refrefh-
ed me when I awaked. I fell afleep a fecond time, and
fell into this ftrange and terrible fort of dream.
Methought I was fitting on the fame fpot of ground
at the outfide of the wall where I fat when the flomi
blew after the earthquake; and that I faw a man de-
fcending from a great black cloud, and light upon the
ground. He was all over as bright as a flafh of fire
that a little before furrounded him; his countenance
D 2 inconceivably
inconceivably terrible; the earth as it were trembled
•when he ftept upon the ground, and flames of fire
feemed to fill all the air. No fooner I thought him
landed upon the earth, but with a long fpear, or other
weapon, he made towards me; but firft afcending a
riGng ground, his voice added to my amazement, when
I thought 1 heard him pronounce thefe dreadful words,
Unhappy -wretch! feeing all thffe things have not
brought thee to repentance, thonjha/t immediately die,
In pronouncing this dreadful fentence, I thought he
went to kill me with the fpear that was in his hand.
Any body may think it impoffible for me to exprefs
the horrors of my mind at this vifion ; and even when
I awaked, this very dream made a deep impreffion up-
on my mind. The little divine knowledge I had, I
received from my father's imh'uclions, and that was
worn out by an uninterrupted feries of feafaring im-
piety for eight years fpace. Except what ficknefs
forced from me, I do not remember I had one thought
of lifting up my heart towards God; but rather had
a certain ftupidity of foul, not having the leaft fenfe
of fear of the omnipotent Being when in diftreis, nor
of gratitude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when
I was on the defperate expedition on the defert Afri-
can fliore, I cannot remember I had one thought of
what would become of me, or to beg his confolation
and affiftance in my fuflerings and diftreis. When
the Portugal captain took me up, and honourably ufed
me: nay, farther, when I was even delivered from
drowning by efcaping to this ifland, I never looked
upon it as a judgment, but only faid I was an unfor-
tunate dog, and that's all. Indeed, fome fecret tranf-
ports of foul 1 had, which was not through grace, but
only a common ffight of joy, that I was yet alive, when
my companions were all drowned, and no other joy
could I conceive but what is common with the failors
over a bowl of punch, after they have efcaped the
greateft dangers.
The
• The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor
conveniences, might have called upon me for a
thankful acknowledgment to Providence. Indeed,
the growth of my corn touched me with fome fenfe;
but that foon wore off again. The terrible earth-
quake pointed to me, as it were, the finger of God,
but my dreadful amazement continued no longer
than its. duration. But now, when my fpirits began
to fink under the burden of a ftrong .diftemper,
and I could leiforely view the miferk-s of death pre-
fent themfelves before my eyes, then my awakened
confcience began to reproach me with my p;;ft life, in
which I had fo wickedly provoked the juftice of God
to pour down his vengeance upon me.
Such reflections as thefe opprefTed me even in the
violence of my diftemper. Some prayers I uttered,
which only proceeded from my fear of death. But
when I confidered my father's advice and prophecy,
I could not forbear weeping; for, he told me, Tbnft
if I did perfijl in my folly, IJbould not only be deprived
of Cod's blejjing, but'have time enough to rcfitt upon
my defpifing his inftruElions, and this in a •wretched
time, -when none could help me. And now, concluding-
it to be fulfilled, having no foul in the ifland to aJ-
minifter any comfort to me, I prayed earneftly to the .
Lord, that he would help -me in this my great calami-
ty. And this, I think, w.as the firft time I prayed
in fincerity for many years. But now I muft-refura
to my journal.
June 28. Something reft'.(lied with fleep, amllTfe"
fit quite off, I got up. My dream frill occasioned in •
me a great confternaticn; and, fearing that tKe'agu«
might return the fuccceding day, I concluded it
~ time to get fomething to comfort me. I filled a cafe
bottle with wver, and fet it within the reach of rrfy
bed; a.nd, to make it more nourifhing and lefs chilly,
I put fome rum in it. The next thing I did was to
boil me a piece of goat fiefh, of which I ate but-lit-
. tie. I was very weak, however, walked about, dread-
D ~;j ing
ing the return of my diftemper; and at night I Tup-
ped on three of the turtle's eggs, which I roafted and
ate, begging God's bleffing therewith.
After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out
of doors with my gun; but was fo weak, that I fat
down, and looked at the fea, which was fmooth and
calm. While I continued here, thefe thoughts came
into my-mind.
In what manner is the production of the earth and
fea, of which I have feen fo much? From whence
came myfelf, and all other creatures living, and of
what are we made?
Our brings were afluredly created by fome almigh-
ty invifible power, who framed the earth, the fea, and
air, and all therein. But what is that power?
Certainly it muft follow, that God has created it
all. Yet, laid I, if God has made all this, he muft
be the ruler of them all, and what is relating there-
to; for certainly the power that makes, muft indif-
putably have a power to guide and direct them. And
if this be fo (as certainly it muft) nothing can hap-
pen without his knowledge or appointment. Then,
£urely, if nothing happens without God's appointment,
certainly God has appointed thefe my fufferings to
befal me. And here I fixed my firm belief, that it
was his will that it fhould be fo; and then proceeded
to inquire, why fhould God deal with me in this
manner? Or what I had done thus to deferve his in-
dignation,?
Here confcience flew in my face, reprehending me
as a blafphemer; crying, with a loud and piercing
voice, Unworthy -wretch! dare you aft -what you have
done? Loak upon your pajl life, and fee what you have
left undone? Afk thyfelf, why thou wert not long
ago in the mercilefs hands of de.*h? Why not
drowned in Yarmouth roads, or killed in the fight*
when the fhip was taken by the Sallee man of war?
"W by not entombed in the bowels of wild beafts on
the
the African Coaft, or drowned here when all thy com-
panions fuffered fhipwreck in the ocean?
Struck dumb with thefe reflections, I rofe up in a
penfive manner, being fo thoughtful that I could not
gotofleep; and fearing the dreadful return of my
diftemper, it caufed me to remember, that the Brazi-
lians ufe tobacco for almoft all difeafes. I then went
to' my cheft, in order to find fome, where heaven, no-
doubt, directed me to find a cure for both foul and
body; for there I found one of the bibles, which, till
this time/I had neither leifure nor inclination to look
into; I took both the tobacco and that out of the
cbeft, and laid them on the table. Several experi-
ments did I try with the tobacco: Firft, I took a
piece of leaf, and chewed it; but it being very green
and ftrong, almoft ftupified me. Next I fteeped it
in fome rum an hour or two, refolving when I went
to bed to take a dofe of it; and, in the third place, i
burnt fome over a pan of fire, holding my nofe over
it fo long as I could endure it without fuffbcation.
In the intervals of this operation, though my head
was giddy and difturbed at the tobacco, I took up
the bible to read. No fooner did I open it, but there-
appeared to me thefe words. Call on me in the day of
trouble, and 1111 ill deliver thee, and thou Jbalt glorify
me.
At firft this fentenee made a very deep impreffion
on my heart; but it foon wore off again, when I
eonfidered the word deliver was foreign to me. And
as the children of .Ifrael faid, when they were pro-
mifed flefh to eat, Can Cod fpread a table in the -wil-
dernefs? in like manner I began to fay, Can God
himfelf deliver me from this defolate iflaud? Howe-
ver, the words would ftiU return to my mind, and
afterwards made a greater impreffion upon me. As
it now was very late, and the tobacco had dozed my
head, I was inclined to fleep; but before I would lie
down, I fell on my knees, and implored the promife
that God had made to me in the holy fcriptures,,
that
that, if I called upon him in. the day of trouble, be
•woulddeliver me. With much difficulty I after drank
the rum, wherein I had fteeped the tobacco 5 which
flying into my head, threw me into fuch a profound
fleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before
I awaked; or rather, 1 btlieve, 1 flept two days, ha-
ving certainly loll a day in my account, and 1 could,
never tell any other way. "When I got up, my fpi-
rits were lively and cheerful; my ftomach much bet-
ter, being very-hungry; and, in short, no fit returned
the next day, which was the 2yth, but 1 found my-
felf much altered for the better.
The 3cth, I went abroad with my gun, but not
far, and killed a fea-fow] or two, refembling a brand-
goofe, which, however, I cared not to eat when I
brought them home, but dined on two more of the
turtle's eggs. In the evening I renewed my medicine»
excepting that I did not take fo large a quantity,?
neither did I chew the leaf, or hold my head over the
fmoke: but next day, which was the ift of July, ha-
ving a little fpice of the cold fit, I again took my me-
. dicine as 1 did the firft time.
July 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In,
this condition, I often .thought of thefe words, 1-wiH
deliver thee; and while ajfome times I would think
of the impoffibility of .it, other thoughts would re-
prehend me, for difregardmg die detiverances I had
received, even from the moft forlorn and diftreffed
condition. I afked myfelf, what regard have I had to
God for his abundant mercies? Have I done my part?
He has delivered me, but 1 have not glorified him; — as
if I had faid, 1 had not owried and been thankful for
thefe as deliverances, and how could I expect greater?
So much did this fenfibly touch my heart, that I gave
God thanks for my recovery from ficknefs in the moll
humble proftration.
July 4. This morning I began ferioufly to ponder
on what is written in the New Teftament, refolving
to read a chapter every morning and night as long
"• as
I
as my thoughts would engage me. As foon as I fet
about this work ferioufly, I found my heart deeply af-.
fccted with the impiety of my paft life j thefe words
that I thought were fpoken to me in my dream revi-
ved, All thefe things have not brought tbee to repen-
tance. After thist I begged of God to affift me with
his Holy Spirit in returning to my duty. One day,
in periiling the fcriptures, 1 came to thefe words, He
it exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance,
and to give remiflidn; Immediately I laid down the
book, and, with uplifted hands to heaven, -loudly
cried, 0 bleJJed'Jefus, tbou fan of David, Jefus, than ex-
alted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance! And
now indeed I prayed with a true fenfe of my conditi-
on, and a more certain hope, founded on the word
of God. Now I had a different fenfe of thefe words,
Call on me, and I will deliver tbee, that is, from the
dreadful load of guilt, which oppreffed my finful
foul, and not from a folitary life, which might rather
be called a ble.Tmg, (feeing I wanted neither food
nor raiment), when compared with living among the
human race, furrounded with fo much oppreffion,
mifery, and affliction: In a word, I came to this con-
clufion, that a deliverance from fin was a much greater
bleffing than a deliverance from affliction. But again
I proceed to my journal.
To the 14th of July, I walked about with my gun,
little and little at a time, having been reduced to the
greateft extremity of vveaknefs. The applications
and experiments 1 ufed were perfectly new; neither
could 1 recommend them to any one's practice. For
though it carried off the fit, it very much weakened
me; and I had frequently convulfions in my nerves
and limbs for fome time. From hence I learned,
that going abroad in rainy weather, efpecially when
it was. attended with ftorms and hurricanes of wind,
was rnofl pernicious to health. I had now been a-
bove ten months in the ifland; and as 1 never had
feen any of ths human kind, 1 therefore accounted •
myfelf
myfelf as fole monarch; and as I grew better, having
fecured my habitation to my mind, I refolved to make
a tour round my kingdom, in order to make new dif-
coveries.
The I5th of July I began my journey. I firft went
to the creek, where I had brought my rafts on fhore;
and travelling farther, found the tide>went no higher
than two miles up, where there was a little brook of
running .water, on the bank of which were many plea-
fant favannas or meadows, plain, fmooth, and cover-
ed with grafs. On the rifing parts, where Iluppofcd -
the water did not reach, I perceived a great deal of
tobacco growing to a very ftrong ftalk. Several other
plants I likewife found, the virtues of which I did not
underftand. I fearched a long time for the Cafiava
root, which I knew the Indians in that climate made
their bread of; but all in vain. There were feveral
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what
they were; likewife I faw feveral fugar-canes, but
imperfect for want of cultivation. With thefe few
difcoveries I came back that night, and ifept content-
edly in my little caflle.
The next.day, being the i6th, going the fame way,
but farther than the day before, I found the country
more adorned with woods and trees. Here I percei-
ved different fruits in great abundance. Melons in
plentjr lay on the ground, and clufters of grapes, ripe
and very rich, fpread over the trees. You may ima-
gine I was glad of this difcovery, yet ate very fpa-
ringly, left I mould throw myfelf into a flux or fever.
The grapes I found of excellent ufe; for when I had
dried them in the fun, which prefefved them as dried
raifins are kept, they proved very wholefome and nou-
rifhing, and ferved me in thofe feafons when no grapes
•were to be had.
The night drawing on apace, I afcended up a tree,
and flept very comfortably, though it was the firft
time I had lain out of my habitation. And when the
morning came, I proceeded with great pleafure on
my
my way, travelling about four miles, as I imagined,
by the length of the valley, directing my courfe north
ward, there being a ridge of hills on the fouth and
north fide of me. At the end of this valley I came
to an opening, where the country feemed to defcend
to the weft; there I found a little fpring of frefh wa-
ter, proceeding out of the fide of a hill, with its cryftal
ftreams running directly eaft. And indeed here my
fttnfes were charmed with the moft beautiful landfcape
nature could afford: for the country appeared fo flou-
fifhing, greert, and delightful, that to me it feemed
like a planted garden. I then defcended on the fide
of that delicious vale, when I found abundance of co-
coa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but very wild
and barren at that time. As for the limes, they were
delightful and wholefome, the juice of which I after
ufed to mix in water, which made it very cool and re-
frefhing. And now I was refolved to carry home and
lay up a ftore of grapes, limes, and lemons, againft the
approaching wet feafon. So laying them up in fepa-
rated parcels, and then taking a few of each with me,
I returned to my little caftle, after having fpent three
days in this journey. Beforelgot home,the grapeswere
fo bruifed that they were utterly fpoiled; the limes in-
deed were good, but of thefe I could bring only a few.
July 19. Having prepared two bags,.I returned
thither again; but, to my great furprife, found all the
grapes fpread about, trod to pieces, and abundance
eaten, which made me conclude there were wild
beafts thereabouts. To prevent this happening again,
I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and hung
them upon the out branches of the trees, both to.
keep them unhurt, and that they might cure and dry
in the fun: and having well loaded myfelf with limes
and lemons, I returned once more to my old place of
refidence.
And now contemplating on the fruitfulnefs of this
«alley, the pleafar.tnefs of its fituatjon, its fecurity
from
from florins, rind the delightfulnefs. of the adjacent
woods, I concluded I was fettled in the woift part of
the country, and therefore Was thinking to remove
my habitation. But when I confidered again, that
though it was pleafant, it was off from the fea-fide,
where there was a poffibility, fome time or other, a
fliip might either be driven or fail by"; and that to
inclofe myfelf among hills and woods muf t certainly
put an end to my hopes of deliverance; I refolved to
let my caftle remain where Providence had firft af-
figned it. Yet fo ravifhed was I with this place, that
I made me a little kind of bower, furrounding it with
a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well ftaked,
and filled with butrufhes; and having fpent a great
part of the month of July, I think it was the firft of
Auguft before I began to enjoy my labour.
Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took
them from the trees, and they proved excellent good
raifins of the fun: the moft of which I carried to my
cave'; and happy for me I did fo, by which I faved
the beft part of my winter food.
Aug. 14. This day it began to rain; and though I
had made me a tent like the other, yet having no fhel-
ter of a hill to keep me from ftorms, nor a cave behind
me to,retreat to, I was obliged to return to my old ca-
ftle. The rain continued more or lefs every day, till
the middle of October; and fometimes fo violently,
that I could not ftir out of my cave for feveral days.
This feafon I found.my family to increafe; for one
of my cats that ran away from me, and who I thought
had been dead, returned about Auguft, with three
kittens at her heels, like herfeif; which I thought
firange, becaufe both my cats were females, and the
wild cats of the ifland feemed to be of a different kind
from our European cats; but from thefe cats proceed-
ed fuch numbers, that I was forced to kill and deftroy
them as I would do wild beafts or vermin.
To the 26th of this month, I could not ftir out,-it
raining
raining incefiantly; when beginning to want food,
I was compelled to venture twice, the firft of which I
fhot a goat, and afterwards found a very large tor-
toife. The manner of my regulating my food was
thus: A bunch of raifins ferved me for breakfaft; a
piece of goat's flefh or turtle broiled for my dinner,
and two or three turtle eggs for my fupper. While
the rain lafted, I daily worked two or three hours at
enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on to-
wards one fide, till 1 came to the outfide of the hill,
and made a door or way out, which came beyond my
fence or wall, and fo I came in and out this way.
But after I had done this, I was troubled to fee my-
felf thus expofed; though I could not perceive any
thing to fear, a goat being the biggeft creature I had
feen upon this ifland.
Sept. 30. Cafting up my notches on my poft, which
amounted to 365, I concluded tins to he the anniver-
fary of ivy landing; and, therefore, humbly proftra-
ting myfelf on the ground, confeffing my fins, ac-
knowledging God's righteous judgments upon me,
and praying to Jefus Chrift to have mercy upon me, I
fafted for twelve hours till the-going down of the fun;
and then eating a bifcuit and a bunch of grapes, laid
me on the bed, and with great comfort took my
night's repofe. Till this time i never had diflinguifh-
ed trTe Sabbath day; but now I made a longer notch
than ordinary for the days of reft, and divided the
weeks as well as I could, though 1 found I had loft a
day or two in my account. My ink failing foon af-
ter, 1 omitted in my daily memorandum things of an
indifferent nature, and contented myfelf to write
down ouly the moft remarkable events of my iffe.
The r,.iny and dry feaibns appeared now regular to
me, and experience taught me how to provide for
them; yet, in one thing i am going to relate, my ex-
perience very much failed me. You may call to
mind what I have mentioned of fome barley" and rice
which I had fared; about thirty ftalks of the former,
E' and
2nd twenty of the latter; and, at that time, the fun
being in its fouthern pofition, going from me, toge-
ther with the rains, made me conclude it a very pro-
per feafon to fow it. Accordingly I dug up a piece
of ground, with my wooden fpade, and dividing it in.
two parts, fowed about two-thirds of my feed, pre-
ferving by me about a handful of each. And happy
it was I did fo; for no rains falling, it was choked
up, and never appeared above the earth till the wet
feafon came again, and then part of it grew, as if it
had been newly fown.
I was refolved ftill to make another trial; and
feeking for a moifter piece of ground near my bower,
I there fowed the reft of my feed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox; which having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, yielded a
noble crop, and fprung up very pleafantly. I had ftill
faved part of the feed, not daring to venture all;
and by the time I found out the proper feafons to
fow in, and that I might expect every year two feed-
times and two harvefts, my ftock amounted to above
half a peck of each fort of grain.
No fooner were the rains over, but the ftakes
which I had cut from the trees, mot out like willows
the firft year after lopping their heads. I was igno-
rant of the tree I cut them from: but they grew fo
regularly beautiful, that they made a moft lively ap-
pearance, and fo flourimed in three years time, that
I refolved to cut more of them; and thefe foon
growing, made a glorious fence, as afterwards I fhall
obferve.
And now I perceived that the feafons of the year
might generally be divided, not into fummer and
•winter, as in Europe, but into wet and dry feafons, as
in this manner:
^" February, ~)

The wet feafons would continue longer or fhorter
as the winds happened to blow. But having found
the ill confequences of being abroad in the rain, I
took care beforehand to furnifh myfelf with provi-
Cons: and, during the wet months, fat within doors
as much as poffible. At this time I contrived to make
many things that I wanted, though it cofl me much
labour and pains, before I could accomplifh them.
The firfl I tried was to make a bafket; but all the
twigs I could get proved fo brittle, that I could not
then perform it. It now proved of great advantage
to me, that, when a boy, I took great delight ir>
flanding at a bafket maker's in the fame town where
my father lived, to view them at work; and, like o-
ther boys, curious to fee the manner of their work-
ing thefe things, and very officious to affifl, I perfect-
ly learned the method of it, and wanted nothing but
the tools. And it coming into my mind, that the
twigs of that tree of which I made my flakes, might
be as tough as fallow, willow, or ofiers, growing in
England, I refolved to make an experiment, and went
the next day to my country-feat, and found fome fit
for my turn; and after cutting down a quantity with
my hatchet, I dried them in my pale, and, when fit
to work with, canicd them to my cave, where I em-

ployed myfelf in making feveral forts of bafkets, ir»-
fomuch that I could put in whatfoever I pleafed. It
is true, they were not cleverly made, yet they ferved
my turn upon all occafions.
But ftill I wanted two neceflary things. I had no
cnfk to hold my liquor, except two rundlets almoft
full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary fize, and
fome fquare cafe bottles; neither had I a pot to boil
any thing in, only a large kettle, unfit to make broth,
or flew a bit of meat: 1 wanted likewife at the begin-
ning of this dry feafon a tobacco-pipe; but for this I
afterwards found an expedient.
I kept myfelf employed in planting my fecond row
cf ftakes. But remembering that when I travelled up
to the brook, I had a mind to fee the whole ifland, I
now refumed my intention, and taking my dog, gun,
hatchet, two bifcuit-cakes, a great bunch of raifins,
•with a larger quantity of powder and fhot than ufual,
I began my journey. Having pafled the vale where
my bower flood, I came within view of the fea lying
to the weft; when, it being a clear day, I fairly de-
fcried land, extending from the W. to the S. W. a- .
bout 10 or 15 leagues,, as I concluded; but could not
fay whether i: was an ifland or a continent. Neither
could I tell what this place might be 5 only thought it
was part of America, and where I might have been in
a miferable condition, had I landed. Again I conff-
dered, that if this was the Spanifh coaft, certainly,
one time or other, I fhould fee fome fhip pafs by; and
if it was not, the.n it muft be the Savage coaft, between
the Spanifh country and Brazil, which abounds with
cannibals or man-eaters.
As I proceeded forward, I found this fide of the
ifland much more pleafant than mine; the fields fra-
grant, adorned with fweet flowers and verdant grafs,
together with feveral very fine woods. There were
parrots in plenty, which made me long for one to be
my companion; but it was with, great difficulty I
could
could knock one down with-my ftick 5 and I kept him
at home fome years, before I could get him to call me
by my name.
In the low grounds I found various forts of hares
and foxes as I took them td be, but much different
from thofe in England. Several of thefe I killed, but
never ate them ; neither indeed had I any occafion;
For, abounding with goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes,
I could defy Leadenhall market to furnifh me a bet-
ter table. In this journey I did not travel above two
miles a day, becaufe I took feveral turns and wind-
ings, to fee what difcoveries I could make, returning
weary enough to the place where I defigned to reft all
night, which was either in a tree, or to.a place which
I furrounded with Rakes, that no wild creature might
fuddenly furprife me. When I came to the fea more,
I was amazed t,o fee the fplendor of it. Its ftrand
was covered with fhells of the moft beautiful fifh, and
conftantly abounding with innumerable turtles, and
fowls of many kinds, which I was ignorant of, except
thofe called Penguins. I might have mot as many
as I pleafed, but was fparingof my ammunition, ra-
ther chufing to kill a fhe-goat, which I did with
much difficulty, on account of the flatnefs of the
country.
Now, though this journey produced" the moft pie x-
fing fatisfaclion, yet my habitation was fo much to
my liking, that 1 did not repine at my being feated
on the worft part of the ifland. I continued my jour-
ney, travelling about twelve miles further towards the
eaft, where I fet a great pile on the fhore for a mark,
concluding that my next journey fhould bring me to
the other fide of the illand,. eaft from my caftlc, and
fo round till I came to my poft again. As I had a
conftant view of the country, I thought I could not
mifs my way; but fcarce had I travelled three miles,,
when I descended into a very large valley, fo fur-
rounded with hills covered with wood, that 1 having
no guide but by the fun, nor even then, unlefsl knew
£3' well.
well the pofition of the fun at that time of the day;
and, to add to my misfortune, the weather proving"
very hazy, I was obliged to return to my poll by the
fea fide, and fo backwards the fame way I came. In
this journey my dog furprifed a kid, and would have
killed it, had I not prevented him. As I had ofterr
been thinking of getting a kid or two, and fo raifing.
a breed of tame goats to fupply me after my ammu-
nition was fpent, I took this opportunity of begin-1
ning: and, having made a collar for this little crea-
ture, with a ftring made of rope-yarn, I brought it to
,ny bower, and there inclofed and left him; and, ha-
ving fpent a month in this journey, at length I re-
turned to my old habitation.
Nobody can doubt of my fatisfadtion, when I re-
turned to my -little caftle, and repofed myfelf in my
hammock. After my journey I refted myfelf a week,,
which time I employed in making a cage for my
pretty poll.' I now began to confiderof the poor kid
I had left at the bower, and I immediately went to-
fetch it home. When I came there, I found the young
creature almoft ftarved; I gave it fome food, and tied
it as before: but there was no occafion, for it follow-
ed me like a dog; and, as I conftantly fed it, it be-
came fo loving, gentle, and fond, that it commenced
one of my domeuics, and would never leave me.
The rainy feafon of the autumnal equinox being'
now come, I kept the 3cth of September in the moft
folemn manner, as ufual, it being the third year of
my abode in the ifland. I fpent the whole day in ac-
knowledging God's mercies, in giving him thanks
for making this folitary life as agreeable, and lefs fin*
ful, than that of human fociety 5 and for the com-
munications of his grace to my foul, in fupporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
providence, and hope for his eternal prefence in the
w^rld to come.
In.leed, I often did conCder how much more happy
I was
-1 was, in this ftate of life, than in that accurfed man1
ner of living I formerly ufed: and fometimes wheft
hunting, or viewing the country, the anguifh of my
foul would break out upon me, and my very heart
would fink within me, to think of the woods, the
mountains, the deferts I was in; and how I was a
prifoner locked up within the eternal bars and bolts
of the ocean, in an uninhabited wiMernefs, without
hopes, and without redemption: In this condition, I
would often wring my hands, and weep like a child:
And even fometimes in the middle of my work this
fit would take me; and then I would fit down and
figh, looking on the ground for an hour or two toge-
ther, till fuch time as my grief got vent in a flood of
tears. •
One morning, as I was fadly employed in this
manner, I opened my Bible, when immediately I
fixed my eyes upon thefe words, / -will never leave
thee, nor for fake thee! Surely, thought I, thefe
•words are directed to me; or elfe why fhould they
appear juft at a moment when I am bemoaning my
forlorn condition? and if God does not forfake me,
what matters it, finee he can make me more happy
i-n this ftate of life, than if I enjoyed the greateft
fplendor in the world? But while I was going to re-
turn God thanks for my prefcnt ftate, fomething
feemed to fhock my mind, as if' it had thus faid:
Unworthy wretch! can you pretend to be thankfuL
for a condition, from which you would pray to be
delivered! Here I ftopt; and though I could not
fay, I thanked the Divine Majefty for being there,
yet I gave God thanks for placing to my view my
fbrmer wicked courfe of life, and granting me a true
knowledge of repentance. And whenever I opened
or fhut the Bible, I blefled kind Providence, that di-
rected my good friend in England to fend it among
my goods without my order, and for affifting me to
lave it from the power of the raging ocean.
And now beginning my third year, my feveral
daily
daily employments were thefe: Firft, My duty to>
Heaven, and diligently reading the holy Scriptures,
which I did twice or thrice every day. Secondly*
Seeking provifion with my gun, which commonly
took me up, when it did not rain, three hours every
morning. Thirdly, The ordering, curing, prefer-
ving, and cooking what I had killed, or catched for
my fupply, which took me up a great part of the day:
for, in the middle of the day, the fun being in its
height, it was fo hot, that I could not ftirout; fb
that I had only but four hours in the evening to work
in: and then the want of tools, of affiftarrce, and flcill,
, wafted a great deal of time to little purpofe. I was
no lefs than two and forty days making a board fit
for a long fhelf, which two fawyers, with their tools
and £»w-pit, would have cut out of the fame tree in
half a day. It was of a large tree, as my board was
to be broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and
two more in lopping off the boughs, and reducing it
to a piece of timber. This I hacked and hewed off
each fide, till it became light to move; then I turned
it, made one fide of it fmooth and Hat as a board
from end to end, then turned it downward, cutting
the other fide, till I brought the plank to be about
three inches thick, and fmooth on both fides. A-
ny body may judge my great labour and fatigue in
fuch a piece of work; but this I went through with
patience, as alfo many other things that my circum-
llances made neceflary for me to do.
The harveft months, November and December,
were now at hand, in which I had the pleafing profpefit
of a very good crop. But here I met with a new mif-
fortune; for the goats and hares, having tafted of
the fweetnefs of the blade, kept it fo fhort, that it
had not ftrength to fhoot up into a flalk. To pre-
vent this, I inclofed it with a hedge, and by day fhot
fome of its devourers; and my dog, which I had
tied to the field-gate, keeping barking all nighr,
fo
•To frightened thefe creatures, that I got entirely rid
of them.
But, no fooner did I get rid of thefe, than other
enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks of feveral
forts of birds, who only waited till my back was
turned, to ruin me. So much did this provoke me,
that I let fly, and killed three of the malefactors;
and afterwards ferved them as they do notorious
thieves in England, hung them xip in chains as a
terror to others. And, indeed, fo good an effect had
this, that they not only forlook the corn, but all that
part of the ifland, fo long as thefe criminals hung
there.
My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of
December, which was my fecond harveft, I reaped it
with a fcythe, made of one of my broad fwords. t
had no fatigue in cutting down my firft crop, it was
fo flender. The ears I carried home in a baiket, rub-
bing it out with my hands, inftead of threfhing it;
end when my harveft was over, found my half pecfc
of feed produced near two bufhels of rice, and two
bufhcls and a half of barley, And now 1 plainly
forefaw, that, by God's goodnefs, I fhould fee fur-
nifhed with bread; but yet I was concerned, becaufe
I knew not how to grind or make meal of my corn,
nor bread, neither knew how to bake it. I >vould
not, however, tafte any of the crop, but reiblved to
preferve it againft next feafon, and, in the mean
while, ufe my beft endeavours to provide myfelfwitb,
other food.
But where were my labours to end? The want of
a plough to turn up the earth, or fhovel to dig it, I
conquered by making me a wooden fpade. The want
of a harrow I fupplied myfelf, with dragging over the
corn a great bough of a tree. When it was growing,
I was forced to fence it; when ripe, to mow it,
carry it. home, threfh it, part it from the chaff, and
fave it. And, after all, I wanted a mill to grind ir,
4Geve to drefs it, yeft and fait to make it into bread,
and
and an oven to bake it. This fet my brains on \vork
to find fome expedient for every one of thefe necefla-
ries againft the next harveft.
And now having more feed, my firft care was to
prepare me more land. I pitched upon two large flat
pieces of ground near my caflle, for that purpofe, in
which I fowed my feed, and fenced it with a good
hedge. This took me up three months; by which
time the wet feafon coming on, and the rain keeping
me within doors, I found fcveral occafions to employ
myfelf; and, while at work, ufed to divert myfelf
with talking to my parrot, learning him to know and
fpeak his own name Poll, the firft welcome word I
ever heard fpoke in the ifland. I had been a long
time contriving how to make earthen veflels, which
I wanted extremely; and, when I confulered the
heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could
find any fuch clay, I might botch up a pot, ftrong
enough, whendriG>l in the fun, to bear handling, and
to hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal, and
other things.
To be fhort, the clay I found ; but it would occa-
fion the moft ferious perfon to fmile, to fee what awk- .
ward ways I took, and what ugly mifhapen things I
made; how many either fell out or cracked by ths
violent heat of the fun, and fell in pieces when they
were removed; fo that I think it was two months
time before I could perfect any thing: and even then
but two clumfy things, in imitation of earthen jars.
Thefe, however, I very gently placed in wicker baf-
kets, made on purpofe for them, and between the
pot and the bafkets, fluffed it full of rice and barley
ftraw: and thefe, I prefumed, would hold my dried
corn, and perhaps the meal, when the corn was brui-
fed. As for the fmaller things, I made them with
better fuccefs; fuch as little round pots, flat difhes,
pitchers, and pipkins, the fun baking them very
hard.
Yet ftill I wanted one thing abfolutely neceflary,
and
and that was an earthen pot, not only to hold my li-
quid, but alfo to bear the fire, which none of thefe
could do. It once happened, that as I was putting
out my fire, I found therein a broken piece of one of
my vefl'els burnt hard as a rock, and red as a tile.
This made me think of burning fome pots; and ha-
ving no notion of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead,
I fixed three large pipkins, and two or three pots in a
pile one upon another. The fire I piled round the
outfide, and dry wood on the top, till I faw the pots
in the infide red-hot, and found that they did not
crack at all; and when I perceived them perfectly red,
I let one of them fland in the fire about five or fix
hours, till the clay melted by the extremity of the
heat, and would have run to glafs, had I fuffered it;
upon which I flacked my fire by degrees, till the red-
nefs abated; and watching them till the morning, I
found I had three very good pipkins, and two earthen
pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn as I could de-
fire.
No joy could be greater than mine at this difcove-
ry. For after this, I may fay, I wanted for no -fort
of earthen ware. I filled one of my pipkins with wa-
ter to boil me fome meat, which it did admirably well,
and with a piece of kid I made me fome good broth,
as well as my circumftances would afford me at that
time.
The next concern I had was to get me a ftone-mor-
tar to beat fome corn in, inftead of a mill to grind it.
Here indeed I was at a great lofs, as not being fit for
a ftone cutter ; "and many days I fpent to find out a
great ftone big enough to cut hollow and make fit for
a mortar, and ftrong enough to bear the weight of a
peftil, that would break the corn without filling it
with fand. But all the ftones of the ifland being of
a mouldering nature, rendered my fearch fruitlefs;
and then I refolved to look out a great block of hard
wood; which having foon found, I formed it with my
axe and hammer, and then with infinite labour made
a
a hollow in it, jufl as the Indians of Brazil make their
canoes. When I had finifhed this, I made a great
peftil of iron wood, and then laid them up againft my
fucceeding harveft.
My next bufinefs was to make me a fieve, to fift
my meal, and part it from the bran and hufk. Having
no fine thin canvafs to fearch the meal through, I
could not tell what to do. What linen I had was
reduced to rags: I had goats hair enough, but nei-
ther tools to work it, nor did I know how to fpin it:
At length I remembered I had fome neckcloths of
callicoe or muflin of the failors, which I had brought
out of the fhip, and with thefe I made three fmall
Ceves, proper enough for the work.
I come now to confider the baking part. The
want of an oven I fupplied by making fome earthen
pans very broad, but not deep. When I had, a-mind
to bake, I made a great fire upon my hearth, the tiles,
of which I had made myielf j and when the wood was
burnt into live-coals, I fpread them over it, till it be-
came very hot; then fweeping them away, I fet down
my loaves, and whelming down the earthen pots \ipon
them, drew the afhes and coals all around the outfide
of the pots to continue the heat; and in this manner I
baked my barley-loaves, as well as if I had been a .
complete paftry cook, and alfo made of the rice feve-
ral cakes and puddings.
It is no wonder, that all thefe things took me up
the beft part of a year, fince what intermediate time
I had was beftowed in managing my new harveft
and hufbamiry; for in the proper feafon I reaped my
corn, carried it home, and laid it up in the ear in my
large bafkets, till I had time to rub, inftead of
threfhing it. And now indeed my corn increafed fo
much, that it produced me about twenty bufhels of
barley, and as much of rice, that I not only began
to ufe it freely, but was thinking how to enlarge
my
rhvy barns, and refolded to fow as much at a rime as
• would be fufEcient for me for a whole year.
All this while, the profpecT: of land, which I had
feen from the other fide of the ifland, ran in my
mind. 'I ftill meditated a deliverance from this*
.-.place, though the fear of greater misfortunes might
have deterred me from it. For allowing that I had
attained that place, I run the hazard of being killed
j and eaten by the devouring cannibals; and if they
•were not fo, yet I might be flain, as other Euro-
ipeans had been, who fell into their hands. Not-
withftanding all this, my thoughts ran continually
.'upon that more. I now wifhed for my boy Xufy,
;and the long boat, with the fhoulder of mutton farl:
?! went to the fhip's boat, that had been caft a great
~way on the more in the late ftorm. She was remo-
•ved but a little; but her bottom being turned up by
•the impetuofity and fury qf the waves and wind, I
fell to work with all the firength I had, and with le-
vers andx rollers I had cut from the wood, to turn
•her, and repair the damages fhe had fuftained. This
work took me up three or four weeks, when finding
my little ftrength all in vain, I fell to undermining
it by digging away the fand, and fo to make it fall
down, fetting pieces of wood to thruft and guide it
:in the fall. Put after this was done, I was itill un-
able to ftir it up, or to get under it, much lefs to
move it forwards towards the water, and fo I was for-
'ced to give it over.
This difappointment, however, did not frighten me.
I began to think, whether it was not poffible for me
to make a canoe or Perigua, fuch as the Indians
make of the trunk of a tree. But here I lay under par-
ticular inconveniencies; want of tools to make it,
and want of hands to move it in the water when it
was made. However, to work I went upon it,
flopping all the enquiries I could make, with this
•very fimple anfwer I made to myfelf, Let's firft make
F ir,
it, I'll warrant I'll find fome way or other to get it
along when it is done.
I firft cut down a ,cedar-tree, which was five feet
.. .ten inches diameter at the lower part next .the flump,
and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty two feet, after which it leflened for a fpace,
and then parted into branches. Twenty days was I
a hacking and hewing this tree at the bottom, four-
teen more in cutting off the branches and-limbs, and
a whole month in fhaping it like the bottom of a
boat. As for the infide, I was three weeks with a
mallet and ch^flel, clearing it in fuch a manner, as
that it was big enough to carry 26 men, much big-
ger than any canoe I ever faw in my life, and confe-
.quently fiifficient to tranfport me and all my effe6ls
.to that wifhed-fpr fhore I fo ardently defired.
Nothing remained now, 'but, indeed, the greateft
.difficulty,' to get it into the water, it lying about 100
.yards from it. To remedy the firft inconvenience,
which was a rifing hill between this boat and the
creek, with wonderful pains and labour I dug imp
the.furface of the earth, and made a declivity. But
•when this was done, all the ftrength >I had was as in-
fufficient to move it, as it was when I attempted to
move the boat. I then proceeded to meafure the di-
ftance of ground, refolving to make a canal, in or-
der to bring the water to the canoe, fmce I could not
bring the canoe to the water. But as this feemed
to be impracticable to myfelf alone, under the fpace
of eleven or twelve years, it brought me into fome
fort of confideration: fo that 'I concluded this alfp
to be impoffible, and the attempt altogether vain. J
now faw, and not before, wtiat ftupidity it is to be-
gin work before we reckon its cofts, or judge right-
ly our own abilities to go through with its perform-
ance.
In the height of this work, my fourth year e,xpi-
fed, from the time I was caft on this ifland. 'At
this time I did not forget my anniversary; but kept
Jt
It with rather greater devotion than before. For now
my hopes being fruftrated, I looked upon this world
as a thing I had nothing to do with j and very well
might I fay, as father Abraham faid unto Dives, Be-
tween me and th:e there is a gulf fixed. And indeed
I was feparated from its wickednefs too, having nei-
ther the luft of the flefh, the lufl of the eye, nor the"
pride of life; I had nothing to covet, being lord, king,
and emperor over the whole country I had in poffef-
fibn, without difputc, and without controul: I had'
loadings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abun-
dance, and grapes above meafure. What was air the'
reft to me? The money I had'lay by me as defpica-
ble drofs, which I would freely have given for a grofs
of tobacco pipes, or a hand-mill to grind my corn:'
In a word, the nature and experience of thefe things,
dictated to me this jufl reflection, That the good
things of this world are no farther good to us, than
they are for cur ufe ; and-that whatever we may heap
to .give others* we can but enjoy as much as we
, and no1 more:
Thefe thoughts rerldered my mind more eafy than'
ufu'il. Every time I fat down to meat, I did it with'
thankiulnefs, admiring the providential hand of God,
who, in this vvildernefs, had fpread a table to me. And
now I confidered what F enjoyed, rather than what
I wanted; compared my prefent condition with what
I at firft expected it fhould be; how I fhould have'
done, if I had got nothing out of the fhip; that I
muft have perifhed before I had caught fim or tur-
tles; or lived, had I found them, like a mere fa-
vage, by eating them raw, and pulling them in pie--
ces with my claws, like a beaft. I' next compared'
my ftation to that which I deferved; how undutiful'
I had been to my parents; how deftitute of the fear"
of God; how void of every thing that was good;.
and how ungrateful for thofe abundant mercies I had.
jseceived from heaven, being fed, as it were, by v
. JT i- miracle^.
up t
ufe,
miracle, even as great as Elijah's being fed by ravens j:,
and caft on a place where there were no venemous >'
creatures to poifon or devour me; in fhort, making:
God's tender mercies matter of great confolation, I
relinquiOied all fadnefs, and gave way to content-
ment.
As long as my ink continued, which with water I;
made laft as long as I could, I ufed to minute down
the days of the month, on which any remarkable thing;
happened. And,
Firft, I obferved, that the fame day I forfook my
parents and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to fea,the fame day afterwards^ in the next year,/
I was taken and made a flave by the Sallee rovers:
That the very day I efcaped out of the wreck of;
the fhip in Yarmouth roads, a year after, on the fame -
day, I made my efcape from Sallee in my patron's'
fifhing-boat:
And, that orr the joth of September, being the dayv
of the year I was born on, on that day twenty-fix years -
after, was I miraculoufly faved, and caft afhore on.':
this ifland:
The nex,t thing that wafted after my ink, was the'
bifcuit which I had brought out of the fhip: and,
though 1 allowed myfelf but one cake a day for above'-
a twelvemonth, yet I was quite out of bread for near
a year, before I got any corn of my own.
In the nest place, my clothes began to decay, and -
my linen had been gone long before. However, I>.
had preferved about three dozen of the'failors che-
quered sbirrs,* which proved a great refrefhment to;
me, when the violent beams of the fun would not
fuffer me to bear any of the feamens heavy watch-
coats'; which made me turn tailor, and, after a mi-
ferable botching .manner, convert them to jackets.
To preferve my head, I made me a cap of goat-
fkins, with the hair outwards to keep out the rain;
•which indeed ferved me fo well, that afterwards -I-
made
•Blade me a waiftcoat and open-kneed breeches of the
fame: And then I contrived a fort of an umbrella,
covering it with fkins, which not only kept out the
heat of the fun, but the rain alfo. Thus being eafy
and fettled in-my mind, my chiefeft happinefs was to
converfe with God, in moft heavenly and comfortable;
.ejaculations.
For five years after this I cannot fay any extraordi--
nary thing, occurred to me. My chief employment
•was to cure my raifins, and plant my barley and rice,>
of both which 1 had a year's provifion before-hand.
But though I was difappointed in my firfl canoe, I'
made it, at intermediate times, my bufinefs to make'
a fecond, of much inferior fize j and it was two years-
Before I finifhed it. But as I perceived it would no-
wife anfwer my defign-of failing to the other fhore,
my thoughts were confined to take a tour round the
ifland, to fee what further difcoveries I could make.
T-o this intent,.after having moved her to the water,,
and tried how fhe would fail, I fitted up a little mail-
to my boat, and made a fail of the fhip's fail that lay
ty me. I then- made lockers or boxes at the end of:

"which would preferve 'them dry either from rain, orr
the fpray of the fea -r and in. the infide of the boar, II
cut me a long hollow place to lay my gun, and to keep
it dry made a flag to hang over it,. My umbrella J'
-fixed in a flcp in the ftern, like a' maft, to keep the-
heat of the fun'off me.- And now refolving to fee the.
circumference of my little kingdomj I victualled my
fhip for the voyage, putting.in two dozen of my bar--
ley-bread loaves,, an earthen pot full of parched rice, a"
little bottle of rum, half a goat, powder and fhot, and:
two watch-coats. It was the 6th of November, in
.the fixth y,ear of my. reign, or captivity, that I fet.
.out on this voyage; which was much longer than L
expe£led, being obliged to put farther out, by reafon
*pf.,the rock's that lay a great way-in the fea. And in-
-E , <kcd-
deed fo much did thefe rocks furprife me, that
for putting back, fearing that if I ventured fafther,_it-
vvould be out of my power to return: In tins uncer*
tainty I came to'an anchor jufl off fhore, to which I
waded with my gun on my fhoulder, and then climb-
ing up a hill, which overlooked that point, I faw the
full extent of it, and fo I refolved to run 'all hazards.
In this profpect from the hill, I perceived a violent
current running to the eaft, coming very clofe to the
point; which 1 the more carefully obferved, thinking
it dangerous, and that when I came to it, I might be •
drove into the fea by its force, and not able to return,
to the ifhnd; and certainly it muft have been fo, had:
I not made this obfervation; for on the other fide was
the like current, with this difference, that it fet off at
a greater diftance; and I perceived there was a ftrong
eddy under the land; fo that my chief bufinefs was to
work out of the firft current, and conveniently get in-
to the eddy. Two days-I ftaid here, the wind blow--
ing very brifkly E. S. E. which being contrary to the •
current, leaves a great breach of the fea upon the
point; fo it was neither fit for me to keep too near the
fhore, on account of the breach; nor ftand at too great.
a diftance, for fear of the ftreams,. That night the
•wind abating, it grew fo calm, that I ventured out;,
and here I may be a monument to all rafh and igno-;
rant pilots: For I was no fooner come to the point, and1
not a~bove the boat's length from fhore, but 1 was got
Into a deep water, with a current like a mill, which*;
drove my boat along fo violently, that it was impoffible
for me to keep her near the edge of it, but forced me •
more and more out from the eddy to theleft of me; and:
all I could do with my padlers was ufelefs, there being
no wind to help me.
Now I began to look upon myfelf as quite loft,,
fmce, as the current ran on both fides of the ifland, 1\
was very certain they muft join again, and then I had
pa
* * 1 1
3W hopes but of perifhing for want in the fea, after:
•what provifion I had was fpent, or before, if a ftorm,
fbould happen to arife.
Who can conceive the prefent anguifh of my mind i
nt this calamity? With longing eyes did I look up-
on my little kingdom, and thought the ifland the
pleafantelt place in the univerfe. Happy, thrice hap-
py defert, faid I, fliall I- never fee thee more?
"Wretched creature ! whithtr nm I going? Why did •
I murmur at my lonefome condition, when now li
•would give the whole world to . be thither again?
"While I was thus'complaining, I found myfclf to
be driven about two leagues into the fea ; .however, ti
fraboured till my ftrength was far fpent,,to keep my
boat as far north as poffibly I could, to that fide of
the current where the, eddy lay on.. About noon li
perceived a little breeze of wind fpring up from the
S. S. E. which' overjoyed my heart; and I was ftill
rnore elated, when, in about half an hour, it blew i.
fentle fine galev Had any thick weather fprung up,
:had been loft another way: for having, no compafs
on board, .1 fhould never have found the way to fteer
towards the ifland, if once it had difappeared; but it
proving the contrary, . I-fet up my maft again, fpread
my fail, and ftood away northward, as much as I
could, to get rid of the current. Ami no fooner did
the boat begin to ftretch away, but 1 perceived, by
the clearnefs of the water, a change of the current
•was near; for, where it was ftrong, the water was
foul; and, where it was clear, the current abated.
To the eaft I foon law, about half a mile, a breach
of the fea upon fome rocks, which caufed it again to
feparate; and as the main force of it drove away
;rnore fouthwardly, leaving the rocks to the north-
eaft, fo the other came back by the repulfe of the
rocks, making a fharp eddy, which returned back a-
gain to the north-well with a very fwift ftream.
They who have experienced what it is to be re-
prieved upon the ladder, or to be faved from thieves,
juft
juft going to take away their lives, or fuch as nars;
been in the like calamities with my own, may guefs-
my prefent excefs of joy, how heartily 1 run my boat,
into the ftream of this eddy, and how. joyfully E
fpread my fail to the refrefhing wind, flanding cheer-
fully before it, with a fmart tide under foot. By the.
uffiftance of this eddy, I was carried above a league'
home again, when, being in the wake of the ifl-and,.
betwixt the two currents, I found the water to be in*
a fort of a fland. About four o'clock in the afternoon^
I reached within a league of the ifland,.and perceived*
the points of the rock, which caufed this difafter,:
ftretching out, as I obferved before,.to the fouthward^
which, throwing off the current more fouthwardly,>
had occafioned another eddy to the north. But ha
•ving a fair brifk gale, I ftretched acrofs this edxly, and'
in an hour came within a mile of the more,- where I:
foon landed, to my unfpeakable comfort; and after an
humble proftration, thanking God for my deliverance,,
•with a refolution to lay all thoughts of efcaping afide,-
I brought my boat fafe to a little cove, and laid me'
down to take a welcome repofe. When I awoke, p
•was confidering how 1 might get my boat home; and;
coafting along the fhore, I came to a good bay, which.'
ran up to a rivulet or brook, where, finding a fafe
harbour, I ftowed her as fafe as if fhe hail been in ai
dry .dock made on purpofe for her.
I now perceived myfe-lf not far from the place-'
•where before 1 had travelled on foot; fo taking no.
thing with me, except my g.un and umbrella, I begaiji
my journey, and in the evening came to my bower,.
•where I again laid me down to reft. I had not flepf
long before I was awakened in great-furp.rife, by a
•ftrange voice that called me feveral times, Robiit^.
Robin, Robin Cnifoe, poor Robin! Where are you, Ra*
JiinCtuJoe? -where are you? -where have you been?
So faft was I afleep at firft, that I did not awake
but half afleep and half awake, £
though^-
thought I dreamed that fomebody fpoke to me. But,
as the voice repeated Robin/on Crufoe feveral times,
being terribly affrighted, I ftarted up, in the utmoft •
confufion; and, no fooner were my eyes fully open,
but I beheld my pretty Poll fitting on the top of the
hedge, and foon knew that it was he that calkd me;
for juft in fuch bewailing language I ufed to talk and
teach him; which he fo exactly learned, that he would'
fit upon my finger, and lay his bill clofe to my face,>
and cry, Poor Robin/on Crujoe, where are you? -where
have you been? how came yeu here? and fuch like •
prattle I had conftantly taught him. But even though;
I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great while be-
fore I could adjuft myfelf; being amazed how the-
creature got thither, and that he fhouklfixabout that"
place, and no where elfe. But now, being allured itf
Could be no other than my honeft Poll, my wonder,
oeafcd; and reaching out my hand, and calling fa-
jfiiliafly Poll, the creature came to me, and perched,
upon my thumb, as he was wont, conflantly prating1
to me, with Poor Robinfon Crufee, and how did 1
come here, and where had I been? as if the bird was
overjoyed, to fee me; and fo I took him home along-
••: with me. -
I was now pretty well cured'of my rambling to
fta; yet I could wifh my boat, which had coft me fo>-
much trouble and pains, on this fide the ifland once
more, but which indeed was impracticable. I there-
fore began to lead a very retired life, living near a',
twelvemonth, in a very contented.manner, wanting'
for nothing except converfationv As to mechanic
labours, which my neceffities obliged me to, I fancied:
I could, upon occafionj makfi a tolerable carpenter,
were the poor tools I had to work withal but good.
Befides, as I improved irr my earthen ware, I contri-
ved to make them with a wheel, tvhich I found much *
eafier and better, making my work fhapely, which
before was rude and ugly. But, 1 think I;was never
fo elevated with my own performance or projectrtbart
for
for being able to make a tobacco-pipe, which, though^
it proved an awkward clumfy thing, yet it was very
found, and carried the fmoke perfe£tly well, to my
great fatisfaction,
I alfo improved my wicker ware, making me abun-
dance of neceflary bafkets, which, though not very
handfome, were very handy and convenient to fetch
things home in, as alfo for holding my flores, barley,,
rke, and other provifions.
My powder beginning to fail, made me examine
after what manner I fhould kill- the goats or birds toj
live on, after it was all gone. Upon which I con-
trived many ways to enlhare the goats, and fee if I
could catch them alive, particularly a fhe goat with
young. At laft I had my defire; fcr, making pit-falls-
and traps, baited with barley and rke, I-found, one-
morning, in one of them, an old he goat, and in the-
otherthree kids, one male the other two females.
So boifterous was the old one, that I could not
bring him away. But I forgot the old proverb, That-
hunger -will tame a lion: For, had I kept him three or-
four days without victuals, and then given him fome
water, with a little corn, he would have been as tame,
as a young kid. The other creatures I bound with.-
ftrings together; but I had great difficulty before I
could bring them to my habitation. It was fome-
time before they would feed; but, throwing them,
fweet corn, it fo much tempted them, that they be-
gan to be tamer. From hence I concluded,- that if t
defigned to furnifh myfelf with goats fiefh, when myr
ammunition was fpent, the tamely breeding them upr
like a flock of fheep, about my fettlement, was the
only method I could take. I concluded alfo I muft
feparate the wild from the tame, or elfe they would
always run wild as they grew up;-and "the beft way
for this, was to have fome inclofed piece of ground,
well fenced, either with hedge or pale, to keep them
fo effe£tually, that thofe within might not break out,
•r thole, without break in. Sudi an undertaking
•Was very great for one pair of hands; but as there was
an abfoluteneceffity for doing it, my firft care was to
find a convenient piece of ground where there was
4ikely to be herbage for them to eat, water to drink,
.and cover to keep them from the fun.
Here again I gave another inftance of my igno-
rance and inexperience, pitching upon a piece of mea-
dow land fo large, that had I inclofed it, the hedge
or pale muft-have been at leafl two miles about. la-
deed, had it been ten miles, I had time enough to do
•it in ; -but then I did not cortfider that my goats would
be as wild in fo much cotnpafs, as if they had had
• the whole ifland, Mid confequently as .difficult for me
to catch them. This thought came into my head, a£-
,ter I had carried it on, I believe, about fifty yards:
I therefore altered my fcheme, and refolved to inclofe
a piece of ground about 150 yards in, length, and
100 in breadth, fufficient enough for as many as would
maintain me, till fuch time as my .flock increafed, and
then I could add more ground. Trfow vigoroufly pro-
fecuted my work, and it took me about three months
in hedging the firft piece; in which time I tethered
the three -kids in the beft part of it, feeding them as
near me as poffible, to make them familiar: and in.
deed I very often would carry fome ears of barley, or
a handful of rice, and feed them out of my hand; by
'which they grew fo tame, that when my inclofure was
finifhed, and I had let them loofe, they would run
after me for a handful of-corn. Thislndeed anfwer-
ed my end; and in a year and a half's time I had a
flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years after, they amounted to forty-three, befides what
1-had taken and killed for my fuftenance. After which
•I inclofed five feveral pieces of ground to feed them
in, with -pens to drive them into, that I might take,
.them as I had occafion.
In this project I likewife found additional bleflings;
ifor I not only had plenty of goats flefh, but milk too,
which,
•which, in my beginning, I did not fo much as think
of. And, indeed, though I never had milked a cow,
.much lefs a goat, or feen butter or cheefe made, yet,
, after feme eflays and mifcarriages, I made me both,
and never afterwards wanted.
How mercifully can the omnipotent Power comfort
'his creatures, even in the midlr. of their .great eft cala-
mities? How can he fweeten the bittereft providen-
ces, and give us reafon to magnify him in dungeons
and prifons? What a bounteous table was here fpread
• in a wildernefs for me, where I expe£ted nothing at
-firft but to perifh for hunger?
Certainly a Stoic would have fmiled to have feen
me at dinner. There fat my royal majefty, an abfo-
lute prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended by my
dutiful fubjects, whom, if I pleafed, I could either
hang, draw, quarter, give them liberty, or take it
.away. When I dined, I feemed a king, eating alone,
none daring to prefume to do fo till I had done. Poll,
.as if he had been my principal court favourite, was
the only perfon permitted to talk with me. My old,
but faithful dog, now grown exceeding crazy, and
•who had found no fpecies to multiply his kind upon,
continually fat on my right hand; while my two cats
• -fat on each fide of the table, exptcting a bit from my
hand, as a principal mark of my royal favour. Thefe
. were not the cats I had brought from the fhip ;" they
had been dead long before, and interred near my ha-
bitation by mine own hand. But one of them, as I
fuppofe, generating with a wild cat, a couple of their
young I had made tame; the reft run wild into the
woods, and in time grew fo impudent as to return
and plunder me of my ftores, till fucb ,time as J.
. ihot a great many, and the reft left me without trou-
bling me any more. In this plentiful manner did I
live, wanting for nothing but converiation. One
thing indeed concerned me, the want of my boat;

fcer; .hut had any one in England met fuch a figure,
it would either have affrighted them, or made them -
burft into laughter; nay, I could not but fmile my-
felf at my habit, which I think in this place will be
very proper to defcribe. ,
The cap I wore upon my head was great, high, and
fhapelefs, made of a goats-fldn, with a flap or pent-
houfe hanging down behind, not only to keep the
fun from me, but to moot the rain off from running
into my neck, nothing being more pernicious than
the rain falling upon the flefh in thefe climates. I
had a fhort jacket of goats-fkin, whofe hair hung
down fuch a length on either fide, that it reached
down to the calves of my legs. As for fhoes and
flockings, I had none, but made a refemblance of
fomething, I know not what to call them; they were
made like bufldns, and laced on the fides like fpatter-
dafhes, barbaroufly fhaped like the reft of my habit.
I had a broad belt of goats-fkin dried, girt round me
with a couple of thongs, inftead of buckles; on each
of which, to fupply the deficiency of fword and dag-
ger, hung my hatchet and faw. I had another belt,
not fo broad, yet faftened in the fame manner, which
hung over my fhoulder, and at the end of it, under
my left arm, hung two pouches, made alfo of goats-
fkin, to hold my powder and fhot. My bafket I car-
ried on my back, and my gun on my fboulder 5 and
over my head a great clumfy ugly goat-fkin umbrella,
which, however, next to my gun, was the mofl ne-
ceflary thing about me. As for my face, the colour
was not fo fwarthy as the Mulattoes, or as might have
been expected from one who took fo little care of it,
in a climate within nine or ten degrees of the Equinox.
At one time my beard grew fo longthat it hung down
above a quarter of a yard; but as I had both razors
and fciiTars in flore, I cut it all off, and fuffered none
to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan whifkers,
the like of which I had feen worn by fome Turks at
Sallee, no&lpng enougk indeed to hang a hat upon,
G but
butoffuch a monftrous fize, as would have amazeJ
any in England to have feen.
But all this was of no confequence hefe, there be-
ing none to obferve my behaviour or habit. And fo,
without fear and without controul, I proceeded on my
journey, the profccution of which took me up five
or fix days. I firfl travelled along the fea fhore, di-
rectly to the place where I firft brought my boat to an
anchor, to get upon the rocks; but having now no
boat to take care of, I went over land a nearer way to
the fame height that I was before upon; when look-
ing forward to the point of the rock, which lay out,
and which I was forced to double with my boat, I was
amazed to fee the fea fo fmooth and qukt, there be-
ing no ripling motion, nor current, any more than
in other places. This made me ponder fome time to
guefs the reafon of it, when at laft I was convinced,
that the ebb fetting from the weft and joining with
the current of water from fome great river on fhore,
muft be the occafion of thcfe rapid ftreams; and that,
confequendy, as the winds blew more weftwardly,
or more fouthwardly, fo the current came the nearer,
or went the farther from fhore. To fatisfy my curiofi-
ty, I waited there till evening, when the time of ebb
being made, I plainly perceived from the rock the cur-
rent again as before, with this difference, that it ran
farther off, near half a league from the fhore; where-
as, in my expedition, it fet clofe upon it, furioufly
hurrying me and my canoe along with it, which at a-
nother time it would not have done. And now I
was convinced, that, by obferving the ebbing and
flowing of the tide, I might eafily bring my boat
round the ifland again. But when I began to think
of putting it in practice, the remembrance of the late
danger ftruck me with fuch horror, that I. changed
my refolution, and formed another, which was more
fafe, though more laborious; and this was to make an-
other canoe, and fo have one for one fide of the ifland,
_nd one for the other.
had
I had now two plantations in the ifland j the firft
my little fortification, fort, or caflle, with many large
and fpacious improvements: for by this time I had
enlarged the cave behind me with feveral little caves,
one within another, to hold my bafkets, corn, and
ftraw. The piles with which I made my wall were
grown fo lofty and great as obfcured my habitation.
And near this commodious -and pleafant fettlement,
lay my well cultivated and improved corn fields,
which kindly yielded me its fruit in the proper fea-
fon. My fecond plantation was that near my coun-
try-feat, or little bower, where my grapes flourifhed,
and where, having planted many ftakes, I made inclo-
fures for my goats, fo ftrongly fortified by labour and
time, that it was much ftronger than a wall, and con-
fequently impoffible for them to break through. As
for my bower itfelf, I kept it conftantly in repair, and
cut the trees in fuch a manner, as made them grow
thick and wild, and form a moft delightful fhade. In
the centre of this flood my tent, thus erecled. I had
driven four piles in the ground, fpreading over it a
piece of the fhip's fail; beneath which I made me a
fort of a couch with the fkins of the creatures I had
flain, and other things; and having laid thereon one
of the Tailor's blankets, which I had faved from the
wreck of the fhip, and covering myfelf with a great
watch-coat, I took up this place for my country re-
treat.
Very frequently from this fettlement did I ufe to
vifit my boat, and kept her in very good order. And
fometimes I would venture in her a c.aft or two from
fhore, but no farther, left either a ftrong current, a
fudden ftormy wind, or fome unlucky accident, fhould
hurry me from the ifland as before. But now I en-
treat your attention, whilft I proceed to inform you of
a new, but moft furpriting fcene of life which here
hefcl me. . „
You may eafily fuppofe, that, after having been
here fo long, nothing could be more amazing than
G a to
to fee a human creature. One day it happened, that,
going to my boat, I faw the print of a man's naked
loot on the fhore, very evident on the fand, as the
toes, heels, and every part of it. Had I feen an ap-
parition in the moft frightful fhape, I could not-have
been more confounded. My willing ears gave the
ftrideft attention. I caft my eyes around, but could"
fhtisfy neither the one or the other. I proceeded al*
tcrn;itely to every part of the fhore, but with equal
et?et~t; neither could I fee any other mark, though the
fand about it was as fufceptible to take impreffion, ds
that which was fo plainly ftarnped. Thus, ftruck with
confufion and horror, I returned to my habitation,
frightened at every built and tree, taking every thing
for men; and pofleffeJ with the wildeft ideas! That
night my eyes never clofed. I formed nothing but the
nicft difmal imaginations, concluding it muft be the?
mark of the devil's foot which I had feen. For other-
wife how could any mortal come to this ifland?
Where was the fhip that tranfported them? and what
figns of any other footfteps? Though thefe feemed
•very ftrong reafons for fuch a fuppofition, yet (thought
I) why fhould the devil make the print of his foot to-
no purpofe, as I can fee, when he might have taker*
other ways to have terrified me? Why mould he leave
his mark on the other fide of the ifland, and that too
on the fand, where the furging waves of the ocean
might foon have efafed the impreffion. Surely this
action is not confiftent with the fubtility of Satan, faid
I to myfelf; but rather muft be fome darfgerous crea-
ture, fome wild favage of the main land over againft
me, that, venturing too far in the ocean, has been
driven here, either by the violent currents or contrary
•winds; and not caring to flay on this ckfolate ifland,.
has gone back to fea again.
Happy indeed, thought I to myfelf, that none of the
favages had feen me in that place: yet I was not al-
together without fear, left, having found my boat,,
they -
•
they fhould return in humbers and devour me, or at
leaft carry away all my corn, and deftroy my flock of
tame goats. In a word, all my religious hopes vanifh-
ed, as though I thought God could not now protect
me by his power, who had fo wonderfully preferved
rne fo long.
What various chains of providence are there in the
life of man? How changeable are our affections, ac-
cording to different circumftances? We love to-day,
'what we hate to-merrow; we fhun one hour, what
we feek the next. This was evident in me in the mof
t
confpicuous manner: For I, who before had fo much
lamented my condition, in being banifhed from all
humankind, was now even ready to expire, when I
confidered that a man had fet his foot on this defolate
ifland. But, when I confidered my ftation of life, de-
creed by the infinitely wife and good providence of
God, that'! ought not to difpute my Creator's fove-.
reignty, who had an undoubted right to govern and
difpofe of his creatures as he thinks convenient; and
that his juftice and mercy, could either punifh or deli-
ver me: I fay, when I confidered all this, I comfort-
ably found it my duty to truft fincerely in him, pray
ardently to him, and humbly refign myfelf to his di-
vine will.
One morning, lying on my bed, thefe words of the
facred writings came again into my mind, Call upon
me in the day of troublet and I will deliver thee, and
thou Jhalt glorify trie.' Upon this fentence, rifing
more cheerfully from my bed, I offered up my pray-
ers in the moft heavenly manner: and, when I had
done, taking up my Bible to read, thefe words appear-
ed firft in my fight* Wait on the Lord, and be of good
cheer, and he JhallJirengthen thy heart: Waitt I fayt
on the Lord, Such divine comfort did this give me,
as to remove all caufe of fadnefs upon that occafion.
Thus, after a world of apprehenfions and fears, for
three days and nights, I at laft ventured out of my
G 3 cattle,
caftle, and milked my goats, one of which was almoffe
fpoiled for want of it. I next (though in great fear)*
vifited my bower, and milked my flocks there alfo ;.
when, growing bolder, I went down to the fhore again,
and meafuring the print of the foot to mine, to fee
perhaps whether I myfelf had not occafioned that
mark, I found it much fuperior in largenefs; and fo>
returned home, now abfolutely convinced, that either
fome men had been afhore, or that the ifland muft be
inhabited; and therefore that I might be furprifed be-
fore I was aware.
I now began to thing of providing for my fecurity,,
and revolved in my mind many different fchemes for
that purpofe. I firft propofed to cut down my inclo-
fures, and turn my tame cattle wild into the woods,,
that the enemy might not find them, and frequent the
ifland in hopes of killing the fame. Secondly, I was.
for digging up my corn fields for the very fame reafon.
And, lajlly, I concluded to demolifh my bower, left,,
feeing a place of human contrivance, they might come
farther, and find out and attack me in my little caftle.
Such notions did the fear of danger fuggeft to me$
and I looked, I thought, like the unfortunate king
Saul, when not only opprefled by the Philiftines, but
alfo forfaken by God himfelf. And, it is ftrange, that
a little before, having entirely refigned myfelf to the
•will of God, I fhould now have little confidence in
him, fearing thofe more who could kill this fading
body, than he who could deftroy my immortal foul.
Sleep was an utter ftranger to my eyes that night;
yet nature, fpent and tired, fubmitted to a filent re-
pofe the next morning. And then, joining reafon
•with my fear, I confidered, that this delightful and
pleafant ifland might not be fo entirely forfaken as I
might think; but that tke inhabitants from the o-
ther fhore might fail, either with defign, or from ne-
eeflity,. by crofs winds; and* if the latter circum-
ftance,
.1
ftance, I had reafon to believe they would depart the
firft opportunity. However, my fear made me think
of a place for retreat upon an attack. I now repent-
ed that I had made my door to come out beyond my
fortification"; to remedy which, I refolved to make
me a fecond one: I fell to work, therefore, and drove
betwixt that double row of trees, which I planted a-
bout twelve years before, feveral ftrong piles, thick-
ening it with pieces of timber and old cables, and
ftrengthening the foot of it with earth which I
dug out of my cave; I alfo made me feven holes,,
•wherein I planted my rnufkets like cannon, fitting
them into frames refembling carriages. This being,
finifhed with indefatigable induftry, for a great way
every where, I planted flicks of ofier like a wood, a-
bout twenty thoufand of them, leaving a large fpace
between them and my wall, that I might have room
to fee an enemy, and that they might not be fhekered
among the young trees, if they offered to approach
the outer wall. And, indeed, fcarce two years had
pafled over my head, when there appeared a lovely
fhady grove, and in fix years it became a thick wood
perfectly impamble. For my fafety I left no avenue
to go in or out; inftead of which I fet two ladders,
one to a part of the rock which was low, and then
broke in, leaving room to place another ladder upon
that; fo that when 1 took thole down, it was impof-
fible for any man to defcend without hurting himlelf;
and if they had, they would ftill be at the outfide of
my outer wall. But while I took all thefe meafures
of human prudence for my own prefervation, I was
not altogether unmindful of other affairs. To pre-
fecve my flock of tame goats, that the enemy fhould
not take all at once, I looked out for the moft retired
part of the ifland, which was the place where I had
loft myfelf before mentioned, and there finding a clear
piece of land, containing three acres, furrounded
with thick woods, I wrought fo hard, that, in lefs
than a month's time, I fenced it fo well round, that
my
my flocks were very well fecured in it, and I pot
therein two he-goats and ten fhe ones.
All this labour was occafioned purely by fearful
apprehenfionsj on account of feeing the .print of a
man's foot. And not contented yet with what I
had done, I fearched for another place towards the
"weft point of the ifland, where I might alfo retain
another flock. Then wandering on this errand more
to the weft of the ifland than ever I had yet done,
and cafting my eyes towards the fea, methought I
perceived a boat at a great diftance; but could not
poffibly tell what it was for want of my perfpe&ive
glafs. I confidered then it was no ftrange thing to fee
the print of a man's foot; and, concluding them can-
nibals, bleffed God for my being caft on the other fide
of the ifland, where none of the favages, as I thought,
ever came. But when I came down the hill to the
fhore, which was the S. W. point of the ifland, I wa*
foon confirmed in my opinion; nor can any one de-
fcribe my horror and amazement, when I faw the
ground fpread with fculls, hands, feet, and bones of
human bodies; and particularly, I perceived a fpace
like a circle, in the mid ft of which had been a fire,
about which I conjectured thefe wretches fat, and un-
naturally facrificed and devoured their fellow crea-
tures.
The horror and loathfomenefs of this dreadful fpec-
tacle, both confounded my fenfes, and made me dif-
charge from my ftomach in an exceffive manner. I
then returned towards my habitation ; and, in my way
thither, fhedding floods of tears, and falling down on
my bended knees, gave God thanks for making my
nature contrary to thefe wretches, and delivering me
fo long out of their hands.
Though reafon and my long refidence here had af-
fured me, that thefe favages never came up to the
thick woody parts of the country, and that 1 had no
reafon to be apprehenfive of a difcovery; yet fuch an
abhorrence
•
sWiorrence did I ftill retain, that, for two years after,
1 confined myfelf only to my three plantations; I
mean my caftle, country feat, and inclofure in the
•woods. And though, in proccfs of time, my dread-
ful appreherrfions began to wear away, yet my eyes
were more vigilant for fear of being furprifed, and I
was very cautious of firing my gun, left, being heard
by thofe creatures, they fhould proceed to attack me.
I refolved, however, manfully to lofe my life if they
did, aiid went armed with three piftols ftuck in my
girdle; which, added to the defcription I have given
of myfclf before,made me look with a very formidable
appearance.
Thus my circumftances for fc-me time remained
very calm and umliftmbed; and when I compared
my condition to others, I found it far from being
E'.iforsbis. And, indesd, would all perfons cortipnrs
their circumftances, not wkh thofe above them, but
with thoie innumerable unhappy obje£ts beneath
them, I am fure we fhould not hear thofe daily mur-
rnurings and complainings that are in the world.
For my part, I wanted but few things. Indeed, the
terror which the favages had put me in, fpoilect
fbme inventions for my own conveniencics. One of
my projects was to brew me fome beer; a very whimfi-
Cal one indeed, when it is confidered, that I had nei*
ther cafks fufficient, nor could \ make any to preferve
it in; neither had I hops to make it keep, yeft to>
make it work, nor a copper or kettle to make it
boil. Perhaps, indeed, after fome years, I might
bring this to bear, as I had done other things. But
now my inventions were placed another way; and
day and night I could think of nothing but, how I
might deftroy fome of theie cannibals, when pro-
ceeding to their bloody entertainments; and fo fa-
ving a victim from being facrificed, that he might af-
ter become my fervant. Many were my contrivan-
ces for this purpofe, and as many more obje£tions
occurred, after I hatched them. 1 once contri-
ved
ved to dig a hole under the place where they made
their fire, and put therein five or fix pounds of gun-
powder, which would confequently blow up all thofe
that were near it; but then I was loth to fpend" fo
much upon them, left it fhould not do that certain
execution I could defire, and but only affright, and
not kill them. Having laid this defign afide, I again
propofed to myfelf to lie privately in ambufh, in
fome convenient place, with my three guns double
loaded, and let fly at them in the mid ft of their
dreadful ceremony; and having killed two or three
of them at every fhot, fall upon the reft fuddenly with
my three piftols, and not let one mother's fon efcape.
This imagination pleafed my fancy fo much, that I
ufed to dream of it in the night time. To put my
defign in execution, I was not long feeking for a
place very convenient for my purpofe, where unfeen
I might behold every action of the favages. Here I
placed my two mu&ets, each of which was loaded
•with a brace of flugs, and four or five fmaller bul-
lets about the fize of piftol bullets; the fowling-
piece was charged with near a handful of the largeft"
fwan fhot; and in every piftol were about four bul-
lets. And thus all things being prepared, no fooner
would the welcome light fpread over the element,
but, like a giant refrejbcd -with -wine, as the fcripture
has it, would I iffue forth from my caftle, and from
a lofty hill, three miles diftant, view if I could fee
any invaders approach unlawfully to my kingdom.
But having waited in vain two or three months, it
not only grew very tirefome to me, but -brought ma
into fome confideration, and made me examine my-
felf, what right I had to kill thefe creatures in this
manner.
If (argued I to myfelf) this unnatural cuftom of
theirs be a fin offenfive to heaven, it belongs to the
divine Being, who alone has the vindictive power in
his hands, to fhower down his vengeance upon
.them. And perhaps he does fo, in making them be-
come
come one another's executioners. Or, if not, if God
thinks thefe doings juft, according to the knowledge
they conceive, what authority have-I to pretend to
thwart the decrees of Providence, which has permitted
thefe actions for fo many ages, perhaps from almoft the
beginning of the creation? They never offe-nded me;
•what right have I then to concern myfelf in their
fhedding one another's blood? And, indeed, I have
fince known, they value no more to kill and devour a
captive taken in war, than we do to kill an ox, or eat
mutton. I then concluded, it neceflarily followed,
that thefe people were no more murderers then Chri-
ftians, who many times put whole troops to the fword,
after throwing down their arms. Again I confidered,
that if I fell upon them, I fhould be as much in the
wrong as the Spaniards, who had committed the
greateft barbarities upon thefe people who never had
offended them in their whole lives; as if the kingdom
of Spain was eminent for a race of men without com-
mon compaffion to the miferable, a principal fign of
the mofl. generous temper. Thefe confiderations
made me paufe, and brought me to think I had taken
\vrong meafures in my refolution; I now argued with
myfelf, that it was better for me never to attack, but
to remain undifcovered as long as poffibly I could;
that an oppofite conduct would certainly prove de-
ftructive; for, as it was fcarcely to be fuppofed I could
till ftsm all, I might either be overpowered by the
remaining, or that fome efcaping, might bring thou-
fands tomycertain deftru&ion. And,indeed,religion
took their part fo much as to convince me how contra-
ry it was to my duty to be guilty of fhedding human
blood, innocent as to my particular, whatever they are
to one another; that I hid nothing to do with it, but
leave it to the God of all power and dominion, as I
faid before, to do therein what feemed convenient to
his heavenly wifdom. And, therefore, on my knees I
thanked the Almighty for delivering me from blood-
guiltinefs,
guiltinefs, and begged his protection that I might ne-
ver fall into their hands.
Thus giving over an attempt which I had rafhly be-
gun, I never afcended the bill on that occafion after-?
wards; I only removed my boat, which lay on the Q-
ther fide of the ifland, and every thing that belonged
to her, towards the eaft, into a little cove, that there
might not be the leaft fhadow of difcovery of any boat
near, or habitation upon the ifland. My caftle then
became my cell, keeping always retired in it, except
when I went out to milk my fhe-goats, and order my
little flock in the wood, which was quite out of dan-
ger; for fure I was, that thefe favages never came
here with expectations to find any thing, and confe-
quently never wandered from the coaft; however, as
they might have feveral times been on fhore, as well
before as after my dreadful apprehenfions, I looked
back with horror to think in what ftate I might have
been, had I fuddenly met them flenderly armed, with
one gun only loaded with fmall fhot; and how great
would have been my amazement, if, inftead of feeing
the print of one man's foot, I had perceived fifteen or
twenty favages, who, having once fet their eyes upon
me, by the fwiftnefs of their feet, would have left
me no poffibility of efcaping? Thefe thoughts would
fink my very foul, fo that I would fall into a deep me-
lancholy, till fuch time as the confideration of my gra-
titude to the divine Being moved it from my heart.
I then fell into a contemplation of the fecret fprings
of Providence; and how wonderfully we are deliver-
ed, when infenfible of it; and when intricated in un-
certain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or hefuation, what
fecrethintdirecTrs us in the right way, when we intend-
ed to. go out of it; nay, perhaps, contrary to our.bu-
finefs, fenfe, or inclination. Upon which, I fixed with-
in me this as a certain rule, never to difobey thofe fe-
cret impreffions of mind, to the acting or not acting
any thing that offered, for which I yet could affign
no
po reafon. But let it be how it will, the advantage
of this conduct very eminently appeared in the lattei;
part of my abode on this ifland; I am a ftranger in
determining whence thefe fecret intimations of Pro-
vidence derive: yet methinks they are not only fomc
proof of the converfe of fpirits, but alfo of the fs-
cret communications they are fuppofed to have with,
thofe that have not paifed through the gloomy vals
of death. ,
Thefe anxieties of mind, and the care of my pre-
fervation, put a period to all future inventions an4
contrivances, either for accommodation or conveni-
ence. I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a
ftick, fire a gun, er make a fire, left either the noife
fhould be heard, or the fmoke difcover me. And on
this account I ufed to burn my earthen ware private-
ly in a cave which 1 found in the wood, and which.I
made convenient for that purpofe; the principal
caufe that brought me here was to make charcoal, fo
that I might bake and drefs my bread and meat with-
out any danger. At that time a curious accident hap-
pened me, which I fhall now relate.
While 1 was cutting down ibme wood for making
my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind a very
thick branch of underwood. Curious to look into it,
I attained its mouth, and perceived it fufficient for
me to fland upright in it. But when I had entered,
and took a further view, two rolling fhining eyes,
like flaming ftars, feemed to dart themfelves at me 5
fo that I made all the hafte out that I could, as not
knowing whether it was the devil or a nionfter that
had taken his refidence in that place. Whcn I re-
covered a little from my furprife, I called myfelf a
thoufand fools, for being afraid to fee the devil one
moment, who had now almoft lived twenty years in
the moll retired folitude. And therefore reluming
all the courage I had, Itook up a flaming firebrand, and
in I rumed again. I had not proceeded above three
fteps> when I was more affrighted-than before; fos
H 'then
then I heard a very loud figh, like that of a human
creature in the greateft agony, fucceeded with a bro-
ken noife, refembling words half exprefled, and then
a broken figh again. Stepping back, Lord! (thought
I to myfelf), where am I got? Into what inchanted
place have I plunged myfelf, fuch as are reported to
contain miferable'captives, till death puts an end to
their fprrow? And, indeed, in fuch a great amaze-
ment was I, that it ftruck me into a cold fwcat; and
had my hat been on my head, I believe my hair
would have moved it off. But again encouraging
myfelf with the hopes of God's protection, I pro-
ceeded forward, and, by the light of nay firebrand,
perceived it to be a monftrous he-goat, lying on the
ground, gafping for life, and dying of mere old age.
At firft I ftirred him, thinking to drive him out,
and the poor ancient creature ftrove to get upon his
feet, but was not able; fo I e'en let him lie ftill, to
affright the favages fnould they venture into this cave.
I now looked round me, and found the place but
fmall and fhapelefs. At the farther fide of it I per-
ceived a fort of an entrance, yet fo low, as muft
oblige me to creep on my hands and knees to it; fo,
having no candle, I fufpended my enterprife till the
next day, and then I came provided with two large
ones of my own making.
Having erept upon my hands and feet .through this
ftrait, 1 found the roof rofe higher up, I think about
twenty feet. But furely never mortal faw fuch a glo-
rious light before! The roof and walls of this cave
reflected a hundred thoufand lights to me from my
two candle), as though they were indented with
(hilling gold, precious Itones, or fparkling diamonds.
And indeed it was the moft delightful cavity or grot-
to of its kind that could be defired, though entirely
dark The floor was dry and level, and had a kind
of gravel upon it; no naufeous venomous creatures
to be feen there, neither any damp or wet about it. I
could find no fault but in the entrance, and 1 began
to
to think that even this might be very neceffary for
my defence, and therefore refolved to make it my
moft principal magazine. I brought hither two
fowling-pieces and three mufkets, leaving only five
pieces at my caftle, planted in the nature of cannon.
In a barrel of gun-powder, which I took up out of
the fea, I brought away about fixty pounds of good
powder, which were not damaged; and thefe, with
a great quantity of lead for bullets, I removed from
my caftle to this retreat, now fortified both by art
and nature.
I fancied myfelf now like one of the giants of old,
who were faid to live in caves and holes among the
rocks, inacceffible to any but themfelves, or, at leaft,
moft dangerous to attempt. And now I defpifed
both the cunning and ftrength of the favages, either
to find me out or to hurt me.
But I m.uft not forget the old goat, .who caufed my
late dreadful amazement. The poor creature gave
up the ghoft the day after my difcovery; and it being
very difficult to drag him out, I dug his grave, and
honourably intombed him in the fame place where
'he departed, with as ntuch ceremony as any Welch-
goat that has been interred about the high mountain
Penmenmoure;
I think I was now in the twenty-third year of my
reign, and my thoughts much eailer than formerly,
having contrived feveral pretty amufements and di-
verfions to pafs away the time in a pleafant manner.
By this time my pretty Poll had learned to fpeak
Englifh, and pronounce his words very articulately
and plain; fo that for many hours we ufed to chat
together after a very familiar manner, and he lived
with me no lefs than twenty-fix years. My dog, who
was nineteen years old, fixteen of which he lived with
me, died fometime ago of mere old age. As for my
cats, they multiplied fo faft, that I was forced to kill
or drive them into the woods, except two or three,
which became my particular favourites. Befides
H a thefe,
thefe, I continually kept two or three houfehold kids
about me, whom 1 did learn to feed out of my hand,
and two more parrots who could talk indifferently,
and call Robin (on Crufoe, but not fo excellently as
the firft, as not taking that pains with them. I had
alfo feveral fea-fowls which I had wounded and cut
their wings; and growing tame, they ufed to breed
among the low trees about my caftle-walls; all which
made my abode very agreeable.
But what unforefeen events fuddenly deftroy the
enjoyments of this uncertain ftate of life, when we
leaft expec~k them! It was now the month of Decem-
ber, in the fouthern folftice, and particular time of
my harveft, which required my attendance in the
fields; when going out pretty early one morning, be-
fore it was day-light, there appeared to me, from the
fea-fhore, a flaming light, about two miles from me,
at the eaft end of the ifland, where I had obferved
fome favages had been before, not on the other fide,
but to my great afffiction it was on my fide of the
ifland. s
Struck with a terrible furprife, and my ufual ap-
prebenfions, that the favages would perceive my im-
provements, I returned dire£U'y to my caftle, pulled
up the ladder after me, making all things look as wild
and natural zs poffibly 1 could. In the next'plaoe, I
put myfelf in a pofture of defence, loading my muf-
kets and piftols, and committing myfelf to God's
protection, I refolved to defend myfelf till my laft
breath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence,
I fet my ladder up to the fide of the hill, where there
vas a flat place, and then pulling the ladder after me,
afcended to the top, where laying mvfelf on my bel-
• ly, with my perfpeclive gbfs, I perceived nolefsthan
nine naked favages, fitting round a fmall fire, eating,
as I fuppofed, human flefh, with their two canoes
haled on fhore, waiting for the flood to carry them
off again. You cannot eafily exprefs the confterna-
tion I was in at this fight, efpecially feeing them near
• • me:
.me; but when I perceived their coming muft be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, 1 became more ea:-
fy in my thoughts, being very fully convinced, that I
might go abroad with feeurity all the time of flood,
if they were not before landed. And, indeed, this
proved juft as I imagined; for no fooner did they all
take boat and paddle away, but the tide made N. W.
Before they went off, they danced, making ridiculous
poftures and geftures, for above an hour, all ftark
naked; but whether men or women, or both, I could
not perceive. When I faw them gone, I took two guns
upon my fhoulders, and placing a ccnple of piliola
in my belt, with my great fword hanging by my fide,.
3 went to the hill, where at firft I made a difcovery
of thefe cannibals, and then faw there had been three
canoes more ef the favages on fhore at that place,
which, with the reft, were making ovor to the main!
land.
But nothing could be more horrid to mey when ga*--
ing to the place of facrifice,' the blood, the bones, and;'
other mangled parts of human bodies appeared in my
fight: and fo fired was I with indignation,, that I was
fully refolved to be revenged on the firft that came
there, though I loft my life in the execution. It
then appeared to me, that the vifits which they make
to this ifland are not very frequent, it being fifteen'
months before they came again: but Rill I was very
uneafy, by reafon of the difmal apprehenfions I had
of their furpriCng me unawares; nor dared I offer lev
fire a gun on that fide of the ifland where they ufcd
to appear, left, taking the alarm, the favages might
return with many hundred canoes, and then God
knows in what manner I fhould have made my end.
pih us was I a year or more before I faw any of thefe
devouring cannibals again.
liut to wave this, the following accident, which
demands attention, for a while, eluded the force of
my thoughts in revenging myfelf on thofe Heathens.
H 3
On the i6th of May (according to my wooden ca-
lendar) the wind blew exceeding hard, accompanied
with abundance of lightening and thunder all day,
and fucceeded by a very ftormy night. The feeming
anger of the heavens made me have recourfe to my
Bible. Whilft I was ferioufly pondering upon it, I
was fuddenly alarmed with the noife of a gun, which
I conjectured was fired upon the ocean. Strch an
nnnfual fnrprife made me ftart up in a minute, -when,
with my ladder afcending the mountain as before,
that very moment a flafh of fire prefaged the report
of another gun, which I prefently heard, and found
it was from that part of the fea where the current
drove me away. I could not but then think, that
this muft be a fhip in diftrefs, and that thefe were
the melancholy fignals for a fpeedy deliverance. Great,
indeed, was my forrow upon this occafion; but my
labours to affift them muft have proved altogether
vain and fmitlefs. 'However, I brought together all
the dry wood that was at hand, and making a pretty
large pile,, fet it on fire on the hill. I was certain
they plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun
as foon as it began to blaze, and after that feveral
more from the fame quarter. All night long I kept
up my fire; and when the air deared up, I perceived;
fomething a great way at fea, directly E. but
could not diftinguifh what it was, even with my
glafs, by reafon the weather was fo very foggy out
at fea. However, keeping my eyes dire£tly fixed up-
on it, and perceiving it not to ftir, I prefently conclu-
ded it muft be a fbip at anchor, and fo very hafty I
was to be fatisfied, that, taking my gun, I went to
tha 8. E. part of the ifland, to the fame rocks where
I had been formerly drove away by the current; in
whiph time the weather being perfectly cleared up,
to my great forrow, I perceived the wreck of a fhip
caft away upon thofe hidden rocks I found when I
was out with my boat; and- which, by making a
kind
kind of an eddy, were the occafion of my preferva-
tion.
Thus, what is one man's fafety is another's ruin;
for undoubtedly this fhip had been driven on them in
the night, the wind blowing ftrong at E. N. E. Had
they perceived the ifland, as I now guefled they had
not, certainly, inftead of having fired their guns for
help, they would rather have ventured in their boat,
and faved themfelves that way. I then thought, that
perhaps they had done fo, upon feeing my fire, and
were caft away in the attempt; for I perceived no
boat in the fhip. But then I again imagined, that,
perhaps, they had another veffel in company, which,
upon fignal, faved their lives, and took the boat up:
or that the boat might be driven into the main ocean,
where thefe poor creatures might be in the moft mife-
rable condition. But as all thefe conjectures were
very uncertain, I could do no more than commiferate
their diftrefs, and thank God for delivering me, in par-
ticular, when fo many perifhed in the raging ocean.
When I confidered ferioufly every thing concerning
this wreck, and could perceive no room tofuppofeany
of them faved, I cannot explain, by any poffible force
of words, what longings my foul felt upon this fight,
often breaking out in this manner: O that there had
been but two or three, nay even one perfon faved,
that we might have lived together, converfed with,
and comforted one another! And, fo much were my
defires moved, that when I repeated thefe words,
"Oh! that there had been but one!" my hands
•would fo clench together, and my fingers prefs the
palms of my hands fo clofe, that, Ivad any foft thing
been between, it would have crufhed it involuntarily
while my teeth would ftrike together, and fet againft
each other fo ftrong, that it required fome timefor me
to part them.
Till the lafl year of my being on this ifland, I ne-
. ver knew whether or not any had been faved out of
this
this fhip. I had the affli&ion, fometime after, to fee
the corpfe of a drowned boy come on fhore, at the
end of the ifland which was next the fhipovfeck; there
was nothing on him but a Teaman's waiftcoat, a pair
of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen fhirt j
but no particular mark to guefs what nation he was
of. In his pocket were two pieces of eight, and a to-
bacco pipe,, the laft of which I preferred much more
than I did the firft. And now the catrrtnefs of the fea-
tempted rr>e to-venture out in my boat to this wreck,
not only to- get fomething neseflary out of the fliip»
but, perhaps, foroe living creature might be on hoard,
whofe life I might preferve. This had fuch an influ-
ence upon-my mind, that immediately I went home,
and prepared every thing neceffary for the voyage,
carrying on board! my boat provifions of all forts, with
a good quantity of rumr frefh water, and a compafs:
ib putting off, I paddled the canoe along the fhore,
till I came at laJt to the north-eaft. part of the ifland,
from whence I was to launch into the ocean; but
here .the currents- ran fo violently, and appeared fo
terrible, that my heart began to- fail me; forefeeing,
that if I was driven into anyofthefe currents, I might
be carried not only out of the reach or fight of the
ifland, but even inevitably loft in the boiling, furges
ef the ocean.
So opprefled was I at thefe troubles, that I gave
over my enterprife, failing to a little creek on the
fhore, where, fteppingout, I fat me down on a rifing-
hill, very penfive and thoughtful. I then perceived
that the tide was turned, and the flood, came on,
•which made it impracticable for me to go out for fo
many hours. Ta be more certain how the fets of
the tides or currents lay when- the flood came in, I
afcended a higher piece of ground, which overlook-
ed the fea both ways; and htre I found, that as the
current of the ebb fet out clofe by the fouth point of
the ifland*. fo the current of the flood fet in clofe by
the fhore of the north iidc,; and all that I had to
dOj,
do, was to keep to the north of the ifland in my re*
turn.
That night I repofed myfelf in my canoe, covered
•with my watch-coat inftead of a blanket, the heavens
being my tefter. I fet out with the firft of the tide
full north, till I felt the benefit of the current, which
carried me at a great rate eaftward, yet not with fuch
impetuofity as before, as to take from me all govern-
ment of my canoe; fo that in two hours time I came
up to the wreck, which appeared to me a moft me-
lancholy fight. It feemed to be a Spanifh veffel by
its building, fluck fafl between two rocks; her ftern
and quarter beaten to pieces by the fca; her mainmaft
and fotemaft were brought off by the board; that is,
broken fhort off. As 1 approached nearer, I percei-
vfd a dog on board, who, feeing me coming, yelped
and cried; and no fooner did I call him, but the poor
creature jumped into the fea, out of which I took
him up, almoft famifhed with hunger and thirft; fo
that when I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous
•wolf eould devour it more greedily: and he drank to
that degree of frem water, that he would have burft
himfelf, had I fuffered him.
The firft fight I met with in the fhip, were two
men drowned in the cook-room or forecaftle, inclo-
fed in one another's arms: hence I very probably
fuppofed, that when the veffel ftruck in the ilorm,
fo high and inceflantly did the waters break in and
over her, that the men, not being able to bear it,
were ftrnnglcd by the conftant rufhiug in of the
waves. There were feveral calks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I could not be pofitive, which lay in
the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the
ebbing out of the water, yet were too large for me to
pretend to meddle with: likewife, I perceived feveral
chefts, which I fuppofed to belong to the feamen,
two of which I got into my boat, without exami-
ning what was in them. Had the ftern of the flap
fixed, and the fore part broken off, I fhould
have
have made a very profperous voyage •, fince, by what
I after found in thefe two chefts, I could not other-
wife conclude, but that the fliip muf t have abundance
of wealth on board; nay, if I muf t guefs by the courfe
fhe fteered, fhe muft have been bound from the Bue-
nos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the fouthern
part of America, beyond the Brazils, to the Havan-
nah, in the gulph of Mexico, and fo perhaps to Spain.
What became of the reft of her failors, I could not cer-
tainly tell; and all Her riches figaitied nothing at that
time to any "body.
Searching farther, I found a cafkj containing a~
bout twenty gallons, full of liquor, which, with
fome labour, I got into my boat; in a cabin were
feveral mufkets, which I let remain there; but took
away with me a great powder horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it. I took aHb a fire fhovel
and tongs, two brafs kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a grid-iron; all which were ex-
tremely neceffary to me, efpecially the fire fhovel and
tongs. And fo with this cargo, accompanied with
my dog, I came away, the tide fcrving for that pur-
pofe; and the fame evening, about an hour within
night, I attained the ill,mil, after the greateft toil and
fatigue imaginable.
That night I repofed my wearied limbs in the
boat, refolving the r. ext morning to harbour what I
had gotten in my new-found fubterraneous grotto;
ancj not carrying my cargo home to my ancient ca-
ftle. Having refrefhed myfelf, and got all my ef-
fects on fhore, I next proceeded to examine the par-
ticulars; and fo tapping the cafk, I found the liquor
to be a kind of a rum, but not like what we had at
the Brazils, nor indeed near fo good. At the open-
ing of the cheft, feveral things appeared very ufefal
to me; for inftance, I found in one a very fine cafe
of bottles, containing the finer! and bef t forts of cor-
dial waters; each bottle held about three pints, cu-
rioufly tipt with filver. I found alfo two pots full
\ of
of the choiceft fweetmeats, and two more which the
water had utterly fpoiled. There were likewife fe-
veral good fhirts, exceeding welcome to me, and a-
feout one dozen and a half of white linen hanker-
chiefs and coloured neckcloths, the former of which
were abfolutely neceffary for wiping my face in a hot
day; and, in the till, I found three bags of pieces of
eight, about eleven hundred in all, in one of which,
decently wrapt up in a piece of paper, were fix dou-
bloons of gold, and feme fmall bars and wedges of
the fame metal, which I believe .might weigh near a
pound. In the other cheft, which I gueffed to belong
to the gunner's mate, by the mean circumftances that
attended it, I only found fome clothes of very little
value, except about two pounds of fine glazed powder,
in three flafks, kept, as I believe, for charging their
fowling-pieces on any occafion; fo that, on the whole,
I had no great advantage by this voyage. The mo-
ney was indeed as mere dirt to me, ufelefs and un-
profitable, all which I would have freely parted with
for two or three Engjifh pair of fhoes and ftockings,
things that for many years I had not worn, except
lately thofe which I had taken off the feet of thofe un-
fortunate men I found drowned in the wreck, yet not
fo good as Englifh fhoes, either for eafe or fervice. I
alfo found in the feaman's cheft about fifty pieces of
eight in rials, but no gold; fo concluded riiat what I
took from the firft belonged to an officer, the latter
appearing to have a much inferior perfon for its own-
er. However, as defpicable as the money feemedy I
likewife lugged it to my cave, laying it up fecurely,
as I did the reft of my cargo; and after 1 had done
all this, I returned back to my boat, rowing or pad-
dling her along till I came to my old harbour, where
I carefully laid her up, and fo made the beft of my
way to my cartle. When I arrived there, every thing
feemed fafe and quiet; fo that now my only bufinefs
was to repofe myfelf after my wonted manner, and
take
take care of my domeftic affairs. But though I might
have lived very eafy, as wanting for nothing abfolute-
ly needful; yet ftill I was more vigilant than ufual
upon account of the favages, never going much a-
broad; or, if I did, it was to the eaft part of the ifland,
•where I was well allured that the favages never came,
and where I might not be troubled to carry that heavy
load of weapons for my defence, as I was obliged to
do if I went the other way.
Two years did I live in this anxious condition, in
all which time, contrary to my former refolutions, my
head was filled with nothing but projects and defigns,
how I might efcape from this ifland ; and fo much were
my wandering thoughts bent on a rambling difpofi-
tion, that had I had the fame boat that I went from
Sallee in, I fhould have ventured once more to the
uncertainty of the raging ocean.
I cannot however but confider myfelf as one of the
unhappy perfons, who make themfelves wretched by
their diflatisfaction with the fhtions which God has
placed them in; for, not to take a review of my pri-
mitive condition, and my father's excellent advice,
(the going contrary to which was, as I may fay, my
original fin], the following miftakes of the fame na-
ture certainly had been the means of my prefent un-
happy ftation. What butinefs hacl I to leave a fettled
fortune, and well flocked plantation, improving and
increafing, where", by this time, I might have been
worth a hundred thoufand moidores, to turn fuper-
cargo to Cuinea, to fetch negroes, when time and
patience would have fo much enlarged my flock at
home, as to be able to employ thofe whofe more im-
mediate bufinefs it was to fetch them home, even to
my own door?
But as this is commonly the fate of young heads,
fo a fc'rious reflection upon the folly of it ordinarily
attends the exercife of future years, when the dear-
bought experience of time teaches us repentance.
Thus was it with me; but notwithftanding the
thoughts

thoughts of my deliverance ran fo ftrongly in my
mind, that it feemed to check all the di£tates of rea-
fon and philofophy. And now to ufher in my kind
reader with great pleafure to the remaining part of
my relation, I flatter myfelf it will not be taken a-
mifs, to give him an account of my firft conceptions
of the manner of efcaping, and upon what foundation
I laid my foolifh fchemes.
Having retired to my caftle, after my late voyage
to the fhip, my frigate laid up and fecured, as ufual,
and my condition the fame as before, except being
richer, though I had as little occafion for riches as
the Indians of Peru had for gold, before the cruel
Spaniards came among them: One night in March,
being the rainy fealbn, in the four and twentieth
year of my folitude, I lay down to fleep, very well
in health, without diftemper, pain, or uncommon
uneafinefs, either of body or mind; yet notwith-
ftanding, I could not compofe myfelf to fleep all the
night long. All this tedious while, it is impoffiblc
to exprefs what innumerable thoughts came into my
head. I traced quite over the whole hiftory of my
life in miniature, from my utmoft remembrance of
things till I came to this ifland; and then proceeded
to examine every action and paflage that had occurred
fince I had taken pofleffion of my kingdom. In my
reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the
happy pofture of my afiairs in the beginning of
my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear, and concern,
fince I had difcovered the print of a foot in the fand;
that while I continued without appprehenfion, I was
incapable of feeling the dread and terror I now fuf-
fered. How thankful rather ought I to have been
for the knowledge of my danger, fince -the greateft
happinefs one can be Dofleffed of is to have fufficient
time to provide againft it? How ftupendous is the
goodnefs of providence, which fets fuch narrow
bounds to the fight and knowledge of human nature,
I i that
that while men walk in the midft of fo many dangers
they are kept ferene and calm, by having the events
of things hid from their eyes, and knowing nothing
of thofe many dangers that furround them, till per-
haps they are diffipated and vanifli away.
When I came more particularly to confider of the
real danger I had for fo many years efcaped; how I
had walked about in the greateft fecurity and tran-
quility, at a time, perhaps, when even nothing but
the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the common ap-
proach of night, had interpofed between me and the
deftru£r.ive hands of the cannibals, who would devour
me with as good an appetite, as I would a pigeon
or curlieu; furely all this, 1 fay, could not but make
me fincerely thankful to my great Preferver, whofe
Cngular protection I acknowledged with the greateft
humility, and without which I muf t inevitably have
fallen into the cruel hands of thofe devourers.
Having thus difcufled my thoughts in the cleared
manner, according to my weak underftanding, I
next proceeded to confider the wretched nature of
thefe deftroying favages, by feeming, though with
great reverence, to enquire, why God fhould give
up any of his creatures to fuch inhumanity, even to
brutality itfelf, to devour its own kind? But as this
was rather matter of abftrufe fpeculation, and as my
miferable fituation made me think this of mine the
moft uncomfortable fituation in the world, I then
began rather to enquire what part of the world thefe
wretches lived in; how far oil' the coaft was from
whence they came; why they ventured over fo far
from home; what kind of boats conveyed them hi-
ther; and why 1 could not order myfelf and my bu-
finefs fo, that I might be as able to attain their coun-
try, as they were to come to my kingdom?
But then, thought I, how fliall 1 manage myfelf
when I come thither? what will become of me if
I fall into the hands of the favages? or how fhall I
efcape from them, if they make an attempt upon me?
and
and fuppofing I mould not fall into their power, what
will I do for provifion, or which way fhall I bend my
courfe! Thefe counter-thoughts threw me into the
greateft horror and confufion imaginable; but then
I ftill looked upon my prefent condition to be the
moft miferable that poffibly could be, and that nothing
could be worfe, except death. For (thought I) could
I but attain the fhore of the main, I might perhaps
meet with fome relief, or coaft it along, as I did with
my boy Xury, on the African fhore, till I came to
fome inhabited country, where I might meet with
fome relief, or fall in with fome Chriftian fhip that
might take me in; and if I failed, why then I could
but meet with death, which would put an end to all
my miferies. Thefe thoughts, I muft confefs, were
the fruit of a diftempered mind, an impatient temper
made defperate, as it were, by long continuance of
the troubles and the difappointments I had met with
in the wreck, where I hoped to have found fome living
perfon to fpeak to, by whom I might have known ifi
what place I was, and of the probable means of my
deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were agitated,
my refignation to the will of heaven was entirely fuf-
pended; fo that I had no power to fix my mind to any
thing, but to the project of-a voyage to the main
land. And indeed fo much was I inflamed upon this
account, that it fet my blood into a ferment, and my
pulfe beat high, as though I had been in a fever, till
nature being, as it were, fatigued and exhaufted with
the very thoughts of it, made me fubmit myfelf to a
CJent repofe.
Jn fuch a fituation, it is very ftrange, that I did not
dream of what I was fo intent upon; but, inftead of
it, my mind" roved on a quite different thing, altoge-
ther foreign. I dreamed, that as I was ifluing from
my caftle, one morning, as cuftomary, 1 perceived
upon the fhore, two canoes, and eleven favages, co-
ming to land, who had brought with them another In-
dian, whom they defigned to make a facrifice of, in
I a order
order to devour; but juft as they were going to give
the fatal blow, methought the poor defigned victim
jumped away, and ran directly into my little thick
grove before my fortification, to abfcond from his e-
nemies; when perceiving that the others did not fol-
low him that way, I appeared to him; that he hum-
bly kneeled down before me, feeming to pray for my
affiftance; upon which I Chewed^ him my ladder,
made him afccnd, carried him to my cave, and he
became my fervant; and when I had gotten this man,
I faid to myfelf, Now furely I may have fome hopes to
attain the main-land; for this fellow will ferve me as
a pilot, tell me what to do, and where I muft go for
provifions; what places, to fhun, what to .venture to,
and what to efcape. But when I awaked, and found
all thefe inexpreffible impreffions of joy entirely va-
nifhed, 1 fell into the greateft dejection of fpirit ima-
ginable.
Yet this dream brought me to reflect, that onefure
way of efcaping was to get a favage; that after I had
ventured my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws
of liis devourers, the natural fenfe he might have of
fuch a prefcrvatioh, might infpire him with a lafting
gratitude and moft fincere affection. But then this
objection reafonably interpofed: How can I effect
this (thought i) without I attack a whole caravan of
them, and kill them all? why mould I proceed on fuch
a defperate attempt, which my fcruples before had
fuggefted to be unlawful? and indeed my heart trem-
bled at the thoughts of fo much blood, tho' it were a
means to procure my deliverance. 'Pis true, I might
reafonably enough fuppofe thefe men to be real enemies
to my life, men who would devour me, was it in their
power; fo that it was felf-prefervation in the highefr.
degree to free myfelf, by attacking them in my own de-
. fence, as lawfully as if they were actually afiaulting
me: though all thefe things, I fay, feemed to me to be
of the greateft weight, yet, as I juft faid before, the
dreadful
dreadful thoughts of fhedding human Mood, ftruck
fiich a terror to my foul, that it was a long time be-
fore I could reconcile myfelf to it.
But how far will the ardency of defire prompt us
on? For, notwithftanding the many difputes and
perplexities I had with myfelf, I at length refolved,
right or wrong, to get one of thefe favages into my
hands, cod what it would, or even though I fhould
lofe my life in the attempt. Infpifed with this firm
refolution, I fet all my wits at work, to find out
what methods I fhould take to anfwer my defign:
this, indeed, was fo difficult a tafk, that I could not
pitch upon any probable means to execute it: I,
therefore, refolved continually to be in a vigilant po-
fture, to perceive when the favages came on fhore,
and to leave the reft to the event, let the opportuni-
ties offer as they would.
Such were my fixed refolutions; and accordingly
I fet myfelf upon the fcout, as often as I could, till
fuch time as 1 was heartily tired of it. I waited for
above a year and a "half, the greatefl part of which
time I went out to the weft, and fouth weft corner
of the ifland, almoft every day, to look for canoes;
but none appeared. This was a very great difcou-
ragement; yet, though I was very much concerned,
'the edge of my defire was as keen as ever, and the
longer it feemed to be delayed, the more eager was
I for it: in a word, I never before was fo careful to
fhun the loathing fight of thefe favages, as I was
no\v eager to be with them: and I thought myfelf
fufficiently able to manage one, two, or three fava-
ges, if I had them, fo as to make them ^ny entire
flaves, to do Vhatfoever I fhould direct them, and
prevent their being able at any time to do me a mif-
chief. Many times did I ufe to pleafe myfelf with
thefe thoughts, with long and ardent expectations;
but nothing prefenting, all my deep proje£ted
fchemes, and numerous fancies, vanifhed away, as
though, while I retained fuch thoughts, the decree
I 3 ~ of
of Providence was fuch, that no favages were to
come near me.
About a year and a half after, when I was ferioufly
mufing of functry other ways how I fhould attain my
end, one morning early I was very much furprifed by
feeing no lefs than five canoes all on fhore together on
my fide the ifland, and the favages that belonged to'
them all landed, and out of my fight. Such a num-
ber of them difconcerted all my meafures ; for, feeing
fo many boats, each of which would contain fix, and
fometimes more, I could not tell what to think of it,
or how to order my meafures, to attack twenty or
thirty men fingle handed: upon which, much difpL-
rited and perplexed, I lay ftill in my caftle; which,
however, 1 put in a proper pofture for an attack; and,
having formerly provided all that was necefiary, was
foon ready to enter upon an engagement, fhould they,
attempt it. Having waited for fome time, my impa-
tient temper would let me bear it no longer; I fet my
guns at the foot of my ladder, and, as ufual, afcend-
ed up to the top of the hill at two ftages, Handing,,
however, in fuch a manner, that my head did not ap-
pear above the hill, fo that they could not eafily per-
ceive me : .and here, by the affiftance of my perfpeo
tive glafs, I obferved no lefs than thirty in number,
around a fire, feafting upon what meat they had dreff-
ed: how they cooked it, or what it was, I could not
then perfectly tell j but they were all dancing and>
capering about the flames, ufmg many frightful and-
barbarous geftures.
But while, with a curious eye, I was beholding thefe
•wretches, my fpirits funk within me, when I percei-
ved them drag two miferable creatures from the boats*
to act afrefh the dreadful tragedy, as I fuppofed they
had done before. It was not long before one of them
fell upon the ground, knocked down, as I fuppofe,
with a club or wooden fword, for that was their man-
ner; while two or three others went immediately to
work, cutting him open for their cookery, and then
fell.
to devour him as they had done the former;
•while the laft unhappy captive was left by himfelf, till
fach time as they were ready for him. The poor
creature looked round him with a wifhful eye, trem-
bling at the thoughts of death; yet, feeing himfelf a
little at liberty, nature, that very moment, as it were,
infpired him with hopes of life: He ftarted away from
them, and raft, with incredible fwiftnefs, along the
fands, direclly to that part of the coaft where my an-
cient and venerable caftle flood.
You may well imagine, I was dreadfully affrighted,.
upon this occalion, when, as I thought, they purfued
him in a whole body, all running towards my palace.
And now, indeed, I expected, that part of my dream
was goingtobe fulfilled, and that he wo'uld certainly
fly to my grove for protection; but, for the reft of
my dream, I could depend nothing on it, that the fa-
y-ages would purfue him thithers and find him there..
However, my fpirits beginning to recover, I ftill kept,
upon my guard; and I now plainly perceived, there
were but three men out of the number that purfued:
him. I was infinitely pleafed with what fwifcnefs the
poor creature ran from his purfuers, gaining fo much,
ground of them,- that I plainly perceived, could he
thus hold it for half an hour, there was not the leaft
doubt but he would fave his life from the power of his.
enemies.
Between them and my caftle there was a creek, that
very fame which I failed into with all my effects from
the wreck of the ship, on the fteep banks of which I
very much feared the poor viclim would be taken, if
he could not fwim for his efcape': But foon was-I out
of pain for him, when .1 perceived he made nothing
of it, though at full tide, but, with an intrepid cou-
rage, fpurred on by the fenfe of danger, he plunged
into the flood, fwimming over in about thirty ftrokes,
and then landing, ran with the fame incredible ftrength
and fwiftnefs as before. When the three purfuert
Cams to the creek, one of them, who I perceived
could
could not fwim, (happily for his part), returned back
to his company) while the others, with as equal cou-
rage, but much lefs fwiftnefs, attained the other fide,
as though they were refolved never-to give over their
purfuit. And now or never I thought was the time
for me to procure me a fervant, companion, or affift-
ant; and that I was decreed by Providence to be the
inftrument that fhould fave this poor creature's life. J
immediately defcended my two ladders with the great-
eft expedition; I took up my two guns, which, I faid:
before, were at the bottom of them: and, getting upa-
gain with the fame hafte towards the hill, I made near-
er the fea. In a word, taking a fhortcut down the hill.
I interpofed between the purfuers and purfued, halloo-
ing aloud to the latter, who, venturing to look back,
was, no doubt, at firft, as much terrified at me as I at
them. I beckoned to him, with my hand, to return
back, in the mean time advancing towards the pur-
fuers, and rufhing on the foremoft, I knocked hint
down with the flock of my piece, and laid him flat
on the ground. I was very unwilling to fire, let the
reft fhould hear, though, at that diftance, I queftioned
whether they could or no; and, being out of fight of
the fmoke, they could not eafily have known what to
make of it. The other favage feeing his fellow fall,
flopped as if he had been amazed; when, advancing
towards him, I could perceive him take his bow from
his back, and, fixing an arrow to it, was preparing to
fhoot at me, and, without difpute, might have lodged
the arrow in my breaft; but, in this abfolutely ne-
ceflary cafe of felf-prefervation, I immediately fired
at him, and fliot him dead, juft as his hand was going
to draw the fatal firing. All this while, the favage who
had fled before ftood ftill, and had the fatisfaction to
fee his enemies killed, as he thought, who defigned
to take away his life: fo affrighted was he with the
fire and noife of my piece, that he ftood as it were
like Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without either
fenfe or motion. This obliged me to halloo to him
.again,
again, making the plaineft figns I could to him to draw
nearer. I perceived he underftood thefe tokens by his
approaching to me a little way, when, as if afraid I
mould kill him too, he flopped again. Several times
did he advance, and as often flop in this manner, till,
coming more to ray view, I perceived him trembling,
as if he was to undergo the fame fate. Upon which
I looked upon him with a fmiling countenance, and
ftill beckoning to him;.at length he came clofe to me,
and kneeled down, kifled the, ground, laid his head
upon it, and taking me by the foot, fet it upon
his head: and this, as I underftood afterwards, was
a token of fwearing to be my flave for ever. I took
him up, and, making much of him, encouraged him
in the beft manner I could. But my work was not
yet finifhed; for I perceived the favage whom I knock-
ed down, was not killed, but ftunned with the blow,
• Snd began to come to himfelf. Upon which I pointed
to my new fervant,. and mewing him that his enemy
was not yet expired, he fpoke fome words to me, but
•which I could not underftand; yet being the firft
found of a man's voice I had heard for above twenty-
five years, they were very pleafing to me. But there
was no time for reflection now, the wounded favage
recovering himfelf fo far as to fit upon the ground,
which made my poor prifoner as much afraid as be-
fore; to put him out of which fear, I p^efented my o-
ther gun at the man, with an intent to fhoot him; but
my favage, for fo I muft now call him, prevented my
firing, by making a motion to me, to lend him my
fword, which hung naked in a belt by my fide. No
fooner did I grant his requeft, but away he runs to his
enemy, and at one blow cut off his head as dexterouf-
ly as the moft accomplifhed executioner in Germany
could have done: for, it feems, thefe creatures make ufe
of wooden fwords made of hard wood, which will bear
edge enough to Cut off heads and arms at one blow.
When this valorous exploit was done, he comes to me
laugh-
laughing, as a token of triumph, delivered me my
fword again, with abundance of furprifing geftures,
laying it along, with the bleeding and ghaftly head of
the Indian at my feet.
The greateft aftonifhment that my new fervant con-
ceived, was the manner of killing the favage at fuch a
diftance, without a bow and arrow: and fuch was his
longing defire to know it, that he firft pointed to the
dead carcafe, and then made figns to me to grant him
leave to go to him. Upon which I bid him go, and,
as well as I could, made him fenfible I granted his
requeft. But when he came there, how wonderfully
was he ftruck with amazement! Firft he turned him
on one fide, then on another, wondering he could
perceive no quantity of blood, he bleeding inwardly:
and after fufficiently admiring the wound the bullet
had made in his breaft, he took up his bow and arrows,
and came back again; upon which I turned to go a-
•way, making many figns to him to follow, left the
reft miffing their companions, might come in purfuit
of him. And this I found he underftood very well,
by his making me underftand that his defign was to
bury them, that they might not be feen if it happen-
ed; and which by figns again I made him fenfible I
very much approved of. Immediately he fell to work,
and never was grave-digger more dexterous in the
world than he was; for in an inftant, as 1 might fay,
he fcraped a large hole in the fands with his hands,
fufficient to bury the firft in; there he dragged him,
and without any ceremony he covered him over; in
like manner he ferved the other: fo that I am fure no
undertaker could be more expert in his bufmefs; for
all this was done in lefs than a quarter of an hour. I
then called him away, and inftead of carrying him
direclly to my caftJe at firft, I conveyed him to my
cave on the farther part of the ifland: and fo my
dream was not fulfilled in that particular, that my
grove fhould prove an afylum or fanctuary to him.
Weary
Weary and faint, hungry and thirfty, undoubted-
ly muft this poor creature be, fupported chiefly by
that vivacity of fpirit, and uncommon tranfports of
joy that his deliverance occafioned. Here I gave him
bread and a hunch of raifins to eat, and water to
drink, on which he fed very cheerfully, to his exceed-
ing refrefhment. I then made him a convenient bed,
with a parcel of rice ftraw, and a blanket upon it, (a
bed which I ufed myfelf fometimes), and then point-
• ing to it, made figns for him to lie down to fleep, up-
on which the poor creature went to take a welcome
repofe.
Indeed he was a very comely handfome young fel-
low, extremely well made, with ftraight long limbs,
not too large, tall and well fhaped, and, as near as I
could reckon, about twenty-fix years of age. His
countenance had nothing in it fierce or furly, but
rather a fort of majefty in his face; and yet, efpe-
cially when he fmiled, he had all the fweetnefs and
foftnefs of an European. His hair was not curled
like wool, as many of the blacks are, but long and
black, with the moft beautiful, yet carelefs, trefles
fpreading over his fhoulders. He had a very high
and large forehead, with a great viv;city and fpark-
ling fIrarpnefs in his eyes. His fkin was not fo tawny
as the Virginians, Brazilians, or other Americans;
but rather of a bright dun olive colour, that had
fomething agreeable in it, though not very eafy to
give a def'cription of. His face was round and plump,
with a fniall nofe, very different frcm the flatnefs of
the negroes, a pretty fmall mouth, thin lips, fine
teeth, very weil fet, and white as the driven fnow.
In a word, fuch handfome features, and exact fym-
mctry in every part, made me confider, that I had
faved the life of an Indian prince, no lefs graceful
and accomplifhcd than the great Oroonoko, whofe
memorable behaviour and unhappy contingencies of
life have charmed the world, both to admiration of
his perfon, and compaffion to his fufferings.
But
But let him be either prince or 'peafant, all my
happinefs centered in this, that I had now got a good
fervant or companion, to whom, as he deferved, I
was refolved to prove a kind mafter and lafting
friend. He had not, I think, flept above an hour,
•when he awakened again, and while I was milking
my goats hard by, out he runs from the cave towards
me in my inclofure, and laying himfelf down on the
ground in the loweft proftration, made all the antic
geflures imaginable, to exprefs his thankfulnefs to
me for being his deliverer. I confefs, though the
manner of his behaviour feemed to be ludicrous e-
riough to occafion laughter; yet I wai very much
moved at his affection, fo that my heart melted with-
in me, fearing he might die away in excefs of joy,
like reprieved malefactors; efpecially as I was inca-
pable either to let him blood, or adminifter phyfic.
It were to be wifhed, that Chriftians would take ex-
ample by this Heathen, to have a lafting remem-
brance of the benefits and deliverances they have re-
ceived,*by the kind mediation and powerful interpo-
fition of their benefactors and deliverers; and, it
would likewife be happy for mankind, were there no
occafion to blame many, who, inftead of thankfully
acknowledging favours and benefits, rather abufe and
contemn thofe who have been the inftruments to fave
them from definition.
But, leaving thefejuft reflections, I return to the
'object that occafioned them; for my man, to con-
clude the Lift ceremony of obedience, laid down his
head again on the ground, clofe to my foot, and fet
my other foot upon his head, as he had done before,
making all the figns of fubjection, fervitude, and fub-
miffion imaginable, to let me underftand he would
ferve me as long as his life endured. As I under-
ftood him in many things, I made him fenfible 1 was
very well pleafed with him; and, in a little time, I
began to fpeak to him, and learn him how to talk
to me again. In the firft place, I made him un-
derftand
derftand his name was to be Friday, becaufe it was
upon that day I faved his life: then I taught him to
fay Mailer, which I made him fenfible was to be my
name. I likewife taught him to fay Yes and No,
and to know what they meant. I gave him fome
milk in an earthen pot, making him view me while
I drank it before hirn, and foaked my bread in it; I
gave him a cake of bread, and caufed him foak it like-
wife, to which he readily confented, making figns of
the greateft fatisfactien imaginable.
All that night did I keep him there; but no fooner
did the morning light appear, when I ordered him to
arife, and come along with me, with certain tokens
that I would give him fome clothes like mine, at which
he feemed very glad,~ being ftark naked, without the
leafl covering whatever. As we paffed by the place
where the two men had been interred, my man pointed
directly to their graves, fhewing me the marks that he.
had made to find them again, giving me to underftand,
by figns, that we mould dig them up, anddevourthem.,
At this I appeared extremely difpleafed, exprefled my
utmoft abhorrence, as if I would vomit at the apprehen-
fions of it, beckoning with my hand to come away,
which he did with the greateft reverence and fubmif-
Con. After this I conducted him to the top of the hill,
to view if the reft of the favages were yet remaining
there ; but when I looked through my perfpe£Hveglafs,
I could fee no appearance of them, nor of their canoes;
fb that it was very evident they never minded their de-
ceafed companions whom we had flain; which if they
had, they would furely have fearched for, or left one
boat behind for them to follow, after they returned,
from their purfuit.
Curiofity, and a defire of fatisfaction, animating me
with courage to fee this fcene of barbarity, I took my
man Friday with me, putting a f^ord' into his hand,
with the bow and arrows at his back, which I per-
ceived he could ufe very dextroufly,. caufing him to
K cany
carry one gun for me, and I two for myfelf; and
thus equipped againft all attacks, away we marched
directly to the place of their bloody entertainment.
But when I came there, I was ftruck with the utmoft
horror at fo dreadful a fpectacle, whilft Friday was
no way concerned about it, being no doubt in his
turn one of thefe devourers. Here lay feveral hu-
man bones, there feveral pieces of mangled flefh,
half eaten, mangled and fcorched, whilft ftreams of
blood ran promifcuoufly as waters from a fountain.
As I was mufing on this dreadful fight, Friday took
all the pains he could, by particular figns, to make
me underfland, that they had brought over four
prifoners to feaft upon, three of whom they had
eaten up, and that he was the fourth, pointing to
himfelf: that there having been a bloody battle be-
tween them and his great king, in the juft defence
of whom he was taken prifoner, with many others;
all of thefe were carried off to different places, to be
devoured by their conquerors; and that it was his
misfortune to be brought hither by thefe wretches
for the fame purpofe.
After I was made fenfible of thefe things, I caufed
Friday to gather thofe horrid remains, and lay them
together upon a heap, which I ordered to be fet on
fire, and burnt them to afhes: my man, however, ftill
retained the nature of a cannibal, having a hanker-
ing ftomach after fome of the flefh: but fuch an
extreme abhorrence did I exprefs at the leaft appear-
ance of it, that he durft not but conceal it: for I
made him very fenfible, that if he offered any fuch
thing, I would certainly fhoot him.
This being done, I carried my man with me to my
caftle, and gave him a pair of linen drawers, which
I had taken out of the poor gunner's, cheft before
mentioned; and which, with a little alteration, fitted
him very well: in the next place, I made him a jer-
kin of goat-fkin, fuch as my fkill was able to ma-
nage, and indeed I thought myfelf then a tolerable
good
good tailor. I gave him alfo a cap, which I made
of a hare's fkin, very convenient and fafhionable.
Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man was "no
lefs proud of his habit, than I was in feeing him in
it. Indeed he went very awkwardly at firft, the
drawers being too heavy on his thighs, not ufed to
bear any weight, and the fleeves of the waiftcoat
failed his moulders, and the inGde of his arms; but
y a little eafing where he complained they hurt him,
and by ufing hunfelf to them, at length he took to
them very well.
My next concern was, where I fhould lodge him:
and that I might do well by him, and yet be perfect-
ly eafy myfelf, I ercifled a tent for him in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in the infide of
the laft, and the outfide of the firft: and as there was
an entrance or door into my cave, I made a formal
framed door-cafe, and a door to open on the inGde;
I barred it up in the night time, taking in my lad-
ders too, fo that, was my man to prove treacherous,
there could be no way to come at me in the infide of
my innermoft wall, without making fo much noife in
fetting over, that it mutt-needs waken me; for my
rft wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, fpreading over my tent, and leaning up to the
fide of the mountain, which was again laid crofs
with fmaller fticks inftead of laths, and thatched over
a great thicknefs with the rice ftraw, which \vas as
ftrong as reeds; and at the hole of the place, left on
purpofe to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a
kind of a trap-door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outfide, would not have opened at all, but have
fallen down, and made a great noife; and as to my
weapons, every night 1 took them all to my bed fide.
But there was no occafion for this precaution; for
furely never mafler had a more fincere, faithful, and
loving fervant than Friday proved to me. Without
paffiofi, fullennefs, or defign, perfectly obliging and
K i engaging,
engaging, his affections were as much tied to me, 39
thofe of a child to his parents; and I might venture to
fay, he would have facrificed his life for the faving
mine, upon any occafion whatfoever. And indeed
the many teftimonies he gave me of this, fufficiemly
convinced me that I had no occafion to ufe thefe pre-
cautions. And here I could not but reflect, with
great wonder, that however it hath pleafed the Al-
mighty in his providence, and in the government of
the creation, to take from fo great a part of the world
of his creatures, the nobleft ufes to which their facul-
ties, .and the powers of their fouls are adapted 5 yet
that he has beftowed upon them the fame reafon, af-
feclions, fentiments of kindnefs, and obligation, paf-
fions of refentment, fincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing and receiving good that he has
given us; and that when he is gracioufly pleafed to
offer them occafions of exerting thefe, they are as
ready,' nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper
ufes for which they were beftowed, than we often.
are. Thefe thoughts would make me melancholy,
efpeciaHy when I confidered how mean a ufe we
make of all thefe, even though we have tbefe powers
enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, and by the
knowledge of his word, as an addition to our under-
ftanding ; and why it has pleafed the heavenly wifdom
to conceal the like faving knowledge from fo many
millions of fouls, who would certainly make a much,
better ufe of it than generally mankind do at this
time. Thefe reflections would fometimes lead me
fo far» as to invade the fovereignty of providence, andr
as it were, arraign the juftice of fuch an arbitrary-
difpofition of things, that mould obfcure' that light
from fome, and reveal it to others, and yet expeft a
like duty from all. But I clofed it up, checking ray
thoughts with this conclufion ; firjl, That we were
ignorant of that right and law by \vhich thefe fhould
be condemned; but tfiat as the Almighty was necef-
ferily, and by the nature of his eflence, infinitely juft
and
and holy; fo it could not be otherwife, but that if
thefe creatures were all deftined to abfence from him-
felf, it was on account of finning againft that light,
which, as the fcripture fays, was a law to themfelves,
and by fuch rules as their confciences would acknow-
ledge to be juft, though the firil foundation was not
difcovered to us> And, fecondly, That ftill as we
were the clay in the hand of the potter, no veflel could
thus fay to him, Why haft thou fafhioned me after
this manner?
I had not been above two or three days returned to
my caftle, but my chief defign was, how I fhould
bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding; and,
to take from him that inhuman relifh he by nature
had been accuftomed to, I thought it my duty to let
him tafte other flefh, which might the rather tempt
him to the fame abhorrence I fo often expreffed a-
gainft their accurfed way of living. Upon which, one
morning I took him out with me, with an intentif -\
to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home, and
drefs it. As I was going, I perceived a fhe-goat ly-
ing down in the fhade, and two young kids fitting by
her. Immediately I catched hold of my man Friday,
and bidding him ftand ftill, and not ftir, I prefented
my piece, and fhot one of the kids. My poor fervant,
who had at a diftance perceived me kill hisadverfary,
and yet did not know by what means, or how it was
done, flood trembling and furprifed, and looked fo a-
mazed, that I thought he would have funk into the
earth. He did not fee the kid I aimed at, or behold I
had killed it, but ripped up his waiftcoat to fee if he
was not wounded, thinking my refolution was to kill
him; for coming to me, he fell on his knees, earnefi-
ly pronouncing many things which I did not under-
ftand the meaning of; which at length I perceived
was, that I would not take.away his life.
Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that
condition, where nature is upon the fevereft trial,
when the immediate hand of death is ready to put for
K. 3 ever
ever a period to this mortal life: and indeed fo much
corr>paffion had I to this creature, that it was with dif-
ficulty I refrained from tcars. But, however, as ano-
ther fort of countenance was neceflary, and to convince
him that I would do him no harm, I took him, fmi-
ling, by the hand, then Inughed at him, and pointing,
to the kid which I had fL;in, made figns to him to fetch
it, which accordingly he did. No Jefs curious was
he in viewing how the creature was killed, than he
had been before in beholding; the Indian; which, while
he was admiring at, I charged my gun again, and pre-
fcntly perceived a great fowl like a hawk,perching upon
a tree within fhot ; and, therefore, to let Friday under-
fland what I was going to do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which I found to be a parrot. I
made him* underftnnd that I would fboot and kill that
bird j accordingly I. fired, and bade him look, wheij
immediately he faw the parrot fall down. Again he
I.ood like one amazed, notwithstanding all I had faid
to him; and the more confounded he was, becaufc he
did not perceive me put any thing into my gun. Un*
doubtedly a thing fo utterly ftrange, carrying death
along with it, far or near, either to man or beaft, muft
certainly create the greater aftonifhment to one whe-
never had heard of fuch a thing in his whole life; and
really his amazement continued fo long, that had I al-
lowed it, he would have proftrated hirafelf before me
and my gun, with the greateft worfhip and adoration.
As for the gun in particular, he would not fo much as"
fufler his fingeis to touch it for feveral days after;
but would come and communicate his thoughts to it,
and talk to it, as if the fenfelefs piece had underftood
and anfwered hi'm: all this I could perceive him do,
•when he thought my back was turned, the chief in-
tent of which was, to defire it not to kill him, as I
afterwards came to underhand.
I never ftrove to prevent his admiration, nor hin-
der him from thofe comical geftures he ufed on fuch
occafions';
occafiong; but when his aftonifhment was a little fl-
yer, I made tokens to him to run and fetch the par-
rot that I had mot; which he accordingly did, flaying
fome time longer than ufual, by reafon the bird, not
being quite dead,- had fluttered fome way farther
from the place where fhe fell. In the mean time, as
he-Was looking for her, I took the advantage of char-
ging'my gun again, that fo I might be ready for any
.other mark that offered; but nothing more occured
. at that time. So I brought home the kid, and the
fame evening took off the fkin, and divided the car-
cafe as well as I could. Part of this flefh I ftewed
and boiled, in a pot I had for this purpofe. And then
fpreading my table, I fat down, giving my man fome
of it to eat, who was wonderfully pleafed, and feem-
ed to like it very well; but what was moft furprifing
to him was to fee me eat fait with it: upon which he
made me to underhand, that the fait was very bad for
me: when putting a little into his mouth, hefeemed
to naufeate it in fuch a manner, as to fpit and fputter
at it, and then warned his mouth with' frefh water:
but to fhew him how contrary his opinion was to mine,
I put fome meat into my mouth without fait, and
feigned to fpit and fputter as much fo. the want of it,
as he had done at it: yet all this proved of no figni-
fication to Friday; and it was a long while before he
could endure fait in his meat or broth, and even then
but a very fmall quantity.
Thus, having fed him fufficiemly with boiled meat
and broth at that time, the next day I was refolved
to feaft j^im with a roafted piece of the kid. And
having no fpit to faften it, nor jack to turn it, I made
ufe of that common artifice which many of the people
of England have, that is, to fet two poles upon each
fide of the fire, and one crofs on the top, hanging the
meat thereon with a ftnng, and fo turning round con-
tinually, roaft it in the fame manner as we read
bloody tyrants of old cruelly roafted the holy mar-
tyrs. This prattice cauled. great admiration 'in my
man
man Friday, being quite another way than that to
which the favages were accuftomed. But when he
came to taflc the fweetnefs and tendernefs of the flefh,
he exprefled his entire fatisfa&ion above a thoufand
different ways. And as I could not but underftand
his meaning, you may be fure I was as wonderfully
pleafed, efpecially when he made it alfo very plain to
me, that he would never, while he lived, eat man's
flefh more.
It is now high time I fliould fet my fervant to
work; fo, next day, I put him to beat out fome corn,
and fift it in the fame manner as I had done before.
And really the fellow was very quiet and handy in
the execution of any thing I ordered him to go about.
I made him underftand that it was to make bread for
us to eat, and afterwards let him fee me bake it. In
fhort, he did every thing as I ordered him, in a little
time, as well as 1 could perform it myfelf.
But now confklering that I had two mouths to feed
inftead of- one, it was neceflary that I muft provide
more ground for my harveft, and plant a larger quan-
tity of corn than I commonly ufed to do; upon which
I marked out a larger piece of land, fencing it in, in
the fame manner as I had done before; in the execu-
tion of which I mult give Friday this good word,
that no man could work more hardy, or with better will
than he did: and when I made him fenfible that it
was for bread to ferve him as well as me, he then
very paffionately ma'de me underftand, that he thought
1 had much more labour on his account, than I had
for myfelf; and that no pains or diligence fhould be
wanting in him, if I would but direft him'in thofe
•works wherein he might proceed.
I muft certainly own, that this was the moft plea-
fant year I ever had in the iflaiid; for, after fome time,
Friday began to talk pretty well, and underftand the
names of thofe things which I was wont to call for,
and the places where I ufed to fend him. So that my
long filent tongue, which had been ufelefs fo many
years,
years, except in an exclamatory manner, either for
deliverance or bleffings, now began to be occupied in
teaching, and talking to my man Friday; for indeed
I had fuch a fingular fatisfaction in the fellow him-
felf, fo innocent did hisfimple and unfeigned honefty
appear inore and more to me every day, that I really
began entirely to love him; and for his pnrt, I be-
lieve there was no love loft, and that his nature had
been more charmed-with my exceeding kindnefs, and
his affections more placed upon me, than any other
object whatfoever among his own countrymen. I
once had a great mind to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again: and by this
time having learned him Englifh fo well, that he could
give me tolerable anfwers to any queftion which I
demanded, I afked him, whether that nation to which
he belonged, ever conquered in battle? This queftion
made Friday to fmile, and to which he anfwered yes,
yes, -we al-waysjight the better; as much as to fay, they
always got the better in fight. Upon which we pro-
ceeded on the following difcourfe: You fay, faid I,
that you always fight the better; why then, Friday,
how came you to be taken prifoner?
Friday. But for all that, my nation beat much.
Mafter. How, fay you, beat! if your nation beat
them, how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many mans than my nation in.
the place where me was, they take one, two, three
and me: my nation much overheat them in the yon-
der place where me no was, there my nation mans
beat one, two, three great toufaud.
Mafter. Then why did not your men recover you
from the hands of your enemies?
Friday. They run one, two, or three, and me;
they make all go in the canoo; my nation have no
canoo that time.
Mafter. 'Tis very well, Friday; but what does
your nation do with the prifoners they take? Do they
carry them away and eat them as thefe have done?
Friday,
Friday. Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat
up all.
Mafter. To what place do they carry them to be
devoured? .
Friday. Go to other nations where they think.
Mafter. Do they bring them hhher?
Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other
place. .
Mafter. And have you been with them here, Fri-
day?
Friday. Yes, me been here, (fainting to the north-
•wejl of the i/land, bfing the fide -where they vfed to
land.) ''
Thus having got what account I could from my
man, I plainly underftood, that he had been as bad
as any of the reft of the cannibals, having been for-
merly among the favages who ufed to come on fbore
on the fartheft part of the ifland, upon the/ame bloody
occafions as he was brought hither for: and fome time
after I carried him to that place where he pointed;
and no fooner did he come there, but he prefently
knew the ground, Signifying to me that he was once
there when they ate up twenty men, two women, and
a young child; but as he could not explain the num-
ber in Eng/i/c, he did it by fo many (tones in a row,
making a fign to me to count them.
This paflage 1 have the rather mentioned, becaufe
it led to things more important and ufeful for me to
know: for after 1 had this fatisfactory difcourfe with
him, my next queftion was, how far it was from the
ifland to the fhore, and whether the canoes were not
often loft in the ocean ? to which he anfwered, There
was no danger; that no canoes were ever loft; but
that after a little way out to the fea, there was a
ftrong current, and a wind always one way in the af-
ternoon. This I thought at firft to be no more than
the fets of the tide, of going out or coming in; but
I afterwards underftood it was occafioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko,
in
in the mouth or gulf of which I imagined my king-
dom lay; and that the land which I perceived to the
W. and N. W. muft be the great ifland Trinidad, on
the north of the river. A thoufand queftions (if that
would fatisfy me) did I afk Friday, about the nature
of the country, the fea, the coafts, the inhabitants,
and what nations were neareft them; to which que-
ftions the poor fellow declared all he knew, with the
greateft opennefs, and utmoft fincerity. When I de-
manded of him the particular names of the various
nations of his fort of people, he could only anfwer
me in general, that they were called Carafe. Hence
it was I confidered that thefe muft be the Caribbees,
fo much taken notice of by our maps, to be on that
part of America, which reaches from the mouth of
the river Oroonoko to Guiania, and fo on to St Mar-
tha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, that, up a
great way beyond the moon, as much as to fay, beyond
the fetting of the moon, which muft be W. from their
country, there dwelt white-bearded men, fuch as I
was, pointing to my whifkers, and that they kill much
mans. I was not ignorant with what barbarity the
Spaniards treated thefe creatures; fo that I presently
coucluded jt muft be them, whofe cruelties had fpread
throughout America, to be remembered even to fuc-
eeeding generations.
Well, you may be fure, this knowledge, which the
imperfect information of my man had led me to, was
very comfomble to me, and made me fo curious as
to afk him, how I might depart from this ifland, and
get among thofe white men? He told me, Yes, yes, t
might go in two canoes. In two canoes, thought I,
what does my man mean? Surely he means one for
himfelf, and another for me; and if not, how muft
two canoes hold me without being joined, or one
part of my body being put in one, and another in the
other? And, indeed, it was a long while before I un-
derftood his meaning, which was, that it muft be a
large boat, as big as two canoes, able to bear with
the
the waves, and not fo liable to be overwhelmed as
one muft be.
I believe there is no ftate of life but what may be
happy, if people would but endeavour for their part
to make it fo. He is not the happieft man that has
the moft riches, but he that is content with what he
hath. Before I had my fervant, I thought myfelf
miferable till I had him; and now that I enjoyed the
happy benefits of him, I ftill complained, and begged
a deliverance from a place of retirement, eafe, and
plenty, where Providence had fufficiently blefled me.
In a word, from this time I entertained fome hopes,
that one time or other I might find an opportunity to
make my efcape from this ifland, and that this poor
favage might be a great furtherance thereto.
All the time fince my man became fo intelligent as
to underftand and fpeak to me, I fpared no pains .nor
diligence to inftruct him, according to my poor fhare
of knowledge, in the principles of religion, and the
adoration that he ought to pay to the True Cod. One
time, as I very well remember, I afked him who made
him? At firit the innocent creature did not under-
ftand what I meant, but rather thought I afked him
who was bis father? Upon which I took another way
to make him fenfihle, by demanding from him an an-
fwer to this queftion. Friday, faid I, who is it that
made the fea, this ground whereon we walk, and all
thefe hills and woods which we behold? And here,
indeed, I did not mifs of my .intention; for he told
me, it was old Benamuckee (the god whom I fuppofed
thefe favages adored) who lived a great way beyond
all. But as for his attributes, poor Friday was an
utter ftranger. He could .defcribe nothing of this
great per Ton; and all that he could fay was, that he
was very old, much older than the fea and land, the
moon, or the liars. Friday, (faid I again), if this
great and old perfon has made all things in the world,
how comes it to pafs, that all things, as you in par-
ticular, do not adore and worfhip him? Upon this,
looking
looking very grave, with a perfect fweet look of in-
nocence, be replied, Mafter, all things fay 0 to him,
by which it may reafonably be fuppofed he meant ado-
ration. And where, faid I, do the people of your
country go when they die? He anfwered, they all go
to Benamuckee. Wb,at, and thofe people that are eaten
up, do they go there? Benamuckec, laid he, love 'em
dearly; me pray to Benamiickee in de canoe, and Bena-
muchee -wou'd love me -when dey eat me all up.
Such difcourfes as thefe had I with my man, and
fuch made mefenfible, that the true God is wormip-
ped, though' under imperfect fimilitudes; and that
the falfe adoration which the Heathens give to their
imaginary deity, is as great an argument of the divine
eflence, as the moft learned Atheifts/^^/yyi culled)
can bring againft it: for God will be gloriSed in his
works, let the denomination be what it will; and 4
cannot be of that opinion which fome conceive, that
God fhould decree men to be damned for want of a
right notion of faith, in a place where the wifdom ot
the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached';
and therefore cannot but conclude, that fince obedi-
ence is the beft facrifice, thefe poor creatures, acting
by that light and'knowledge which they are poflefli-d
with, may undoubtedly obtain a happy fak'ation,
though not that enjoyment with Chrift, as his faints,
confeflbrs, and martyrs muft enjoy.
But laying thefe determinations afide, rrtore'fit for
•divines than me to difcufs, I began to inftrutr. my
Servant in the faving knowledge ot the {rue Deity, in
which the directions of God's Holy Spirit affifted me.
Llifted up my hands to heaven, and pointing thereto,
told him, that the great Maker of heaven and earth
lived there: that as his'infinite power fafhioned this
world out of a confufed chaos, and made it in that
beautiful frame which we behold, fo he governs and
preferves it by his unbounded knowledge, fovereign
greatnefs, and peculiar providence: that he was omni-
potent, could do every thing for us, give every thing
L to
to us, and take every thing away from us : that he was
a rewarder and punifherof good and evil aclions: that
• there was nothing but what he knew, no thoughts fo
iecret but what he could bring to light; and thus, by
degrees, I opened his eyes, and described to him the
manner of the creation of the world, the fituation of
paradife, the tranfgreffion of our firft parents, the wic-
kednefs of Gotl's peculiar people, and the univerfal
fins and abominations of the whoie earth. When
thefe things were implanted in his mind, I told him,
that as God's juftice was equal to his mercy, he refol-
»ed to deftroy this world, till his Son Jefus Chrift in-
terpofed in our behalf; and,toprocureour redemption,
obtained leave of his heavenly father to come down
from heaven into the world, where he took human na-
ture upon him, inftru&ed us in our way -to eternal
life, and died as a facrifice for our fins; that he was
now afcended into heaven, mediating for our pardon,
delivering our petitions, and obtaining all thofe good
benefits which we afk in his name, by humble and
hearty prayers, all which were heard at the throne of
heaven. As very frequently I ufed to inculcate things
into his mind, Friday one day told me, that if our
great God could hear us beyond the fun, he muft fure-
ly be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived
but a little way off, and yet could not hear them till
they afcended the great mountains where he dwelt, to
fpeak-to him. What, faid I, Friday, did you go thi-
therto fpeak to him too? He anfwered, No, they ne-
ver went that were young men, none but old men cal-
led their Oowa/iakef, meaning the Indian priefts, who
went to fay 0, (fo he called faying their prayers), and
they returned back, and told them what Benamuc-
kec faid. From hence, I could not but obferve how
happy we Chriftians are, who have God's immediate
revelation for our certain guide; and that our faith is
neither mifled, nor our reafon impofed upon, by any
fet of men, fuch as thefe Indian impofters.
But,
But,to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Fri-
day, I told him, that the pretence of their ancient
men going up to the mountain to fay O to their god
Benamuckee was an impofture, and that their bring-
ing back an anfwer was all a fham, if not worfe; for
that, if there was any fuch thing fpoken to them, fure-
ly it muft proceed from an infernal fpirit. And here
I thought it neceffary to enter into a long difcoui fs
with him, which I did after this manner.
Friday, (faid I), you muft know, that before this
world was made, there was an almighty Power exift-
ing, by whofe power all things were made, and whofe
Majgfty fhall have no end. To be glorified and ado-
red by beings of a heavenly nature, he created angels
and arch-angels, that is, glorious fpirits refembling
himfelf, to encompafs his throne, eternally finging
forth his praife in trte rnoft heavenly founds and di-
vine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir, Lu*
cifer bore a great fway, as being then one of the pe-
culiar favourites of thefe celeftial abodes; but he,
contrary to that duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign,
•with unbounded ingratitude to his divine Creator,
not only envied him that adoration which was his
due, but thought to ufurp that throne which he had
neither power to keep, nor title to pretend to. He
raifed a diffenfion and civil war in heaven, and had
a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded fol-
ly! ftupendous pride! thus to hope for victory, and
afpire above his powerful Creator! The Deity, not
fearful of fuch an enemy; yet juftly provoked at this
rebellion, commiffions his arch-angel Michael to lead
forth the heavenly hoft, and give him battle; the
advantage of which was quickly perceived, by Satan's
being overthrown, and the prince of the air, (for fo
the devil was called) with all his fallen angels, driven
headlong into a difmal place, which is called Hell.
The recital of this truth made my man give the
greateft attention, and he exprefied a great fatisfac-
tion by his geftures, that God had fent the devil into
L a, the
the deep hole. And then I defired him to give gfeat
hei d to what I had further to fay.
No fooner (proceeded I) was God freed from, and
the heavens clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father
fpeaks to the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to
his effence, and were equal to him in power and glory,
Come let us make man, (faid he) in our own image, after
our own likencfs> Gen. i. 26. to have dominion over
the creatures of the world which we have created.
And thefe he intended fhould glorify him in heaven,
according to their obedience in this ftate of probation
on earth, which was, as it were, to be the fchool to
train them up for thefe heavenly manfions. N^ow,
(?atan feeing him foiled; yet, that God had not ta-
ken the power from him as prince of the air, which
power Heaven defigned he fhould retain, whereby
his creatures might be tried; in revenge for the dif-
grace he had received, he tempts Adam's wife, Eve,
to tafte of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
which God had forbidden. He appears to her in the
fhape of a ferpent, then a moft beautiful creature,
and tells her, that it was no better than an impofi-
tion which God had put upon her and her hufband,
not to eat of that fair fruit which he had created;
that the tafte thereof would make them immortal like
.God himfelf; and confequently as great and power-
ful as he. Upon which fhe not only eat thereof her-
felf, but made her hufband eat alfo, which brought
them both under the heavenly difplealure.
Here Friday exprefled a great- concern; Ah> poor
jftans! (cried he) ndugkty -wctnans! naughty devil!
make Cad not Idve de tnans, make mans like devil him*
fetf.
Friday, faid I, God ftill loved mankind; and tho'
the devil tempted human nature fo far, he would not
fuffer him to have an abiolute power over them. I
have told you before of his tender love to his people,
till they, like Lucifer, difobeyed his commands and
•rebelledagainfthim; and even then,how Jsfus Chrift,
his
his only Son, came to:fatefinners. jBut ftill every
rpan that liycs in the world is undec temptatipn ani}
triaj. The devil has yet a power, as prince of the"
ftir, to fuggeft evil cogitations into our minds, and
prompt us on to wicked actions, that he might glory
in our deftruction. "VYhatever evil thoughts we have-
proceed from him; fo that God, in this our diftrefs,
expects we fhould apply ourfelves to him by fervent
prayer for fpeedy redrefs. He is not like Benamiukee,
to let none come near him but Oa-waknkee, but fu/rers
the people as well as prieRs to offer themfelves at his
feet, thereby to be delivered from the power and temp-
tation of the devil.
: But though at firft my man Friday exprefled fbme
concern at the wickednefs of Lucifer, I found it not
fo eafy to imprint the right notions of him in his
mind, as it was about the divine eflencc of God: for
there nature affi.fr.ed me in all my arguments, to (hew-
to him plainly the neccffity of a great firft caufe, and
over-ruling governing power^of a fecrct directing
Providence, and of the equity fcnd reafonableuefs of
paying adoration to our Creator; whereas there ap-
peared nothing of all this in the nption pf an evil-
fpirit,.of his firft beginning, bis nature, and, above allf
, of his inclination to evil actions, and his power to
tempt us to the like. And indeed this unlearned In-
dian, by the mere force of nature, puzzled me wiih
one particular queftion, more than ever I eouid have
expected.
I had, it feems, one day, Been talking to him of
the omnipotent power of God, and his infinite abhor-
rence of fin, infomuch that the fcriptures ftyled him
a. confumingfire to all the workers of iniquity; utul
that it was in his power, whenever lie pleaied, to de-
ftroy all the world in a moment, the greater part of
which are continually oil-ending him.
-, When, with a ferious attention, he had .Mcncd .1
great while to what I faid, after I had been telling
him how the devil was God's enemy in thehcarts of
men, and ufed all his malice and fkill to defeat the
good defigns of Providence, and deftroy the kingdom
of Chrift in the world, and fo forth: Very well, ma-
fter, faid Friday, you fay God is fo ftrong, fo great,
is he not much ftrong, much mightier than the
naughty devil? To be fure, Friday, faid I, God is
more wife, and ftronger than the ferpent: he is above
the devil., which makes us pray to him, that he would
tread down Satan under our feet, enable us to refifl
his violent temptations, and quench his fiery darts.
Why then, anfwered Friday quickly, if Cod, as you
fay, has muck Jirong, much might as the devil, -why Cod
no kill devil, make no more tempt, no more do tvicked.
\'ou may be certain, I was ftrangely furprifed at
this queftion of my man's; and, though an old man»
I was but a young doctor, a-nd confequently very ill
qualified fora cafuift, or a refolver of intricate doubts
hi religion. And, as it required fome time for me to
ftudy for an anfwer, I pretended not to hear him,
nor to afk him what Ije fa-id: But, fo earneft was he
for an anfwer, as not to forget his queftion, which he
repeated in the very fame broken words as above.
"When I had recovered myfelf a little, Friday, faid I,
Cod-will at laft punijh him feverely, being refer-vedfof
judgment, and' is to be ccift into the bottcmlefs pit, t»
remain in fire everlq/ling. But all this did not fatif-
fy Friday; for, returning upon me, he repeated my
vords, RESERVE AT LAST, me no under/land; but,
inhy net kill devil no-w, not kill devil, great, great -whilg
ago? Friiiay, faid I, yeu may as well afk me why
God does not kill you and me, when, by our wicked
actions, we fo much offend his Divine Majefty? Ha
gives us time to repent of our fins, thai thereby we
may obtain pardon. At thefe words, obtain pardon,
Friday mufed a great while ; and, at laft, looking me
ftcdfaftly in the face, Well, -well, -faid he, that's very
liiells foyou, f, devil, all.-wickedmans, all freJervfy
repent, Cod pardon all. «
Indeed, here I was- run down to the lafl extremity,
when
when it became very evident to me, how mere natu-
ral notions will guide reafonable creatures to the
knowledge of a Deity, and to the homage due to the
fupreme being of God; but, however, nothing but
divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jefus
Chrift, and of a redemption purchafed for us, of the
Mediator of the new covenant, and of an interceflbr
at the footftool of God's throne; and, therefore, the
gofpel of our Lord and Saviour Jefus Chrift; that is,
the Word and Spirit of God, promifed for the guide
and fanclifier of his people, are the moft neceflary in-
ftructors of the fouls of men, in the faving knowledge
of the Almighty, and the means to attain eternal hap-
pinefs.-
And now I found it neceflary to put an end to this
difcourfe between my man and me; for which pur-
pofe I rofe up haftily, and made as if I had fome oc-
eafion to go- out, fending Friday for fomething that
was a good way off. I then fell on my knees, and
befeeched God that he would infpire me fo far as to
guide this poor favage in the knowledge of Cbrift, to
anfwer his queftions more clearly, that his confcience
might be convinced, his eyes opened, and his foul
faved. When he returned again, I entered into a
very long difcourfe with him, upon the fubjecl; of the
world's redemption by the Saviour of it, and the
do&rine of repentance preached from heaven, toge-
ther with an holy faitb in our blefled Redeemer Jefuj
Chrift: and then I proceeded to explain to him, ac-
cording to- my weak capacity, the reafon why our Sa-
viour took not on him the nature of angels, but ra-
ther the feed of Abraham; and how the fallen angels
had-no benefit by that redemption; and, laftly, that
he came only to the loft fheep of the houfe of Ifrael,
and the like. God knows I had more fmcerity than
knowledge in all the ways I took for this poor In-
dian's inftru£U0n; and, I muft acknowledge, what I
believe every body that a£b upon the fame principle
will find, that in laying heavenly truths open before
him,
him, I informed and inftructed myfelf in many things,
that either I did not know, or had not perfe£tly con-
fidered before; fo that, however this poor creature
might be improved by my inftruction, certain it is,
. that I myfelf had great reafon to be thankful to Pro-
vidence for fending him to me. His company allayed
my grief, and "made my habitation comfortable; and,.
Trhen I reflected, that the folitary life to which I had
been fo long confined, had made me to look further
towards heaven, by making me the inftrument, under
Providence, to fave the life, and for aught I know,
the foul of this poor favage, by bringing him to the
knowledge of Jefus Chrili, it caufed a fecret joy to
fpread through every part of my foul; and I fre-
quently rejoiced, that ever I was brought to this place,
which I once thought the moft miferable part of th»
world. , .• , '.
In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards
continue, while I abode on the ifland, and for three
years did my man and I live in the greateft enjoyment
of happinefs. Indeed, I believe the favage was' as
good a ChrifHan. asjI.; aiid I hope we were equally
penitent; and.fuch penitents as were comforted an4
reftored by God-'s Holy Spirit; for now we had the
word of the Lord to inftruct us in the right way, as
much as if we had been on the Englifh fhore.
By the conftant application I made of the Scrip-
tures, as I read them to my man Triday, I earneftfy
endeavoured to make him underftand every part of it,
as much as lay in my power. He alfo, on the other
hand, by his very ferious queftions and inquiries,
pnade me a much better proficient in fcripture know-
ledge, than I fhould have been by my own private
reading and fludy. I muft not omit another thing,
proceeding from the experience I had in my retire-
ment: It was that infinite and inexprcflible bleiJing,
the knowledge of God through Jefus Chrift, which
was fo plain and eafy to he underftood, as immediate-
ly to direct me to carry on the great work of fincere
repentance
repentance for my fins, and laying hold of a Saviour
for eternaMife, to a practical flared reformation, and
obedience to all God's inftitutions, without the affift-
ance of a reverend and orthodox divine; and cfpe-
cially by this fame inftruction, fo to enlighten this fa-
vage creature, as to make him fo good a Chriftian,
as very few could exceed him. And there was only
this great thing wanting, that I had no authority to
adminifter the holy facrament, that heavenly partici-
pation of Chrift's body and blood; yet, however, we
refted Ourfelves content, that God would accept our
defires, and according to our faith, have mercy on us.
But what we wanted one way, was made up in a-
nother, and that was univerfal peace in our little
church. We had no. difputes and wranglings about
the nature and equality of the holy, blefled, and un-
divided Trinity; no niceties in dbctrine, or fchemes
of church government; no four and morofe diffen-
ters to impofe more fublimated notions upon us; no
pedant fophiflers to confound .us with unintelligible
myfteries: but, inftead of all this, -we enjoyed the
rnoft certain guide to heaven; that is, the word of
God; befides which, we had the comfortable views
of his Spirit leading us to the truth, and making us
both willing and obedient to the inftcuctioM of his
•word. As the knowledge and ."practice of this are
the principal means of falvation, I cannot fee what
it avails any ChrUtian Church, or man, in the world,
to amufe himfelf with fpeculations anJ opinions, ex-
cept it be to difplay their particular vanity and affec-
tation. ';,
You may well fuppofe, that, by the frequent difr
courfe we had together, my man and me became moft
intimately acquainted, and that there was but very
little that I could fay, but what Friday undcrilood j
and, indeed, he fpoke very fluently, though it was but
broken Englifh. I now took a particular pleafure in
relating all my adventures, efpecially thofe that oc-
curred liuce my being caft on this ifland. I made
him
him underftand that wonderful myftery, as he con-
ceived, of gun powder and bullet, and taught him
how to fhoot. I alfo prefented to him a knife, which
pleafed him exceedingly, making him a belt, with a
frog hanging thereto, like thofe in which we wear
hangers in England; and, inftead of a hanger to put
in the frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only
a good, but even a better weapon upon many occafi-
ons. In a word, my man thus accoutred, looked up-
on himfelf as great as Don Quixote, when that ce-
lebrated champion went to combat the windmill.
I next gave him a very particular defcription of
the territories of Europe, and in a particular manner
of Old-England, the place of my nativity. I laid be-
fore him the manner of our worfiupping God, our
behaviour one to another, and how we trade in fhips
to every part of the univerfe. I then told him my
misfortunes in being fhipwrecked, fhowing him, as
near as I could, the place where the fhip lay, which
had been gone long before; but I brought him to the
ruins of my boat, which before my whole ftrength
could not move,' but now was almoft rotten, and
fallen to pieces. I obferved my man Friday to view
this boat with an uncommon curiofity; which, when
he had done, he flood pondering a great while, and
faid nothing. At laft, faid I, Friday, what makes
you ponder fo much? He replied, 0 mafter, me fee
like boat come ta place at my nation.
It was fome time, indeed, before I underftood what
my man meant j but examining ftri£Uy into it, I
plainly found, that fuch another boat, refenfbling mine»
had come upon the country where he dwelt; that is
to fay, by his farther explanation, that the boat was
driven there through violent ftorms and ftrefs of wea-
ther. It then came into my mind, that fome Euro-
pean fhip having been caft away, the poor diftrefled
creatures were forced to have recourfe to the boat to
fave their lives; and being all, as I thought, drown-
ed, I never concerned myfelf to afk any thing con-
cerning
earning them, but my only inquiry was about the
boat, and what defcription my man could give of it.
Indeed Friday anfwered my demands very well,
making every thing very plain to my underftanding;
but beyond meafure was I fatisfied, when he told me,
with great warmth and ardour, 0 majler, we fave
•white mans from drown; upon which I immediately
afked him, if there were any white mans, as he called
them, in the boat; Yes, yes, faid he, the boat full,
very full of-white mans. How many, Friday? faid I.
Hereupon he numbered his fingers, and counted fe-
venteen. And when I afked him what became of
them all, and whether they lived or not? he replied,
Yes, mafter, they all live, they be live among my nation,
This information put frefh thoughts into my head,
that thefe muft be thofe very men who before I con-
cluded had been fwallowed up in the ocean, after they
had left their fhip, that had itruck upon the rocks of
my kingdom, and after efcaping the fury of the deep,
landed upon the wild fhare, and committed them-
felves to the fury of the devouring Indians.
The manner of their cruelties to one another, which
confequently, as I thought, muft be acted with greater
barbarity to ftrangers, created in me a great anxiety,
and made me ftill more curious to afk Friday'concern-
ing them. He told me he was fure they flill lived there,
having refided among them above four years, and
that the favages gave them victuals to live upon. But
pray, Friday, faid I, whence proceeded all this good
nature and generofity? How came it to pafs that they
did not kill and eat them, to pleafe their devouring
appetites; and occafion fo fplendid an entertainment
among them? No, no, faid Friday, they not kill 'em,
they make brother -with 'em; by which I underftood
there was a truce between them. And then I had a
more favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday's
uttering thefe words : My nation, t' other nation no cat
tnans, but -when mans make war jigkt; as though he
had faid, that neither thofe of his kingdom, nor any
other
other nations that he knew of, ever ate their fellow-
creatures, but fuch as their law of arms allowed to
be devoured; that is, thofe miferable captives, whofe
misfortune it fhould be to be made prifoners of war.
Some confiderable time after, upon a very pleafant
day, in moft ferene weather, my man and I flood up
on the top of a hill, on the eaft fide of the ifland,
whence 1 had once before beheld the continent of
America. I could not tell immediately what was the
matter; for fuddenly Friday fell a jumping and dan-
cing as if he had been mad; and upon my demand-
ing the reafon of his behaviour, 0 joy, faid he, 0glad!
there fee my country, there my nation, there live-white
mans gether. And indeed fuch a rapturous fenfe of
pleafure appeared in his countenance, that his eyes
had an uncommon fparkling ami brightnefs, and fuch
a ftrange eagernefs, as if he had a longing defire to
be in his own country again. This made me not fo
well fatisfied with my man Friday as before; for by
this appearance, I made no difpute, but that if he
could get back thither again, he would not only be
unmindful of what religion I had taught him, but
likewife of the great obligation he owed me for his
wonderful deliverance: nay, that he would not only
inform his countrymen of me, but accompany hun-
dreds of them to my kingdom, and make me a mi-
ferable facrifice like thofe unhappy wretches taken in
battle.
Indeed I was very much to blame to have thefe
cruel and unjuft fufpicions, and muft freely o\vn I
wronged the poor creature very much, who was of a
quite contrary temper. And had he had that difcern-
ing acutenefs which many Europeans have, he would
certainly have perceived, my coldnefs and indifference,
and alfo have been very much concerned upon that
account; 3s I was EOV- more circurnlpect, I had
much leflened my kindnefs and familiarity with him,
and while this jealoufy -continued, I uicd that art-
ful way (now too mucn in fafhion, the occafion, of
itrife
ftrife and difleution) of pumping him daily, thereby
to difcover whether he was deceitful in his thoughts
and inclinations: but certainly he had nothing in
him but what was confiftent with the befl principles,
both as a religious Chriftian and a grateful friend;
and, indeed, I found every thing he faid was fo inge-
nuous and innocent, that I "had no room for fufpicion,
and, in fpite of all uneafinefs, he not only made me
entirely his own again, but alfo caufed me much to
lament that I ever conceived one ill thought of him.
As we were walking up the fame hill another day,
when the weather was fo hazy at fea, that I could
not perceive the continent, Friday, faid I, don't you
wifh yourfelf to be in your own country, your own
nation, among your old friends and acquaintances?
Yes, faid he, me much 0 glg.d te be at my own nation.
And what would you do there, Friday ( Would you
turn wild again, eat mans flefti, and be a favage as
you were formerly? No, no, (anfwered he, full of
concern, and fhaking his head), Friday noio tell them
to live good, tell them pray Cod, tell them to eat corn-
bread, cattle flejh, milk, no eat man again. But Cure-
ly, replied I, if you fhould offer to do all this, they will
kill you; and ro manifeft their contempt of fuch in-
ftruclion, eat you up when they have done. He then
put on a grave, yet innocent and fmooth counte-
nance, faying, No, they no kill me, they willing love
searn: that is, that they would be very willing to
learn: adding withal, that they had learned much of
the bearded mans that-come in the boa.t. Will you,
faid I, go back again, Friday? He fmiled at that, and
told me, that he could not fwim fo far. But, faid I, I
will make a canoe for you: Yes, majlcr, faid he, me
go if you go, me no go ifyoiijlay. I go, Friday! why,
would you have them eat me up, and devour your
kind mafter? No, no, faid he, me make them net eat
inafter, me make they much love IQU-, that is, he would
tell them how I had flain his enemies, and thereby
M faved
faved his life, for which reafon he would make them
love me: and then he related to me, as well as he
was able, bow exceeding kind thofe of his nation
were to the white, or bearded men, as he called them,
who, in their great calamity, were driven into their
country.
It was from this time, indeed, I had ftrong incli-
nations to venture over, and ule my utmoft efforts,
if poffible, to join thefe white bearded men, \vho un-
doubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguefe; for, thought
I, it muft be certainly a better and lafer way to efcape
when there is a good company, than for me alone,
from nn ifland forty miles off the fhore, and without
any affiftance. Some days after, Friday and I being
at work, as ufual, at the fame time diverting ourfelves
with various difcourfes, I told him I had a boat which
I would bellow upon him, whenever he pleafed to re-
turn to his own nation: and to convince him of the
truth of whnt 1 fnid, I took him with me to the other
fide of the ifland, where my frigate lay, and then ta-
king it from under the water, (for 1 always kept it
funk for fear of a difcovery) we both went into it to
fee how it would manage iucli an expedition.
And really never could any be more dexterous in
rowing than my faithful fervant, making the boat go
as faft again as I could. Well, now, Friday, faid I,
fnnll we now go to your fo much defired nation ? But in-
ftead of meeting with that cheerfulnefs I expected, he
looked very dull and melancholy at my faying fo;
which indeed at firft furprifed me, till he maUe.me
fenfible, that his concern was about the'boat's being
too fmall to go fo ar a voyage. Upon which I let
him underftand I had a much bigger ; and, according-
ly, the next day woit to the place where the firft boat
Jay, which I had made, when all the rtrength I had,
or art I could uic, failed me in my attempt to get it
into the water; but now it having Iain in the fun
two and twenty years, and no care being taken of it
all that while, it became in a manner ,otten. My
man
man told me, that fuch a boat would do very well to
the purpofe, fufficient to carry enough vittle, dring,
bread, for that was his manner of talking. In fhort,
my mind being firongly fixed upon my defign of go-
ing over with him to the continent, I very plainly
told him, that we would both go and make a boat full
as big, and more proportionable than that, wherein he
might fafely return to his own nation. >
Thefe words made Friday look fo very penfive,
that I thought he would have fallen at my feet. It
was fome time before he could fpeak a word, which
made me afk him, what was the matter with him?
He replied, in a very foft and moving tone, JVh.it has
poor Friday done" -wby are you angry mad -with poor fcr-
vant? what me done, 0 -what me done? Friday, faid I,
.you never yet have offended me: what makes you
think I am angry with you, when I am not angry at
all? You no angry, no angry, (aid he feveral times; if
•you lie no angry, -why den fend Friday over great water
to my own nation'? \Vhv, iurely, Friday, anfwered I,
did you not wifh to be there, when, from a mountain,
you beheld the place where you was born? and is it
not to fatisfy your defires that I am willing to give
you leave to return thither.? Yes, yes, faid Friday, me
inift) be there fare enough, but me den -wifli mafter there
too: no "wijh Friday there, no mafter there. In fhort,
he could not endure the thoughts of going there with-
out me. I go there, Friday, faid I, what fhall I do
there? He anfwered very quickly, 0 ma/ter, you
do great deal much good,you teachallde -wildmans to be
good tame mans: you learn dem to Is fober, live good
life, to kno-ui God, and pray God. Alas! poor Friday,
faid I, what can I do againft their priefts of Bena-
muckee, or indeed what good can I make your nation
fenlible of, when I myfelf am hut a poor ignorant
man? No, no, mafter, faid he, you It? no ignorant, you
teachee me good, you teachee dem good. You fhall go
without me, Friday, faid, I, for I don't care to ac-
company you thither; I would rather live in this fo-
M 2 liiude
litude than venture among fuch inhuman favages. Go
your way, fince you defire it, and leave me aJone by
myfelf, as I was before I faved your life.
Never was any creature more thunder-ftruck than
Friday was at rheie words. Co me a-way, leave mafter
a-way, faid he, after a long filence, no, no, Friday diei
Friday live not mafter gone; as though he had faid,
I neither can nor will live, if my mafter fends me
irom him. And here I cannot but take notice of the
ftroug ties of friendfhip, which many times farpafs
thofe of confanguinity: For often we find a great dif-
agreement among kindred; and, when there is any
feeming regard for each other, it is very feldom true,
and fcarce ever lafting, if powerful intereft does not
bear the fway; and that alone is often the occafion
of the greateft hatred in the world, which is to defire
the death of parents and relations, for the fake of ac-
quiring their fortunes. But there was no fuch thing
between my fervant and me: inftead of which there
•was the greateft gratitude, and the moft fincere love;
he found me net only his deliverer, but his preferver
and comforter; not a fevere and cruel tyrant, but a
kind, loving, and affable friend. He wanted for no
manner of fuftenance; and, when he was ill, or out
of order, I was his phyfician, not only for his body,
but his foul; and iherefore no wonder was it, that
fuch an innocent creature, long fince divefted of his
former natural cruelty, fhculd have an uncommon
concern at fo cruel a feparation from me, which
pierced him to the very foul, and made him defire e-
ven to die, rather than live without me.
After I had told Fridayi in a very carelefs manner,
that he mould be at his liberty as foon as the boat was
made, the language of his eyes exprefled all imagi-
nable confufion; when, immediately running to one
of his hatchets, vhich he ufed to wear as a defenfive
•weapon, he gives it into my hand, with a heart fo
full, that he could fcarcely fpeak. Friday, faid I,
•what is it you mean? What, muft I do with this?
Qnly
Only kill Friday, faid he, Friday care not live long..
But what muft I kill you for? replied I again. Ak.1
dear mafter, -what made you Friday fave from eat a me
up,fo keep long Friday, make Friday love Cod, and not
love Benamuckee, and new Friday fend auay, never
fee Friday mare. As though the poor creature had
faid, Alas, my deareft kind mafter, how comes it to
pafs, that, after having ventured your precious life to
fave me from the jaws of devouring cannibals like
myfelf, after fuch a tender regard to provide for me
fuch a comfortable nourifhment, and continuing fo
long a kind mafter, and a moft fincere friend; and
after making me forfake the falfe notion of an Indian
deity, and worfhip the true God in fpirit and in
truth-: after all this, how comes it now, that you are
willing to fend me away to my former courfe of li-
ving, by which means undoubtedly we fhall be dead
to each other; but greater muft be my misfortune,
that I fhall never behold my beft friend I have in the
world any more. And this undoubtedly, though he
could not exprefs himfelf fo clearly, muft be his fen-
timents; for the tears ran down his cheeks in fuch a.
plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain
from weeping alfo, when I beheld the poor creature's
affection; fo that [ was forced to comfort him in the
beft manner I could, which 1 did, by telling him, if
he was content to abide with me, I fhould be ever
willing to keep him.
After Friday's grief was fomething abated, more
fully to convince me of his afrection, he faid, O ma~
Jler, me not care to be in my nation, leave you here; me
defire nation lea-rn good, that's all; meaning, that his
defire was for the converfion of that barbarous people.
But as I had no apoftolic miffion, nor any concern
about their falvation; fo'I had not the leall intention
or defire of undertaking it: and the ftrength of my
inclination, in order to efcape, proceeded chiefly from
my late difcourfe with Friday, about theie feventeen ^
white, bearded men, that had been driven upon the
M 3 barbarian
barbarian coaft, whom I defigned to join, as the only
means to further our efcape. To which intent my
mnn and I went to fearch for a proper tree to fell,
•whereof we might make a large periagua or canoe,
to undertake the voyage: arid, indeed, we were not
long in finding one fit for our purpofe, there being
enough of wood in the ifland to have built a fleet of
large veffels, but the thing we principally wanted
was, to get one fo near the water, that we might
launch it after it was finifhed, and not commit fo
horrid a miftake as I had done once before.
Well, after a great fearch for what was beft and
moft convenient, Friday at Ml, whofe judgment in
fuch affairs was much fuperior to mine, pitches upon
a kind of wood the moil fitting for it. To this
day I cannot teM the name of the tree, nor defcribe
k any other way, than only by faying, that it is very
like what we caH/a/?;c, or betwixt that and the Ni-
caragua wood, being much of the fame colour and
fmell. But though my man exceeded me in the
knowledge of the moft proper tree, yet I fhewed him
a much better and cleaner way to make a canoe than
ever he knew before: for h« was for burning the
hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make this
boat; but I then told him how we might do it with
tools, learning him at the fame time how to ufe
them, which indeed he did very dexteroufty; fo that in
a month's labour we finifhed it, making it very hand-
fome, by cutting the outfide into the true fhape o£
a boat. After this it took us a full fortnight before,
•we eould get her into the water, which we did, as it
were, inch by inch, upon great rollers: but when fhe
was in, fhe would have carried twenty men, with alt.
the eafe imaginable.
As I was very well pleafed, you may be fure, at the
launching of this man of war of mine, I was no lefs
amazed to behold with what dexterity my mart,would
manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. Weil,.
Friday, faid I, what do you think of it now? Do you
think
think this will carry us over? Yes, inafter, faid he,
me venture over -we'l, though great bloi,, -wind. But
my dcfign was yet farther, which he was infenfible of;
and that was to make a maft and fail, and to provide
her with an anchor and cable. As to a maft, that
•was no difficult thing at all to procure; fo I fixed
epon a ftraight young cedar-tree, which I found near
the place, great plenty of it abounding in the ifland;
and fetting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti-
cular directions how to fhspe and order it; but as to
the fail, that I managed myfelf. I very well knew I
had fome old ones, or pieces of fails enough, which
had lain fix and twenty years by me; but not being
careful to preferve them, as thinking I fhould have
no occafiort to ufe them any more, when I came to
look them over, I found them almoft all rotten, ex-
eept two; and with thefe I went to work, and after
'a great deal of pains and awkward tedious ftitching
for want of needles, at length I finifhed a three-cor-
nered ugly thing like what we call in England a
fhoulder of mutton fail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little fmall fprit at the top, like thofe which
our longboats ufe, and which I very well knew how
to manage; efpecially fince it was like that which I
had in my patron's fifhing boat, when, with my boy
Xury, I made my efcape from the Barbarian fhore.
It was near two months, I think, before I comple-
ted this work, that is, the rigging, and fitting my
maft and fails; and indeed they were nicely done,
having made a fmall ftay, and a fail, or forefail to it,
to affift, if we fhould turn to the weftward; and,
which was flill more, I fixed a rudder to the ftern 6f
ber, to fteer with ; and though I was but a very inV
different fhipwright, yef, as I was femible of the
great ufefulnefs and abfolute neceffity of a thing like-
this, I applied myfelf to it with fuch a conftant ap-
plication, that at lall I accomplifhed my defign; but
•what with the many dull contrivances I had about it,
and the failure of many things, it coil me as much pains
• •' in.
in ordering as in making the boat. Befides, when alF
this was done, I had my man to teach what belonged
to its navigation: for though he very well underftood
how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter ftran-
ger to a fail and a rudder, and was amazed when he
faw me work the boat ta and again in the fea, by
them, and how the fail gibbed and filled this way or
that way, as the courfe we failed changed. After
fome time, and a little ufe, I made all thefe things
very familiar to him, fo that he became an expert
failor, except in relation to the compafs, and that I
could make him underftand but little of. But, as it
happened, there were fcldom occafion for it, there
being but little cloudy weather, and fcarce ever any
fog in thofe parts; the ftars were always vifible in the
night, and the fhore perfpicuous by day, except in
the rainy feafon, which confined every, one to his
habitation.
Thus entered in the feven and twentieth year ef
my reign, or captivity, which you pleafe, (the laft
three of which, bleffed with the company of my man'
Friday, ought not to be reckoned), I kept the annL-
verfary of my landing here, with the fame thankful.-
nefs to God, for his tender mercies, as I did before j.
and certainly, as I had great caufe for a thankful ac-
knowledgment for my deliverance at firfl, I had
much greater now, for fuch fingular and additional
teftimonies of the care of Providence over me, in all
my diftreffes both of body and mind, and the great
hopes I had of being effectually and fpeedilv: deliver-
ed; for I had a ftrong impreffion upon my mind,
that I fhould not be another year in this ifland. But,
however, 1 ftill continued on with my hufbandry,
digging, planting, and fencing, as ufual ; gathering
and curing my grapes, and doing all other things
that were necefiary.
And now the rainy feafon beginning to come on,
obliged me to keep the longer within doors; but be-
fore this, I brought my new vefl'd into the creek,
where
where I had landed my rafts from the fhip, and ha-
ling her up to the fhore, I ordered my man Friday to
dig a dock fufficient to hold her in, and deep enough
to give her water, wherein fhe might float; and then,
when the tide was out, we made a ftrong dam crofs
the end of it, to keep out the water; by which means
(he lay dry, as to the tide from the fea; and to keep
the rain from her, we thatched her over, as it were,
with boughs of trees, like a houfe; and fo we waited
for the months of November and December, in which
I defigned to venture over the ocean.
No Iboner did the feafonable weather begin to draw
near, but fo much was I elevated with this new de-
Cgned adventure, that I daily prepared for the voy-
age. The firft thing I.thought on was, to lay by a
certain quantity of provifions, as a fufficient ftore for
fuch an expedition, intending in a week or fortnight's
time to open the dock, and launch out the boat for
that purpofe. But one morning as I was very bufy
upon fomething neceflary for this occafion, I called
Friday to me, and bid him go to the fea fhore, and
fee if he could find a turtle or tortoife, a thing which
•we commonly had once a week, as much upon ac-
count of the eggs, as for the lake of the flefh. -He
had not been long gone, but he came running back,
as though he was purfued for life, and as it were flew
over my outward wall, or fence, like one that felt not
the ground, or fteps he fet his feet on; and before I
had time to enquire the reafon of his precipitation,
he cries out, 0 dear ma/ler, 0 forrt-w! for row ! Bad!
0 bad! Why, what's the matter, Friday? faid I. Ot
yonder, yonder, faid he, there lie one, two, or three
canoes! t-wo, three. Surely (thought I) there muft be"
fix, by my man's way of reckoning; but, on a ftricter
inquiry, I found there were but three. Well, Friday,
faid I, don't be terrified, I warrant you we^will not
only defend ourfelves againft 'em, but kill the moft
of thefe cruel favages. But though I comforted him
in the beft manner I could, the poor creature trembled
fo, that I fcarce knew what to do with him: 0, ma.-
Jler> faid he, they come look Friday, cut pieces Friday,
cut a me up. Why, Friday, faid I, they will eat me
up as well as you, a,nd my danger is as great as yours.
But fince it is fo, we muf t refolve to light for our
lives. What fay you? can you fight, Friday? Yes,
faid he very faintly, mejhcot, me kill u-hat I can, but
there come great many number. That's no matter,
faid I again, our guns will terrify thofe that we do not
kill: I am very willing to ftand by you to the laft drop
of my blood. Now, tell me, if you will do the like by
me, and obey my orders in whatfoever I command?
Friday then anfwered, 0 majler, me lofc life for you, me
die -when you bid die. Thus concluding all queflions
concerning his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a
good dram of rum, (of which I had been a very good
hufband), and gave it him to comfort his heart.
After he had drank it, I ordered him to take the two
fowling pieces, which we always carried, and load
them with large fwan fhot, as big as fmall piftol bul-
lets; then I took four mufkets, and loaded them with
two flugs, and five fmall bullets each; charging my
two piftol s each with a brace, I hung my great fword,
as cuftomary, naked to my fide, and gave Friday his
hatchet, as a moft excellent weapon for defence.
Thus prepared, I thought as well of myfelf as any
knight-errant that ever handled a fword and fpesr. I
took my perfpective glafs, and went'up to the fide of
the hill, to fee what I could difcover ; and I perceived
very foon, by my glafs, that there were one and twen-
ty favages, three -prifoners, and three canoes; and
that their chief concern feemed to be the triumphant
banquet upon the three poor human bodies, a thing
which by this time I had obferved was very common
with them. I alfo remarked, that they did not land
at that place from whence Friday made his efcape,
bur nearer to the creek, where the fhore was low,
and where a thick wood came very clofe to the fea.
My foul was then filled with indignation and abhor-
i rence
reiice at fucb. inhuman wretches, which 'put a period
to all my fermer thoughts in their vindication; nei-
ther would I give myfelf time to confider their right
of conqueft, as I had done before; but defeending
from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and told
him, I was refolved to go fpeedily to them and kill
them all; afking him again, in the fame breath, if he
•Would ftand by me? When by this time being reco-
vered from his fright, and his fpirit much cheered with
the dram I had given him, he wns very pleafant; yet
ferioufly telling me, as he did before, When I kiddie,
he -would tife.
And now it was, having fixed my refolution in fo
ftrong a manner, that nothing could diveft my breaft
of its uncommon fury. I immediately divided the
Joaded arms betwixt us. To my man Friday I gave z
piftol to flick in his girdle, with three guns upon his
fhoulder, a weight too great I confefs to'bear; but
•what muft a poor king do, who had but one foldier in
the world? But to fhew I made him bear no more
than what I would lay on myfelr, I ftuck the other
piftol in my girdle, and other three guns upon my
fhoulders; nay fomething more, but that was like
.^Efop'.s burden, a.fmall bottle of rum, which,was
foon lightened to our exceeding refreibment. Thus
we marched out, under a ponderous load of armour,
like two invincible champions, with a quantity of
powder and bullets to ftand our battle, and load again,
when the pieces were difcharged. And now my or-
ders being to be obeyed, I charged Friday to keep
dole behind me, and not to ftir, or fhoot, or attempt
any thing till I commanded him; and, in the interim,
not to fpeak fo much as one word. It was in this or-
der I fetched a com pafs to the right hand, of near a
mile, as well to get over the creek, as to attain the
wood; and by this, 1 thought to coine within Shot of
them before 1 coujd lie difcerned, as I found by my
glais, would not be diiikuit to accomplifh.
But
But how fickle and wavering is the mind of men,
even in our greateft fury and ftrongeft inclination?
For while I was taking this march, my refolution be-
gan to abate, not through fear of their numbers, who
were a parcel of naked unarmed wretches, but thofe
reflections occurred to my thoughts: What power
•was I commiffioned with, or what occafion or necef-
fity had I to go and imbrue my hands in human blood,
and murder people thjjt had neither done nor intend-
ed to do me any wrong? They were innocent in par-
ticular as to me; and their barbarous cuftotn was not
only their misfortune, but a fign that God- had left
them in the moft immenfe flupidity; but yet did not
warrant me to be a judge of their actions, much lefs
an executioner of his righteous judgments: That, on
the contrary, whenever he thought fit, he would take,
vengeance on them himfelf, and punifh them in a
national way, according to their national crimes; but
this was nothing at all to me, who had no concern
•with them. Indeed my man Friday might juftify
himfelf, becaufe they were his declared enemies, of
that very fame nation that went to facrifice him before;
and, indeed, it was lawful for him to attack them,
which I could not fay was fo with refpect to me. So
warmly did thefe things prefs upon my thoughts all
the way I went, that I only refolved to place myfelf
fo as to behold their bloody entertainment, without
falling upon them, except fomething more than ordi-
nary, by God's fpecial direction, Ihould oblige me
thereto.
Thus fixed in my refolution, I entered into the
thick wood, (my man Friday following me clofe be-
hind), when, with all poflible warinefs and filence, I
marched till I came to the fldrt of it, on that fide
which was the neareft to them ; for only one end of the
wood interpofed between me and them. Upon which
I called very foftly to Friday; an4 fhewing him a
great tree, that-was juft at the corner of the wood, I
ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word, if
he
I . he could plainly perceive their actions: Accordingly,
he did as I commanded him, and came back with
this melancholy ftory, that they were all about their
fire, eating the flefh of one of their prifoners; and
that another lay bound upon the fand, a little diftant
from them, which they defigned for their next facri-
fice; and this, he told me, was not one of their na-
tion, but one of thofe very bearded men, who was
driven by a ftorm into their country, and of whom
he had fo often talked to me about. You may be fure,
that upon hearing this, my foul was ready to fink
within me; when afcending up into a tree, I faw
plainly, by my glafs, a white man, who lay upon,
the beach of the fea, with his hands and feet ty'd
•with flags, or things refembling rufhes, being cover-
ed with clothes, and feemed to be an European.
From the tree where I took this profpect, I perceived
another tree, and a thicket beyond it, about fifty
yards nearer to them, than where I was; which, by
taking a fmall circle round, I might come at undif-
covered, and then I fhould be within half a fhot of
thefc devourers. And this confideration alone, to be
more perfectly revenged upon them, made me with-
hold my paffion, though I was enraged to the higheft
degree imaginable; when going back about twenty
paces, I got behind fome bufhes, which held all the
way till I came to the other tree; and then I afcend-
ed to a little rifing ground, not above eighteen yards
diftance, and there I had a full view of thefe crea-
tures, and I could perceive all their actions.
Such a fight did then appear, as obliged me not to
lofe a moment's time. No lefs than nineteen of thefe
dreadful wretches fat upon the ground, clofe huddled
together, expreffing all the delight imaginable at fo
barbarous an entertainment; and they had juft fent
other two to murder this poor unhappy Chrijiian, and
bring him limb by limb to their fire; for they were
N juft
juft then going 'to untie the bands from'his feet, in
order for death, as fetters arc knocked off the feet of
malefactors before they go to the place of execution.
Hereupon, immediately turning to my man, Now,
Friday, faid I, mind what I fay, fail in nothing, but
do exactly as you fee me do. All which he promi-
fing he would perform, I'fet down one of my mufkets,
and the fowling piece upon the ground, and Friday
did'the fame by his; and with the other mufket I
took my aim at the favages, bidding him do the like:
Are you ready, faid I? Yes, mqfter, faid he. Why
then fire at them, faid I; and that very moment I
gave fire likewife.
I only killed one, and wounded two; but my man
Friday, taking his aim much better than I, killed
two, and wounded three. You may be fure they
were in a dreadful confternation, at fuch an imex-
jiected difafter; and thofe who yet had efcnped our
penetrating fliot, immediately jumped upon their
feet, but were in fivch confufion, that they knew not
•which way to run or look; not knowing from whence
their deftruction came. We then threw down our
pieces, and took up others, giving a fecond dreadful
volley; but as they were loaded only with fwan-fhot,
or fmall piftol bullets, we perceived only two of them
fall; though many were wounded, who run yelling
and fcreaming about like mad creatures. Now, Fri-
day, faid I, lay down your piece, and take up the
mufker, and follow me. He did fo, with great cou-
rage, when fhewing ourfelves to thefavagts, we .gave'ar
great fhour, and made dire£lly to the poor victim, who
would have been facrificed, had not our firft fire obli-
ged the butchers, with three others, to jump into a ca-
noe. By my order, Friday fired at them, at which
fhot I thought he had killed them all, by reafon of their
falling to the bottom of the boat; however, he killed
two, and mortally wounded a third. In the mean time,
I cut the flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor
creature,
creature, and lifting him up, aftced him in the Por-
tugucfe.tongue, What he was? He anfwered me in
Latin,. Cbriftianus; but fo very weak and faint, that
he could fcarce ftand or fpeak. Immediately I gave
;him a dram, and a. piece of bread to cherifh him,
and afked him, What countryman he was? He faid,
Efparuo1ai and then uttered all the thankfulnefs
imaginable for his deliverance.- Signior, (faid I,,
with as .much Spanijh as I was mailer cf), Ictus
talk afterwards, but fight now; here, take this fword
and piftol, and do what you can. And, indeed, he
, did fo with fuctr courage and intrepidity,, that he cut
'"two of. them to pieces in an inftant, the favages not
having the power to fly for their lives. I ordered Fri-
day to run for thofe pieces we had left at the tree,
which he brought me with great fwiftnefs, and then
I gave him my mufket, w.hilp I loaded the reft. Bijt
. now there happened a fierce encounter between the
Spaniard and one of the favages, who had made at
him with one of their wooden (words ; and though
the former was as brave as could be expected, having,
twice wounded his enemy in the head; yet, being
weak and faint, the Indian had thrown him upon, the
ground, and was wrefting my fword out of his hand,
which the Spaniard very wifely quitting drew put his
piftol, and /hot him through the body before I coi^Jd
come near him, though I was running to his ailift-
ance. As to Friday, he purfued the flying wretchfa
with his hatchet, difpatching three, but the reft were
too nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one of
the fowling-pieces, wounded two, who running into
the woodi Friday purfueii and killed oua; bu,t th~e
other, notwithftandiug his wounds, plunged himfelf
into the fea, an,d fwara to thofe two who were left in
the canoe, which, with one wounded, were all that
efcaped out of one and twenty. The account is as
follows,;

The favages in the canoe worked very hard to get
out of our reach, and Friday was as eager in pur-
fuing them; and, indeed, I was no lefs anxious
about their efcape, left, after the news had been
carried to their people, they fhould return in mul-
titudes, and deftroy us. So being refolved to pur-
fue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and
bid Friday follow me ; but no fooner was I in, than,
to my furprife, I found another poor creature, bound
hand and foot for the flanghter, juft as the Spaniard
had been, with very little life in him. Immediately
I unbound him, and would have helped him up; but
he could neither ftar J nor fpeak, but groaned fo pi-
teoufly, as thinking he was only unbound in order to be
flain. Hereupon 1 bid Friday fpeak to him, and tell him
of his deliverance; when pulling out my bottle, I made
the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with the joyful
news he had received, fo revived his heart, that he fat
up in the boat. As foon as Friday began to hear him
fpeak, and look more fully in his face, it would have
moved any one to tears to perceive his uncommon
tranfports'of joy; for he kiffed, embraced him, hug-
5ed him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
anced, fung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his face and head, then fung and jumped about
again, like a diftracted creature: fo that it was a
great while before I could make him fpeak to me,
or tell me what was the matter with him; but
when
when he came to the liberty of his fpeech, at laft lie
told me it was his father.
Here indeed I was infinitely moved to fee that du-
tiful and tender affection this poor favage had to his
aged parent. He would fit down by him in the boat,
open his breaft, and hold his father's head clofe to his
bofom, half an hour together, to cherifh it: then he
took his arms and ancles, which were ftiff and num-
bed with binding, and chafed and rubbed them with
his hands; by which means, perceiving what the cafe
was, I gave him fome rum, which proved of great be-
nefit to him.
While we were bufy in this action, the favages had
gotten almoft out of fight; and ha'ppy it was we did
not purfue them: For there arofe from the north-
weft, which continued all night long, fuch a violent
ftorm, that I could not fuppofe otherwife but that they
were all drowned. After this, I called Friday to me,
:and afked him, if he had given his father any bread?
He fhook his head, and faid, None, not one bit, me
eat a up all; fo I gave him a cake of bread out of a
little pouch I carried for this end. I likewife gave
him a dram for himfelf, and two or three bunches of
raifins for his father. Both thefe he carried to him,,
for he would make him drink the dram, to comfort
him..
Away he then runs out of the boat as if he was be- -
witched,, with fuch an extraordinary fwiftnefs, that
he was out of fight as it were in an inftant; but,
at his return, I perceived him flacken his pace, be-
caufe he had fomething in. his hand. And this I
found to be, as he approached nearer, an earthen
jug with fome water to his father, with two more
cakes of bread,.which he delivered into my hands.
Being very thirfty myfelf, I drank fome of the wa-
ter, of which when his father had drunk fufficienf-
ly, it more revived his fpirits than all the rum I had
given him.
I then; called Friday. 19.me,, and ordered himt.', •
N 3 carr
carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, and fome wate*,
who was repofing himfelf upon a green place under
the fhade of a tree, but fo weak, that though he
exerted himfelf, he could not ftand upon his feet.
Upon which I ordered Friday to rub and bathe his
ancles with rum, as he did his father's. But every
minute he was employed in this, he would cafl a
wifhful eye towards the boat, where he left his fa-
ther fitting; who fuddenly difappearing, he flew
like lightning to him, and finding he only laid
himfelf down to eafe his limbs, he returned back to
me prefently, and then I fpoke to the Spaniard to
let Friday help him, and lead him to the boat, in
order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where I would
take care of him. Upon which Friday took him
upon his back, and fo carried him to the canoe,
fetting him clofe by his father*; and prefently ftep^
ping out again, launched the boat off, and paddled
it along the (hore fafter than I could walk, though
the wind blew very hard too j and having brought
them fafe to the creek, away he runs to fetch the
other canoe, which he brought to the creek al-
moft as foon as I got to it by land, when Wafting
me over, he took our new guefts out of the boat -t
but fo weak were they, that I was forced to make
a kind of a hand barrow; and when I came to my
eaftle, not being willing to make an entrance into
my wall, we made them a handfome tent, covered
with old fails, and boughs of trees, making two good
beds of rice ftraw, with blankets to lie upon and
cover them. Thus, like an abfolate ling, ever
fubjects who owed their lives lo me, I thought
myfelf very considerable, efpecially as I had now
three religions in my kingdom, my man Friday be-
ing a Proteflant, his father a Pagan, and the Spa-
niard a Papifl: but I gave liberty ef canfcience to
them all.
To get provifions for my poor weak fubjecls, I
ordered Friday to kill me a yearling goat; which
when
when he had done, I cut off the hinder quarters, and
choping it into fmall pieces, boiled and ftewed it,
putting barley and rice into the broth. This I car-
ried into their tent, fet a table, dined with them my-
felf, and encouraged them. Friday was my inter-
preter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too,
who fpoke the language of the favages pretty well.
After dinner I ordered Friday to fetch home all our
arms from the field of battle, and the next day to
bury the dead bodies, which he did accordingly.
And now 1 made Friday enquire of his father whe-
ther he thought thofe favages had efcaped the late
ftorm in their canoe; and if fo, whether they would
not return with a power too great for us to refift?
He anfwered, that he thought it impoflible they
could outlive the ftorm; or if they were driven
fouthwardly, they would come.to a land where they
would as certainly be devoured, as if they were
drowned in the fea. And fuppofe they had attained
their own country, the ftrangenefs of their fatal and
bloodly attack, would make them tell their people*
that the reft of therrt were killed by thunder and
lightening, not by the hand of man, but by two
heavenly fpirits (meaning Friday and me) who were
fent from above to deftroy them. And this, he faidy
he knew, becaufe he heard them fay the fame to one
another. And indeed he was in the right on't; for I
have heard fince, that thefe four men gave out, that
whoever went to that inchanted ifland, would be de-
ftroyed by fire from the gods.
No canoes appearing feme time after, as I expected,
my apprehenfions ceafed: In (lead of which my form-
er thoughts of a voyage took place, efpecially when
Friday's father affured me I fhould have good u-
fage in his nation. As to the Spaniard, he toM me,
that fixteen more of his countrymen, and Portu-
guefe, who had been fhipwrecked, made their e-
fcape thither; that though tbey were in union with
the
the favages, yet they were very miferable for want
of provifions and other neceffaries. When I afked
him about the particulars of his voyage, he an-
fivered, that their fliip was bound from Rio de la
Plata to the Havannah; that when the fhip was loft,
only five men perifhed in the ocean; the reft having
faved themfelves iu the boat, were now landed on the
main continent. And what do they intend to do
there? fald I. He replied, they have concerted mea-
fures to efcape, by building a vefl'd, but that they
haxl neither tools nor provifions, fo that all their de-
figns came to nothing. Suppofir.g (faid I) I fhould
make a propofal, and invite them here, would they
not carry me prifoner to New Spain? lie anfwered,
no; for he knew them to be fuch honeft men, as
would fcorn to act fuch inhuman bafenefs to their de-
liverer : That if I pleafed, he and the old favage would
go over to them, talk with them about it, and bring
me an anfwer: That they fhould all fvvear fidelity to
me as their leader, upon the holy facrament; and,
for his :part, he would not only do the fame, but
fland by me to the laft drop of his blood, fhoulil there
be occafion.
Thefe folemn affurances made me refolve to grant
them relief, and to ..fend thefe two over, for that
purpofe: but when every thing was ready, the Spa-
niard, raifed an obje£tion, which carried a great deal
of weight in it: Yau kno-w, Si/, faid ho,.. that ha-
ving been fome time with you, I cannot but be fen/ible
ofyourjiock of rice and corn,.firfficient, perhaps, for its
at prefent, but not for-them, foould they come over pre-
.fently; muc% lefs to vicinal. a vejjel for an intended
voyage. Want might be as great an occafion for them
to difagree and rebel, as the children of Ifrael did a-
gaiuft God himfejf, -whsn they -wanted bread in the
•vuilderncfs. And, therefore, my advice is, to -wait ano'
thcr haryejl, and in the mean time cultivate and im-


prove fome more land, whereby -we may have plenty of
•provifions, in order to execute our dejign.
This-advice of the Spaniard's I approved extreme-
ly; and fo fatisfied was I of his fidelity, that I efteem-
ed him ever after. And thus we all four went to
work upon fome more land, and againft feed-time we
had gotten foonuch cured and trimmed up, fuffici-
ent to fow 22 bufhels of barley on, and i6jars of
rice, which was in fhort all the feed we had to fpare.
As we were four in number, and by this time all in
good health, we feared not a hundred Indians, fhould
they venture to attack us: and while the corn was
growing, I pitched upon fome trees, fit to build us a
large vefiel, in caie the Spaniards came oeer; which
being marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut
them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was now
my privy counlellor, to overfee and direct the work.
I likewife encreafed my flocks of goats, by fhooting
the wild dams, and bringing home their kids to my
inclofure: Nor did I neglect the grape-feafon, but
cured them as ufual, though I had fuch a quantity
now, as would have filled 80 barrels with raifins.
And thus, all of us being employed, they in working,
and I in providing for them, till harveft came, God
almighty blefled the encreafe of it fo much, that from
twenty-two barrels of barley, we threfhed out two
hundred and twenty, and the like quantity of rice,
fufficient to victual a fhip fit to carry me and all the
Spaniards to any part of America.
Ihus the principal objection being anfwered, by
a fufficient flock of provifion, I fent. my two am-
bafladors over to the main-land, with a regal au-
thority to adminifter the oaths of allegiance and
fidelity, and have an inftrument figned under their
hands, though I never afkcd whether they had pen,
ink, or paper; when giving each of them a mufket,
eight charges of powder and. ball, and provifion e-
noueh
nough for eight days, they failed away with a fair gale,
on a day when the moon was at full.
Scarce 'a fortnight had paffed over my head; but,
impatient for their return, I laid me down to flcep
ione morniug,! when a flrange accident happened,
•which was ufhered in by my man's coming run-
ning to me, and calling aloud, Mafteri mafter, they
are come, they are come. Upon which, not dream-
jng of any danger, out I jumped from my bed, put
on my .clothes, and hurried through my little grove;
when looking towards the fea, I perceived a boat
about a league and a half diftant, flanding in for
the fhore, • with the wind fair. I beheld they did
not come from the fide where the land lay on, but
from the fouthermoft>end of the iflamj: So thefe
being none of the people we wanted, I ordered Fri-
day to lie ftill, till fuch time as I came down from
the mountain, which, with my ladder, I now afcend-
ed, in order to difcover more fully what they were:
ami now, with the help of my perfpeclive glafs, I
plainly perceived an Englifh fhip, which I conclu-
ded it to be, by the fafhion of its long boat; and, which
filled me with fuch uncommon tranfports of joy, that
I cannot tell how to defcribe; and yet feme fecret
doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know not
what caufe, as though I had reafon to be upon my
•guard. And, indeed, I would have no man contemn
the fecret hints and intimations of danger, which
very often are given, when he may imagine there is
no poifibility of its being real; for, had not I been
warned by this filent admonition, I had been in a
worfe fituation than before, and perhaps inevitably
ruined.
Not long it was, before I perceived the boat to
approach the fhore, as though, they looked for a
place where they might conveniently land; and at
laft they ran their boat on fhore upon the beach,
about half a mile's diftance; which proved fo much
the happier for me, fince, had they come into the

not only have forced me out of my caftle, but'plim*
dered me of all I had in the world. Now I was fully
convinced they were all Englifhmen, three of-which
were unarmed and bound ; when immediately thefirft
four or five leaped on fhore, and took thofe three out
of the hoat as prifoners; one of whom I could per-
ceive ufed the moft paffionate geftures of entreaty, af-
fliction, and defpair, while the others, in a leffer de-
gree, fhewed abundance of concern.
Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very
much aftonifhed, and I beckoned to Friday, who was
below, to afcend the mountain, and likewife view
this fight. 0 mafter, fays he to me, you fee Englifh
mans eat prifeners as -well as Savage mans. And do
you think they, will eat them, Friday? faid I. Test
laid Friday, they eat a all up. No, no, faid I, Fri->
day, I am much more concerned left they murder
them; but as for eating them up, that I am fure they
will never do.
And now I not only lamented my misfortune in
not having the Spaniard and Savage with me, tut
alfo that I could not come within fhot of them un-
perceived, (they having no fire arms among them)
and fave thefe three men, whom I thought they were
goi-ng to kill with their fwords. But fome comfort
it 'was to me, that I perceived they were fet at liber-
ty to go where they pleafed, the rafcally feameft
fcattering about as though they had a mind to fee
the place: and fo long did they negligently ramble,
that the tide had ebbed fb low, as to leave the boat
aground. Nor were the two men that were in her
more circumfpect>: for having drunk a little too
much liquor, they fell faft afleep; but one of them
waking before the other, and perceiving the boat
too fait aground for his ftrength to move it, he hal-
looed out to the reft, who made all poffible expedi-
tion to come to him; but, as Providence ordered
it.
it, all their force was ineffectual to launch her, when
I could hear them fpeak to one another, Why, let
her alone, Jack, can't yc, Jbe'll float next tide; by
which words I was fully convinced they were my
own countrymen. All this while I lay very quiet,
as being fully fenfible it could be no lefs than ten
hours before the boat would be afloat, and then it
would be fo dark, as that they could not eafily per-
ceive me, by which means I fhould be at more li-
berty to hear their talk, and obferve all their mo-
tions: not but that I prepared for my defence: yet
as I had now another fort of enemies to combat
with, I acted with more caution. I took two fu-
fees on my fhoulders, and gave Friday three mufltets;
befides, my formidable goat-fkin coat, and monftrous
cape, made me look as fierce and terrible as Hercules
of old, efpecially when two piftols were ftuck in my
belt, and my naked fword hanging by my fide.
It was my defign at firft not to make any attempt
till it was dark; but it being now two o'clock, in
the very heat of the day, the failors were all ftrag-
gling into the woods, and undoubtedly were Iain
down to fleep. The three poor diftrefied creatures,
too anxious to get any repofe, were, however,
feated under the fhade of a great tree, about a quar-
ter of a mile from me. Upon which, without any
more ado, I approached towards them, with my man
following behind me, and, before I was perceived, I
called aloud to them in Spani/h, What are ye, Gen-
tlemen?
At thefe words, they ftarted up in great confu-
Con, when they beheld the ftrange figure I made;
they returned no anfwer, but feemed as if they would
fly from me; Gentlemen, (faid I in Englifh) don't be
afraid, perhaps you have a friend nearer than you ex-
petl. He muft be from heaven, faid one of thein,
gravely pulling off his bat, for we are paft all help in
this world. All help is from Heavent faid I; butt Sir,
as
as I have perctived every aflion between you and thefe
brutes fince your landing, only inform me how to ajp'jl
you, and I will do it to the utmofl of my power.
. Am I talking with God or man, faid he, in melt-
ing tears. Are you «f human kind, or an angel?
Sir, faid I, my poor habit may tell you I am a man,
and an Englishman, willing to affift you, having but
this fcrvant only: here are arms and ammunition:
tell freely your condition, can we fave you? The
ftory, faid he, is too long to relate, fince our but-
chers are fo near: but, Sir, I was mafter of that fhip,
my men have mutinied, and it is a favour they have
put my mate, this paflenger, and me, on more with-
out murdering us, though we expect nothing but
perifhing here. Are your enemies, gone? faid I. No,
replied he, (pointing to a thicket), there they lie,
while my heart trembles, left, having feen and heard
us, they mould murder us all. Have they fire-arms?
faid I. They have but two pieces, faid he, one of
•which is left in the boat. He alfo toid me, there
were two enormous villains among them, that were
the authors of this mutiny, who, if they were killed
or feized, might induce the reft to return to their o-
bedience. Well, well, faid I, let us retire farther
under the covering of the woods; and there it was I
made thefe conditions with him.
I. That, while they ftaid in the ifland, they fhould
not pretend to any authority; but fhould entirely
conform-to my orders, and return me the arms which
I Thould put into their hands.
II. That, if the fhip was recovered, they fhould
.afford Friday and myfelf our paflage gratis-to Eng-
land.
When he had given me all the fatisfaction I could
defire, I gave him and his two companions each of
them a gun, with powder and ball fufficient, advi-
fing them to fire upon them as they lay fleeping.
The captain modeftly faid, that he was forry to kill
them j though, on the other hand, to let thefe vil-
O kins
lains efcape, who were the authors of his mifery,
might be the ruin of us all. Well, faid he, do as you'
think fit: and fo accordingly I fired, killing one-of
the captain's chiefeft enemies, and wounding the
other, who eagerly called for aififtance; but the cap.
tain (who had referved his piece) coming up to
him, Sirrah, faid he, 'tis too late to call for affift-
ance, you Jbovld rather cry to God to pardon your vil-
lany; and fo knocked him down with the ftock of
his gun: three others were alfo flightly wounded,
who, at my approach, cried out for mercy. This, the
captain granted, upon condition that they would
fwear to be true to him in recovering the (hip,' which
they folemnly did: however, I obliged the captain to
'keep them bound. After which I fent Friday and the
captain's mate to fecure the boat, and bring away the
oars and fail; when, at their return, three men co-
ming back, and feeing their late diftrefied captain,
now their conqueror, fubmitted to be bound alfo.
And then it was, that having more liberty, I related
the adventures of my whole life, which he heard
with a ferious and wonderful attention. After this,
I carried him and his two companions into my little
fortified caftle, fhewed them all my conveniencies,
;end refrefhed them with fuch provilions as I could
afford. When this was over, we began to confider
.about regaining the fhip: he faid, that there were
twenty-fix hands on board, who, knowing their lives
•were forfeited by the law, for confpiracy and mu-
tiny, were fo very hardened, that it would be dan-
gerous for our fmall company to attack them. This
was a reafonable inference, indeed; but fomething
we muft refolve on, and immediately put in exe-
cution: we, therefore, heaved the boat upon the
beach fo high that fhe could not fhoot off at high
water mark, and broke a hole in her not eafily to be
flopped; fo that all the fignals they gave for the
boat to come on board were in vain. This obliged
them
I
ftiem to fend another boat afhore, with ten men
armed, whofe faces the captain plainly defcried, the
boatfwain being the chief officer; but he faid there
were three honeft lads among them, who were for-
ced into the confpiracy. Hereupon I gave him frefh
courage, (for I had perceived he was in concern); in
the mean while fecuring our prifoners, except two,
whom we took to our affiftance, we thought ourfelves
able enough to adventure a b.ittle. When the Tailors
landed, and beheld their boat in that condition, they
not only hallooed, but fired, for their companions to
hear, yet they received no anfwer. This ftruck them
with horror and amazement, thinking their compa-
nions were murdered, they made as if they wouldr
return to the fliip. I could perceive the captain's
countenance change at this, till," of a fudden three"
men were ordered to look after the boat, while the
other feven leapt on Ihore, in order to fearch for their
companions: and, indeed, they came to the brow of
the hill, near my ancient caftle, from whence they
could fee to a great diftance in the woods, and there
fhouting and hallooing till tired and weary, they at
length feated themfelves under a fpreading tree. My
opinion was, that nothing could be done till night,
when I might ufe fome artifice to get them all out of
the boat; but, of a-fudden, they ftarted up, and made*
to the fea fide; hereupon I ordered Friday and the
captain's mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud
as they could, and fo decoying them into the woods,
come round to me again. And this, indeed, had good'
effect; for they followed the noifc, till coming weft-
ward to the creek, they called for their boat to carry
them over, and taking one of the men out of her,
left two to look after her, having faftened her to the
ftump of a little tree on fhore. Hereupon immedi-
ately the captain and our party pafling the creek, out
of their fight, we furprifedthem both, by the captain's
TuiocTcing down one, and ordering the other to furren-
O i der
der upon pain of death, and who, being the honefteft
of them all, fincerely joined with us. By this time it
was pretty late; when, the reft, returning to their
boat, which they found aground in the creekr the
tide out, and the men gone, they ran about, wring-
ing their hands, crying it was an inchanted ifland,
and that they fhould be all murdered by fpirits or
devils. My men would willingly have fallen upon'
them, but I would not agree to hazard any of our
party. But, to be more certain, Friday and the
captain crawled upon their hands and feet, as near
as pollible; and, when the boatfwain approached in
fight, fo eager was the captain, that he fired, and
killed him on the fpot; Friday wounded the next
man, and a third ran away. Hereupon I advanced
with my whole army; and, it being dark, I ordered
the men we had furprifed in the boat, to call them
by their names, and to parley with them. Accord-
ingly he called out aloud, Tom Smith, Tom Smith!
He aufwered, Who's that? Robinfon! anfwered the
oiher, For Cod's fake, Tom, furrender immediately,
or you're all dead men. Who muft we furrender to?
lays Smith. To our captain and fifty men here, -who
have taken me prifoner, -wounded Will Frye, and kill-
ed the lro.itfwain. Shall we have quarters then? fuid
Le. Hereupon the captain calls out, You, Smith,
you kno-w my voice, furrender immediately, and you
fbull all have your lives grunted, except Will. Atkins.
Hereupon Atkins cries out, What have I done, Cap-
tain, more than the reft, -who have been as bad as me?
but that was a lie, for he was the perfon that laid
hold of him, and bound him. However, he was or-
dered to fubmit to the governor's mercy, tor fuch
was I- called. And fo, laying down their arms, we
bound them all, and feized on their boat.
After this, the captain expoftulated with them,
telling them, that the governor was an Englimman,
who might execute them there; but he thought they
would be feut to Lnghnd, except Will. Atkins, who
was
was ordered to prepare for death, next morning.
Hereupon Atkins implored the captain to intercede
for his life, and the reft begged that they might nor
be fent to England. This anfwered our project for
feizing the fhip. For after fending Atkins, and two
of the worft, fail bound to the cave, and the reflr
being committed to my bower, I fent the captain to
treat with them in the governor's name, offering'
them pardon if they would affift in recovering the
fhip. Upon which they all promifed to ftandby him
till the laft drop of their blood; and whoever a£led
treacheroufly, Jhould be hanged in chains upon the
Leach. They were all releafed on thefe affurances;
and then th« captain repaired the other boat, making
his paflenger captain of Her, and gave him four men
well armed; while himfelf, his mate, and five
more, went in the other boat. By midnight they
came within call of the fhip, when the captain or-
dered Robinfon to hail her, and tell them, that with
great difficulty they had-found the men at laft But
while they were difcourfmg, the captain, his mate,-
and the reft entered, and knocked down the feeond"
mate and carpenter, fecured thofe that were upon'
the deck, by putting them under hatches, while the
other boat's crew entered and fecured the forecaflle;
they then broke into the round-houfe, where the
mate, after fome refiftance, fhor the pirate captain-
through the head, upon- wlnich all the reft yielded'
themfelves prifoners. And thus the fhip being re-
covered, the joyful fignal was fired, which I heard
with the greateft joy imaginable: rior was it long he-
fore he brought the fhip to an anchor at the creek's"
mouth, where coming to me unawares, There, fays
he, my dearcjl friend and deliverer, thtre is ymrjbipt
and we arc your fervants; a comfort fo unfpeakable,
as made me fwoon in his arms, while, with griti-
tude to heaven, we were tenderly embracing each o-
ther.
O 3 , Nothing
Nothing now remaining, but to confult what we
ihould do with the~prifoners, whom he thought it
•was not fafe to take on board. Hereupon, concert-
ing with the captain, I drefled myfelf in one of his
fuits, and fending for them, told them, That as T
was going to leave the ifland with all my people, i£
they would tarry there, their lives fliould be fpared j-
if not, they fhould be hanged at the firft port they
came at. They agreed to Qay. Hereupon I told
•them my whole ilory, charging them to be kind to
the Spaniards that were expecled, gave them all my
arms,, and informing them of every thing neceflary
for their fubfiftcnee, I and my man Friday wenjt on/
boar.i. But the next morning two of the men came
fwimmmg to the fhip's fide, defiring the captain to
t ike them on board, though he hanged them after-
wards, complaining mightily how barbaroufly. the
others ufed them. Upon which I prevailed with the
cnptain to take them in; and being feverely whipt and
pickled, they proved more honeft for the future.
And fo I bid farewell to this ifland, carrying along
virh me my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat-
'fkin cap; fetting fail December 12. 1686, ' after
twenty eight years, two months, an'd nineteen days
refidence, that fame day and month that I efcaped>
from Salee, landing in England, June n. 1687, after
five and thirty years abfence from my own country,
which rendered me altogether a ftranger there.
Here I found my firft captain's widow alive, who
had buried a fecond hufband,. but in very mean cir-
cumftances, and whom I made mighty eafy upon my
atcount. Soon after I went down to Yorkfhire,
where all my family were expired, except two
fifterSf. and as many of one of my brother's children.
I found no provifion had been made for me, they
concluding I had been lonjj firsce dead; fo that L
was but in a very flender llation. Indeed the cap-
tain di>l n:e n great kindnefs, by his report to the
owners,) how 1 had delivered their fliip on the dcfo-
late
late ifiand, upon which they made me a prefent of
300 /. Sterling. I next went to Lifbon, taking my
man Friday with me, and there arriving in April, I
Biet the J^ortuguefe captain, who had taken me on
board on the African coaft; but being ancient, he
had left off the fea, and refigned all his bufmefs to
his fon, who followed the Brazil trade. So altered
both of us were, that we did not know each other at
firft, till I difcovered myfelf more fully to him. Af-
ter a few embraces, 1 began to enquire of my con-
cerns; and then the old gentleman told me,- that it
-•was nine years Cnce. he had been at Brazil, where my
partner was then living, but my truftees were both-
dead; that he believed I fhould have a good account
of the product of my plantation; that the imagina-
tion of my being loft, had obliged my truftees to give
an eftimate of my fhare to the procurator-fifcal, who,
in cafe of my not returning, had given one third to
the king, and the reft to the monaftery of St Augu-
iline; but if I put in my claim, or any one for me,
it would be returned, except the yearly product,
•which was given to the poor. I then defired him to
tell me what improvement he thought had been made
of my plantation, and whether he imagined it was.
worth my xvhile to look after, it? He anfwered, he
did not know how much it was improved; but this
he was certain of, that my partner was grown vnftly
rich upon his half of itj and that he had been in-
formed, that the king had 260 moidores per annum
for his third part. He added, that the furvivors of
my truftees were perfons of an ingenuous character;
that my partner could witnefs my title, my name
being regiftered in the country, by which means I
fhould indifputably recover confiderable fums of
money. But, anl'wered I, how could my truftees
tiifpofe of my effects, when I made you only my heir?
This,, he faid, was true; but, there being no affidavit
made of my death, he could not,act as my executor.
-However, he had ordered his fon (then at Brazil) to
act
a& by procuration upon my account,'and he bad ta^
ken pofleffioH of my fugar-houfe, having accounted-
liimfelf for eight years with my partner and truftees
for the profits, of which he would give me a very good
account.
And, indeed, this he performed very faithfully, in-
a few days, making himfelf indebted to me 470 moi-
dores of gold, over and above what haii been loft at
fca, after I had left the place. And then he re-
counted to me what misfortunes he had gone through,
which forced my money out of his hands, to buy
part in a new fhip: but, fays he, you fball not -want,*
tnkc this, and -whcn my fan returns, every farthing
Jball be paid yju. Upon which he put into-my hand
a purfe of 150 moidores in gold, as likewife the inftru-
Bient, containing the title to the fhip which his fon
was in, and which he offered as fecurity for the re-
mainder. But really when I faw fo much goodnefs,,
generality, tendernefs, and real honefty, I had not.
the heart to accept it, for fear he fhould ftraiten-
liimfelf upon my accouiit. It is true, faid he, it may
be Jo; but then the money is yours, not mine, and you-
may have the greatejl occafion for it. However, I.
returned fifty of them back again, promifing, that.
I would freely give him the other hundred when I
got my effects in my hands, and that I defigned to-
go myfelf for that purpofe. But he told me he.
could fave me that trouble, and fo caufed me to en-
ter iny name, with a public notary, as likewife my-
affidavit, with a procuration affixed te it; and this
he ordered me to fend in a letter to one of his ac-
quaintance, a merchant in Brazil •, and, indeed, no-
thing could be more faithfully and honourably ob-
ferved; for, in feven months time, I had a very faith-
ful account of all my effects, what fums of money-
were raifed, what expended, and what remained for-
my life : in a word, 1 found myfelf tobe worth 5coo/.
Sterling, and icoo/. per annum. Nor was this all ;•
for my partner congratulated me upon my being a-
live,
live, telling me how much my plantation was' im-
proved, what negroes were at work, and how many
jive Marias he had faid to the virgin Mary for my
prefervation, defiring me to accept kindly fome pre-
fents he had fent me, which I found fhewed the great-
eft generofity.
No fooner did the fhip arrive, but I rewarded my
faithful captain, by returning him the hundred moi-
dores; and not only forgiving him all he owed me,
1 allowed him yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his
fon, during their lives. And now being refolved to
go to England, I returned letters of thanks to the
prior of tit Auguftine, and in particular to my old
partner, with very fuitable prefents. By the cap-
tain's advice, 1 was perfuaded to go by land to Calais,
and there take paflage for England; when, as it hap-
pened, I got a young Englifh gentleman, a merchant's
Ton at Lifbon, to accompany me, together with two
Englifh, and two Portugueie gentlemen; fo that
with a Portuguefe fervant, an Englifn failor, and my
man Friday, there were nine of us in number.
Thus armed and equipped, we fet out, and came to
Madrid, when the fummer decaying, we hafted to
Navarre, where we were informed, that there was
fcarcely any palling, by reafon of the prodigious
quantity of fnow; fo that we were obliged to abide
near twenty days at Pampeluna, and at laft to take
a guide to conduct us fafe towards Tholoufe. And
now twelve other gentlemen joining with us, toge-
ther with their fervants, we had a very jolty company.
Away our guide led us by the frightful mountains,
and through fo many intricate mazes and winding's,
that we infenfibly pafled them, which, as we travel-
led along, ufhered us into the profpe£l of the fruit-
ful and charming provinces of Languedoc and Gaf-
coigne.
But now came on two adventures, both tragical
and comical. Firft, our guide was encountered by
three
three wolves and a bear, who fet upon him and hfs
horfe, and wounded him in three places; upon,which
my man, riding up to his affiftance, fhot one of them
dead upon the fpot, which made the others retire to
the woods. But the pleafanteft adventure was, ta
behold my man attack the bear. 'Tis fuch a crea-
ture, that if you let him alone, he will never meddle
with you: and this my man very well knew, and fo-
begging leave of me, in broken Englifh, he told us
he would make good laugh. Why, you filly fool, faid
I, he'll eat you up at a mouthful. Eatee me up, re-
plied he, by way of fcorn, me not only eatee him, but
make much good laugh. Upon which, pulling off
his boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after
the monftrous beaft:, he called out, that he wanted
to difcourfe with him; and then throwing ftones on
purpofe to incenfe him, the beaft turns about in fury,
and with prodigious ftrides, fhuffles after him. But
though he was not fwift enough to keep up pace
•with Friday, who made up to us as it were for help;
yet being angry, Ton dog, faid I, immediately take
horfe, and let us Jboot the creature. But he cried,
Dear mafter, no Jboot, me make you lau^h much. And
fo he turned about, making figns to follow, while the
bear ran after him, till coming to a great oak, he
afcended in a minute, leaving his gun at the bottom
of it. Nor did the bear make any difficulty of it,
but afcended like a cat, though his weight was very
great. You muft confider 1 was not a little amazed
at the folly of my man, as not perceiving any thing-
to occafion our laughter, till fuch time as we rode
up nearer, and beheld the beaft mounted upon the
oak, on the beginning of the fame branch, to which
Friday clung at the farther end, where the bear durft
not come. Hereupon Friday cried out, NOVJ majler,
me make much laugh, me make Ac bear dance. Upon
which he fell a fnaking the bough, which made the
creature look behind him, to fee how Ire could re-
treat. Then, as if the bear had underftood his ftam-
mering.
mering Englifh; Why you no come farther, Mr Bear?
faid he, pray, Mr Bear, come farther: and then in-
deed we all burft into laughter, efpecially when we
perceived Friday drop like a fquirrel upon the ground,
leaving the beaft to make the beft of his way down
the tree. And now thinking it the moft convenient
time to fhoot the creature, Friday cried our, 0 dear
majler,nojboot, me float by and by; when taking up
the gun, Me nojhoot yet, faid he, me make once more
much laugh. And, accordingly, he was as good as his
word; for the creature defcending backwards from
the tree very leifurely, before he could lay one foot
on the ground, Friday fhot him through the ear,
ftone dead: and looking to fee whether we were
pleafed, he burft out into a hearty laughter, faying,
So we kill de bear in my country, not -with the gun,
but with much long arrows. Thus ended our diver-
fion, to our great fatisfaction; efpecially in a place
where the terrible howlings ftruck us with a conti-
nual terror. But the fnows now growing very deep
particularly on the mountains, the ravenous creatures
were obliged to feek for fuftenance in the villages,
•where coming by furprife on the country-people,
they killed feveral of them, befides a great number of
their fheep and horfes.
Our guide told us, we had yet one more danger-
ous place to pafs by; and if there were any more
wolves in the country, there we fhould find them.
This was a fmall plain, encompaffed with woods, to
£et through a long lane, to the village where we
were to lodge. When we entered the wood, the fun
was within half an hour of fetting; and a little after
it was fet, we came into the plain, which was not
above two furlongs over, and then we perceived five
great wolves crofs the road, without taking notice
of us, and fo fwift as though they were puifuing af-
ter their prey. Hereupon our guide, 'believing there
were more coming, defired us to be upon our
guard. Accordingly our eyes were very circumfpect,
till
till about half a league farther, we perceived a dead
horfe, and near a dozen of wolves devouring its car-
cafe. My man Friday fain would have fired at them,
but I would not permit him j nor had we gone half
over the plain, but we heard dreadful howlings in a
wood on our left, when prefently we faw an hun-
dred come up againft us, as though they had been
an experienced army. This obliged us to form our-
felves in the beft manner; and then I ordered that
every other man fhould fire, that thcfe who did nor,
might be ready to give a fecond volley, fhould they
advance upon us; and then every man fhould make
ufc of his piftols. But there was no neceffity for
this; for the enemy being terrified, ftopped*at the
noife of the fire; four of them were fhot dead, and
feveral others being wounded, went bleeding away,
as we could very plainly difcover by the fnow. And '•
now remembering what had been often toJd me, that
fuch was the majefty of a man's voice, as to ftrike
terror even into the fierceft creatures, I ordered all
our companions to halloo as loud as poffible: and in
this notion I was not altogether miftaken; for they
immediately turned about upon the firft halloo, and
began to retire; upon which, ordering a fecond vol-
ley in their rear, they galloped into the woods with
great precipitation.
Thus we had fome fmall time to load our pieces
again, and then made all the hafte we could on our
way; 'but we had not rode far, hefore we were
obliged to put ourfelves, in a pofture of defence as,
before, being alarmed with a very dreadful noife in
the fame wood, on our left hand, the fame way as we
were to pafs, only that it was at fome diftance fiom
us. By this time the darkfome clouds began to
fpread over the elements, and the night grow-
ing very dulky, made it fo much the more to our
difadvantage; but flill the noife increafing, we were
fully aflured, that it was the howling and yelling
of thofe ravenous creatures; when prefently three
troops
troops of wolves, on our front, appeared to our fight,
as though a great number of them had a defign to fur-
round us and devour us in fpite of fate' But as they
did not fall upon us immediately, we proceeded on
our journey in asfwift a manner as the roads would
permit our horfes, which was only a large trot. It
was in this manner we travelled, till fuch time as we
difcovered another wood, and had the profpect of its
entrance through which we were to pafs, at the far-
theft fide of the plain. • But furely none can exprefs
the terror we were in, when, approaching the lane,
we perceived a confufed number of the fierceft wolves
flanding, and, as it were, guarding its entrance. Nor
were we long in this amazement, before another oc-
cafion of horror prefented itfelf; for fuddenly we
heard the report of a gun at another opening into the
wood, and, looking that way, out ran a horfe bridled
and faddled, flying with the greateft fwiftnefs, and no
lefs than fixteen or feventeen wolves purfuing after
him, in order to devour the poor creature: and un-
queftionably they did fo, after they had run him
down, not being able to hold out that fwiftnefs with
which he at firft efcaped them.
When we rode up to that entrance from whence
the horfe came forth, there lay the carcafes of another
horfe and two men, mangled and torn by thefe de-
vouring wolves: and undoubtedly one of thefe men
was the perfon who fired the gun which we had heard,
for the piece lay by him; but, alas! mof t of the upper
part of his body and his head were entombed in the
bowels of thefe ravenous creatures.
What courfe to take, whether, to proceed or retreat,
we could not tell; but it was not long before the
wolves themfelves made us come to a refohuion: for
fuch numbers furrounded us, every one of whom ex-
pected their prey, that, were our bodies to be divided
among them, there would not be half .a mouthful a-
piece. But happy, very happy it was for us, that but
P a
a little way from the entrance, there lay fome very
large timber trees, which'I fuppofed had been cut
, down and laid there for fale; amongft which I drew
my little troop, placing ourfelves in a line behind
one long tree, which ferved us for a breaft work, when
defiring them to alight, we ftood in a triangle, or
three fronts, inclofing our horfes in the centre, the
only place where we could preferve them.
Never certainly was there a more furious charge
than what the wolves made upon us in this place;
and the fight of the horfes, which was the principal
prey they aimed at, provoked their hunger, and add-
ed to their natural fiercenefs. They came on us
with a moft dreadful noife, that made the woods ring
again; and beginning to mount the pieces of timber,
T ordered every other man to fire as before direfted:
and, indeed, fo well did they take their aim, that they
killed feveral of the wolves at the firft volley; but
ftill we were obliged to keep a continual firing, by
reafon they came on like devils, pufhing one another
with the gre;ueft fury. But our fecond volley fome-
thing abated their courage, when, flopping a little,
'we hoped they would have made the beil of their
way; however, it did not prove fo, "for others made
a new attempt upon us: and though in four firings
we killed feventeen or eighteen of them, laming twice
as many, yet they feveral times fucceffively came on,
as though they valued not their lives for the fake of
their prey.
Unwilling was I to fpend our laft fhot too fudden-'
ly, and therefore called rny other fervant, and giving
him a horn of powder, bid him" lay a large train
quite along the timber, which he did, while Friday
was charging my fufee and his own, with the greateft
dexterity. By this time the wolves coming up the
timber, I fet fire to the train, by mapping a dif-
charged piftol-clofe on the powder. This fo fcorch->
ed and terrified them, that fome fell down, and
others
others jumped in among us; but thefe we imme-
diately difpatched, when all the reft, frighted with
the light, which the darkfome night caufed to appeal
more dreadful, began at length to retire; upon which,
ordering our laft piftols to be fired at once, giving at
the fame time a great fhout, the wolves were obliged
to have recourfe to their fvviftnefs, and turn tail;
and then we fallied put upon twenty lame ones, cut-
ting them in pieces with our fwords, which obliged
them to howl lamentably, to the terror of their fel-
lows, who refigned to us the field as victorious con-
querors. And, indeed, I queftion whether Alexander
king of Macedonia, in any of his conquefls, had more
occafion for triumph than we had; for he was but at-
tacked by numerous armies of foldiers; whereas our
little army was obliged to combat a legion of devils,
as it were, worfe than the cannibals, who, the fame
moment had they flain us, would have facrificed us,
to fatisfy their voracious appetites.
Thus ended our bloody battle with the beafts, ha-
ving killed threefcore of them, and faved our lives
from their fury. We ftill had a league farther to go,
when, as we went, our ears were faluted with their
moft unwelcome bowlings, and we expected every
moment another attack. But, in an hour's time, we
arrived at the town where we were to lodge; and
here we found the place finally guarded, and all in
terrible confufion, as well they might, for fear of
the bears and wolves breaking into the village, in
order to prey upon their cattle and people. The
next morning we were obliged to take a new guide,
by reafon the other fell very bad of his wounds,
which he had received, as Before mentioned. After
we had reached Tboloufe, we came into a warm,
pleafant, and fruitful country, not infefted with
wolves, nor any fort of ravenous creatures; and
when we told our flory there, they much blamed our
guide, for condu£ting us through the foreft at the
"Pa foot
foot of the mountains, in fuch a fevere feafon, when
the fnow obliged- the wolves to feek for fhelter in the
woods. When we informed them in what manner
we placed ourfelves, and the horfes in the centre, they
exceedingly reprehended us, and told us, it was an
hundred to one, but we had all been deftroyed; for
that it was the very fight of the horfes, their fo much
defired prey, that made the wolves more ragingly fu-
rious than they would have been, which was evident,
by their being at other times really afraid of a gun;
but then being exceeding hungry and furious, upon
that account, their eagernefs to come at the horfes
made them infenfible of their danger; and that, if
we had not, by a continual fire, and at laft by the cun-
ning ftratagem of the train of powder, got the better
of them, it had been great odds if their number had
not overpowered us ; befides, it was a great mercy we
alighted from our horfes, and fought them with that
courage and conduct, which, had we failed to do, e-
very man of us, with our beafts, had been devoured;
and, indeed, this was nothing but truth; for never, in
my life, was I fo fenfible of danger, as when three
hundred devils came roaring upon us, to fhun
whofe unwelcome company, if I was fure to meet a
florm every week, I would rather go a thoufand
leagues by fea.
I think I have nothing uncommon in my paflage
through France to take notice of, fince other travel-
lers of greater learning and ingenuity, have given a
more ample account than my pen is able to fet forth.
From Tholoufe I travelled.to Paris, from thence to
Calais, where I took fhipping, and landed at Dover
the 14th of January, in a very cold feafon.
Thus come to the end of my travels, I foon dif-
covered my new found eftate, and all the bills of
exchange I had brought were currently paid. The
good ancient widow, my only privy counfellor,
thought no pains nor care too great to procure my
advantage; nor had I ever occafion to blame her
fidelity,
fidelity, which drew from me an ample reward. I
was for leaving my effects in her hands, intending to
fet out for Lifbon, and fo to the Brazils; but as in
the Defolate I/land I had fome doubts about the Ro-
mifh religion, fo I knew there was little encourage-
ment to fettle .there, unlefs I would apoftatize from the
orthodox faith, or live in continual fear of the Inqui-
fition. Upon this account, I refolved to fell my plan-
tation; and, for that intent, I wrote to my old friend
at Lifbon, who returned Tne an anfwer to my great
fatisfaction; which was, that he could fell it to good
account: however, if I thought it convenient to give
him liberty to offer it in my name to the two mer-
chants, the furvivors of my truftees, refiding at fthe
Brazils, who confequently underftood its intrinfic va-
lue, having lived juft upon the fpot, and who I was
fenfible were very rich,, and, therefore, might be the
more willing to purchafe it; he did not in the leaft
doubt, but that I fhould make four or five thoufand
pieces of eight more of it, than I could do, if I dif-
pofed of it in any other manner whatfoever.
You may be fure I could not but agree with this
kind and ingenuous propofal; and immediately I fent
him an order to offer it to them, which he accord-
ingly did; fo that, about eight months after, the fhip
being in that time returned, he gave me a fatisfactory
account, that they not only willingly accepted the
offer, but that they had alfo remitted 33,009 pieces
of eight to a correspondent of their own at Lifbon, in
order to pay for the purchafe.
Hereupon, in return, I figned the inftrument of fale
according to form, which they had fsnt from Lifbon,
and returned it again to my old friend, he having fent
me, for my eftate, bills of three hundred twenty-eight
thoufand pieces of eight, referving the payment of
.Gne hundred moidores per annum, which I had al-
lowed him during life, likewife fifty to his fon during
life alfo, according to my faithful promife, which'the
plantation was to make good as a rent-charge.
P 3 ' "~* And
And thus having led my reader to the knowledge-
of the firft part of my life, fo remarkable for the ma-
ny peculiar providences that attended it, floating in
an ocean of uncertainty and difappointment, of adver-
fity and profperity, beginning foolifhly, and yet end-
ing happily j methinks, now that I am come to a fafe
and pleafant haven, it is time to caft out my anchor,
and, laying up my veflel, bid, for a while, adieu to
foreign adventures. I had no other concerns to look
after, but the care of my brother's two fons, which,
•with the good widow's perfuafions, obliged me to
continue at home feven years. One of thefe children
I bred up a gentleman, and the other an expe-
rienced failor, remarkable for his courage and brave-
ry. Befides this, I married a virtuous young gentle-
woman, of a very good family, by whom I had two
fons and one daughter. But my dear and tender
wife leaving this earthly ftage, (as in the fecond part
of my life you will hear), which rent my foul as it
were afunder, my native country became weary and
tirefome to me: and my nephew happening to come
from the fea, tempted me to venture another voyage
to the Eaft Indies, which I did in the year 1694, at
which time I vifited my ifland, and informed my-
felf of every thing that happened fince my depar-
ture.
One might reafonably imagine, that what I had
faffered, together with an advanced age, and the
fear of lofing, not only what I had gotten, but my
life alfo, might have choaked up all the feeds of youth-
ful ambition and curiofity, and put a lafting period
to my wandering inclinations. But as nothing but
death can fully allay the active part of my life, no lefs
remarkable for the many various contingencies of it;
you will next perceive how I vifited my little king-
dom, faw my fucceflbrs the Spaniards, had an ac-
count of the ufage they met with from the Englifh-
men, agreeing and difagreeing, uniting and fepara-
ting, till at laft they were fubjecled to the Spaniards,
•who -
•who yet ufed them very honourably, together with
the wonderful and fuccefsful battles over the Indians*
•who invaded, and thought to have conquered the
ifland, but were repelled by their invincible courage
and bravery, having taken eleven men and five wo-
men prifoners, by which, at my return, I found about
twenty young children on my little kingdom. Here I
ftaid twenty days, left them fupplies of all neceflary
things, as alfo a carpenter and fmith, and fhared the
ifland into parts, referving the whole property to my-
felf. Nor will you be infenfible, by the account of
thefe things, of feveral new adventures I have been
engaged in, the battles I have fought, the deliveran-
ces 1 have met with.: and while, in the furprifing re-
lation of fuch remarkable occurrences, I mall de-
feribe many of God's kindeft providences to me in

i
WHEN we confrder the puifiant force of Na-
ture, and what mighty influence it has
many times over the temper of the mind, it will be
no fuch great wonder to think, that my powerful
reafon fhould be overcome by a much ftronger in-
clination. My late acquired kingdom ran con-
tinually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreamed
of
of it in the night; nay, I made it the continual
ject of my talk, even to impertinence, when I was
awake; 1 had fuch vapo'urs in my head, that I ac-
tually fuppofed myfelf at my caftle ; that I not only
perceived Friday's father, but the old Spaniard, and
the wicked failors, but that I talked and difcourfed
•with them about their manner of Hying; that I heard
thefe things related to me, which I found afterwards
to be but too true; and that I executed my judg-
ments with the greateft feverity upon the offenders.
And, indeed, this anticipating all the pleafing joys of
my life, fcarcely afforded me one pleafant hour: my
dear and tender wife could not but take notice of it,
which drew thefe affectionate Beeches from her:
My dear, faid fhe, I am really perfuaded that fame
fecret impulfe from heaven occajlons in you a determi-
nation to fee the i/ltmd again: nor am 1 lefs fenfible,
but your being engaged to me, and thefe dear children,-
is the only hinderance of your departure. I know, my
dear, if I was in the grave, you would not long con-
tinue at homes prevent not your happinefs upon my
account, whofe. only comfort centers in you. All that
I can objeEl is, that fuch an hazardous undertaking
is no way conftflent with a per/on of your yean; but
if you are refilved to go, added fhe, weeping, only per-
mit me to bear you company, and that is all that I defire.
Such endearing tendernefs, graced with the rnoft
innocent, and yet moft powerful charms, brought
me infenfibly into my right underftanding-, and when,
I confidered all the tranfkctions of my life, and par-
ticularly my new engagement; that I had now one
child atready born, and my wife big of another; and
that I had no occafion to feek for more riches, who
atready was bleffed with fufficiency, with much •
Struggling I altered my refolutions at laft, refolving
to apply myfelf to fome bufinefs or other, which
might put a period to fuch wandering inclinations.
Hereupon I bought a .little farm in the county of
Bedford, with a refolution to move thither: upon
this-
this there was a pretty convenient houfe, furrounded
with land, very capable of improvement, which fuit-
ed my temper as to planting, managing and cultivat-
ing. Nor was I long before I entered upon my new
fettlement, having bought ploughs, harrows, carts,
waggons, horfes, cows, and fheep; fo that I now
led the life of a country gentleman, and as happy in
my retirement as the greateft monarch in the world.
And what made me think my happinefs the greater
was, that I was in that middle Jiate of lifei which my
father had fo often recommended, much refembling
the felicity of a rural retirement, which is elegantly
defcribed by the poet in thefe lines:
Free from all vices, free from care,
Age has no fain, anff youth no fnare.
But, in the midft of this my happinefs, I was fud-
denly plunged into the greateft forrbw that I could
poffibly endure: for, when I leaft expected it, my
dear and tender wife was forced to fubmit to the ir-
refiftible power of death, leaving this tranfitory life
for.a better. It is impoffible for me to exprefs the
beauties of her mind, or the lovelinefs of her perfon;
neither can I too much lament her lofs, which my
lateft breath fhall record: her influence.was greater
over me, than the powers of my own reafon, the im-
portunities of friends, the inftruclions of a father, or
the melting tears of a tender and difconfolate mo-
ther: in a word, fhe was the fpirit of all my affairs,
and the center of my enterprifes. But now, fmce
the cruel hand of death had clofed my deareft's eyes,
I feemed in my thoughts a ftranger to the world ; my
privy counfellor being gone, I was like a fhip with-
out a pilot, that could only run before the wind.
And when I looked around me in this bufy world,
one part labouring for bread, and the other fquander-
ing away their eftates; this put me in mind how I had
lived in my little kingdom, where both reafon and
religion
religion dictated to me, that there was fomething
that certainly was the reafon and end of life, whicfi
was far fuperior to what could be hoped for on this
fide the grave. My country delights were now asin-
fipid and dull, as mufic or fcience to thofe who have
neither ta-fte nor ingenuity. In fhort, refolving to
leave off houfe keeping, I left my farm, and, in a few
months, returned to London.
But neither could that great city, fo famous for its
variety of entertainment, afford me any agreeable
delight; a ftate of idlenefs I found to be the very
dregs of life, and moft hurtful to body and foul. It
was now the beginning of the year 1694, at which
time my nephew (who, as I before obferved, had
been brought up to the fea, and advanced to be cap-
tain of a fhip) was returned from a fhort voyage to
Bilboa, the firft he had made in that ftation. He
comes to me one morning, telling me, that fome
merchants of his acquaintance had propofed to him fo-
go a voyage for them, to the Eaft Indies and China,
in the manner of private traders: and now, uncle,
faid he, if you'll accompany me thither, I'll engage to
land you upon your old ijland, to vifit thejiate of your
little kingdom.
Juft before he came in, my thoughts were fixed
to get a patent for its pofleffion, and then to fill it
with .inhabitants. After I had paufed a little while,.
and looked ftedfaftly on him, What devil, 'or fpirit,.
faid I, fent you -with this unlucky errand? He Itarted
at firft; but ^recovering himfelf, when he perceived
I was not offended; Sir, replied he, what I have
propofed 'cannot, I hope, be ftyled unlucky, fince
certainly you muft be defirous to fee your little ter-
ritory, where you reigned with more content than
any of your brother-kings in the univerfe. Nephew,
faid I, if you will leave me there, and call for me as
you come back, I care not if I give my confent:
but he anfwered, that the merchants would not al-
low their veffel, loaden with an infinite value, to re-
turn:
turn there again, which was a month's fail out of the
way : -befides, Sir, faid he, if I fhould mifcarry, was
your requeft granted, why then you would be locked
up as before. This, indeed, carried a great deal of
reafon in it; but we found out a remedy, and that
was to carry a framed floop on board, ready to be
fet up in the ifland, by the affiftance of fome carpen-
ters, which we fhould tarry with us, that might be
fitted in a few days to go to fea. J was not long in
forming my refolution, which over-fwayed my good'
friend the widow's perfuafions, and the natural affec-
tion I bore to my young children. I made my will,
and fettled my' eftate in fuch a manner, that I was
perfectly fure that my poor infants would have juftice
done them. The good widow not only undertook to
make provifion for my voyage, but alfo took the charge
of my domeftic affairs, and to provide for my chil-
dren's education; and indeed no mother could take
more care, or underftood that office better; for which
I lived to reward, and return her my hearty thanks.
The beginning of January 1694-5, my nephew
being ready to fail, I and Friday went on board in
the Downs on the 8th, having, befide that floop al-
ready mentioned, a very considerable cargo for my
new colony. Firft, I had fome fervants, whom I pro-
pofed to leave there as inhabitants, or to work while
I ftaid there, as they fhould appear willing: there
were two carpenters, a fmith, and a very ingenious
fellow who was Jack of all trades; for he was not on-
ly a cooper byatrade, but alfo he was dexterous at
making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn, likewife
a good turner, and a good pot-maker. I alfo carri-
ed a tailor, who confented to ftay in my plantation,
and proved a moft neceffary fellow in the ifland.
As to my cargo, it confifted of a fufficient quantity
of linen, and Englifh fluffs, for clothing the Spa-
niards that I expected to find there; as likewife
gloves, hats, fhoes, ftockings; together with beds,
\ - bedding,
bedding, and houfehold fluff, efpecially kitchen uten-
fils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brafs, &c. alfo nails,
tools of all forts, ftaples, hooks, hinges, and all ci-
ther things neceflary; all which, I think, coft me a-
bout three hundred pounds. Nor was this all; for
I carried an hundred fpare arms, mufkets, and fufees,
befides fome piflols, a confiderable quantity of feveral
forts of fhot, two brafs cannon, befides fwords, cut-
lafles, and the iron part for fome pikes and halberts.
I made my nephew take wirh us two fmall quarter
deck guns, more than he had occaiion for in his fhip,
to leave behind, if there was a neci-ffity; that fo we
might build a fort there, and man it againft all op-
'pofers whatfoever.
Well, we put out to /ea; and though I can't fay
this voyage was fo unprofperous as my others had
been, yet contrary winds drove us fo far northward,
that we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland,
where we Jay wind bound two and twenty days. Here
indeed our provifions were very cheap, and we add-
ed to our fhip's ftores, by taking in feveral live
hogs, two cows and calves, which I then refolved to
put on fhore in my ifland, if our neceffities did hot
call for them. On the 5th of February we failed
from Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lafted for
fome days; and 1 think it was about the i.oth of
the fame month, late in the evening, when the mate
informed us that he faw a flafh of fire, and heard
a gun fired; and when he was fpeaking, a boy came
in, and told us, that the boatfwain had heard ano-
ther. Upon which we all ran to the quarter-deck,
from whence in a few moments we perceived a ter-
rible fire at a diftance. We had immediately r&-
courfe to our reckonings, in which we were all of o>-
pinion, that thetc could be no land that way, it ap-
pearing to be at N. N. W- Hereupon we con-
cluded that fome fhip iad taken fire at fea, and that
it could not be far off, by the report of the guns
which we had heard. We_made up directly to it,
and
and in half an hour's time, the wind being fair, we
could plainly perceive a great fhip on fire in the
middle* of the fea. Touched with this unhappy
difafter, and confidering my former circumflances,
when the Portuguefe captain took me up, I imme-
diately ordered five guns to be fired, that the poor
creatures, not feeing us, it being dark, (though we
could perceive their flame), might be fenfible there
was deliverance at hand, and confequently might en-
deavour to fave themfelves in their boat. Nor was
it long before the fhip blew up in the air, and the
fire was extinguifhed in the ocean. Eut fuppofing
them all to be in their boats, we hung out our lan-
terns, and kept firing till eight o'clock in the morn-
ing; when, with our perfpectives, we beheld two
boats, full of people, making towards us, though
the tide was agiinft them: then fpreading out our
ancient, and hanging out a wafr, as a fignal for them
to come on board, in half an hour's time, we came
up to them, and took them all in, there being no
lefs than fixty four men, women, and children. It
was a French merchant fhip of 300 tons, homeward
bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The ma-
fter informed me how, by the negligence of the fleerf-
man, the fleerage was fet on fire: that, at his out-
cry for help, the fire was, as they thought, totally
extinguifhed; but, that fome fparks getting between
the timber, and within the ceiling, it proceeded into
the hold, where there was no refilling it: that then
they got into their boats, as creatures in the laft
extremity, with what provifion they had, together
with oars, fails, and a compafs, intending to go back
to Newfoundland, the wind blowing at 8. E. and by
E. though there were feveral chances againft them,
as florins to overfet and founder them, rains and colds
to benumb and perifh their limbs, and contrary winds
to keep them back and ftarve them; but, laid he,
in this our great diftrefs, we heard the welcome re-
port of your guns, when, with unfpeakabls jov, ta-
Q . 'king
king down our mafts and fails, we were refolved to
lie by till morning; but perceiving your light, we
fet our oars at work to keep our boat a-head, the
.fooner to attain your fhip, the happy inftrument of
our deliverance.
Indeed, no one can exprefs the joy of thefe poor
creatures on this occafion; fear and grief are eafily
fet forth; fighs and tears, with a few motions of the
hands and head, are all the demonftrations of tbefe
paffions; but an excefs of joy, carries in it a thoufand
extravagancies; efpecially, I think, amongft the
French, whofe temper is allowed to be more volatile,
paffionate, fprightly, and gay, than that of other na-
tions. Some were weeping, tearing themfelves in
the greateft agonies of forrow, and running flark
mad about the fhip, while the reft were ftamping
with their feet, wringing their hands, finging,
laughing, fwooning away, vomiting, fainting, with
a few returning hearty thanks to the Almighty, and
crofting themfelves. I think, if I am not miftaken,
our furgeon was obliged to let thirty of them blood.
But among the paflengers, there were two priefts,
the one an old, and the other a young man; but
what amazed me more was, that the oldeft was in
the worf t plight; for no fooner did he perceive him-
felf freed from danger, but he dropt down, as it were
without life, and, to every one's appearance, quite
dead; but the furgeon, chafing and rubbing his arm,
opened a vein, which at firft dropped, and then
flowing more freely, the old man began to open his
eyes, and in a quarter of an hour was well again.
But foon remembering his happy change, the joy of
which whirled his blood about rafter than the veffels
could convey it, he became fo feverifh, as made him
more fit for bedlam than any other place; but the
furgeon giving him a fleepy dofe, he was perfectly
compofed the next morning.
Remarkable, indeed, was the behaviour of the young
prieft. At his entrance on board the (hip, he fell
on
on his face in the moft humble proftratidn to the Al-
mighty. 1 thought, indeed, he had fallen into a
fwoon, and fo ran to help him up; but he modeftly
told me, he was returning his thanks to the Al-
mighty, defiring me to leave him a few moments,
and that, next to his Creator, he would return me
thanks alto. And, indeed, he did fo, about three
minutes after, with great ferioufnefs and affection,
while the tears ftood in his eyes, which convinced
me of the gratitude of his foul. Nor did he lefs fhew
his piety and wifdom, in applying himfelf to his
country people, and labouring to compofe them, by
the moll powerful reafons, arguments, and perfua-
fions. And when, indeed, thefe people had taken
their night's repofe, in fuch lodgings as our fhip
would allow, we found nothing but the beft of man-
ners, and the moft civil acknowledgments, for which
the French are eminently remarkable. The next day
tbe captain and one of the priefts defired to fpeak with
me, and my nephew the com'man-dw. They tolct usv
that they had faved fome money and valuable things
out of the ruined veiTel, which was at our fervice:
only that they defired to be fet on fliore fome where in
our way. At the firft, my nephew was for accepting
the money; but I (who knew how hard my cafe
would have been, had the Portuguefe captain ferved
me fo) perfuaded him to the contrary; and therefore
told them, that as we had done nothing but what we
were obliged to do, by nature and humanity, and what
we ourfelves might expert from others in fuch calami-
ty; fo we took them up to fave diem, not to plunder
them, or leave them naked upon the --land, to perifti
for want of fubfiftence, and therefore would not accept
their money: but as to landing them, that was a great
difficulty; for, being bound to the Eaft Indies, it
was impoilible wilfully to change our voyage upon
their particular account, nor could my nephew (who
was under charter-party to purfue it by way of Bra/.il)

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
anfwer it to the freighters. All that we could do, was
to put ourfelves in the way of meeting fome fhips
homeward bound from the Weft Indies, th;:t, if pof-
fible, they might get a paflage to France or .England.
Indeed, they were very thankful for our firft kind-
nefs; but were under great concern, efpecially the
paflengers, at their being carried to the Eaft Indies.
They begged, therefore, I would keep on the banks of
Newfoundland, where, probably, they might meet
with fome fhip or Hoop to carry them to Canada,
•whence they' came. As this was but a reafonable
requeft, I was inclined to grant it, Cnce it was no
breach of charter-party, and that the laws of God
and nature obliged us to do what good we could to
our fellow-creatures; and befides, the danger we
ourfelves fhould be in for want of provifions: fo we
confented to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind
and weather would permit; if not, that we fhould
carry them to Martinico in, the Weft Indies. But as
ij happened, in a week's time, we made the banks of
Newfoundland, where the French people hired a bark
to carry them to France. But the young prieft being
defirous to go to the Eaft-Indies, I readily agreed to it,
becauie I liked his converfation, and two'or three of
the French failors alfo entered themfelves on board
our fhip.
Now, directing our courfe for the Weft Indies,
fteering »S. and S. by E. about twenty days, with lit-
tle wind, another adventure happened, to exercife our
humanity. In the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes
north, the Jpth of March 1694-5, we perceived a
fail, (our courfe S. E. and by S.), which bore up
to us, and then fhe appeared to be a large veflel,
having loft her main top-maft, fore-mart, and bolt-
.fprit; when firing a gun, as a fignal of diftrefs, wind
N. N. W. we foon came to fpeak with her. She
was a fhip of Brilol, bound home, from Barbadoes,
out of which road fhe had been forced by a hurricane
to the weftward, in whioh they loft their mafts.
They
They told us, their expectations were to fee the Ba-
hama iflamls, but were driven away by a ftrong
wind at N.N.W. and having no fails to work the fhip
\vith, but the main courfe, and a kind of fquare fail
upon a jury fore-mail, becaufe they could not come
near, the land, were endeavouring to fland for the
Canaries; nay, what was worfe, befides all their fa-
tigue, they were almoft ftarved for want of provifion,
having ate nothing for eleven days; all that they
had aboard was fugar, a barrel of frefh water, and
feven cafks of rum. Jn this fhip were three paffen-
gers, a youth, his mother, and a maid fervant, who
were in a moft deplorable condition for want of food.
If I had not gone on board their fhip, the knowledge
of their mifery had been concealed from me, and they
would have inevitably perifhed, though, indeed, their
fecond mate (who was captain, by reafon the true;
captain was not on board when the hurricane hap-
pened) had before informed me that there were fuch
perfons on board, whom he fuppofed to be dead, be-
ing afraid to enquire after them, becaufe he had no-
thing to give them for relief. Hereupon we refolved
to let them have what we could fpare, ordering the
mate to bring fome of his men on board us, which
he did accordingly; as he and they looked like fke-
leions, when meat was fet before them, I ordered
them to eat fparingly. Bur, however, they foon fell
fick; which obliged the furgeon to mix fomething in
their b;oth, which was to be to them both food and
phyfic. When they were fed, we ordered our mate
to carry them a fack of bread, and four or five
pieces of beef; but the furgeon charged them to fee
it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook-room, to
prevent the men from eating it raw, and-confequent-
Jy killing themfelves with what was defigned for
their relief. But, particularly, I defired the mate to
fee what condition the poor paiTengers were in, and
the furgeou gave -him a pitcher of the fame broih
which lie had prepared for the ineu. And being cu-
rioiS
rious to fee this fcene of mifery myfelf, I took the cap-
tain (as we called the mate of the fhip) in our own
boat, and failed after them.
Here was n fad fight indeed! fcarce were the vic-
tuals half boiled in the pot, but they were ready to
break open the cook-room door. To ftay their fto-
machs, the mate gave them bifcuits, which were
dipped in, and foftened with the liquor of the meat,
which they call Brenife; telling them, it was for
their own fafety, that he was obliged to give them
but a little at a time: and fo feeding them gradually,
their bellies were comfortably filled, and the men did
very well again. But when they came to the poor
gentlewoman in the cabin, who, for feveral days, had
continued without food, giving what fhe had to her
fon, they found her as it were in the arms of death.
•4!he was fitting upon the floor'of the deck, with her
bade up againft the fides, between two chairs, which
•were lamed faft, and her head fhrunk between her
fhoulders, like a fenfelefs corpfe. Nothing was
wanting in my mate to revive and encourage her;
opening her lips, and putting fome broth into her
mouth with a fpoon. But not having ftrength to
fpeak, fhe lifted up her head with much difficulty, in-
timating that it was now too late! at the fame time
pointing to the youth her fon, as though fhe defired
him to do what he could to fave the lad; and, in a
little after, fhe died.
The youth, indeed, was not fo far gone, yet lay
ftretched out in a cabin bed, like one that had fcarce
any life. In his mouth was a piece of an old glove,
the reft of which he had ate up. At firft he vomited
what the mate had given him; but at length began
fcnfibly to revive, though in the greateft concern for
the death of his tender mother.
As to the poor maid, (lie lay by her miftrefs, like
o»e in the laft pangs of death: her limbs were diftort-
rd, one of her hands was clafped round the frame of
a chair, which fhe griped fo hard, that it was with
fome
fome difficulty we feparateci her from it: tier other
arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both toge-
ther, fet faft againft the frame of the cabin table : not
only being ftarved with hunger, but overcome with
grief for the lofs of her miflrefs, whom fhe loved moft
tenderly. It was a great while before the furgeon
could bring her to life, and a much longer time be-
fore fhe came to her fenfes.
After we had failed with them fome days, we fent
them five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogf-
heads of bifcuit, with peafe, flour, and other things;
taking three ca&s of fugar, fome rum, and fome
pieces of eight for fatisfaflion, we left them, but took
the youth and maid with us, with all their goods.
The lad was about feventeen years old, very hand-
fome, modeft, fenfible, and well bred, but mightily
concerned for the lofs of his honoured mother, ha-
ving loft his father at Barbadoes but a few months
before. He befeecbed the furgeon to intercede with
me to take him out of the fhip; for that the failors,
not fparing a fmall fuftenance, had ftarved his mo-
ther. But hunger has no bounds, no right, and
confcquently is incapable of any compaffion. When
the furgeon told him, that our voyage might put
him in bad circumftances, and farther from his
friends; he anfwered, he did not care, fo he was
delivered from that terrible crew: that as the captain
(meaning me) had faved him from death, fo he
was fure~he would do him no harm; and as for
the maid, when (he was reftored to her fenfes, fhe
would be no lefs thankful, let us carry them where
we would. And, indeed, the furgeon fo reprefented
their cafe to me, that I confented, and took them on
board, with all their goods, except eleven hogfheads
cf fugar; but the youth having a bill of lading, I
made the commander oblige himfelf to deliver a let-
ter and the deceafed-widow's goods to Mr Rogers,
a merchant in Briftol; but I believe the fhip was loft
at fea, for we,could never hear what became of her
afterwards.
afterwards. We were now in the latitude of 19
deg. 32 min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage.
But, palling by fcveral little incidents relating to
•wind aml weather, I fhall relate what is moft re-
markable concerning my little kingdom, to which I
•was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in
finding it; for as I came to, and went from it before,
on the fouth and eaft fide of the Maud, as coming
from the Brazils; fo now approaching between the
main and the illand, not having any chart for the
coaft, nor land-mark, it obliged us to go on fliore
feveral iflands on the mouth of the river Oroonoko,
but to no purpofe. This I perceived, that what I
thought was a continent before, was no fuch thing,
but a long ifland, or rather a ridge of fands. On
one of thefe iflands I found fome Spaniards, but they
belonged to the Me de Trinidad, who came hither
in a floop to make fait, and to try to find fome pearl
mufcles. But, at length, I came fair on the fouth fide
of my ifland, and then I prefently knew the counte-
nance of my little kingdom, fo we brought the fhip
fafe to an anchor, broadfide within the little cresk,
where flood my ancient and venerable caftle.
No fooner did I fee the place, but calling for Fri-
day, I afked him where he was? But when he look-
ed a little, he clapped his hands, crying, 0 joy, 0
there, 0 yes, 0 there! pointing to our old abode, and
then fell a dancing and capering as if he was mad,
and I had mucii ado to keep him from jumping into
the fea, to fwim afhore. Friday, faid I, what do you
think, fhall we go fee your father? At the men-
tioning his father's name, the poor affectionate crea-
ture fell a weeping: No, no, fays he, me Jee him no
more, never fee foor father more! he hug ago Ju; die
long ago; he much old man. You don't know that,
Friday, faid I, but fhall we fee any body elfe? He
looks about, and pointing to the hill a'bove my houle,
cries out, We fee, we jce, there much men and
there!
there! which, though I could not perceive them with
my perfpeclive glafs, was true, by what the men
themfelves told me the next day.
When the Englifh ancient was fpread, and three
guns fired as a fignal of friendfhip, we perceived a
fmoke rife from the creek; upon which I ordered
the boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging
out a white flag of truce, I went on fhore, accom-
panied alfo by the young friar, to whom I had rela-
ted the hiftory of the firfl part of my life: befides, we
had fixteen men well armed, in cafe we had met with
any oppofition.
After we had rowed directly into the creek, the
firft man I fixed my eye upon, was the Spaniard,
•vvhofe life I had faved, and whofe face I perfectly
veil knew. I ordered them all to ftay in the boat
for, a while; but Friday perceiving his father at a
diftance, would have jumped into the fea, had they
not let the boat go. No fooner was he on fhore,
but he flew like a fwift arrow out of a bow, to em-
brace his aged father. Certai-.Jy it would melt a
man of the firmeft refolution, into the fofteft tears,
to fee with what uncommon tranfports of joy he f,i-
luted him: he firft kiffed him, then ftroked his face,
took him in his arms, laid him under a fhady tree,
fat down by him, then looked as earneft at him, as
one would do at a picture, for a quarter of an hour
together. After this, he would lie upon the ground,
ftroke his legs, and kifs them, then get up and ftare
at him, as though he was bewitched: but the next
day one could not forbear laughter to fee his behavi-
our, for he would walk feveral hours with his father
along the fhore, leading him by the hand, as though
he was a lady; while, every now and then he would
run to the boat, to get fomething for him, as a
lump of fugar, dram, bifcuit, or fomething or other
that was good. His frolics ran in another channel
in the afternoon; for when he fet old Friday on the
ground, he would dance round him, making comi-
cal
cal poftures and geftures: and all this while would
be telling him one ftory or other of his travels and
adventures.
It was on the icth of April, anno 1695, tnat ^ fet
•"y feet upon the ifland a.fecond time. When my
faithful Spaniard, accompanied by one m6re, gff*
proached the boat, he little knew who I was, till I
difcovered myfelf to him: Seignior, faid I, in Por-
tuguefe, don't you know me? he fpoke never a word,
but giving his mufket to his attendant, £xtended his
arms, and faying fomething in Spanifh, that I did not
then underfland, he came forward, and embraced
me, faying, he was inexcu'fable, not to know his de-
liverer; who, like an angel fent from heaven, had
faved his life. He then beckoned to the man to call
out his companions, afldng me, if I would walk to
my own habitation, and take pofleffion, where I
fhould find fome mean improvements: but indeed
they were extraordinary ones; for they had planted
fo many trees fo clofe together, that the place was
like a labyrinth, which none could find out, except
themfelves, who knew its intricate windings. lark-
ed him the meaning of all thefe fortifications ; he
told me he would give me a large account of what
had paffed fince my departure to this.time, and how
he had fubdued fome Englifh, who thought to be
their murderers, hopijig 1 would not be difpleafed,
fince neceffity compelled them to it. As I knew
they were wicked villains, fo I told him, that I was
not only-far from finding fault with it, but was ra-
ther heartily glad that they had fubdued them.
While we were thus talking, the man whom he had
fent returned, accompanied by eleven more, but in
fuch habits, that it was impoffible to tell what na-
tions they were of. He firft turned to me, and
pointing to them ; Thefe, Sir, faid he, are fome of
the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodnefs;
then turning to them, and pointing to me, he made
them fenfible who I was: and then indeed they fa-
luted
luted me one by one; not as ordinary men, but as
though they had been ambafladors or noblemen,- and
I a triumphant conqueror j for their behaviour -hot
only agreed with a manlike majeftk gravity, but, at
the fame time was fo obliging and courteous, as made
them admirable to the lail degree.
Before I relate the biftory of the tranfactions of
my kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own
mouth, I muft here infert what I omitted in my for-
mer relation. The matter is thus : Juft before we
weighed anchor to fet fail, there happened a quarrel
on board the fhip, which had like to have occafioned
afecond mutiny, till fuch time as the courageous cap-
tain, taking two of the moft refractory prifoners,
laid them in irons, threatening, as they were con-
cerned in the former diforders, to have them hang-
ed in England, for running away with the fhip.
This frightened fome of the reft, as thinking the cap-
tain would ferve them in the fame manner, though
he feemed to give them good words for the prefent.
But the mate having intelligence of this, made me
acquainted with their fears; fo that, to make them
more eafy, and ourfelves more fafe from their confpi-
racies, I was obliged to go down, and pafs my ho-
nour's word for it, that, upon their good behaviour,
all that was paft mould be pardoned; in tefti"iony of
which I ordered the two men's irons to be taken off",
and themfelves forgiven. But as this had brought
us to an anchor that night, in which there was a calm,
the two men- that had been in irons, ftole each of
them a mufket, and fome other weapons, and taking
the (hip's pinnace, not yet haled up,. ran away to.
their brother rogues. The next mormng we fent
the long boat, with men to purfue them; but all in
vain; the mate, in revenge, would have demolimed
my little cattle, burnt its furniture, and deftroyed
their plantations; but having no orders for it he did
not put it in execution. And thus there were five
Englifhmen ia the iflaud, which caufcd great differ-
ences,
ences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect ac-
count of it in the following manner.
You cannot, Sir, but remember the embafly you
fent me about, and what a difappointment we met
•with, by your abfence, at our return. There is but
little variety in the relation of our voyage, being
blefled with calm weather, and a fmooth fea. Great,
indeed, was the joy of my countrymen to fee me a-
live, having aGed as the principal man on board,
the captain of the fhipwrecked veflel dying before;
, nor was their furprife lefs, as knowing I was taken
prifoner by the favages of another nation, they
thought me long Cnce entombed in their monftrous
bowels. But- when I fhewed them the arms, ammu-
nition, and provifions I had brought for them, they
looked upon me as a fecond Jofeph advanced in
Pharaoh's court, and immediately prepared to come
along with me. Indeed, they were obliged to trefpafs
upon their friendly favages, by borrowing two of
their canoes, under a pretext for fifhing: and they
came away the next morning, but without any pro-
vifions of their own, except a few roots, which
ferved them inftead of bread. After three weeks
abfence, we arrived at your habitation. Here we
met with three Englifh failors, who, I confefs, gave
us provifions, and that letter of directions you had
left for us, which informed us how to bring up tame
goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make pots; and, in
fhort, every thing that was neceflary for our ufe;
as, in particular, I knew your method beft, fo taking
Friday's father to affift me, we managed all the af-
fairs; nor were the reft of the Spaniards wanting in
their kind offices, dreffing food for the Englifhmen,
who did nothing but ramble and divert themfelves in
the woods, either fhooting parrots, or catching tortoi-
fes. But we had not been iong afhore, before we were
informed of two more Englifhmen, unnaturally turn-
ed out of their common place of refidence by the
three others above mentioned : this made my Spa-
niards
niards and me (whom they now looked upon as
their governor in your abfence) endeavour to per-
fuade them to take them in, that we might be as
one family; but all our entreaties were in vain, fo
that the poor fellows, finding nothing to be done
without induftry, pitched their tents on the north
fide of the ifland, a little inclining to the weft, for
fear of favages. Here they built two huts, one
to lodge, and the other to lay their ftores in; for
my good natured Spaniards giving them fome feeds,
they dug and planted as I had done, and began to
live prettily. But while they were thus comfortably
going on, the three unnatural brutes, their country-
men, in a mere bullying humour, infulted them,
by faying, the governor (meaning you) had given
them pofieffion of the ifland, and d—mn 'em, they
fliould build no houfes upon their ground, without
paying rent. The two honeft men (for fo let me
now diftinguifh them) thought their three country-
men only jefted, and one of them invited them in,
to fee their fine habitations; while the other face-
tioufly told them, that Cnce they built tenements,
with great improvements, they fhould, according to
the cuftom of landlords, give them a longer leafe;
at the fame time defiring them to fetch a fcrivener
to draw the writings. One of the wretches fvvear-
ing he fhould pay for the jeft, fnatches up a fire-
brand, and clapping it to the outfide of their hut,
very fairly fet it on fire, which would foon have con-
fumed it, had not the honeft man thruft him away,
and trod it out with his feet. Hereupon the fellow
returns with a pole, with which he would have
ended his days, had not the poor man avoided the
blow; when, fetching his mufket, he knocked down
the villain that began the quarrel. The other two
coming to affift their fellow, obliged the honeft man
to take his mufket alfo, and both of them prefenting
their pieces, bid the villains fland off; and if they
did not lay down their arms, death mould decide the
R difpute
fdifpute one way or other. This brought them to ar
parley, in which they agreed to take their wounded
man and be gone j but they were in the wrong that
they did not difcrm them when they had the power,
and then make their complaint to me and my Spa-
niards for juftice, which might have prevented their
farther defigns againft them. And indeed fo many
trefpafles did they afterwards commit, by Itreading
down their corn, fhooting their young kids and
goats, and plaguing them night and day, >that
they refolved to come to my caftle, challenge all
the three, and decide their right by one plain
battle, while the Spaniards flood by to fee fair play.
One day it happened, that two of my Spainards (one
of whom underftood Englifh) being in the woods,
v ere met by one of the honeft men, who complain-
ed how barbarous their countrymen had been in
deftroying their corn, killing their milch-goat, and
three kids, which deprived them of their fubfiftence;
that if we did not grant them relief, they muft be
inevitably ftarved; and fo they parted: but when
my'Spaniards came home at night, and fupper being
on the table, one of them began to reprehend the
Englifhmen, but in a very mannerly way; which they
refenting, replied, What bufinefs had their country-
men there without leave, when it was none of their
ground ? "Why, faid my Spaniard, calmly, Inglefe,
they muft not ftarve; but they replied, Let them
ftarve and be d—mn'd, they fhould neither plant nor
build, and d—mn them they fhould be their fer-
vants, and work for them, for the ifland was theirs,
and they would burn all the huts they fhould find
in the land. By this rule, faid my Spaniard, fmiling,
we fhall be your fervants too. Aye, by G—d, and
fo you fhall, replied the impudent rafcal. Upon
which, ftarting up, Will. Atkins cries, Come, Jack,
let's have t'other brufh with them; who dare to
build in our dominions? Thus leaving us fomething
heated with a juft paffion, away they trooped, every
man
man having a gun, piftol, and fword, muttering fome
threatening words, that we could then but imperfect!y
underftand. That night they defigned to murder their
two companions, and flept till midnight in the bower,
thinking to fall upon them in their fleep: nor were
the honeft men lefs thoughtful concerning them;
for, at this juncture, they were coming to find them
out, but in a much fairer way. As foon as the
villains came to the huts, and found nobody there,
they concluded that I and my Spaniards had given
them notice, and therefore fwore to be revenged on
us. Then they demolifhed the poor mens habita-
tion; not by fire, as they attempted before, but
pulled down their houfes, limb from limb, not lea-'
ving flick nor ftone on the ground where they flood;
broke their houfehold fluff in pieces, tore up their
trees, fpoiled their inclofures, and, in fhort, quite
ruined them of every thing they had. Had thefe
people met together^ no doubt but there would have
been a bloody battle; but Providence ordered it for
the better; for juft as the three were got thither,
the two were at our caftle; and, when they left us,
the three came back again, but in a great rage,
fcoffingly telling us what they had done; when one
taking hold of a Spaniard's hat, twirls it round, fay-
ing, And you, Seignior, Jack Spaniard, fa.ill have the
fumefauce, if you don't mend your manners. My Spa-
niard, a grave, but courageous man, knocked him
down with one blow of his fift; at which another
villain fired his piftol, and narrowly miffed his body,
but wounded him a little in the ear. Hereat enraged,
the Spaniard takes up the fellow's mufket whom he
had knocked down, and would have fhot him, if I
and the reft had not come out, and taken their arms
from every one of them.
Thefe Englifhmen, perceiving they had made all of
us their enemies, began to cool; bur, notwithfland-
ing their better words, the Spaniards would rot re-
turn them their arms again, telling them, they would
R 2 do
do them no manner of harm, if they would live
peaceably j but, if they offered any injury to the plan-
tation or caflle, they would fhoot them as they
would do ravenous beafts. This made them fo mad,,
that they went away raging like furies of hell. They
were no fooner gone, but in came the two honeft
men, fired with the jufleft rage, if fuch can be, ha-
ving been ruined as aforefaid. And, indeed, it was
very hard, that nineteen of us fhouhl be bullied
by three villains, continually offending with impu-
nity.
It was a great while, Sir, before we could perfuade
the two Englifhmen from purfuing, and undoubtedly
killing them with their fire arms; but we promifed
them jyftice fhould be done them, and in the mean
time they fliould refide with us in our habitation.
In about live days after, thefe three vagrants, almofl
ftarveii with hunger, drew near our grove, and per-
ceiving me, the governor, and two others, walking
by t'ac fide of the creek, they very fubrniffively de-
fired to be received into the family again. We
told them of their great incivility to us, and of their
unnatural barbarity to their countrymen; but yet
•we would fee to what the reft agreed to, and in half
an hour's time would bring them word. After fome
debate, we called them in, where their two coun-
trymen laid a heavy charge againft them, for not
only ruining, but defigning to ra'urder them, which
they could not deny. But here I was forced to
interpofe as a mediator, by obliging the two Englifh-
men not to hurt them, being naked and unarmed;
and that the other three fhould make them reflitH-
tion, by building their two huts, and fencing their
ground in the fame manner as it was before. Well,
being in a miferable condition, they fubmitted to
this at prefent, and lived fome time regularly enough*
except as to the working part, which they did not
care for, but the Spaniards would have difpenfed
with that, had they continued, eafy and quiet. Their
arms
arms being given them again, they fcarce had them •
a week, when they became as troublefome as ever;
but an accident happening foon after, obliged us to
lay afide private refentments, and look to our com-
mon prefervation.
One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfectly well in
health, and yet by no means could I compofe myfelf
to fleep. Upon which, being very uneafy, I got up,
and looked out; but it being dark, I could perceive
nothing but the trees around our caftle. I went to
bed again; but, it was all ^>ne, I could not fleep;
•when one of my Spaniards, hearing me walk about,
aiked who it was up? I aufwere-d, It is I. When
I. told him the occafion ; Sir, faid he, fuch things
are not to be ffighted; for certainly there is feme
mifchief plotting near us. »Where are the Euglifh-
men? faid I. He anfwered, in their huts; for they .
lay feparate from us, Sir, fince the laft mutiny. Well,
faid I, fome kind fpirit gives this information, for
our advantage. Come, let us go abroad, and fee if
any thing offers to juftify our fears. Upon which I
and fome of my Spaniards went up the mountain, not
by the ladder, but through the grove; and then we
were ftruck with a panic fear, on feeing a lighr,
as though it were a fire, at a very little dflance,
and hearing the voice of feveral men. Hereupon we
retreated immediately, and raifing the reft of our
forces, made them fenfible of the impending danger;.
but, with all my authority, I could not make them
flay where they were, fo earneft were they to fee
how things went. Indeed, the darknefs of the night
gave them opportunity enough to view them (by
the light of the fire) undifcovered. As they were
in different parties, and ftraggling over the fhore,
we were much afraid that they fhould find out our
habitations, and deftroy our flocks of goats. To
prevent which, we fent an Englifhman and two Spa-,
niards to drive the goats into the valley where the
<ave lay; or, if there was occafion, into the cave
R 3 itfelf
itfelf. As to ourfelves, refnming our native couragey
and prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we
durft venture to attack an hundred of them; bnr, be-
fore it was yet light, we refolved to fend out Friday's
father as a fpy, who, immediately, (tripping himfelf
naked, gets among them undifcovered, and, in two
hours time, brings word, that they were two parties
of two different nations, who lately having a bloody
battle with one another, happened to land, by mere
chance, in the fame ifland, to devour their miferable
prifoners: That they were entirely ignorant of any
perfon's inhabiting here; but rather, being filled with
rage and fury againft one another, he believed, thary
as foon as day-light appeared, there would be a terri-
ble engagement. Old Friday had fcarce ended his-
relation, when we hean? an uncommon noife, and
perceived, that there was a horrid engagement be-
tween the two armies.
Such was the curiofity of our party, efpecially the
Englifhmen, tint they would not lie elofe, though-
Old Friday told them, their fafety depended upon it;
and that, if we had patience, we mould behold the
favages kill one another. However, they ufed fome
caution, by going further into the woods, and pla-
cing themfelves in a convenient place to behold the
battle.
Never could there be a more bloody engagement,.
nor men of more invincible fpirits, and prudent con-
duct, according to their way and manner of fighting.
It lafted near two hours, till that party which was
neareft to our caftle began to decline, and, at Jaft, to-
fly from their conquerors. We were undoubtedly
put into u great confirmation on this account, left
they fliould run into our grove, and confequently
bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we refolved
to kill the firft that came, to prevent difcovery; and:
that too with our fwonb, and the butt end of our
mufkets, for fear the report of our guns fhould be
heard.
And
And fo indeed, as we thought, it happened: for
three of the vanquifhed army croffing the creek, ran
directly to the place, as to a thick wood, for fhelter;
nor was it long before our fcout gave us notice of it;
as alfo, that the victors did not think fit to purfue
them. Upon this I would not fuffer them to be
flain, but had them fwrprifed and taken by our par-
ty: and afterwards they proved very good fervants
to us, being flout young creatures, and able to do a
great deal of work. The remainder of the conquer-
ed favages fled to their canoes, and put out into the
ocean, while the conquerors, joining together, fhout-
ed by way of triumph: and about three in the after-
noon, they alfo embarked for their own nation.
Thus we were freed at once from the favages and
our fears, not perceiving any of thefe creatures for
fome confiderable time after. We found two and
thirty men dead in the field of battle; fome were
flain with long arrows, which we found flicking in
their bodies; and the reft were killed with great un-
weildy wooden fwords, which denoted their vaft.
ftrength, and of which we found feventeen, befides
bows and arrows: but we could not find one wound-
ed creature among them alive; for they either kill!
their enemies quite, or carry thofe wounded away
with them.
This terrible fight tamed the Englifhmen for fome
time, confidering how unfortunate they might have
been, had they fallen into their hands, who would not
only kill them as enemies, but alfo for food, as we
do cattle; and, indeed, fo much did this naufeate
their flomachs, that it not only made them very Ock,
but more traceable to the common uecefiary buifnefs
of the whole fociety, planting, fowing, and reaping,,
with the greateft Cgns of amity and friendfhip: fo
that now, being all good friends, we began to confider
of circumftances in general; and the firil thing we
thought of, was, whether, as we perceived the fava-
ges haunted tint fide of the ifland, and there being
more
more retired parts of it, and yet as well fuited to our
manner of living, and equally to our advantage, we
ought not rather to move our place of refidence, and
plant it in a much fafer place, both for the fecurity of
our corn and cattle?
After a long debate on this head, it was refolved,
or rather voted, nemine contradicente, not to remove
our ancient caftle, and that for this very good reafon,
that, fome time or other, we expected to hear from our
fupreme governor, (meaning you, Sir). whole mef-
fengers not finding us there, might think the place
demolifhed, and all his fubjects deftroyed by the fa-
vages.
As to the next concern, relating to our corn and
cattle, we conferred to have them removed to the
valley where the cave was, that being mefl proper
and fufficient for both-. But yet, when we confi-
"dered further, we altered one part of our refolution;
which was, to remove part of our cattle thither, and.
plant only part of our corn there; fo that in cafe
one part was deftroyed, the other might be preferved.
Another refolution we took, which really had a great
deal of prudence in it; and that was, in not trufting
the three favages whom we had taken prifoners,.
with any knowledge of the plantations which we
had made in that valley, of what number of cattle we
had there, much lefs of the eave, wherein were kept
feveral arms, and two barrels of powder you left for
us, at your departure from this ifland. But though
we would not change our habitation, we refolved
to make' it more fortified, and more lecret. To this
end, Sir, as you had planted trees at fome diftance
before the entrance of your palace; fo we, imita-
ting your example, planted and filled up the whole
fpace of ground, even to the banks of the creek, nay,
into the very ooze, where the tide flowed, not lea-
ving a place for landing: and among thofe I had
planted, they had intermingled fo many fhort ones,
all of which growing wonderfully faft and thick, a
." litde
little dog fcarcely could find a paffage through them.
ISTor was this fufficient, as we thought; for we did
the fame to all the ground, to the right and left hand
of us, even to the top of the hill, without fo much
as leaving a paflage for ourfelves, except by the lad-
der: which being taken down, nothing but what had
wings or witchcraft could pretend to come near us.
And, indeed, this was exceedingly well contrived,
'efpecially to ferve that occafion, for which we after-
wards found it necefiary.
Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement,
having, all this time, not one vifit from the favages.
Indeed, one morning, we had an alarm, which put
us in fome amazemenr; for a few of my Spaniards
being out very early, perceived no lefs than twenty
canoes, as it were coming on fhore; upon which, re-
turning home, with great precipitation, they gave us
the alarm, which obliged us to keep at home all that
day, and the next, going out only in the night-time,
to make our obfervations: but, as good luck would
have it, they were upon another defign, and did not
land that time upon the ifland.
But now there happened another quarrel between
the three wicked EnglifJimen, and fome of my Spa-
niards. The occafion was this: One of them being
enraged at one of the favages, whom he had taken
prifoner, for not being able to comprehend fome-
thing which he was fhewing him, fnatched up a
hatchet in a great fury, not to correct, but to kill
him; yet miffing his. head, gave him fuch a barba-
rous cut in the fhoulder, that he had like to have
ftruck off his arm; at which one of my good-natured
Spaniards interpofing between the Englifhman and
favage, befeeched the former not to murder the poor-
creature; but this kindnefs had like to have coft
the Spaniard his life, for the Englifhman ftruck at
him in the fame manner; which he nimbly and
wifely avoiding, returned fuddenly upon hint with his
fhovcl, (being ajl at work about their corn-land), and
very
very fairly knocked the brutifh creature down.
Hereupon, another Englifhman, coming to his fel-
low's affiftance, laid the good Spaniard on the earth;
when immediately two others coming to his relief,
were attacked by the third Englifhman, armed with
an old cutlafs, who wounded them both. This up-
roar foon reached our ears, when we, rufhing out
upon them, took the three Englifhmen prifoners:
and then our next queftion was, what fhould be done
to fuch mutinous and impudent fellows, fo furious,
defperate, and idle, that they were mifchievous to
the higheft degree, and confequently not fafe for the
fociety to let them live among them.
Now, Sir, as I was governor in your abfence, fo
I alfo took the authority of a judge; and, having
them brought before me, I told them, that if they
had been of my country, I would have hanged every
mother's fon of them; but, fmce it was an Englifh-
man (meaning you, kind Sir) to whom we were in-
debted for our prefervation and deliverance, I would,
in gratitude, ufethem with all poffible mildnefs; but,
at the fame time, leave them to the judgment of the
other two Englifhmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their
refentments, would deal impartially by them.
Hereupon, one of his countrymen ftooil up: Sir,
faid he, leave it not to us, for you may be fenfble -we
have reafon tofentence them to the gallows: befides,
Sir, this fellow, Will. Atkins, and the two others,
propofedto us, that we might murder you all in your
Jleep, -which -we would not confent to; but, knowing
their inability, and your vigilance, we did not think
Jit to difcover it before now.
How, Seignior, faid I, do you hear what is alled-
ged againft you? What can you fay to juftify fo hor-
rid an action, as to murder us in cold blood? So far,
Sir, was the wretch from denying it, that he fwore,
•d—n him but he would do it ftill. But what have
we done to you, Seignior Atkins, faid I, or what
will you gain by killing us? What fhall we do
oft
to prevent you? Muft we kill you, or you kill us:
Why will you, Seignior Atkins, (faidl fmiling), put
us to fuch an unhappy dilemma, fuch a fatal neceffi-
ty? But fo great a rage did my fcoffing, and yet fe-
vere jeft, put him into, that he was going to fly at
me, and undoubtedly had attempted to kill me if he
had been poflefled of weapons, and had not been pre-
vented by three Spaniards. This unparallelled and
villanous carriage, made us ferioufly confider what
was to be done. The two Englifhmen and the Spa-
niard, who had faved the poor Indian's life, mightily
petitioned me to hang one of them, for an example
to the others, which mould be him that had twice at-
tempted to commit murder with his hatchet, it being
at that time thought impoffible the poor flave fhould
recover. But they could never gain my confent to
put him .to death, for the reafons above mentioned,
fince it was an Englifhman (even yourfelf) who was
my deliverer: and as merciful counfels are moft pre-
vailing, when earneftly prefled, fo I got them to be
of the fame opinion as to clemency. But, to prevent
their doing us any farther mifchief, we all agreed,
that they fhduld have- no weapons, as fword, gun,
powder, or fhcr, but be expelled from the fociety, to
live as they pleafed, by themfelves; that neither the
two Englifhmen, nor the reft of the Spaniards, fhould
have converfation with them upon any account what-
foever: thr>t they fhould be kept from coming within
a certain diftancc of our caftle; and if they dared to
offer us any violence, either by fpoiling, burning,
killing, or deftroying any of the corn, plantings,
buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the fociety,
we would moot them as freely as we would do beafts
of prey, in whatfoever places we fhould find them.
This fentence feemed very juft to all but them-
felves ; when, like a merciful judge, I called out to
the two honeft Englifhmen, faying, You muft confi-
der they ought not to be ftarved neither; and fince it
will
•will be fome time before they can raifc corn and cat-
tle of their own, let us give them fomc corn to Jaft
them eight months, and for feed to fow, by which
time they'll raife fome for themfelves: let us alfo be-
ftow upon them fix milch-goats, four he ones, and
fix kids, as well for their prefent fupport, as for a
further increafe; with tools neceflary for their wort,
as hatchets, an axe, faw, and other things conveni-
ent to build them huts: all which were agreed to; ,
but before they took them in pofleflion, I obliged
them folemnly to iwear, never to attempt any thing
againft us or their countrymen for the future. Thus
difmiffing them from our fociety, they went away,
fullen and refractory, as though neither willing to go
nor ftay: however, feeing no remedy, they took
What provifion was given them, propofing to chufe
a convenient place, where they might live by them-
felves.
About five days after, they came to thofe limits
appointed, in order for more victuals, and fent me
word by one of my Spaniards, whom they called to,
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them-
felves out an habitation and plantation, at the N. E.
and moft remote part of the ifland. And indeed
there they built themfelves two very handfome cot-
tages, refembling our little caftle, being under the
fide of a mountain, with fome trees atready growing
on three fides of it; fo that planting a few more, it
would be obfcured from fight, unlefs particularly
fought for. When thefe huts were finifhed, we gave
them fome dry goat fkins for bedding and covering;
and upon their giving us fuller aflurances of their
good behaviour for the future, we gave them fome
peafe, barley, and rice for fowing, and whatever
tools we could fpare.
Six months did they live in this feparate condition,
in which they got their firft harveft in, the quantity
of which was but fmall, becaufe they had planted
but little land: for indeed, all their plantations be-
ing
mg to form, made it the more difficult, efpeciaMy as
it was a thing out of their element: and when they
were obliged to make their boards and pots, &c= they
could make little or nothing of it. But the rainy
feafon coming on, put them into a greater perplexity
for want of a cave to keep their corn dry, and prevent
it from fpoiling :. and fo much did this humble them,
that they begged of my Spaniards to help them, to
which the good-natured men readily confented, and,
in four days fpace, worked a great hole in the fide of
the hill for them, large enough for their purpofe, to
fecure their corn and other things from the rain, tho'
not comparable to ours, which had feveral additional
Apartments.
But a new whim poflcfled thefe rogues about three
quarters of a year after, which had like to hare ru-
ined us, and themfelves too: for, it feems being tired
and weary of this fort of living, which made them
work for themfelves, without hopes of changing their
condition, nothing would ferve them, but they would
make a voyage to the continent, and try if they could
feize upon fome of the favages, and bring them over
as flaves, to do their drudgery, while they lived at
eafe and pleafure.
Indeed the project was not fo prepofterous, if they
had not gone farther; but they neither did, nor pro-
pofed any thing, but what had mifchief in the de-
fign, or the event. One morning, thefe three fellows
came down to the limited ftation, and humblj defi-
red to be admitted to talk wiih us, which we readi-
ly granted; they told us, in fhort, that, being tired
of their manner of living and the labour of their
handc, in fuch employments, not being fufficient to
procure the neceflkries of lite, they only deiired one
of the canoes we came over in, with fome arms and
ammunition, for their defence, and they would feck
their fortunes abroad, and never trouble us any more.
To be fure, we were glad enough to get rid of fuch,
wretched plagues; but yet honefty made us ingenu-
S oufly
oufly reprefent to them, by what we curfelves had
fufFered, the certain deftruction they were running
into, either of being ftarved to death, or murdered
by the favages. To this they very 'audacioufly re-
plied, that they neither could nor would work; and
confequently, that they might as well be ftarved a-
broad as at home: and as to their falling into the
hands of the favages, why, if they were murdered,
that was nothing to us, there was an end of them;
neither had they any wives or children to cry after
them; nay, fo intent were they upon their voyage,
that if the Spaniards had not given them arms, fo
they had but the canoe, they would have gone without
them.
Though we could not well fpare our fire-arms, ra-
ther than they fnould go like naked men, we let them
have two mufkets, a piftol, a cutlafs, and three hat-
chets, which were thought very fufficient: we gave
them alfo goats flefli,.a great balket full of dried grapes,
a pot of frefh butter, a young live kid, and a large
canoe fufficient to carry twenty men. And thus,
•with a maft, made of a long pole, and a fail of fix
large goats fkins dried, having a fair breeze, and a
flood tide with them, they merrily failed away, the
Spaniards calling after them Bon vcyujs, no man ever
expecting to fee them more.
When they were gone, the Spaniards and Englifh-
men would often fay one to another, 0 bo-w peace-
ably do "we now live,Jlnce thofe turbulent fellows have
left us? Nothing could be farther from their
thoughts, than to behold their faces any more; and
yet fcarce two and twenty days had pafled over their
heads, but one of the Englifhmen, being abroad a-
planting, perceived, at a diftance, three men, well
armed, approaching towards him. Away he flies
with fpeed to our caftle, and tells .me and the reft,
that we were all undone, for that ftrangers were
landed upon the ifland, and who they were he could
not tell 5 but added, that they were not favages, but
men
'»
men habited, bearing arms. Why then, faid I, we
have the lefs occafion to be concerned, fince, if they
are not Indians, they muft be friends; for 1 am fure
there is no Chrillian people upon earth, but what
will do us good rather than harm. But while we
were confidering of the event, up came the three
Englifhmen, whole voices we quickly knew, and ib
all our admiration of that nature ceafed at once. And
our wonder was fucceeded by another fort of enqui-
ry, which was, what could be the occafion of their re-
turning fo quickly to the ifland, when we little ex-
pected, and much lefs defired their company? But
as this was better to be related by themfelves, I or-
dered them to be brought in, when they gave me
the following relation of their voyage:
After two days fail, or fometfcing lefs, they reach-
ed land, where they found the people coming to give
them another fort of reception than what they ex-
pected or defired: for as the favages were armed
with bows and arrows, they durft not venture on
ftiore, but fleered northward, fix or feven hours, till
they gained an opening, by which they plainly per-
ceived, that the land that appeared from this place,
was not the main land, but the ifland. At their en-
trance into the opening of the fea, they difcovered
another ifland, on the right hand northward, and
feveral more lying to the weftward; but being re-
folved to go on fhore fome where or other, they
put over t& one of the weftern iflands. Here they
found the natives very courteous to them, giving
them feveral roots and dried fifh; nay, even their
women too were as willing to fupply them with what
they could procure them to eat, bringing it a great
way to them upon their heads. Among thefe ho-
fpitable Indians they continued fome days, enquiring
by figns and tokens, what nations lay around them;
and were informed, that there were feveral fierce
and terrible people lived every way, accuftomed to
eat mankind: but for themfelves, they never ufed
S a fuch
fuch diet, except thofe that were taken in battle, and
of them they made a folemn feaft.
The Englifhmen enquired how long it was fince
they had a feaft of that kind? they anfwered, about
two moons ago, pointing to the moon; and then
to two fingers; that, at this time, their king had two
hundred prifoners, which were fattening up for the
flaughter. The Englifhmen were mighty defirous
of feeing the prifoners, which the others miftaking,
thought that they wanted fome of them for their own
food: upon which they beckoned to them, pointing
to the rifing, and then to the felting of the fun;
meaning, that by the time that it appeared in theeaft
'next morning, they would bring them fome: and
indeed they were as good as their word; for by that
time they brought eleven men and five women, juft
as fo many cows and oxen are brought to fea port
towns, to victual a fhip. But as brutifh as thefe
Englifhmen were, their ftomachs turned at the fight.
"What to do in this cafe, they could not tell: to re-
fufe the prifoners, would have been the higheft af-
front offered to the favage gentry; and to difpofe of
them, they knew not in what manner: however, they
refolved to accept them, and fo gave them, in re-
turn, one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife,
and fix or feycn- of their tullets: things which tho'
they were wholly ignorant of, yet feemed entirely
contented with; and dragging the poor wretches in-
to the boat, with their hands bound behind them,
delivered them to the Englifhmen, But this obliged
them to put off as foon as they had thefe prefents,
left the donors fhould have expected two or three of
them to be killed, and to be invited to dinner the
next day: and fo taking leave with all poffible re-
fpecl and thanks, though neither of them underftood
what the others faid, they failed away back to the
firft ifland, and there fet eight of the prifoners at
liberty. In their voyage they endeavoured to com-
foit, and have fome ccnverfation with the poor cap-
tives
ti'ves; but it was impoffible to make them fenfible of
any thing; and nothing they could fay, or give or
do fpr them, could make them othenvife perluaded,
but that they were unbound only to be devoured: if
they gave them any food, they thought it was only,
to fatten them for the Daughter; or looked at any
ene more particularly, the poor creature fuppofed
hfelf to be the firft Sacrifice; and even when we
brought them to our ifland, and began to ufe them
with the greateft humanity and kindnets,' yet they
expected every day that their new mailers would dc-
Tour them.
And thus, Sir, did thefe three ftrange wanderers
conrlude their unaccountable relation of their voyage,.
•which was both amazing and entertaining. Here-
upon, I nfked them, where their new family was?
They told me, they had put them into one of their
huts, and they came to beg foma victuals for them.
This, indeed, made us all long to fee them; and
taking Friday's father with us, leaving only two at
our caftlc,, we came down to behold thefe poor crea-
tures.
When we arrived at the h'ur, (they being bound
again by the Englilhmen, for fear of efcaping), we
found them ftark naked, expecting their fatal; tra-
gedy: there were three lufty men, well fhaped, with
ftraight and fair limbs, between thirty and five aiuU
thirty years old ; and five women,.two.of them might
be from thirty to forty, two more not above four and.
twenty ; and the laft a comely tall maiden of about fo
venteen. Indeed, all the women were very agreeable,
both in their proportion and features-, except that
they were tawny, which their modeil behaviour, and
other graces, made amends for, when they afterwards
came to be clothed.
This naked appearance, together with their mifer-
able circumilances, was no very comfortable light
to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may ven-
ture. Sir, without flattery, to fay, are men. of the
a 3 J beft
beft behaviour, calmeft tempers, and fweeteft na-
ture, that can poffibly be; for they immediately or-
dered Friday's father to fee if he knew any of them,
or if he underftood what they could fay. No foon-
er did the old Indian appear, but he looked at them
with great ferioufnefs; yet, as they were not of bis
mtion, they were utter ftrangers to him, and none
eould .uivderftand his fpeech or figns, but one wo-
man. This was enough to anfwer the defign,
•winch was to allure them they would not be killed,
being fallen into the hands of Chriftians, who ab-
horred fuch barbarity. "When they were fully fatis-
fied of this, they expreffed their joy by fuch
ftrange gelhires, and uncommon tones, as it is not
pclTibiC for me to ciefcribe. But the woman, their
interpreter, was ordered next to inquire, whether
they were content to be fervants, and would work
for the men, who had brought them hither to fave
their lives? Hereupon, (being at this time unbound)
they fell * capering and dancing, one taking this
thing uppn her fhoulders, and the other that, inti-
mating, that they were willing to do any thing for
them. But now, Sir, hasingf women among us, and
dreading that it might occa/ion fame ftrife, if not
blood, I aflced the three men what they would do,
and'how they intended to ufe thcfe creatures, whe-
ther as fervants or women? One of them very pert-
ly and readily anfwered, they would ufe them as
both. Gentlemen, faid I, as you are your own ma-
fters, I am not going to rcftrain you from that; but»
merhinks, for avoiding diflemions among you, 1
would only defire you to-engage, that none of you
will take more than.one for a woman or a wife, and
that having, taken this one, none elfe fhould prefume
to touch her ; for though we have not a pricflly nu-
thority to marry you, yet it is but r>fafcnable, that
whoever thus takes a woman, fhoukl be obliged to
maintain bee: ifnce nobody elfe has any thing to do
•wiih her: and this, indeed, appeared fo j.uft to all pre,-
fcnt,,
fent, that it was unanimoufly agreed to. The En-
glifhmen then afked my Spaniards, whether they de-
figned to take any of them.? 'but they all anfwered,
No; fome declaring they had already wives in Spain;
and othe.s, that they cared not to join with infidels.
On the reverfe, the Englifhmen took each of them a
temporary wife, and fo fet up a new method of
living. As to Friday's iather, the Spaniards, and
the three favage fervants we had taken in the late
battle, they all lived with me in our ancient caftle;
and indeed we fupplied the main part of the ifland
with food, as neceffity required. But the moft re-
markable part of the ftory is, how thefe Englifhmen,
•who had been fo much at variance, fhould agree a-
bout the choice of thefe women; yet they took a
way good enough to prevent quarreling among
themfelves. They fet the five women in one of
their huts, and going themfelves to the other, drew
lots which fhould have the firft choice. Now, he
that had the firft lot went to the hut, and fetched
out her he chofe, and it is remarkable, that he took
her that was the moft homely and eldeft of the num-
ber, which made the reft of the Englifhmen exceed-
ing merry; the Spaniards themfelves could not but
fmile at it: but, as it happened, the fellow had the
bef t thought, in chufing one fit for application and
bufinefs: and indeed fhe proved the beft wife of all
the parcel.
But when the 'poor creatures perceived themfelves
placed in a row, and feparated one by one, they were
again feized with an unfpeakable terror, as now
thinking -they were going to be flain in earneft: and
when the Englifliman came to take the firft, the reft
fet up a lamentable cry, dafped their arms around
her neck, and hanging about her, took their laft
farewell, as they thought, in fueh trembling ago-
nies, and affe£tionate embraces, as would haj-e
foltened the hardeft heart in the world, and made
the dryeft eyes melt into tears j, nor could they be
psrfuaded,
perfuaded, but that they were going to die, till fuch
time as Friday's father made them fenfible that the
Engliflimen had chofen them for their wives, which
ended all their terror and concern upon this OCCSL-
fion.
Well, after this, the Englifhmen went to work,,
and being affifted by my good natured Spaniards, in
a few hours they ere£ted every one of them a new
hut or tent, for their feparate lodging, fince thofe
they hnd atready were filled with tools, houfehold
fluff, and provifion. They all continued on Ae
north fhore of the ifland, but feparate as before -r
the three wicked ones pitching farther off, and the
two honeft men nearer our caftle; fo that tr-3 ifland
feemed to be peopled in three places, three towns be-
ginning to be built for that purpofe. And here I
cannot but remark, what is very common, that the:
two honeft men had the worft wives, (1 mean as to
induftry, cleanlinefs, and ingenuity), while the
three reprobates enjoyed women of quite contrary
qualities.
But anotKer obfervation I made was, in favour of
the two honeft men, to fhew what difparity there is
between a diligent application to bufinefs, on the
one hand, and a flothful, negligent, and idle tem-
per, on the other. Both of them had the fame par-
eel of ground laid out, and corn to fow, fufficient
for them; but both did not make the fame improve-
ments, either in their cultivation or in their plant-
ing. The two honeft men had a multitude of young-
trees planted about their habitations, fo that when
you approached near them, nothing appeared but a
wood, very pleafing and delightful. Every thing
they did profpered and fiourifhed; their grapes plant-
ed in order, feemed as though managed in a vine-
yard, and were infinitely preterable to any of the o-
thers. Nor were they wanting to find out a place
of retreat, but dug a cave in the moft retired- part
of a thick wood, to fccure th*ir wives and children,
wkb
with their provifion, and chiefeft goods, furrounded
with innumerable flakes, and having a moil fubtile
entrance, in cafe any mifchief fhould happen, either
from their fellow countrymen, or the devouring fa-
vages.
As to the reprobates, (though I muft own they
were much more civilized than before), inftead of a
delightful wood furroimding their dwellings, we
found the words of King Solomon too truly verified;
I went by the vineyard of the ftothful, and it u-as all
overgrown with thorns. In many places their crop
was obfcured by weeds; the hedges having feveral
gaps in them, the wild goats had got in, and eaten
up the corn, and here and there was a dead bufh,
to flop in thofe gaps for the prefent, which was no
more than fhutting the ftable-door after the fteed
was ftolen away. But as to their wives, they (as I
obferved before) were more diligent, and cleanly e-
nough, efpecially in their victuals, being inftrucled'
by one of the honeft men, who had been a cook's
mate on board a fhip: and very well it was fo; for
as he cooked himfelf, his companion and their fa-
milies lived as well as the idle hufbands, who did
nothing but loiter about, fetch turtles eggs, catch
fifli end birds, and do any thing but work, and
lived accordingly; while the diligent lived very hand-
fomely and plentifully, in the moft comfortable man-
ner.
And now, Sir," I come to lay before your eyes, a
fcene q'.'ite different from any thing that ever happen-
ed to us before, and perhaps ever bcfel you in all the
time of your refidence on this ifland. I fhall inform,
you of its original in the following manner.
One morning, Sir, very early, there came five or
fix canoes of Indians on fhore, indifputably upon
their old cuftom of devouring their prifoners. All
that we had to do upon fuch an occafion, was to lie -
concealed, that they, not having any notice of in-
habitants, might depart quietly, after performing
their
their bloody execution: whoever firft difcovered
the favages, was to give notice to all the three
plantations to keep within doors, and then a proper
fcoiit was to be placed to give intelligence of their
departure. But, notwithftanding thefe wife mea-
fures, an unhappy difafler discovered us to the fa-
vages, which was like to have caufed the defolation
pf the whole ifland: for, after the favages were
gone off in their canoes, fome of my Spaniards and
I looking abroad, and being inflamed with a curio-
fity to fee what they had been doing, to our great
amazement, beheld three favages faft afleep on the
ground, who, either being gorged, could not awake
when the others went off, or having wandered too
far into the woods, did not come back in time.
What to do with them at firft, we could not tell;
as for flaves, we had enough of them atready; and as
to killing them, neither Chriftianity nor humanity
would fuffer us to fhed the blood of perfons who ne-
ver did us wrong. We perceived they had no boat
left them to tranfport them to their own nation; and
that, by letting them wander about, they might dif-
cover us, and inform the firft favnges that fhould
happen to land upon the fame bloody occafion,
which information might entirely ruin us; and there-
fore I counfelled my Spaniards to feeure them, and
let them about fome work or other, till we could
better difpofe of them.
Hereupon we all went back, nnd making them a-
wake, took them prifoners. It is impofifble to ex-
prefs the horror they were in, efpecially when bound,
as thinking they were going to be murdered and
eaten, but we foon eafed them of their fear as to that
point. We firft took them to the bower, where
the chief of our country-work lay, as keeping goaOv
planting corn, &c. and then carried them to the two
Englifhmens habitation, to help them in their bufi-
nefs: but happy it was for us all, we did not carry
them to our caftle, as by the fequel will appear.
The
The J.nglifhmen, indeed, found them work to do;
but whether they did not guard them ftrictly, or
that they thought they could not better themfelves, I
cannot tell ; but certainly one of them ran away into
the woods, and they could not hear of him for a long
time after.
Undoubtedly, there was reafon enough to fuppofe
he got home in fome of the canoes, the favages re-
turning in about four weeks time, and going off in
the fpace of two days. You mny be certain, Sir,
this thought could not but terrify us exceedingly,
and make us juftly.conclude, that this favage would
inform his countrymen of our abode in the ifland,
how few and weak we were in compaiifon to their
numbers; and we expe£led it would not. be long
before the Englifhmen would be attacked in their ha-
bitations: but the favages had not feen their places
of fafety in the woods, nor our caftle, which it was a
great happinefs they did not know.
Nor were we miftaken in our thoughts upon this
.occafion; for, about eight months after this, fix ca-
noes, with about ten men in each canoe, came fail-
ing by the north fide of the ifland, which they were
never accuftomed to do before, and landed about an
hour after fun-rife, near a mile from the dwelling of
the two Englifhmen, who, itfeems, had the good for-
tune to difcover them about a league off; ib that it
was an hour before they could attaiii the fliore, and
fome longer time before they could come at them.
And now, being confirmed in this opinion, that they
vere certainly betrayed, they immediately bound the
two flaves which were left, caufing two of the three
men, whom they brought with the women, and who
proved very faithful, to lead them with their wives,
and other conveniencies, into their retired cave in the
wood, and there to bind the two fellows hand and
foot, till they had further orders. They then open-
ed their fences, where they kept their milch goats,
and drove them all out, giving the goats liberty to
. . ramble
ramble in the woods, to make the favages believe
that they were wild ones; but the flave had given a
truer information, which made them come to the
very inclofures. The two frighted men fent the
other flave of the three, who had been with them by
accident, to alarm the Spaniards, and defire their af-
fiftance; in the mean time, they took their arms
and ammunition, and made to the cave where they
had fent their wives, and fecuring their flaves, feated
themfelves in a private place, from whence they
mig-ht behold all the actions of the favages. Nor
had they gone far, when afcending a riling ground,
they could fee a little army of Indians approach to
their beautiful dwelling, and, in a few moments
more, perceive the fame, and their furniture, to their
unfpeakable grief, burning in a confuming flame:
and when this was done, they fpread here and there,
fearching every bum and place for the people, of
•whom, it was very evident, they had information.
Upon which the two Englifhmen, not thinking them-
felves fecure where they flood, retreated about half
a mile higher in the country, rightly concluding,
that the farther the favages lliolled, there would be
jeffer numbers together: upon which they next took
their ftand by the trunk of an old tree, very hollow
and large, whence they refolved to fee what would
offer; but they had not ftoo,ci long there, before two
favages came running directly towards them, as
though having knowledge of their being there, who
feemed refolved to uttr.ck them; a little farther were
.three more, and five more behind them again, all
running the fane way. It cannot be imagined what
perplexity the poor men were in at this fight, think-
ing that if aififtance did not fpeedily come, their
•cave in the wood would be difcovered, and confe-
iquently all therein loft: io they refolved to refift
them there, and, when overpowered, to afcend to
the top of the trers, where they might defend them-
idvts as long as their ammunition Jailed, and fell
their
their lives as dear as poffible to thofe devouring fa-
vages. Thus fixed in their refoludon, they next
confidered, whether they fhould fire at the firft two,
or wait for the three, and fo take the middle party,
by which the two firft and the five laft would be fe-
parated. In this regulation the two favages alfo
confirmed them, by turning a little to another part
of the wood; but the three, and the five after them,
came directly towards the tree. Hereupon they re-
folved to take them in a direft line, as they approach-
ed nearer, becaufe perhaps the firft fhot might hit
them all three; and, upon this -occafion, the man
who was to fire, charged his piec« with three or four
bullets. And thus, while they were waiting, the fa-
vages came on, one of them was the runaway, who
had caufed all the mifchief; fo they refolved he
fhould not efcape, if they both fired at once. But
however, though they did not fire together, they were
ready charged; when the firft that let fly, was too
good a markfman to mifs his aim ; for he killed the
foremoft outright, the fecond (who was the runaway
Indian) fell on the ground, being fhot through the
body, but not dead, and the third was a little wound-
ed on the fhoulder, who, fitting down on the ground,
fell a fcreaming in a moft fearful manner. The noife
of the guns, which not only made the moft refound-
ing echoes, from one fide to another; but raifed
the birds of all forts, fluttering with the moft con-
fufed noife, fo much terrified the five favages behind,
* j/.ihat they flood ftill at firft, like fo many inanimate
Images. 'But when all things were in profound fi-
lence, they .came to the place wiere their companions
lay: and here, not being fenfible that they were
liable to the fame fate, Hood over the wounded
.man, undoubtedly enquiring the occafion of his fad
calamity; and, 'tis as reafonable to fuppofe, he told
them, that it came by thunder and lightening from
the gods, having never feen nor heard of a gun be-
fore, in the whole courfe of their Jives. By this
T time
> \
time the Englifhmeo, having loaded their pieces,
fired both together a fecond time, when feeing them
all fall immediately OH the ground, they thought
they had killed every creature of them. This made
them come up boldly before they had charged their
guns, which, indeed, was a wrong flep; for, when
they came to the place, they found four alive, two
of them very little wounded, and one not at all,
which obliged them to fall upon them with their
mufkets: they firft knocked the runaway favage
on the head, and another that was but a little wound-
ed in the arm, and then put the other languifhing
wretches out of their pain: while he that was not
hurt, with bending knees, and uplifted hands, made
jpitcous moans, and figns to them to fpare his life:
nor, indeed, were they unmerciful to the poor wretch,
but pointed to him to fit down at the root of a tree
hard by; and then, one of the Englifhmen, with a
piece of rope twine he had in his pocket by mere
chance, tying his two feet faf t together, and his two
hands behind him, they left him there, making all
the hafte they could after the other two, fearing they
fhould find out their cave; but though they could
not overtake them, they had the fatisfaction <o per-
ceive them, at a diftance, crofs a valley towards the
fea, ai quite contrary way to their retreat; upon
•which they returned to the tree, to look after their
prifonerj but when they came there, he was gone,
kaving the pieces of rope-yarn, wherewith he was
bound, behind him.
Well, now they were as much concerned as ever,
as not knowing how near their enemies might be, or
in what numbers. Immediately they repaired to their
cave, to fee if all was well there, and found every
thing fafe except the women, who were frighted
upon their hufbands account, whom now they loved
entirely. They had not been long here, before fevcn
of my Spaniards came to afllft them; while the other
ten, their femnts, and Friday's father, were gone to
defend
defend their bower, corn and cattle, in cafe the fa-
vages fhould have rambled fo far. There accom-
panied the feven Spaniards, one of the three favages
that had formerly been taken prifoner; and with
them alfo, that very Indian whom the Englifhmeni
had, a little before, left under the tree; for, it feems,
they patted by that way where the flaughter was
made, and fo carried along with them that poor
wretch that was left bound. But fo many prifoners
now becoming a burthen to us, and fearing the
dreadful confcquence of their efcaping, moft of the
Spaniards and Englilh urged the abfolute neceffity
there was of killing them for our common preferva-
tion: but, Sir, the authority I bore, as a governor,
over-ruled that pie.ce of cruelty; and then I ordered
them to be fent prifoners to the old cave in the valley,
bound hands and feet, with two Spaniards to guard
them.
So much -encouraged were the Englifhmen at the
approach of the Spaniards, and fo great was their fu-
ry againft the favages, for deftroying their habita-
tions, that they had not patience to flay any longer;
but, taking five Spaniards along with them, armed
•with four mufkets, a piftol, and a quarter-ftaff, away
they went in purfuit of their enemies. As they paf-
fed by the place where the favages were flain, it was
very cafy to be perceived that more of them had been
there, having attempted to carry off their dead bodies,
but found it impracticable. From a rifing ground,
our party had the mortification to fee the fmoke that
proceeded from the ruins; when coming farther in
fight of the fhore', they plainly perceived that the fa-
vages. had embarked in their canoes, and were putting,
out to fea. This they were very "forry for, there be-
ing no coming at them to give them a parting falutej
but, however, they were glad enough to get clear of
fuch unwelcome guefts.
Thus the two honeft, but unfortunate, Englifhmen,
ruined a fecond time, and'their improvements
T ^ quite
,.-^_.- ;' t_
quite destroyed, moft of my good-natured Spaniards
helped them to rebuild, and we all affifted them with
needful fupplies ; nay, what is more remarkable, their
three mifchievous countrymen, when they heard it,
(which was after all thefe difafters were over, they li-
ling remote eafhvard) very friendly fympathifed with
them, and worked for them feveral days: fo that, in
a little time, their habitation was rebuilt, their necef-
fities fupplied, and themfelves reflored to their former
tranquillity.
'1 hough the favages had nothing to boaft of in
this adventure, (feveral canoes being driven afhore,
followed by two drowned creatures, having un-
doubtedly met with a florm at fea that very night
they departed) yet it was natural to be fuppofed, that
thofe whofe better fortune it was to attain their na-
tive fliore, would inflame their nation to another
ruinous attempt, with a greater force, to carry all
before them. And, indeed, fo it happened; for, a-
fcout feven months after, our ifland was invaded with
a mofl formidable navy, no lefs than eight and twen-
ty canoes full of favages, .armed with wooden fwords,.
inonftrous clubs, bows and arrows, and fuch like
inftruments of war, landing at the eaft fide of the
ifland.
You may well, Sir, imagine, what confirmation
our men were in upon this account, and how fpeedy
they were to execute their refolution, having only
that night's time allowed them. They knew, that
fince they could not withftand their enemies, con-
cealment was the only way to procure their fafety:
and, therefore, they took down the huts that were
built for the two Englifhmen, and drove their flock of
goats, together with their own at the bower, to the
old cave in the valley, leaving as little appearance of
inhabitants as pofllble; and then pofted themfelves,
with all their force, at the plantation of the two men.
As they expected, fo it happened; for, early the next

could be g,uefiixl. Our array was but little indeed;
and what was our greater misfortune, we bad nor

men, .Sir, is as follows:

As to our flaves, we gave three of them halberts,
and the other three long (laves, with great iron
fpikes at the end of them, with hatchets by theit
fides: we alfo had hatchets flicking in our girdles,
befides the fire-arms: nay, two of the women, in- .
fpired with Amazonian fortitude, could not be dif-
fuaded from fighting along with their deareft buf-
bands, and if they died, to die with them. Seeing
their refolution, we g,ve them hatchets likewife; but
•what pleafed them belt, were the bows and arrows
(which they dexteroufiy knew how to ufe). that the
Indians had left behind them, after their memorable
battle one againft another.
Over this army, which, though little, was of great
intrepidity, I was conftituted chief general and com-
mander; and .knowing Will, dthins, though exceed-
ing wicked-, yet a man of invincible courage, I gave
him the power of commanding under me: he and
fix men, with their mufkets loaded, with fix or feven
bullets a-piece, were planted juft behind a fmall thick-
et of bufhes, as an advanced guard, having orders
to let the firft pafs by; and then, when he fired into
the middle of them, make a nimble retreat round
T 3 F-rt
part of the wood, and fo come in the rear of tns
Spaniards, who were fhaded by a thicket of trees:
for though the favages came on with the fiercenefs of
lions, yet they wanted the fubtiltyof foxes, being-
out of all manner of order, and fhaggling in heaps
every way: and, indeed, when Will. Atkins, after fifty
of the favages had pafled by, had ordered three of his
men to give fire, fo great was their confternation, to
fee fo many men killed.and wounded, and hear fuch
a dreadful noife, and yet not know whence it came,
that they were frightened to the higheft degree;
•and when the fecond volley was given, they con-
cluded no lefs but that their companions were flain
by thunder and lightening from heaven. In this no-
tion they would have continued, had Will. Atkins
and his men retired, as foon as they fired, according.
to order: or had the reft been near them, to pour
in their fhot continually, there might have been *
complete victory obtained; but flaying to load their
pieces again, difcovered the whole matter. They
were perceived by feme of the feathering favages at *
diftance, who let fly their arrows among them»
•wounded Atkins himfelf, and killed his fellow Eng-
lifhman, and one of the Indians taken with the wo-
men. OuF party did not fail to anfwer them, and in>
their retreat killed about twenty favages. Here I can-
not but take notice of our poor dying flave, who, tho°
ftopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with his
ftaff and hatchet defperately and gallantly afiailed the-
purfuers, and killed five of the favages, before his
life fubmitted to a multiplicity of wounds. Nor is-
the cruelty or malice of the Indians to be lefs re-
marked, in breaking the arms, legs, and heads of.
the two dead bodies with their clubs and wooden
fwords, after a moil wretched manner. As Atkins
retreated, our party advanced, to interpofe between-
him and the favages; but, after three volleys, we
vrere obliged to retreat alfo: for they were fo nume-
rous and defperate, that they came up to our very-
teeth.
teeth, fhot their arrows like a cloud, and their wound-
ed men, enraged with cruel pain, fought like mad-
men. They did not, however, think fit to follow
us, but drawing themfelves up in a circle, they gave
two triumphant fhouts in token of victory, though
they had the grief to fee feveral of their wounded
men bleed to death before them.
After I had, Sir, drawn up our little army toge-
ther upon a rifing ground, Atkins, wounded as he
•was, would have had us attack the whole body of the
favages at once. I was extremely well pleafed with
the gallantry of the man; but, upon confideration, I
replied, You perceiw, Seignior Atkins, how their
•wounded men fight; let them alone till morning, when
they -will be faint, Jliff, and fore, and then -we JbalL
have fewer to combat with. To which Will. Atkins,'
fmiling, replied, That's very true, Seignior, and Jo.
flail 1 too; and that's the renfon I fu on Id fight them-
now I am -warm. We all anfwered, Seignior Atkins,
for your part, you have behaved very gallantly; and,
if you are not able to approach the enemy in the morn-
ing, we will fight for you, till then we think it con^
venient to wait, and fo we tarried.
By the brightnefs of the moon, that night, we per-
eeived the favages in great diforder about their deadT
and wounded men. This made us change our refo-
kition, and refolve to fall upon them ia the night,
if we could give them one volley undifcovered. This
we had a fair opportunity to do, by one of the two
Englifhmen's leading us round,, between the woods
and the fea-fide weftward, and turning fhort fouth,
came privately to a place where the thickeft of them,
were. Unheard and unperceived, eight of us fired
among them, and did dreadful execution; and, ia
half a minute after, eight more of us let fly, killing
and wounding abundance of them; and then divi-
ding ourfelves into three bodies* eight perfons in each
body, we marched from among the trees to the very
teeth, of the enemy, fending forth the greateft fhouts'
and
an<l acclamations. The favages hearing a different
noitc: from three quarters at once, flood in the ut-
rnoft confufion; but coming in fight of us, let fly a
volley of arrows, which wounded poor old Friday,
yet happily it diJ not prove mortal. We did not,:
.however, give them a iecond opportunity; but rufliing.
in among them, we fired three feveral ways, and then,
fell to work with our fwords, fhves, hatchets, and'
the butt end of our mufkets, with, a fury not to be
refifted; fo that, with the moil difrnal fcreanung and
howling; they had reeourfe to their feet, to fave their
lives by a fpeecly flight. Normufl we forget the va-
lour of the two women; for they expofcd themfelves-
U> the greatefl dangers, killed many with their arrows,-
and valiantly deftroyed feveral more with their hat-
chets.
In fig-hting thefe two' battles, we were fo much,
tired, that we did not then trouble ourfeives to pur-
fue them to their canoes, in which we thought they
•would prefcntly put to the ocean; but there happen-
ing a dreadful flormat fea, which continuing, all that
night, it not only prevented their voyage, but daflied.
feveral of their boats to pieces againft the beach,
and drove the reft fo high upon the more, that it
required infinite pains to get them off. After our
men had taken fome refrefhment and a little repofe,
they refolwed early in the morning to go towards the
place of their landing, and fee whether they were
gone off-, or in what pofture they remained. This
neceffarily led them to the place of battle, where
feveral of the favages were expiring, a fight no way
pleafing to generous minds, to delight in their mifery,
though obliged to conquer them by the law of arms:
but our own Indian flaves put them out of their pain,
by difpatching them with their hatchets. At length,
coming in view of the remainder of their army, we
found them leaning upon their knees, which were
bended towards their mouth, and the head between
the two hands. Henntpon, coming within mufket-
ihot
fhot of them, I ordered two pieces to be fired with-
out ball, in order to alarm them, that we might
plainly know, whether they had the courage to ven-
ture another battle, or were utterly difpirited from
fuch an attempt, that fo we might accordingly ma-
nage them. And, indeed, the project took very well;
for, no fooner did the favages hear the firft gun, and
perceive the flam of the fecond, but they fuddenly
ftarted upon their feet, in the greater! confternation;
and when ws approached towards them, they ran
yowling and fcreaming away up the hill into the coun-
try.
We could rather, at firft, have wifhed, that the
weather had permitted them to have gone off to the
fea; but when we confidered, that their efcape might
occafion the approach of multitudes, to our utter ruin
and diflblution, we were vqry well pleafed the contra-
ry happened: and Will. Atkins (who, though wound-
ed, would not part from us all this while) advifed us
net to let flip this advantage, but clapping between
them and their boats, deprive them of the capacity of
e.ver returning to plague the ifland: / kno-w, (faid he)
there is but one objeElian you can make, -which is, that
thefe creatures, living like beafts in the -wood, may
make excurftons, rifle the plantationst and dejtroy the
tame goats: but then canfider, -we had better to do
'iuith an hundredmen, whom vie can kill, or make Jlaves
ff, at leifure, than with an hundred nations, whom
it is impojjible -wejhouldfave our/elves from, much lefs
fubdue. This advice, and thefe arguments being ap-
proved of, we fet fire to their boats; and though they
were fo wet that they would not burn entirely, yet
we made them incapable for fwimming in the feas.
As foon as the Indians perceived what we were doing,
many of them ran out of the woods, in fight of us,
and, kneeling down piteoufly, cried out, Oa, Oa, IVa-
ramakoa, intimating, I fuppofe, that, if we would
but fpare their canoes, they would never trouble us
. ''...-..
But
Btit all their complaints, fubmiflions, and entrea-
ties, were in Vain: for felf-prefervation obliging us
to the contrary, we deftroyed every one of them that
had efcaped the fury of the ocean. When the In-
dians perceived this, they raifed a lamentable cry,
and ran into the woods, where they continued ran-
ging aboat, making the woods ring with their la-
mentation. Here we fhould have confidered, that
making thefe creatures thus defperate, we ought, at
the fame tifne, to have fet a fufficient guard upon
the plantations: for the favages, in their ranging
about, found out the bower, deftroyed the fences,,
trod the corn down under their feet, and tore up
the vines and grapes. It is true, we were always able
to fight thefe creatures; but, as they were too fwift
for us, and very numerous, we durft not go out fingle,
for fear of them ; though that too was needlcfs, they
having na weapons, nor any materials to make them;
and, indeed, their extremity appeared in a little time
after.
Though the favages, as already mentioned, had
deftroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &£•
yet we had ftill left OUT ftock of cattle in the valley
by the cave, with fome little corn that grew there,
and the plantation of Will. Atkins nnd his com-
panions, one of whom being killed by an arrow,
they were now reduced to two: it is remarkable,
that this was the fellow who cut thepoor Indian with
his hatchet, and had a defign to murder me and my
countrymen the Spaniards. As our condition was
fo low, we came to the refolution to drive the f:wa-
ges up to the farther part of the ifknd, where no In-
dians landed: to kill as many of them as we could,
till we had reduced their number; and then to give
the remainder fome corn to plant, and to teach them
how to live by their daily labour. Accordingly, we
purfued them with OINF guns, at the hearing cf
•which, they were fo terrified, that they would fall
to thje ground. Every day we killed, and wound-
ed
ed forne of them, and many we found ftarved to
death, fo that our hearts began to relent at the fight
offuch roiferable objects. At laft, with great diffi-
culty, taking one of them alive, and uling him with
kindnefs and tendernefs, we brought him to Old
Friday, who talked to him, and told him, how
good we would be to them, all, giving them corn
and land to plant and live in, and prefent nourish-
ment, provided they would keep within fuch bounds
as fhould be slotted them, and not do prejudice to
others: Co thent faid he, and in/arm yaur countrymen
cfthis; -which, if they will not agree ty} every one of
themfball bejlain.
The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being
reduced to about tHirty-feven, joyfully accepted thti
offer, and earneftly begged for food-, hereupon we
fent twelve Spaniards and two Englifhmen, well arm-
ed, together with Old Friday, and three Indian flaves
who marched to the place where they were. The
flaves were loaded with a large quantity of bread,
and rice cakes, with three live goats: and the poor
Indians being ordered to fit down on the fide of the
hill, they ate die victuals very thankfully, and have
proved faithful to the laft, never trefpaffing beyond
their bounds, where, at this day, they quietly and
happily remain, and where we now and then vifit
them. They are confined to a neck of land about
a mile and a half broad, and three or four in length,
on the fouth-eaft corner of the ifland, the fea being
before, anrl lofty mountains behind them, free froru
the appearance of canoes; and indeed their country-
men have never made any enquiry after them. We
gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives;
have taught them to build huts, make wooden fpades,
piant corn, make bread, breed tame goats, and
milk them, as likewife to make wicker-work, in
which, I mull ingenuoufly confefs, they infinite-
ly outdo us, having made themfelves feveral pretty
neceflaries and fancies, as baikets, fieves, bird ca-
ges,
,
ges, and cupboards, as alfo ftools, beds, and couch-
es, no lefs ufeful than delightful; and now they live
the moft innocent and inoffenfive creatures that ever
were fubdued in the world, wanting nothing but
•wives to make them a nation.
Thus, kind Sir. have I given you, according to
my ability, an impartial account of the various tranf-
actions that have happened in the ifland fince your
departure, to this day: and we have great reafon to
acknowledge the kind providence of heaven in our
merciful deliverance. When you infpect your little
kingdom, you will find in it fome little improvement,
your flocks increafed, and your fubjecls augmented:
fo that from a defolate ifland, as this was before your
wonderful deliverance upon it, here is a vifible pro-
fpect of its becoming a populous and well governed
little kingdom, to your immortal fame and glory.
The end of the Spantfb governor's relation.
The continuation of the life ef Robinfon Crufoe, both
of thofe paffages that happened during the time of
his continuance on the i/land, and after his depar-
ture, till he arrived again in his native country.
THERE is no doubt to fuppofe, but that the pre-
cedent relation of my ^faithful Spaniard was
very agreeable, and no lefs furprifing to me, to the
young prieft, and to all who heard it: nor were thefe
people lefs pleafed with thofe neceflary utenfils that
I brought them, fuch as the knives, fciflars, fpadesj
fhovels, and pick-axes, with which t'hey now adorn
their habitations. So much had they addicted them-
felves to wicker-work, prompted by the ingenuity of
the Indians, who affifted them, that when I viewed
the Englifhmen's colonies, they feemed at a diftance
as though they had lived like bees in a hive: for

Will.
Will. Atkins, who was now become a very indu-
ftrious and fober man, had made himfelf a tent of
baftet-vvork round the outfide; the walls were work-
ed in as a bafket, in pannels or ftrong fquares of
thirty two in number, flanding about feven feet
high,: in the middle was another, not above twen-
ty- two paces round, but much ftronger built, being
of an oclogonal form, and in the eight corners flood
eight ftrong pofts, round the top of which he laid
ftrong pieces, pinned \vith wooden pins, from which
lie raifed a pyramid for the. roof, mighty pretty, I
affure you, .and joined very well together with iron
fpikes, which he made himfelf; for he had made
him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows and
-charcoal for his work, forming an anvil out of one
of the iron crows, to work upon, and in this manner
would he make himfelf hooks, ftaples, fpikes, bolts,
and hinges. Alter he had pitched the roof of his
innermoft tent, he made it fo firm between the raf-
ters with bafket-work, thatching that over again with
rice ltraw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, that
his houfe was as dry as if it had been tiled or flated.
The outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to quite round
this inner apartment, laying long rafters from the
thirty-two angles, to the top-pofts of the inner houfe,
about twenty feet diftant: fo that there was a fpace
like a walk betwixt the outer and inner wall, near
twenty feet in breadth. The inner place he partiti-
oned off with the fame wicker-work, dividing it into
fix neat apartments, every one of which had a door,
firft into trfe entry of the main tent, and another into
the fpace and walk that was round it, not only con-
venient for retreat, but for family neceffaries. Within
the door of the outer circle, there was a paflage di-
rectly to the door of the inner houfe; on either fide
was a wicker-partition, and a door, by which you go
firfl into a large room twenty-two feet wide, and about
thirty long, and through that into another of a fmaJler
length, fo that in the outward circle were ten hand-
U fome
fome rooms, fix of which were only to be come at
through the apartments of the inner tent, ferving as
retiring rooms to the refpetftive chambers of the inner
circle, and four large warehoufes, which went in
through one another, ttvoon either hand of thepaflage
that led through the outward door to the inner tent.
In fhort, nothing could be built more ingenioufly, kept
more neat, or have better conveniences; and here
lived the three families, Will. Atkins, his compa-
nion, their wives and children, and the widow of the
deceafed. As to religion, the men feldom taught
their wives the knowledge of God, any more than
the failors cuftom of fwearing by his name. The
greateft improvement theif wives had, was, they
taught them to fpeak Englifh, fo as to be underftood.
None of their children were then above fix years
old; they were all fruitful enough ; and, I think, the
cook's mate's wife was big of her fixth child.
When I enquired of the Spaniards about their cir-
.cumftances while among the favages, they told me,
that they abandoned themfelves to defpair, reckoning
themfelves a poor and miferable people, that had no
means put into their hands> and confequently muft
foon be ftarved to death. They owned, however,
that they were in the wrong to think fo, and for re-
fufing the affiftance that feafon offered for their fup-
port, as well as future deliverance, confeffing that
grief was a moft infignificant paffion, as it looked
upon things as without remedy, and having no hope
of good things to come; all which verified this noted
proverb,
In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.
Nor did his remarks end here: for, making obfer-
vations upon my improvements, and on my condi-
tion at firft, infinitely worfe than theirs, he told me,
that Englimmen had, in their diftrefs, greater prefence
of
of mind than thofe of any other country that he had
met with; and that they and the Portuguefe were
the worft men in the world to ftruggie under mif-
fortunes. When they landed among the favages,
they found but little provifion, except they would
turn cannibals, there being but a few roots and herbs,
with little fubftance in them, and of which the na-
tives gave them but very fparingly. Many were
the ways they took to civilize and teach the favages, -
but in vain: for they would not own them to be
their inftruclors, whofe lives were owing to their
bounty. Their extremities were very great, many
days being entirely without food, the favages there
being more indolent and lefs devouring than thofe
who had better fupplies. When they went out to
battle, they were obliged to afllft thefc people, in
one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had;
like to have been devoured. They had loft their am-
munition, which rendered their fire-arms ufelefsj
nor could they ufe the bows and arrows that were
given them, fo that while the armies were af a di-
ftance, they had no chance, but when clofe, then
they could be of fervice with halberts and fliarpenecj
flicks, put into the muzzles of their mufkets. They
made themfelves targets of wood, covered with the
fkins of wild heafts; and when one happened to be,
knocked down, the reft of the company fought over
him till he recovered: and then ftanding clofe in a
line, they would make their way through a thoufand
favages. At the return of their friend, who they
thought had been entombed in the bowels of their
enemies, their joy was inconceivable. Nor were they
lefs furprifed at the fight of the loaves of bread I had
fent them, things that they had not feen for feveral
years, at the fame time erofling and blefiing it, as
though it was manna fent from heaven: but when
they knew the errand, and perceived the boat which
was to carry them to the perfon and place from
whence fuch relief came, this (Iruck them with fuch
U 2 a
a furprife of joy as made fome of them faint away,
and others burft out Into tears.
This was the fummary account that I had from
them. I fhall now inform the reader what I next
did for them, and in what condition I left them. As
•we were all of opinion that the favages would fcarce
trouble them any more, fo we had no apprehenfions
on that fcore. I told them I was come purely to e •
ftablifh, and not to remove them; and, upon that
occafion, had not only brought them neceflaries for
convenience and defence, but alfo artificers, and o-
ther perfons, both for their 'neceflary employments,
and to add to their number. They were all to-
gether when I thus talked to them; and before I
delivered to them the ftores I had brought, I afked
them one by one, if they had entirely .forgot their
firft ahimofities, would engage in the ftri&eft friend-
fhip, and fhake hands with one another? On this
Will. Atkins, with abundance of good humour,
faid, they had afflictions enough to make them
all fober, and enemies enough to make them all friends:
as for himfelf, he would live and die among them,
owning, that what the Spaniards had done to him,
his own mad humour had made neceflary for them
to do. Nor had the Spaniards occafion to juflify
their proceedings to me; but they told me, that, fince
Will. Atkins had behaved himfelf fo valiantly in
fight, and at other times fhewed fuch a regard to
the common, intereft of them all, they had not only
forgotten all that was paft, but thought he ought as
much to be trufted with arms and neceflaries as any
of them, which they teftified by making him next
in command to the governor: and they moft hear-
tily embraced the occafion of giving me this folemn
affurance, that they would never feparate their intereft
again a,s long as they lived.
After thefe kind declarations of friendfhip, we ap-
pointed all of us to dine together the next day; upon
this I caufed the fhip's cook and his mate come on
fhore
fhore for that purpofe, to affift in dreffing our din-
ner. We brought from the fhip fix pieces of beef,
and four of pork, together v:ith our punch-bowl,
and materials to fill it; and, in particular, I gave them
ten bottles of French claret, and ten of Englifh beer,
which was very acceptable to them. The Spaniards
added to our feaft five whole kids, which being roaft-
ed, three of them were fent as frefn meat to the'
failors on board, and the other two we ate ourfelves.
After our merry and innocent feaft was over, I be-
gan to diftribute my cargoe among them. Firft, I
fave them linen fufficient to make every one of them
Dur fjiirts, and at the Spaniard? requeft made them,
up fix. The thin tnglifh fluffs I allotted to.make
every one a light coat like a frock, agreeable to the
climate, and left .them fnch a quantity, as to make
more upon their decay; as alfo pumps, fhoes, hats,
and flockings. It is not to be exprefled, the pleafing
fatisfaction which fat upon the countenances of
thefe poor men, when they perceived what care I
took of them, as if I had been a common father
to them all; and they all engaged never to leave
the ifland, till I gave my confent for their depar-
ture. I then prefented to them the people I brought,
to wit, the tailor, fmith, and the two carpenters;
but my Jack of all trades was the moft acceptable
prefent 1 could make them. My tailor fell imme-
diately to work, and made every one of them a
fhirt; after which, he learned the women how to
few and flitch, thereby to become the more helpful
to their hufbands. Neither were the carpenters
lefs ufeful, taking in pieces their clumfy things,
inflead of which, they made convenient and hand-
fome tables, ftools, bedftcads, cupboards, lockers
and fhelves. But when I carried them to fee "Will.
Atkins's bafket-houfe, they owned they neeer faw
fuch a piece of natural ingenuity before: / am
Juret faid one of the carpenters, the man that built
U 3 this
this hat no need cf us; you need, Sir, do nothing but
give hifn tools.
I divided the tools among them in this manner:
to every man I gave a digging-fpade, a fhovel and a
rake, as having no harrows or ploughs; and to eve-
ry feparate place a pick axe, a crow, a broad axe,
and a faw, with a ftore for a general fupply, fhould
any be broken or worn out- I left them alfo nails,
flaples, hinges, hammers, chiffels, knives, fciflars,
and all forts of tools and iron work; and, for the ufe
of the fmith, gave them three tons of unwrought
iron for a fupply: and as to arms and ammunition,
I ftored them even to profufion; or, at leaft, to equip-
a fufficient little army againft all oppofers whatfoever.
The young man (whofe mother was unfortunately
flarved to death), together with the maid, a pious
and well educated young woman, feeing things fa
well ordered on fhore (for I made them accompany-
me), and eonfidering they had no occafion to go fo
far a voyage as to the Eaft-Indies, they both defired
of me, that I would leave them there, and enter
them among my fubjecls. This I readily agreed tor
ordering them a plat of ground, on which were three
little houfes ere£ted, environed with bafket-worfc,
pallifadoed like Atkins's, and adjoining to his planta-
tion. So contrived were their tents, thai each c£
them had a room apart to lodge in, while the mid-
dle tent was not only their ftore-houfe, but their place
for eating and drinking. At this time the two
Englifhmen removed their habitation to their former
place; fo that now the ifland was divided into three
colonies;firft, T,hofe I have juft now mentioned;
fecvndly, That of Will. Atkins, where there were four
families of Englifhmen, with their wives and childien,
the widow and her children: the young man, and
the maid, who, by the way, we made a wife of be-
fore °ur departure; three favages, who were flaVes j
the tail°r> fralth, (who ferved alfo as a gunfmith),
and
ind my otbet celebrated perfon called Jack of all
trades. Thirdly, My chief colony, which confifted
of the Spaniards, with Old Friday, who ftill remained
at my old habitation, which was my capital city:
and furely never was there fuch a metropolis, it now
being hid in fo obfcure a grove, that a thoufand
men might have ranged the ifland a month, and
looked purpofely for it, without being able to find
it, though the Spaniards had enlarged its boundaries^
both without and within, in a moft furprifing man-
ner.
But now I think it high time to fpeak of the
young French prieft of the order of St BenediEI,
whofe judicious and pious difcourfes, upon fundry
occafions, merit an extraordinary obfervation; not
can his being a French Papift prieft, I prefume, give
offence to any of my readers, when they have this-
affurance from me, that he was a perfon of the moft
courteous difpofition, extenfive charity, and exalted
piety. His arguments were always agreeable to
reafon, and his converfation the moft acceptable
of any perfon that I had ever yet met with in my
life.
Sir, faid he to me one fay,Jince, under Cod (at the
fame time erofling his breaft) you have not only faved
my life; but, by permitting me to go this voyage, have
granted me the happinefs of free converfation, 1-think
it my duty, as my profeffion obliges me, to. fave what
fouls 1 can, by bringing them to the knowledge of fome
Catholic dsftrine, neceffary tofalvation; and,fence theft
•people are under your immediate government, in gra-
titude, ju/lice, and decency for -what you have done for
tne, IJballoffer no farther points in religion, than -what
fball merit your approbation. Being pleafed with the
modefty of his carriage, I told him he fhould not be
the worfe ufed for being of a different perfuafion, if,
upon that very account, we did not differ in points
of faith, not accent in a part of the country, where
the poor Indians ought to be inftru&ed in the know-
ledge
ledge of the true God, and his fon Jefus Chrift. To
this he replied, that converfation might eafily be fepa-
rated from difputes; that he would difcourfe with me
rather as a gentleman than a religious ; but that,,
if we did enter upon religious arguments, upon my
defiring the fame, I would give him liberty to de-
fend his own principles. He farther added, that he
would do all that became him in Jiis office, as a
prieft as well as a Chriftian, to procure the happi-
nefs of all that was in the fhip: that though he
could not pray with, he would pray for us, on all
occafions; and then he told me feveral extraordi-
nary events of his life, within a few years paft; but
particularly in this laft, which was the moft re-
markable: that, in this voyage, he had the misfor-
tune to be five times fhipped and unfhipped: his firft
defign was to have gone to Martinico; for which, ta-
king fhip at St Malo, he was forced into Lifbon by
bad weather, the veffel running aground in the mouth
of the Tagus: that from thence he went on board
a Portuguefe fhip, bound to the Madeiras, whofe ma-
fter being but an indifferent mariner, and out of his
reckoning, they were drove to Fial, where felling
their commodity, which was corn, they refolved to
take in their loading at the Me of May, and to fail'
to Newfoundland; at the banks of which, meeting a
French fhip bound to Quebec, in the river of Canada*
and from thence to Martinico, in this fhip he em-
barked; the mafter of which dying at Quebec, that
voyage was fufpended: and laftly, fhipping himfelf
for France, this laft fhip was deftroyed by fire, as be-
fore has been related.
At this time we talked no further; but another
morning he comes to me, juft as I was going to vifit
the Englifhmens colony, and tells me, that, as he
knew the profperity of the ifland was my principal
defire, he had fomething to communicate agreeable
to my defign, by which perhaps he might put it,
•more than he yet thought it was, in the way of the
-benedi&ion.

benediction of heaven. How, Sir? faid I, in a fur-
prife, are we not yet in the way of God's bleffing, af-
ter all thefe fignal providences and deliverances, of
•which you" have had fuch an ample relation? He re-
plied, I hope, Sir, you are in the way, and that your
good defign will profper: but ftill there are fome a-
mong you that are not equally right in their actions:
and remember, I befeech you, Sir, that j4chant by
his crime, removed God's bleffing from the camp of
the children of Ifrael; that though fix and thirty were
entirely innocent, yet they became the objects of di-
vine vengeance, and bore the weight of the punifh-
ment accordingly.
So fenfibly w?s I touched with this difcourfe, and,
fo fatisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his
foul, that I defired him to accompany me to the
Englifhmens plantations, which he was very glad of,
by reafon they were the fubjects of what he de-
figned to difcourfe with me about; and while we
•walked on together, he began in the following man-
ner:
Sir, faid he, I muft confefs it is a great unhappi-
nefs that we dilagree in feveral docUinal articles of
religion; but, furely both of us acknowledge this,
that there is a God, who having given us fome
ftated rules for our fervice and obedience, we ought
not willingly and knowingly to offend him, either
by negle£ling what he has commanded, or by doing
what he has forbidden. This truth every Chriftian
owns, that whenever any one prefumptuoufly fins
againft God's command, the Almighty then with-
draws his bleffing from him; every good man there-
fore ought certainly to prevent fuch neglect of, or
fin againft God and his commands. I thanked the
young prieft for expreffing fo great a concern for us,
and defired him to explain the particulars of what he
had obferved, that, according to the parable of
j4chan, I might remove the accurfed thing from
among us. Why then, Sir, faid he, in the firft
place,
place, you have four Englifhmen, who have taken
favage women to their wives, by whom they have
feveral children, though none of them are legally
married, as the law of God and man requires; they»
I fay, Sir, are no lefs than adulterers, and as they
ftill live in adultery, are liable to the curfe of God.
I know, Sir, you may object the want of a prieft, or
clergyman of any kind; as alfo, pen, ink, and
paper, to write down a contra£t of marriage, and
have it figned between them. Hut neither this, nor
what the Spanifh governor has told you of their
chufing by confent, can be reckoned a marriage,
nor any more than an agreement to keep them from
quarrelling among themfelves; for, Sir, the eflence
or facrament of matrimony (fo he called it) not only
Confifts in mutual confent, but in the legal obliga-
tion, which compels them to own and acknowledge
one another, to abftain from other perfons, the men
to provide for their wives and children, and the wo-
men to the fame and like conditions, mutatis mutandis,
on their fide: whereas, Sir, thefe men, upon their
own pleafure, on any occafion, may forfake thofe
women, and marry others, and by difowning their
children, fuffer them utterly to perifh. Now, Sir,
added he, can God be honoured in fuch an unlawful li-
berty as this? how can a bleffing fucceed the beft endea-
vours, if men are allowed to live in fo licentious a way?
I was indeed ftruck with the thing myfelf, and
thought that they were much to blame, that no for-
mal contract had been made, though it had been
but breaking a flick between them, to engage them
to live as man and wife, never to feparate, but love,
cherifh, and comfort one another all their lives;
yet, Sir, fekl I, when they took thefe women, I
was not here; and if it is adultery, it is paft my re-
medy, and I cannot help it. True, Sir, anfwered
the young prieft, you cannot be charged -with that part
of the crime •which -was done in your abjence; but I be-
feech you, dan't flatter your/elf, that you are under no
obligation
obligation now to put a period to it; 'which if you ne-
gleft to do, the guilt 'will be entirely on you alone,Jince
it is certainly in nobody's power but yours, to alter
their condition. I muft confefs, I was fo dull, that I
thought he meant I fhould part them, and knowing
that this would put the whole ifland in confufion, I
told him I could not confent to it upon any account
•whatfoever. Sir, faid he, in a great furprife, / da
•not mean that you Jbould feparate, but marry them, by
a. written contrail, figned by both man and woman,
v and by all the -witneJJ'es prefent, which all the European
laws decree to be offufficicnt efficacy. Amazed with
fuch true piety and fincerity, and confidering the va-
lidity of a written contract, I acknowledged all that
he faid to be very juft and kind; and that I would
difcourfe with the men about it; neither could I fee
what reafon they could have not to let hint marry
them, whofe authority in that affair is owned to be as
authentic as if they were married by any of our cler-
gymen in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me was
this, that though thefe Englifh fubje&s of mine had
lived with thefe women feven years, and though
they were of good underftanding, and capable of in-
ftruction, having learned not only to fpeak, but to
read Englifh, yet all this while they had never
taught them any thing of the Chriftian religion, or
the knowledge of God, much lefs in what manner
he ought to be ferved. And is not this an unaccount-
able ueglecl? faid he warmly. Depend upon if, Gad
Almighty -will call them to account for fuch contempt.
And tho' I am not of your religion, yet I Jbould be glad
to fee thefe people releaft-d from the devil's power, and
'befaved by the principles of the Chriftian religion, the
knowledge of God, of a Redeemer, the refurreclion, and
of a future pate. But, as it is not too late, ifyou pleafe
to give me leave to inJiruEl them, I doubt not but I
Jljallfupply this great defeft, by bringing them into the
great
great circle of Chrijiianity, even -while you continue in
the ijland,
I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told
him, with a thoufand thanks, I would grant whatever
he requefted, and defired him to proceed in the third
article, which he did in the following manner:
Sir, faid he, it fhould be a maxim among all Chri-
ftians, That Chriftian knowledge ou%ht to be propoga-
ted by all poj/ible meansi and on all occajions. Upon
this account our church fends mifiionaries into Perfia,
India, and China, men who are willing to die for the
fake of God and the Chriftian faith, in order to bring
poor Infidels into the way of lalvation. Now, Sir, as
here is an opportunity to convert feven and thirty-
poor favages, I wonder how you can pafs by fuch an
occafion of doing good, which is really worth the ex-
pence of a man's whole life. • ,
I muft confefs I was fo confounded at this difcourfe,
that I could not tell how to anfwer him. Sir, faid
he, feeing me in diforder, / frail be very forry if I
have given you offence. No, Sir, faid I, I am rather
confounded; and you know my circumftanccs, that,
being bound to the Eaft Indies in a merchant fhip, I
cannot wrong the owners fo much, as to detain the
fhip here, the men lying at vitluals and wages on
their account. If I ftay above twelve days, I muft
pay 3 /. Sterling per diem demurrage, nor muft the
(hip ftay above eight days more -r fo that I am unable
to engage in this work, unlefs I would leave the
(hip, and be reduced to my former condition- The
prieft, though he owned this was hard upon me, yet
laid it to my conference, whether the blerifng of
faving feven and thirty fouls was not worth venturing
all that I had in the world? Sir, faid I, it is very
true: but as you are an ecclefiaftic, it naturally falls
into your profeffion : why, therefore, don't you rather
offer to undertake it yourfelf, than prefs me to it?
Upon this he turned about, making a very low bow,
I moft humbly thank God and you, Sir, faid he, for
fo blefled a call; and maft willingly undertake fo glo-
rious an office, which will fufficiently compenfate all
the hazards and difficulties I have gone through in a
long and uncomfortable voyage.
While he was thus fpeaking, I could difcover a
rapture in his face, by his colour going and coming;
at the fame time his eyes fparkled like fire, with all
the figns of the moft zealous tranfports. And when
I afked whether he was in earnefl:? Sir, faid he, it
was to preach to the Indians, 1 confented to come a-
long with you; thefe infidels, even in this little
ifland, are infinitely of more worth than my -poor
life: if fo that I fhould prove the happy inftrument
of faving thefe poor creatures fouls, I care not if I
never fee my native country again. One thing I
only beg of yon more, is, that you would leave
Friday with me, to be my interpreter, without
whofe affiftance neither of us will underftand each
other.
This requeft very fenfibly troubled me; firft, upon
Friday's being bred a Proteftant; and, fecondly, for
the affection I bore to him for his fidelity: But, im-
mediately the remembrance of Friday's father coming
into my head, I recommended him to him as having
learned Spanifh, which the prieft alfo underftood:
and fo was thoroughly fatisfied with him.
When we came to the Englifhmen, after I had told
them what neceflary things I had done for them, I
talked to them of the fcandalous life they led, told
them what notice the clergyman had taken of it, and
afked them if they were married men or bachelors?
They anfwered, two of them were widowers, and
the other three fingle men. But, faid I, \yith what
confcience can you call thefe your wives, by whom
you have fo many children, and yet are not lawfully
married? They all faid, that they took them before
the governor as fuch, having nobody elfe to marry
them, which they thought as legal, as if they had
X" 'had
had a parfon. No doubt, faid I, but in the eye of
God you are fo: but unlefs I am aflured of your ho-
neft intent, never to defert thefe poor creatures, I
can do nothing more for you, neither can you ex-
pect God's bleffing while you live in fuch an open
courfe of adutrery. Hereupon, Will. Atkins, who
fpoke for the reft, told me, That they believed their
wives the moft innocent and virtuous creatures in the
•world : that they would never forfake them while they
Tiad breath; and that, if there was a clergyman in the
fhip, they would be married to them with all their
heart. 1 told you before, faid I, that I have a mini-
fter with me, who fhall marry you to-morrow morn-
ing, if you are willing; fo I would have you confult
to-night, with the reft, about it. I told him the
clergyman was a Frenchman, and knew not a word
of Englifh, but that I would act as a clerk between
them. And indeed this bufinefs met with fuch fpee-
dy fuccefs, that they all told me, in a few minutes
after, that they were ready to be formally married, as
foon as I pleafed ; with which informing the prieft, he
was exceedingly rejoiced.
Nothing now remained, but that the women
fhould be made fenfible of the meaning of the thing;
with which being well fatisfied, they, with their huf-
bands, attended at my apartment the next morning:
there was my prieft, habited in a black veft, fome-
thing like a caflbck, with a fafh round it, much re-
fembling a minifterx and I was his interpreter. But
the ferioufnefs of his behaviour, and the fcruples he
made of marrying the women, who were not bap-
tized, gave them an exceeding reverence for his per-
fon; nor indeed would he marry them at all, till he
obtained my liberty to difcourfe both with the men
and women, and then he told them, That, in the
fight of all indifferent men, and in the fenfe of the
laws of fociety, they had lived in open adultery,
which nothing now, but their confent to marry, or
final feparation, could put an end to; and even here
was
was a difficulty with refpect to the laws of Chriftian
matrimony, in marrying a profefled Chriftian to a
heathen idolater, unbaptized; but yet there was
time enough to make them profefs the name of
Gnnft, without which nothing could be done: that,
befides, he believed themfelves very indifferent Chri-
IHans: and confequently had not difcourfed with
their wives upon that fubject; and that unlefs they
nromifed him to do fo, he could not marry them, as
being exprefsly forbidden by the laws of God.
All this they heard attentively, and owned readily;
But, Lord, Sir! faid Will. Atkins tome, how Jijould
•we teach them religion, who know nothing of it our-
felves' How can -we talk to our -wives of God, Jefus
Chrift, heaven and hell? why they would only laugh
at us, who never yet have praRifed religion, but on the
contrary, all manner of-wickednefs. Will. Atkins, faid
I, cannot you tell your wife fbe is in the wrong,
and that her gods are idols, which can neither hear,
fpeak, nor urderftand; but that our God, who h?s
made, can deftroy all things; that he rewards the
good, and punifnes the wicked; and at laft will
bring us to judgment? cannot you tell her thefe
things ? That's true, faid Atkins, but then fhe'll tell
me, it is utterly falfe, fince 1 am not punifhed and
fcnt to the devil, who hath been fuch a wicked crea-
ture. Thefe words I interpreted to the priefl! O!
faid he, tell him, his repentance will make him a
very good minifter to his fpoufe, and qualify him to
preach on the mercy and long-fuffering of a merciful
Being, who defires not the death of a finner, and
even defers damnation to the .'aft judgment; this
will lead him to the doctrine of, and will make
him an excellent preacher to his wife. I repeated
this to Atkins, who, being more than ordinary af-
fecled with it, replied, 1 know all this, Sir, and a
great deal more ; but how can I have the impudence
to talk thus to my wife, when my confcience wit-
nefies againft me? ALAS! faid he, (with tears in
X 2 his
Tiis eyes, and giving a great figh), as for repenting,
that is for ever paft me. Pail you! Atkins, faid I,
•what do you mean? You know well enough, faid he,
what I mean; / mean it is ten late.
When 1 told the prieft what he faid, the poor af-
fcctionate man could not refrain from weeping; but
recovering himfelf, Pray, Sir, faid he, ajk him if he
is contented that it is tea late; or is be concerned, and
-wi/hes it-were not fo? This queftion I put fairly to
Atkins, who replied in a paffion, How can I le ea-
fy in ajlate which I kr.o-w mitji terminate in my rum?
fir 1 really believe, feme time or other, Ijhall cut my
throat, to put a period both to my life and to the terrors
cf my conjcience.
•At this the clergyman fhook his head. Sir, faid
he, pray tell him it is net too late; Cirift -w'ill give
him repentance, if he has recourfe to the merit of his
fafficn. Does he think he is beyond the ptnver of di-
• vine mercy? there may indeed be a time -when provoked
merry -will n; longer ftrive, but never tea late for men
to repent in this world. I told Atkins every word the
prieft had faid, who then parted from us to talk to
his wife, while we difcourfed with the reft. But
tl.efe were very fhipid in religious matters, yet all
cf them pYomifed to do their/ endeavours to make
their wives turn Chrifthms ; and upon which promi-
fes the prieft married the three couple. But as At-
kins was the only fincere convert, and of more
fei-ife than the reft, my clergyman was earneftly in-
quiring after .him: Sir, faid he, let in -walk out'of
this labyrinth, and 1 dare fay -we jhall find this poor
man preaching to his -wife atready. And indeed we
found it true; for coming to the edge of the wood,
we perceived Atkins and his favage wife fitting under
the fhade of a bufh, in very earneft difcourfe; he
pointed to the fun, to the quarters of the earth, to
himfelf, to her, the woods,.and the trees. Immediately
we could perceive him ftart upon his feet, fall down
upou his knees, and lift up both his hands; at which
the
the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our
great misfortune was, we could not hear one word
that patted between them. Another time he would
embrace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, luffing
her with the greateft tranfports, and then both kneel
down for fome minutes together. Such raptures of
joy did this occafion in my young prieft, that he
could fcarcely contain himfelf: And a little after this,
we obferved by her motion, as frequently lifting up
her hands, and laying them on her breaft, that fhe
was mightily affected with his difcourfe, and fo they
withdrew from our fight.
When we came back, we found them both wait-
ing to be called in; upon which we agreed to exa-
mine him alone, and fo 1 began thus to difcourfe him.
Prithee, Will. Atkins, faid I, what education had
you? What was your father?
IV. A. A better man than ever I fiiall be; he was,
Sir, a clergyman, who gave me good inftruction, or
correction, which I defpifed, like a brute as I was,
and murdered my poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer!
[Here the priejljlarted and lookedpaht is think-
ing lie bad really killed bis father.'}
R. C. What, did you kill him with your hands?
W. A. No, Sir, I cut net his throat, but broke his
heart, by the mofl unnatural turn of difobedience to
the tendereft and beft of fathers.
R. C. Well, 1 pray God grant you repentance; I
did not afk you to extort a confeffion; but I aflted you,
becaufe I fee you have more knowledge of what is
good, than your companions.
W. A. O, Sir, whenevier I look back upon my paft
life, confcience upbraids me with my father: the CMS
againft our parents make the deepeft wounds, and
their weight lies the heavieft upon the mind.
R. C, You talk,-Will, too feelingly and fenfibly
for me; 1 am not able to bear it.
W. A. You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of it.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES
R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do; and every fLore, val-
ley, and tree in this illanti, witnefe the anguifh of my
foul for my undutifulnefs to my kind father; whom I
have murdered likewife; yet my repentance falls in-
finitely fhort of yours. But, Will, how eomes the
fenfe of this matter to touch you juft now?
W. A'. Sir, the work you have fet me about, has oc-
cafioned it; for talking to my wife about God'and'
religion, me has preached rne fuch a fermon, that I
fh?'ll retain it in lafting remembrance.
R. C. No, no, it is your own moving pious argu-
ments to her, has made confidence fling them bacit
upon you. But pray, Atkins,, inform us what paffed
between you and your wife, and in what manner did
you begin..
W. A. I talked to h;r of the laws of marriage, the
reafon of fuch compacts, whereby order and jullice is
maintained; without which^ men would run from-
their wives and children, to the dificlution of families
or inheritances.
A'. C. Well, and what did fhe fey to all this?
W. A. Sir, we began our difcourfe in the following
manner, which I fhail exa&ly repeat according to my
mean capacity, if you think it worth your while to
honour it with your attention..
The DIALOGUE tetween Will. Atkins and bis
Wife in tJie -wood.
Wife.~\TC>\3 tell me ma-rriage God appoint, have
j£ you God in your country?
If. A. Yes, child, God is in every nation;
Wife. No; great old Benamuckee god is in my
country, not yours.
W. A. My dear, God'is in heaven-, which he made;
fcc alfo made the earth, the fea, and all tbat is therein.
U'ift, Why you. not tell me much Jong ago?
W. A..
*
W. A. My dear, I have been a wicked wretch, ba-
ring a long time lived without the knowledge of God
in the world.
Wife. What, not know great God iir own nation?
No do good ting? No fay O to him ? 'that's ftrange!
W. A. But, my dear, many live as if there'was no
God in heaven for all that.
Wife. Why God fuffer this? why makee not live
well?
W. A. It is our own faults, child.
•Wife. But if he much great, can makee kill, why no
makee kill when no fcrve him? No be good mans no
cry O to him?
W. A. That's true, my dear, he may ftrike us dead,
but his abundant mercy fpareth us.
Wife. Did riot you tell God tankee for that?
W. A. No, I have neither thanked him for his mer-
ey, nor" feared him for his power.
Wife. Then me not believe your God be good, noE
makee kill, when you makee him angry.
W. A. Alas! muftmy wicked life hinder you from
believing in him?
Wife. How can me tink your God live there?
{pointing to heaven.} bure he no ken what you da
here.
W. A. Yes, yes, my dear, he hears us fpeak, fees
what we do, and knows what we even think.
Wife. Where then makee power ftrong, when he
hears you curfc, fwear de great damn?
W. A-. My dear this fhews he is indeed a God and
not a man, who has fuch tender mercy.
Wife. Mercy !' what you call mercy?
W. A. He pities and ipares us: as he is our great
Creator, fo is he alfo our tender father.
Wife. So God never angry, never kill wicked, then.
fte no good, no great mighty.
W. A. O my dear, don't fay fo, he is both; and
many,
many times he fhews terrible examples of his judge-
ment and vengeance.
Wife. '.Then you makee de bargain with him; you
<k> bad ting, he no hurt you, he hurt other mans.
W. A. No, indeed, my fins are all prefumptions upon
his goodnefs.
Wife. -Well, and yet no makee you dead? and you
give him no tankee neither?'
W. A. It ia true, I am. an ungrateful, unthankful
dog, that I am.
Wife. Why, you fay he makee you, why makee you
no much better then.
W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myfelf, and
abufed his goodnefs.
Wife. Pray makee God know me, me no makee him
angry, no do bad ting.
W. A. You mean, my dear, that you defire I would
teach you to know God: alas! poor dear creature;
he muft teach thee, and not I. But I'll pray earneftly
to him to direct thee, and to forgive me, a miferable
finner. {Hereupon be -went a little diftance, and kneel-
ing do-wn, prayed earnejUy to Cod to enlighten her mind,
and to pardon his fins; -when this -was dene, they
continued their difcwrfe thus.}
Wife. What.you put down Tsnee for? For what hold
up hand? Who you fpeak to?
W. A. My dear, 1 bowed in token of fubmiffion to
him that made me, and prayed that he would open your
eyes and underftanding.
Wife. And can he do that too? And will he hear
what you fay?
W. A. Yes, my dear, he bids us pray, and has given
us piomile that he will hear us.
Wife. When did he bid you pray? What, do you
hear him fpeak?
W. A. No, my dear, but God has fpoken formerly
to good men from heaven : and by divine revelation
they have written all his laws down in a book.
Wife.
Wife. O where dat good book?
W> A. I have it not now by me: but one time or
other I fhall get it for you to read. Then be embraced
her with great affeflion.
Wife. Pray tell a mee did God teachee them write
that book?
W. A. Yes, and by that rule we know him to be
God.,
Wife. What way, what rule you know him?
W. A. Becaufe he teaches what is good, juil, and
toly; and forbids all wicked and abominable actions
that incur his difpleafure.
Wife, O me fain underftand that, and if he do
all things you fay he do, fnrely he hear me fay O to
him j he makee me good if I wifh to be good;
he no kill me if I love him; me link, believe him
great God; me fay O to him, along with you, my
dear.
Here the poor mdn fell upon his knees, and made her
kneel down by him, praying -with the greateft fervency
that Gad -would injlruEl her by his Holy Spirit; and
that Gad by'hls providence wouldfend them a Bible for
both their in/truSfions. And fuch tuns the early piety
of this new convert, that Jhe made him promife never
to forfake God any more, left, being made dead, as foe
called if, Jhe Jbould not only want her inftruftor, but
himfelf be miferable in a long eternity.
Such a furprifing account as this was, proved very
affecting to us both, but' particularly to the young
clergyman, who was mightily concerned he could
not talk to her himfelf. Sir, faid he, there is fome-
thing more to be done to this woman than to marry
her: I mean that fhe ought to be baptized.. To
this I prefently agreed: Pray, faid he again, afk her
hufband, whether he has ever talked to her of Jefus
Chrift, the falvation of finners, the nature of faith,
and redemption in and by him, of the Holy Spirit,
the refurrection, laft judgment, and a future ftate:
but the poor fellow melted into tears at this quettion,
faying,
faying, that he had faid fomething to her of thefe
things, but his inability to talk of them, made him
afraid left her knowledge of them fhould rather
make her contemn religion, than be benefited by
it: but that, if I would difcourfe with her, it would
be very evident my labour would nnt be in vain.
Accordingly I called her in, and placing myfelf as
interpreter between the religious prieft and the wo-
man, I entreated him to go on: but furely never was
fuch A fennon preached by any clergyman in thefe
latter days, with fo much zeal, knowledge, and fin-
cerity; in fhort, he brought the woman to embrace
the knowledge of Chrift, and of redemption by him,
with fo furprifmg a degree of underftandhig, that
fhe made it her own requeft to be baptized. .
He then performed his office in the facrament of
baptifm, fir ft, by faying fome words over to himfelf
in Latin, and then afking me to give her a name, us
being her godfather, and pouring a whole difh full
of water upon the woman's head, he faid, MARY,
I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghoft j fo that none could
know of what religion he was. After this he pro-
nounced the benediction in Latin. Thus the woman
being made a Chriflian, he married her to Will. At-
kins; which being finifhed, he affectionately exhorted
him to lead a holy life for the future; that fmce the
Almighty, by the convi£tions of his confcience, had
honoured him to be the inftrument of his wife's
converfion, he fhould not dilhonour the grace of
God, that while the favage was converted, the in»
ftrument mould be cafb away. Thus ended a cere-
mony, to me the moft pleafant and agreeable I ever
paffed in my life.
The affairs of the ifland being fettled, I was pre-
paring to go on board, when the young man (whofe
mother was flarved) came to me, faying, that as hq
underfteod I had a clergyman with me, who had
married the Englifhmen with favages, he had a.
match'
match to make between two Chriftians, which he
defired might be finifhed before I departed. Think-
ing that it was he himfelf that had courted his mo-
ther's maid, I perfuaded him not to do any thing
rafhly upon the account of his folitary circumflances;
that the maid was an unequal match for him, both
in refpect to fubftance and years j and that it was very
probable he would live to return to his own country,
•where he might have a far better choice. At thefe
words, fmiling, he interrupted me, thanking me for
my good advice; that as he had nothing to beg of
me, but a fmall fettlement, with a fervant or two, or
fome few neceflaries, fo he hoped I would not be un-
mindful of him when I returned to England, but give
his letters to his friends; and that when he was re-
deemed, the plantation, and all its improvements,
however valuable, fhould be retumed to me again.
But, as for the marriage he propofed, that it was not
himfelf, but that it was between my Jack of all trades,
and the maid Sufan.
I was indeed agreeably furprifedat the mentioning
this match, which feemed very fuitable, the one being
a very ingenious fellow, and the other an excellent,
dexterous, and fenfible houfe-wife, fit to be gover-
nefs of the whole ifland: fo we married them the
fame day; and, as I was her father, and gave her
away, fo I pave her a handfome portion, appoint-
ing her and her hufband a convenient large fpace of
ground for their plantation. The fharing out of the
land I left to Will. Atkins, who really divided it
very juftly, to every perfon's fatisfaction: they only
defired one general writing under my hand for the
whole, which I caufed to be drawn up, figned, and
fealed to them, fetting out their bounds, and giving
them a right to the whole poffeffion of their refpec-
tive plantations, with their improvements, to them and
their heirs, referving all the reft of the ifland as my
own property, and a certain rent for every particular
jilautation, after eleven years. As to their laws and
government;
government, I exhorted them to love one another: and
as to the Indians who lived in a nook by themfelves,
I allotted three or four of them plantations, and the
reft willingly chofe to become fervants to the other
families, by which means they were employed in
ufeful labour, and fared much better than they did
before. Befides, the favages being thus mixed with
the Chriftians, the work of their converfion might
be fet on foot by the latter, in the clergyman's ah-
fence, to our equal fatisfaction. The young priefr,
however, was a little anxious left the Chriftians
fliould not be willing to do their parts in inftructing
thofe poor Indians: I therefore told him, we fhould
call them all together; that he fhould fpeak to the
Spaniards who were Papifts, and I to the Englifh
who were Proteftants, and make them promife that
they would never make any diflinction in religion,
but teach the general true knowledge of God, and
his Son'Jefus Chrift, in order to convert the poor
favages. And this, indeed, they all promifed us ac-
cordingly.
When I came to Will. Atkins's houfe, I found his
baptized wife, and the young woman newly married
to my Jack of all trades, were become great inti-
mates, and difcourfing of religion together. O, Sir,
fays Will. Atkins, when God has finners to reconcile
to-himfelf, he never wants an inftru£tor: I knew I
was unworthy for fo good a work, and therefore
this young woman has been fent hither as it were
from heaven, who is fufficient to convert a whole
iflanci of favages. The young woman blufhed, and
was going to rife: but I defired her to fit flill, and
hoped that God would blefs her in fo good a work:
and then, pulling out a Bible, (which I brought on
purpofe in my pocket for him), Here, Atkins, faid I,
here is an afflftant that perhaps you had not before.
So confounded was the poor man, that it was fome
time before lie could fpeak; at laft, turning to his
wife, My dear, he faid, did I not tell you that God
could
could hear what we faid? Here's the book I prayed
for, when you and I kneeled under the bufh: God
then heard us, and now has fent it. The woman wzs
iurprifed, and thought really God had fent that indi-
vidual book from heaven; but I turned to the young
woman, and defired her to explain to the new convert,
that God may properly be faid to anfwer our petitions,
when, in the courle of his providence, fuch particular
things come to pafs as we petitioned for. This the
young woman did effectually, but furely Will. At-
kins's joy cannot be exprefled; no man being more
thankful for any thing in the world, than he was for
his Bible, nor defired it from a better principle.
After feveral religious difcourfes, I defired the
young woman to give me an account of the anguifh
fhe felt when (he was fbrving to death for hunger -
to which fhe readily confented, and began in the fol-
lowing manner:
"Sir," faid fhe, " all our viSuals being gone,
after I had fafted one day, my ftomach was very
fickifh, and, at the approach of night, I was inclined
to yawmng, and fleepy. When I flept upon the
couch three hours, I awaked a little refrefhed: three
hours after, my ftomach being more and more fickifh,
I lay down again, but could not fleep, being very
faint and ill. Thus I paffed the fecond day with a
ftrange variety, firft hungry, then fick again, with
Teachings to vomit: that night I dreamed I was at
Barbadoes, buying plenty of provifions, and dined
heartily. But when I awaked, my fpirits were ex-
ceedingly funk, to find myfelf in the extremity of
famine. There was but one glafs of wine, which
being^ mixed with fugar, I drank up; but for want
.of fubflance to digeft upon, the fumes of it got into
my head, and made me fenfelefs for fome time. The
third day I was fo ravenous and furious, that I could
have eaten a little child if it had come in my way;
during which time, I was as mad as any creature in
* bedlam,
bedlam. In one of thefe fits I fell down, and flruck
my face againft the corner of a pallet bed, where my
miftrefs lay: the blood gufhed out of my nofe, but by
my exceffive bleeding, both the violence of the fever,
and the ravenous part of the hunger abated. After
this, I grew fick again, ftrove to vomit, but could not;
tb/en bleeding a fecond time, I fwooned away as dead;
when I came to myfelf, I had a dreadful gnawing
pain in my ftomach, which went off towards night,
with a longing deiire for food. I took a draught of
water and fugar, but it came up again; then I drank
tester without 1'ugar, and that ftaid with me. I laid
me down on the bed, praying God would take me a-
way; after I had flumbered, I thought myfelf a-dying,
therefore recommended my foul to God, and wifheil
ibmebody would throw me into the fea. All this
while my departing miftrefs lay by me; the la ft bit
of bread flie had, flie gave it to her dear chikl, my
young mailer. The morning after, I fell into a vio-
lent paffion of crying, and after that into hunger. I
efpied the blood that came from my nofe in a bafon,
which I immediately fwallowed up. At night I hail
the ufual variations, as pain in the ftomach, fick,
fleepy, and ravenous ; and I had nb thought but that
I fhould die before morning. - In the morning came
on terrible gripings in my bowels. At this time, I
heard my young mafter's lamentations, by which I
imderftood his mother was dead. Soon after, the fai-
lors cried, A fail! a fad! hallooing as if they were
diftrac~led, for joy of that relief, which afterwards we
received from your hands."
Surely never was a more diftinct account of ftar-
ving to death than this. But to return to the difpofi-
tion of things among my people, I did not take any
notice to them of the floop that I had framed, neither
would I leave them the two pieces of brafs cannon,
or the two quarter-deck guns that I had on board,
left, upon any difguft, they mould have feparated,
or
',
or turned pirates, and fo made the ifland a den of
thieves, inftead of a plantation of foher pious people:
but leaving them in a flourifhing condition, with a
promife to fend them further relief from Brazil, as
fhecp, hogs, and cows, (being obliged to kill the ht-
ter at fea, having no hay to feed them), I went on
board the fhip again, the firft of May 1695, after,
having been twenty days among them: and next
morning, giving them a falute of five guns at parting,
we fet fail for the Brazils. The third day, towards
evening, there happening a calm, and the current
being very ftrong, we were drove to the N. N. E. to-
wards the land. Some hours after we perceived the
fea covered as it were with fomething very black, not
•eafily at firft to be difcovered: upon which our chief
mate afcending the fhrouds a little way, and taking a
viewwrth a perfpe£iive glafs, he cries out, an Army!
An army, you fool, faid I, what do you mean ? Nay,
Sir, faid he, don't be angry, I afiure you it is not
only an army, but a fieet too; for I believe there are
a thoufand canoes paddling along, and making with
great hafte towards us.
Indeed every one"of us were furprifed at this rela-
tion: and my nephew the captain could not tell what
to think of ir, but thought we fhould all be devoured.
Nor was I free from concern, when I confidered how
much we were becalmed, and what a ftrong current
fet towards the fhore: bow-even, I encouraged him.
not to be afraid, but bring the fhip to an anchor, as
foon as we were certain that we muft engage them.
Accordingly we did fo, and furled all our fails: as to
the favages, we feared nothing, but only that they
might fet the Ihip on fire; to prevent which I order-
ed them to g«t their boats out, and faften them, one
clofe by the head, and the other by the ftern, well
manned, with fkeets and buckets to extinguifh the
flames, fhould it fo happen. The favages foon came
up with us, but there were not fo many as the mate
had faid, for inftead of a thoufand canoes, there were
Y 2 only-
only one hundred and twenty; too many indeed for
us, feveral of their canoes containing about fixteen or
feventeen men.
As. they approached us, they feemed to be in the
greateft amazement, not knowing what to make of us.
They rowed round the fhip, which occafioned us to
call to the men in the boats, not to fuffer them to
come near them. Hereupon they beckoned to the
favages to keep back, which they accordingly did;
but at their retreat they let fly about fifty arrows a-
mong us, and very much wounded one of our men in
the longboat. I called to them not to fire upon any
account, but handing them down fome deal-boards,
the carpenters made them a kind of a fence to fhield
them from the arrows. In half an hour after they
came fo near aftern of us, that we had a perfect fight
of them; then they rowed a little farther out, till
they came directly along fide of us, and then approach-
ed fo near as they could hear us fpeak: this made
• me order all our men to keep clofe, and get their
guns ready. In the mean time I ordered Friday to
go. out upon deck, and afk them in his language
•what they meant? No fooner did he do fo, but lix
of the favages, who were in the foremoft canoes, floop-
ing down, fhewed us their naked backfides, as much
as to fay in EngliJh,-Kifs our :but Friday quickly
knew what this meant, by immediately crying out
they were going' to fhoot; unfortunately for him,,
poor creature! who fell under the cloud of three hun-
dred arrows, no lefs than feven piercing through his
body, killing one of the beft of fervants, and faithful-
left of companions in all my folitudes and afflictions.
So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that
the guns, which before were charged with only pow-
der, to frighten them, I ordered to be loaded with
fmall fhot; nor did the gunners fail in their aim, but
at this broadfide fplit and overfet thirteen or fourteen
of their canoes, which killed numbers of them, and
fet the refl a fwimming: the others, frightened out
of
of their wits, little regarding their fellows drowning,
fcoured away as faft as they could. One poor wretch
pur people took up, fwimming for his life, an hour
after. He was very fullen at firft, fo that he would
neither eat nor fpeak: but I took a way to cure him, by
ordering them to throw him into the fen, which they
did, and then he came fwimming back like a cork,
calling in his tongue, -as I fuppofe, to fave him. SO'
we took him on board, but it was a long time before
we could make him fpeak or underftand Englifh; yet
when we h.id taught him, he told us, they were going
with their kings to fight a great battle: and when ive
afked him, what made them come up to us? he faid,
to maliee de great wonder kok: where, it is to be
noted, that thofe natives, and thofe of Africa, always
add two e's at the end of Englifh words, as makee,
takee, and the like, from which it is a very difficult
thing to make them break off.
Being now under fail, we took our laft farewell of
poor honefl Friday, and interred him with all poffible
decency and folemnity; putting him into a coffin,
and committing him to the deep, at the fame time
cauTing eleven guns to be fired for him. Thus ended
the life of one of the moft grateful, faithful, hondt,
and affe£tionate fervants, that ever any man was blef-
fed with in the world.
Having now a fair wind for Brazil, in about twelve
days time we made land in the latitude of five degrees
fouth of the line. Four days we kept on S. by E. in
fight of fhore, when we made cape St Augufline, and
in three days we came to an anchor off the bay cf
All Saints. I had great difficulty here to get leave to
hold correfpondence on (Lore; for neither the figure
of my partner, my two merchant truftees, nor the
fame of my wonderful prefervation in the ifland, could
procure me the favour, tilf fuch time as the prior of
the monaftery of the Auguflines (to whom! had given
500 moidores) obtained leave from the governor, for
pie perfona!Iy, with the captain and one more, toge-
v. Y 3 ther
ther with eight failors, to come on (bore; upon thre.
condition, that we fhould not land any goods out of
the fhip, or carry any perfon away without licence:
I found means however to get on fhore three bales of.
Englifh goods, fuch as fine broad cloths, ftuffs, and
feme linen, which I brought as a prefent for my part-
ner, who had fent me on board aprefent of frefh pro-
vifions, wine, and fweatmeats, worth above thirty
moidores, including fome tobacco, and three or four
fine gold medals. . .
Here I delivered my partner in goods to the value
of lool. Sterling, and obliged him to fit up the floop
I bought, for the ufe of my ifland, in order to fend
them refrefhments: and fo active was he in this mat-
ter, that he had the veflel fmifhed in a few days, to
the mailer of which I gave particular inftructions to
find the place. I foon loaded him with a fmall car-
go: and one of our failors offered to fettle there, upon
my letter to the Spanifh governor, if I would allot
him tools and a plantation. This I willingly grant-
ed, and gave him the favage we had taken prifoner
to be his flave. All things being ready for the voy-
age, my old partner told me, there was an acquain-
tance of his, a Brazil planter, who having fallen'un-
der the difpleafure of the church, and in fear of the
Inquifition, -which obliged him to be concealed, would
be glad of fuch an opportunity to make his efcape,,
with his wife and two daughters; and if I would al-
lot them a plantation in my ifland, he would give
them a fmall flock to begin with, for that the officers
had atready feized his effects and eftate, and left him
nothing but a little "houfhold fluff, and two flaves.
This requeft I prefently granted, concealing him and
his family on board our fhip, till fuch time as the
floop (where all the effects were) was gone out of.
the bay, and then we put them on board, who car-
ried fome materials, and plants for planting fugar-
c.uies, along with them. By this floop, among other
things^! fent my fubje&s 3 milch cows and five calves,,
about
•about 22 hogs, 3 fows big with pig, 2 marcs and a
flone horfe. I alfo engaged three Portugal women
to go for fake of the Spaniards, which, with the per-
fecuted man's two daughters, were fufficienr, fince
the reft had wives of their own, though in. another
country; all which cargo arrived fafe, no doubt to
their exceeding comfort, who, with this addition,
were about fixty or feventy people, befides children.
At this place, my truly honeft and pious clergyman
left me; for a fhip being ready to fet fail for Lifbon,
he afked me leave to go thither; but I affure you, it
was with the greateft reluctancy I parted from a per-
fon, whofe virtue and piety merited the greateit e-
fteem.
From the Brazils, we made direclly over the Atlantic
ocean, to the Cape of Good Hope, having a tolerable
good voyage, fleering for the moft part S. E. We
were on a trading voyage, and had a fupercargo on
board, who was to direct all the fhip's motions after
flie arrived at the Cape, only being limited to a cer-
tain number of days, for ftay, by charter party, at
the feveral ports fhe was to go to. At the Cape, we
only took in frefh water, and then failed for the
coaft of Coromandel: we were there informed, that a
French man of war of 50 guns, and two large mer-
chant fhips, were failed for the Indies,1 but we heard
no more of them.
In our paffage, we touched at the ifland of Mada-
gafcar, where, though the inhabitants are naturally
fierce and treacherous, and'go conftamly armed with
bows and lances,, yet for fome time they treated us
civilly enough ; and, in exchange for knives, fcifiars,
and other trifles, they brought us eleven good fat bulr
locks, which we took partly for prefent frefli victuals,
and the remainder to fait for the fhip's ufe.
So curious was I to view every corner of the world
where I came to, that I went on fhore as often as I
could. One evening when on more, we obferved
i numbers of the people ftand gazing at us at a dir
fiance.
ftance. We thought ourfelves in no danger, -as they
had hitherto ufed us kindly. However, we cut three
boughs out of a tret, fticking them at a dMtance from
us, which, it feems, in that country, is not only a to-
ken of truce and amity, but when poles or boughs
are fet up on the other fide,' it is n fign the truce is
accepted. In thefe treaties, however, there is one
principal thing to be regarded, that neither party
come beyond one another's three poles or boughs; fo
that the middle fpace is not only fecure, but is alfo
allowed as a market for traffic and commerce: when
the truce is thus accepted, they ftick up their javelins
and lances at the firft poles, and come on unarmed;
but, if any violence is offered, away they run to their
poles, take up their weapons, and then the truce is
at an end. This evening, it happened that a greater
number of people than ufual, both men and women,
traded among us for fuch toys as we had, with fuch
great civility, that we made us a little tent of large
boughs of trees, fome of the men refolving to lie
fin fhore all night: But, for my part, I and fome o-
thers took our lodging in the boat, vvith boughs of
trees fpreadover it, having a fail fpread at the bottom
to lie upon. About-two o'clock in the morning, we
vsre awakened by the firing of mufkets, and our
men crying out for help, or elfe they would all be
murdered. Scarce had we time to get the boat afhore,
when our men came plunging themfelves into the
water, with about four hundred of the inlanders at
their heels. We took up feven of the men, three of
them very much wounded, and one left behind killed,
while the enemy poured their arrows fo thick among
us, that we were forced to make a barricade, with
boards lying at the fide of the boat, to fhield us from
danger; and, having got ready our fire arms, we re-
turned them a volley, which wounded feveral of them,
as we could hear by their cries. In this condition
we lay till break of .day, and then making fignals of
diftreis to the fhip, -which my nephew the captain
heard
heard and underftood, he weighed anchor, and flood
as near the fhore as poffible, and then fent another
boat with ten hands in her to affifh us; but we called
to them not to come near, informing them of our
unhappy condition. However, they ventured; when
one of the men taking the end of a tow line in his
one hand, and keeping our boat between him and our
adverfaries, fwam on board us, and made faft our
line to the boat; upon this, ffipping our cables, they
towed us out of the reach of their arrows, and quick-
ly after, a broadfide was given them from the fhip,
which made a moft dreadful havock among them.
When we got on board, we examined into the occa-
fion of this fray ; the men who fled informed us, that
an old woman, who fold milk within the poles, had
brought a young woman with her, who carried roots,
or herbs, the Cght of whom fo much tempted our
men, that they offered rudenefs to the maid, at which
the old woman fet up a great cry 5 nor would the
failors part with the prize, but carried her among
the trees, while the old woman went, and brought a
•whole army down upon them. At the beginning of the
attach, one of our men was lulled with a lance, and the
fellow who began the mifchief, paid dear enough for
his miftrefs, though as yet we did not know what
had' become of him; the reft luckily efcaped. The
third night after the action, being curious to under-
ftand how affairs flood, I took the fupercargd, and
twenty flout fellows with me, and landed about two
hours before midnight, at the fame place where thofe
Indians flood the night before, and there we divided
our men into two bodies, the boatfwain commanding
one, and I another. It was fo dark, that we could
fee nobody, neither did we hear any voice near us:
but by and by the boatfwain falling over a dead bo-
dy, we agreed to halt till the moon mould rife, which
•we knew would be in an hour after. We perceived
here no fewer than two and thirty bodies upon the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Satisfied.
•with'
this difcovery, I was for going on board again;
but the boatfwain and the reft told me, they would
make a vifit to the Indian town, where thofe dogs, fo
they called them, refided, afking me at the fame time
to go along with them; for, they did not doubt,
betides getting a good booty, but they fhould find Tom
Jeffery there, for that was the unhappy man we mif-
fed. But I utterly refufed to go, and commanded
them back, being unwilling to hazard their lives, as
the fafety of the fhip wholly depended upon them.
Notwithftanding all I could fay to them, they all left
me but one, and the fupercargo: fo we three return-
ed, to the boat, where a boy was left, refolving to ftay
till they returned. At parting I told them I fuppofed
rnoft of them would run the fame fate with Tom
Jeffery. To this they replied, Come, boys, come along,
we'll war rant "we'll come offfafe enough: and fo away
they went, notwithstanding all my admonitions, ei-
ther concerning their own fafety, or the prefervation
of the fhip. Indeed, they were gallantly armed, e-
very man having a mufket, bayonet, and a piftol, be-
fides cutlafles, hangers, pole-axes, and hand grana-
does. They came to a few Indian houfes at firft,
which not being the town they expected, they went
farther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they con-
cluded that fhe would be a fufficient guide, and fo it
proved; for, after they untied her, flie led them di-
rectly to the town, which confifted of above two hun-
dred houfes, feveral families living in forne of the huts
together. At their arrival, all being in a profound
fteep, the failors agreed to divide themfelves into
three bodies, and fet three parts of the town on
fire at once, to kill thofe that were eft-aping, and
plunder the reft of the houfes. Thus defperately re-
folved, they went to work; but the firft party had
not gone far, before they called out to the reft, that
they had found Tom Jeffery; whereupon they all ran
up to the place, and found the poor fellow indeed
hanging up naked by one arm, and his throat cut
alnaotl.
almoft from ear to ear: in a houfe that was hard by
the tree they found fixteen or feventeen Indians, who
had been concerned in the fray, two or three of them
being wounded, who were not gone to fleep; this
houfe they fet on fire firft, and, in a few minutes after,
five or fix places more in the town appeared in flames.
The conflagration fpread like wild fire, their houfes
being all of wood, and covered with flags or nrfhes.
The peer affrighted inhabitants endeavoured to run
out to fave their lives, but they were driven back in-
to the flames by the failors, and killed without mer-
cy. At the firft houfe above mentioned, after the boat-
fwain had flain two with his pole-axe, he threw a
hand-granado into the houfe, which buriling, made a
terrible havock, killing and wounding moft of them;
and their king and moil of his train, who were then
in that houfe, fell viclims to their fury, every crea-
ture of them being either fmothered or burnt. All
this while they never fired a gun, left the people fhould
awaken fafter than they could overpower them. But
the fire awakened them fail enough, which obliged
our fellows to keep together in bodies. By this time
the whole town was in a flame, yet their fury rather
increafed, calling out to one another to remember
Tom Jeffery. The terrible light of this conflagration
made me very uneafy, and roufed my nephew the
captain, and the reft of bis men, who knew nothing
of the matter. When he perceived the dreadful fmoke,
and heard the guns go off, he readily concluded his
men were in danger; he, therefore, takes another
boat, and comes ailiore himfeli, with thirteen men
well armed. He was greatly furprifed to fee me and
only two men in the boat, but more fo when I told
him the ftory; but though I argued with him, as I
did with his men, about the danger of the voyage,
the interefts of the merchants and owners, and the
fafety of the fhip, yet my nephew, like the reft, de-
clared, that he would rather lofe the fhip, his voyage,
his life, and all, than his men fhould be loft for want
of
of help: and fo away he went. For my part, feeing
him refolved to go, I had not power to ftay behind.
He ordered the pinnace back again for twelve men
more, and then we marched directly as the flame
guided us. But furely never was fuch a fcene of hor-
ror beheld, or more difmal cries heard, except when
Oliver Cromwell took Drogheda in Ireland, where
he neither fpared man, woman, or child.
The firft object, I think, we met with, was the
ruins of one of their habitations, before which lay
four men and three women killed, and two more
burnt to death among the fire, which was now de-
caying. Nothing could appear more barbarous than
this revenge: none more cruel than the authors of it.
As we went on, the fire increafed, and the cry pro-
ceeded in proportion. We had not gone much far-
ther, when we beheld three naked women, follow-
ed by fixteen or feventeen men, flying with the
greateft fwiftnefs from our men, who fhot one of
them in our fight. When they perceived us, whom
they fuppofed alfo their murtherers, they fet up a moft
dreadful fhriek, and both of them fwooned away in
the fright. This was a fight which might have foft-
ened the hardeft heart: and, in pity, we took fome
ways to let them know we would not hurt them,
•while the poor creatures, with bended knees, and lift-
ed up hands, made piteous lamentations to us to fave"
their lives. I ordered our men not to hurt any of
the poor creatures whatfoever; but being willing to
underftand the occafion of all this, I went among
thefe unhappy wretches, who neither underftood me,
nor the good I meant them. However, being, re-
folved to put an enu to this barbarity, I ordered the
men to follow me. We had not gone fifty yards
before we came up with the boatfwain, with four
of our men at his heels, all of them covered with
blood and uuft, and in fearch of more people to fa-
tiate their vengeance. As foon as we faw them, we
called out, and made them underftand who we were;
upon
•were; upon which they came up to us, fetting up a
halloo of triumph, in token that more help was come.
Noble captain, faid he to my nephew, I'm glad you're
come: we have not half done wiih thefe villanous
hell hound dogs, we'll root out the very nation of
them from the earth, and kill more than poor Tom
has hairs upon his head: and thus he went on till I
interrupted him. Blood-thiffty dog! faid I, will your
cruelty never end? I charge you touch not one crea-
ture more; ftop your hands, and Hand ftill, or yon're
a dead man this moment. Why, .Sir, faid he, you
neither know whom you are protecting, nor what
they have done: but, pray, coma hither, and behold an
inftance of companion, if fuch can merit your cle-
mency, and with that he fhewed me the poor fellow
with his throat cut, hanging upon the tree.
Indeed, here was enough to fill their breafts with
rage, which, however, I thought had gone too far,
agreeable to thefe words of Jacob to his fons Simeon
and Levi; Curfed be their anger, for it -was farce;
and their -wrath, fer it -was cruel. But this fight
made my nephew and the reft as bad as they; nay,
my nephew declared, his concern was only for his
men; as for the people, not a foul of them ought to
live. Upon this, the boatfwain and eight more di-
rectly turned about, and went to finifll the intended
tragedy; J^iieti^eing out of my power to prevent, I
returned Back boll from ths difmal fight, and the pi-
teous cries of thofe unfortunate creatures, who were
Hiade victims to their fury. Indeed, it was an egre-
gious piece of folly in me to return to the boat with
but one attendant; and I had very near paid for it,
having narrowly efcaped forty armed Indians, who
had been alarmed by the conflagration; but having
pafled the place where they flood, I got to the boat,
accompanied with the fupercargo, and fo went on
board, fending the pinnace back again, to affift the
men in what might happen. When I had got to the
Z boat,
boat, the fire was almoft extinguifhed, and the noife
abated; but I had fcarce been half an hour on hoard
the fhip, when I heard another volley given by our
failors, and a great fmoke, which, as I afterwards
found, was our men falling upon thofe houfes and
perfons that ftood between them and the fea: but
here they fpared the wives and children, and killed
only the men, to the number of about fixteen or fe-
venteen. By the time they got to the fhore, the pin-
nace and the fhip's boat were ready to receive them,
and they all got fafe on board, not a man of them
having received the leaft hurt, except two, one of
whom ftrained his foot, and the other burnt his hand
a little; for they met with no refiftance, the poor In-
dians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded.
I was extremely angry with every one of them,
hut particularly with the captain, who, inftead of
cooling the rage of the men, had prompted them on
to farther mifchief: nor could he make me any
other excufe, but, that as he was a man, he could not
mafter his paffions at the fight of one of his mea
fo cruelly murdered. As for the reft, knowing they
were not under my command, they took no notice
of my anger; but rather boafted of their revenge.
According to all their accounts, they killed or de-
ftroyed about one hundred and fifty men, women,
and children, befides burning the town to allies.
They took their .companion Tom Jeffery from the
tree, covered him with fome of the ruins, and fo left
him. But, however, this a&ion of our men might
feem to them juftifiable, yet I always openly con-
demned it with the appellation of the Maffacre of
Madagafcar. For, though they had flain this Jeffe-
ry, yet certainly he was the firfl. aggreflbr, by at-
tempting to violate the chaftity of a ycwij innocent
woman, who venturing down to them, on the faith
of the public capitulation, which was fo treacheroufly
broken, •
While
While vre were under fail, the boatfwain would
often defend this bloody action, by faying, that the
Indians had broke the truce the night before, by/booting
one of our men •without juft provocation; and what if
the poor fellow had taken a little liberty -with the wench,
he ought not to have been murdered in fo villanous a
manner : and that they hadafled nothing but -what the
divine la-ws commiffioned to be done to fuch homicides.
However, I was in the fame mind as before, telling
them that they were murderers, and bid him depend
upon't, that God would blaft their voyage for fuch
an unparallelled piece of barbarity.
When we came into the gulf of Perfia, five of our
men, who ventured on fhore, were either killed or
made flaves by the Arabians, the reft of them having
fcarce time to efcape to their boat. This made me
upbraid them afrefh with the juft retribution of hea-
ven for fuch actions; upon which the boatfwain ve-
ry warmly afked me, Whether thofe men on whom
the tower of Siloam fell, were greater finners than
the reft of the Galileans? and befides, Sir, faid he,
none of thefe five poor men that are loft, were with
us at the maflacre of Madagafcar, as you call it;
and, therefore, your rqjrehenfion is very unjuft, and
your application improper. Befides, added he, you
are continually ufing the men very ill, upon this ac-
count, and being but a paflenger yourfelf, we are
not obliged to bear it; nor can we tell what ill de-
figns you may have to bring us to judgment for it in
England; and, therefore, if you do not leave this dif-
courfe, as alfo not concern yourfelf with any of our
affairs,' I will leave the fhip, and Mot fail among fuch
dangerous company.
All this I heard very patiently; but, it being often
repeated, I at length told him, the concern 1 had on
board was none of his bufinefs: that I was a confi-
derable owner in the fhip, and therefore had a right
to fpeak in common, and that I was no way ac-
countable to him, nor to any body elfc. As no
Z i more
more paffed for fome time after, I thought all had been
over. At this time we were in the road of Bengal,
•where, going on fhere with the fupercargo, one day,
in the evening, as I was preparing to go on board, one
of the men came to me, and told me, I need not
trouble myfelf to co:ne to the boat, for that the
cockfwain and others had ordered him not to carry
-4he on board any more. This infolent meffage
much furprifed me; yet I gave him no anfwer to it,
but went directly and acquainted the fupercargo, en-
treating him to go on board, and, by acquainting the
captain with it, prevent the mutiny which I percei-
ved would happen. " But before I had fpoken this,
the matter was effected on board; for no fooner
was he gone off in the boat, but the boatfwain,
gunner, carpenter, and all the inferior officers, came
to the quarterdeck, defiling to fpeak with the cap-
tain; and there the boatfwain made a long harangue,
exclaiming againft me, as before mentioned, that,
if I had not gone afhore peaceably, for nly own di-
verfion, they, by violence, would have compelled me
for their fatisfaction: that,.as they had fhipped with
the captain,' fo they would faithfully ferve him;
but, if I did not quit the fhip, or the captain oblige
me to it, they would leave the fhip immediately:
hereupon, tuming his face about by way of fignal,
they all cried out, ONE and ALL, ONE and
ALL.
\ou maybe fure, that though my nephew was a
man of great courage, yet he could not be but fur-
prifed at their fudden and unexpe£ted behaviour;
and, though he talked floutly to them, and after-
vrards expoilulated with them, that, in common
juftice to me, who was a confiderable owner in the
fhip, they could not turn me, as it were, out of my
own houfe, which might bring their lives in danger,
fhonld they ever be taken in England; nay, though
he invited the boatfwaih on fhore to accommodate
matters with me ; yet all this, 1 fay, fignified nothing:
they
tfiey would have nothing to do with me; and
they were refolved to go on fhore, if I came on
board. Well, faid my nephew, if you are fo re*
folved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have
done: and fo he came to me, giving me an account
of their refolution, how one and all defigned to for-
fake the fhip when I came on board, for which he
was mightily concerned. I am glad to fee you, ne-
phew, faid I, and rejoice it is no worfe, fince they
have not rebelled againft you : I only defire you to
fend my neceflary things on fhore, with a fuffkient
fum of money, and I will find my way to England,
.as well as I can. Though this grieved my nephew
to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compli-
ance; in fhort, all my neceflarks were fent me, and;
fo this matter was over in a few hours.
I think I was now near a thoufand leagues farther
off England by fea,' than at my little kingdom, ex-
cept this difference, that I might travel by land over
the Great Mogul's country to Surat, from thence up
to Baflbra, by fea up the rerfian gulf, then take-the
way of the caravans over the Arabian defert to Aleppo
and Scanderoon, there take fhipping: to Italy, and
fo travel by land into France, and from thence crofs
the fea to England.
My nephew kft me two perfons to attend me;
one of them was his fervant, and the other clerk
to the purfer, who engaged to be mine. I took lod-
gings in an Englifh woman's hou'fe, where feveral
French, one Englifh, and two Italian merchants re^
Cded. The handfome entertainment I. met 'with,
here, occafioned me to ftay nine months confidering
what courfe I fhould take. Some Englifh goods I
had with me of great value, befides a thoufand pieces
of eight, and a letter of credence for more, if there
was fuch neceffity. The goods I foon difpofed cf
to advantage, and bought here feveral good di,-
montls, which I could eafily carry about with mtv
One morning the Englifii merchant came to me, as
Z 3 being
being very intimate together, Countryman, faid he, 7
have a project to communicate to you, -which, I hope,
•will fuit lo both our advantage. To lie fliort, Sir,
we are both in a remote part «/ the -world from our
country; but yet in a place ivhere men of Inijlnefs may
get a great deal of money. Now, if you -will put a
thojlfand pounds to my thoufand pounds, \vc -will hire a
Jlup to our fatisfaclion : youjb.illbe captain, 1 -willbe
merchant; and "we'll go a trading voyage to China;
for why fl;ould -use He Jiill like drons, "iuhile the -whole
world is in a continual motion.
This propofal foon got my confent, being very a--
greeable to my rambling genius; and the more fo,
bccaufe I looked upon my countryman to be a very
fincere perfon; it required fome time before we could
pet a vefiel to our mind, and failors to man it ac-
cordingly; at length, we bought a fhip, and got an
Englifh mate, boatfwain, and gunner, a Dutch car-
penter, and three I'ortuguefe foremaft-men; and, for
want of others, made fhift with Indian feamen. We
full failed to Achin, in the ifland of Sumatra, and then
to Siam, where we bartered our wares for fome ar-
rack and opium, .the laft of which bore a great price
among the Chinefe; in a word, we went up to
Suikan, making a very great voyage; and, after
eight months time; I returned to Bengal, very well i
fatisGed with this adventure, having not only got a i
fufficient quantity of money, but an infight of getting
a great deal more.
The next voyage my friend propofed to me, was
to go among the Spice iflands, and bring home a load
of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts, iflands
belonging partly to Spain, but where the Dutch trade
very confiderably. We were not long preparing for
this voyage, which-we made no kfs fuccefsful than
the laft, touching at Bornea, aind feveral other places
which I do not perfectly remember, and returning
Lome in about five months time. We foon fold our
fpices, which were chiefly cloves, and fome nutmegs,
to
to the Perfian merchants, who carried them away for
the gulf; and, in fhort, making five to one advan-
tage, we were loaded with money.
Not long after my friend and I had made up our
accounts, to our entire fatisfaction, there came in a
Dutch coafler from Batavia, of about two hundred
tons. T;.e crew of this veflel pretended themfelves
fo fickly, that there were not hands fufficient to
undertake a voyage; and the captain having given,
out that he intended to go to Europe, public notice
was given that the fhip was to be fold. No fooner
did this come to our ears, but we bought the fhip,
paid the mafter, and took pofleffion. We would alfo
have very willingly entertained fome of the men:
but they having received their fhare of booty, were
not to be found, being altogether fled to Agra, the
great city of the Mogul's refidence; and from thence
were to travel to Surat, and fo by fea to the Perfian
gulf. And indeed they had reafon to fly in this
manner: for the truth of it was, the pretended cap-
tain was the gunner only, and not the commander:
that having been on a trading voyage, they were at-
tacked on ihore by the Malayans, wh'o killed three
men, and the captain; after whofe death the other
eleven men run away with the Ihip to the bay of
Bengal, and left the mate and five men more on
fhore; but of this affair we fhall have occafion to
fpeak at more length hereafter.
However they came by the fhip, we thought we
bought it honeftly; neither did we fufpect any thing
of the matter; when the man fhewed us a bill of
fale for the fhip (undoubtedly forged) to oneEmanuel
Clofterfhoven, which name he went by. And fo
without any more to do, we picked up fome Dutch
and Englifh feamen, refolding for another voyage for
cloves among the Philippine and Molucca iflands; in
fhort, we continued thus five or fix years, trading
from port to port with extraordinary fuccefs; in
the feventh year we undertook a voyage to China,
defigning
defigning to touch at Siam, and buy fome rice ty
the way. In this voyage, contrary winds beat us up
and down for a eonfidersble time among the iflands
in the ftraits of Molucca. No fooner were we clear
of tbofe rugged feas, but we perceived our fhip had
fprung a leak, which obliged us to put into the
river Cambodia, which lies northward of the eulf,
and goes up to Siam.
One day as I was on fhore refrefhing myfelf, there
comes to me an Englifhman, who was a gunner's
mate on board an Englifh Eaft India fhip, riding up
the river, near the city of Cambodia. Sir, foid he, you
may -wonder at my bnfmefs, havingnever feenme in pur
life; but though lam ajtranger, Ikavefomething to tell
you that very nearly concerns yaut and indeed it is the
imminent danger you are in, has moved me to give you
this timely notice. Danger! faid I, what danger? I
know of none, except my fhip being leaky, for which
I defign to have her run aground to-morrow morning.
Sir, faid he, I hope you will be better employed, -when
youfball hear -what I have to fay to you. You know the-
town o/'Cambodia is about i 5 leagues up this river : a-
bout three leagues on this fide of it, there lies two Dutch
and three EnglifhyZ>//j. And -would you venture here,
•without confidering -what ftrength you had to engage
them.? I knew not what he meant by this difcourfe,and
turning fhcrt upon him, Sir, faid I, I know no reafcn I
have to be afraid either of any Englifh or Dutch fhips.
I am no interloper, and what bufinefs have they then,
with me? Well, Sir, faid the man, if you do think your-
felffecure, all as I can fay, you muji take your chance .-
hs-wever, lam very ferry you arefo deaf to good advice;
hit I ajfure you if you do not put tofea immediately, you
•will be attacked by five long boats full of men, hanged
yourfelffor a pirate, if you are taken, and the parti-
cular,! examined after-wards. I thought, Sir, added he,
I might have met -with better reception for fuch a Jin-
gular piece of fervice. Sir, faid 1,1 was never ungrate-
ful to any man: but pray explain yourfelf, and I'll
go on board this minute, whether the leak be flopped
or no. Why, Sir, faid he, to be fhort, becaufe time is
precious, the matter is this: Yon know -well enough that
you -was -with thz flip ,it Samatra, -where your captain
was murdered by the Malayans, -with three of his fai-
hrs; and that either you, or fome -who -were on board
you, ran away with the Jbip, and are fmce turned pi-
rates at fea. Now, Sir, this is the fum of-what I had
to fay; aml I can positively af*ure you, that if you be.
taken, you will be executed without much ceremony;
for undoubtedly you cannot but ie fenfible what little law
merchant Jbips foe-w to pirates, whenever they fall in-
to their unmerciful hands.
Sir, faid I, I thank you for your kind informa-
tion; and though, I am fure, no man could come
more honeflly by the fhip than I have done, yet
knowing their entcrprife, and being fatisfied of your
honcfl intention, I'll be upon my defence. Prithee,
Sir, faid the man, don't talk of being t/fon your defence,
the beji that yon can make is to be out of danger; and
therefore, if you have any regard to your life, and the
lives of your men, take the advantage, without fail, of
putting out to fea at high water; by whieh means, as
you have a whole tide before you, you will lie gone too far
out of their reach before they can come dfuin.
I am mighty well fatisfied, faid I, in this particu-
lar, and of your kindnefs, which merits my greateft
efteem? pray, Sir, what amends fhall I make you?
He replied, 1 know not what amends you are willing
to make, bccaufe you may have fome doubts of its cer-
tainty: tut, to convince you of the truth of what Ifa\-,
I have one offer to make to you. On board one of the
Engifft,jbips, I have nineteen months pay due to me, and
this Dutchman that is with me has /even months pay
due to him, which if you will make good to us, we will
go along with you. Jf you /ballfind, that there is no-
thing in what we have faid, then we /hall dcfirc no-
thing: but, when you are canvinced that we ha vefaved
the
tktjbip, your life, and the lives of the men, -we "will
leave the whole to your generofity.
So reafonable did this every way appear, that I
immediately confented, and we went directly on
board. As foon as we came on board, my partner
calls joyfully out, That they had flopped the leak!
Well, thank God, faid I, but, pray let us weigh
anchor forthwith. Weigh! faid he, what is the
meaning of this hurry? Pray, afk no queftions, faid
I, but all hands to work, without lofing a moment's
time: Upon which, in great furprife, the captain
was called, who immediately ordered the anchor to
be .got up; and though the tide was not quite down,
yet, being affifted with a little land breeze, we ftood
out to fea. I then called my partner into the cabin*
and related the ftory at large, which was confirmed,
and more amplified by the two men I had brought
on board. Scarce had we finifhed our difcodrfe, up-
on this head, but a failor came to the cabbin door,
with a meflage from the captain, that we were
chafed by five floops full of armed men. Ve/y well,
faid I, it is plain now there is fomething in it. And
fo, going upon deck, I told all the men there was a
defign for feizing the (hip, and of executing us for
pirates; and afked them) whether they would faith-
fully ftand by us, and by one another? To which,
they unanimoufly replied, that they would fight to
their laft drop of blood. I then afked the captain,
which way he thought beft for us to manage the
battle ? Sir, faid he, the only method is to keep them off
with our great Jbot as long as tve are able, and then have
recourfe to our/mall arms: and -when both, thefefail us,
then retire to clofe quarters, when perhaps the enemy,
•wanting materials, can neither break apen our l-ulk
beads, nor get in upon us. Mean time the gunner was
ordered to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of
the fteerage, and fo load them with mufket bullets,
and fmall pieces of old iron; and the deck being
cleared, we prepared for the engagement, Hill, how-
ever,
ever, keeping out at fea. The boats followed us
with all the fail they could make, and we could per-
ceive the two foremoft were Englifh, which outfailed
the reft by two leagues, and which we found would
come up with us: hereupon, we fired a gun without
ball, intimating that they fhould bring to, and we
put out a flag of truce, as a fignal for parley; but,
finding them crouding after us, till they came with-
in (hot, we took in our white, and hanging out the
red flag, immediately fired at them with ball: we
then called to them with a fpeaking trumpet, bidding
them at their peril keep off.
But all this fignified nothing; for, depending up-
on the ftrength that followed '.hem, they were refo-
lately bent for mifchief: hereupon, I ordered them to
bring the fhip to, by which means, they lying upon
our broadfide, we let fly at them at once, one of
whom carried away the ftern of the hindermofl boat,
and obliged them not only to take down their fail,
but made them all run to the head of the boat, to
keep them from finking; and fo ihe lay by, having
enough of it. In the mean time, we prepared to
welcome the foremoft boat in the fame manner.
While we were doing this, one of the three hinder-
moft boats came up to the relief of that which was
difabled, and took the men out of her. We again
called to parley with them ; but, in flead of an anfwer,
one of the boats came clofe under our ftern; where-
upon, our gunner let fly his two chace guns, but
miffing) the men in the- boat fhouted, and waving
their .caps, came on with greater fury. To repair
this feeming difgrace, the gunner foon got ready,
and, firing the fecond time, did a great deal of mif-
chief among the enemy. We waved again, and,
bringing our quarter to bear upon them, fired three
guns more, when we found the boat a-fin king, and
feveral men atready in the fea; hereupon, manning
our pinnace, I gave orders to fave as many as they
could, and inftantly to come on board, becaufe the
reft
refl of their boats were approaching: accordingly they
did fo, and took up three of them, one of whom was
almoft paft recovery; and then crouding all the fail
we could, after our men came on board, we flood
out farther to fea, fo that the other three boats gave
Over their chace, when they came up to the firft two.
Thus delivered from imminent danger, we changed
our courfe to the eaftward, quite out of the courfe of
all European fhips.
Being "ow at fea, and inquiring more particularly
of the two feamen, the meaning of all this, the
Dutchman, at once, let us into the fecret. He told
us, that the fellow who fold us the fliip was an ar-
rant thief, who had run away with her; that the
captain was treacheroufly murdered on the coaft of
Molucca by the natives there, with three of his men;
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being obli-
ged to have recourfe to the woods for their fafety,
at length efcaped by means of a Dutch fhip, in its
way to China, which had fent their boat on fhore for
frefh water: That, after this, he went to Batavia,
where two of the feamen belonging to the ^hip (who
had deferted the reft in their travels) arrived, and
there gave an account that the fellow who ran away
with the fhip had fold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates,
•who went a cruifing, and had atready taken one Eng-
lifh, and two Dutch fhips richly laden.
Now, though this was abfolutely falfe, yet, con-
cerning us directly, my partner truly faid, that our
deliverance was to be eftecmed fo much the more,
by reafon, had we fallen into their hands we could
have expected nothing from them but immediate
death, confidering our accufers would have been our
judges: and, therefore, his opinion was, to return
diredly to Bengal, where, being known, we could
prove how honeftly we came by the fhip, of whom
we bought her, and the like, and where we were
fure of fome juftice; at leaft would not be hanged
firft, and judged afterwards. I was at firft of my
partner's
partner's opinion; but when I had more fcrioufly
confidered of the matter, I told him we ran a great
hazard in attempting to return, being on the wrong
fide of the ftraits of Molucca, and that if, upon alarm
given, we fhould be taken by the Dutch of "BatavLi
or Englifh elfewhere, our running away would be a
fufficient evidence to condemn us. This danger in-
deed ftartled not only my partner, but likewife all the
fhip's company; fo we changed our former refolu-
tion, and refolved to go to the coaft of Tonquin, and
fo to that of China, where, purfuing our firft defign
as to trade, we might likewife have an opportunity to
difpofe of the fhip fome way or other, and to return
to Bengal in any country veflel we could procure.
This being agreed to, we fleered away N. N. E. a-
bout 50 leagues off the ufual courfe tothe.eaft, which
put us to fome inconveniencies. As the wind blew
fteadily againft us, our voyage became very tedious,
and we began to be afraid of want of provifion; and
•what was ftill worfe, we apprehended, that as thofe
fhips, from whofe boats we had efcaped, were bound
to China, they might get before us, and have given
frefh information, which might create another vigo-
rous purfuit. Indeed, I could not help being grieved,
when I confidered that I, who had never wronged or
defrauded any perfon in my life, was now purfued
like a common thief; and, if taken, to run the great-
eft danger of being executed as fuch; and, though
innocent, I found myfelf under the neceffity of flying
for my fafety: and thereby efcape, being brought to
fhame, of which I was even more afraid than of death
itfelf. It was eafy to read my dejection in my coun-
tenance. My mind was opprefled, like thofe unhap-
py innocent perfons, who, being overpowered by
blafphemous and perjured evidences, wickedly refol-
ved to take away their lives, or ruin their reputation,
have no other recourfe in this world to eafe their for-
row, but lighs, prayers, and tears. My partner fee-
ing me fo concerned, encouraged me as well as he
A a could;
could; and, after defcribing to me the feveral ports
or that coaft, he told me, he would either put me in
on tie coail of Cochinchina, or elfe in the bay of
Tonquin, from whence we might go to Macao, a
town once poffefled by the Portuguefe, and where ftill
many European families refided.
To this place we fleered, and, early next morning,
came in fight of the coaft; but thought it advifeable
to put into a fmall river where we could, either over
land, or by the fhip's pinnace, knew what veflels
were in any ports thereabouts. This happy ftep pro-
ved cur deliverance; for, next morning, there came
to the bay of Tonquin two Dutch fhips, and a third
without any colours; and, in the evening, two Eng-
lifh fhips'fteered the fame courfe. 'J he river where
we were was but fmall, and run but a few leagues up
the country northward: the country was wild and
barbarous, and the people thieves, having no corre-
fpcndence with any other nation, dealing only in fifh,
oil, and fuch grofs commodities; and one barbarous
cuflom they ftifl retained, that when any veflH was
unhappily fhip-wrecked upon their coaft, they make
the men prifoners or flaves; fo that now we might
fairly fay we were furrounded by enemies both by fea
and land.
As the fhip had been leaky, we took the opportu-
nity, in this place, to fearch her, and to flop up the
places which let in the water. We accordingly
lightened her, and bringing our guns and other
moveable things to one fide, we eflayed to bring her
down, that we might come at her bottom: but, up-
on fecond confederation, we did not think it fafe to
let her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the
place convenient for it. The inhabitants, not ufed
to fuch a fight as to fee a fhip lie down on one Cde,
and heel in towards the fhore, not perceiving her
men, who were at work on her bottom, with ftages
and boats on the ofl-fide, prefently imagined the fhip
bad been caft away, and lay faf t on the ground.
Agreeable
Agreeable to this fuppofuion, they furrounded us
with ten or twelve large boats, with a refolution,
undoubtedly, to plunder the fhip, and to carry away
thofe they found alive for flaves to their king. But
•when they perceived our men hard at work on the
fhip's bottom and fide, wafhing, graving, and flop-
ping her, it filled them all with fuch furprife, that
they ftood gazing as though they were confounded.
Nor could we imagine what their defign was; how-
ever, for fear of danger, we handed down arms and
ammunition, to thofe at work, in order to defend
themfdvcs; and, indeed, this precaution was abfo-
]utely neceffory; for, in a quarter of an hour after,
the natives, concluding it was really a Ihipwreck,
and that we were faving our lives and goods, which
they thought belonged to them, came down upon
our men, as though it had been in a line of hmlc.
We lay at prefent but in a very unfit poflure to fight;
and before the ftages could be got down, or the men
in the boat come on board as they were ordered, the
Cochinchinefes were upon them, and two of their
boats boarding our longboat, they began to lay hold
of our men as prifoners. The firft they feized was
a ftout Englifh failor, who never fired his nuifket,
like a fool, as I imagined, but laid it down in the
boat; but he knew what he was doing; for, by main
force, he dragged the Pagan out of the boat into ours
by the two ears, and knocked his brains out againft
the boat's gunnel: a Dutchman that was next him
fnatched up the mufket, and knocked down five
more with the but-end of it; however, this was
doing- very little to their number; but a ftrange un-
exf:cted accident, which rather merits laughter than
any thing elfe, gave our men a complete victory over
them.
It feems the carpenter, who was preparing to grave
the outfide of the Ihip, as well as to pay the fcams,
where he caulked to flop the leaks, had gotten two
kctties juft let down in the boat, one filled with
A a 2 boiling
boiling pitch, and the other with rofin, tallow, oil,
and fuch fluff as the fhipwriglus ufe: the carpenter's
man had a great iron laddie with which he ufed to
fupply the workmen with hot fluff, and as two of
the enemies catered the boat where the fellow ftood,
he faluted them with a full laddie of the hot boiling
liquor, which, the poor creatures being half naked,
made them roar out, and jump into the fea. Well
done, Jack, fays tbe carpenter, give them the other
dofe: and fo ftcpping forward himfelf, takes a mop,
nnd dipping it into the pitch pot, he and his man fo
plentifully flung it among them, as that none e-
- leaped being fcahled: upon which, they all made the
beft of their way, crying.and bowling in fuch a
frightful manner, that, in all my adventures, I never
lieard the like. And, indeed, never was I better
pleafed with any conqueft than I was with this, there
being fo little bloodfhed, and having an averfion to
tilling fuch favage wretches, (more than was ne-
cefiary), as knowing they came on errands, which
their laws and cufboms made them think were juft
-nnd equitable. By this time, all things being in or-
iler, and the fhip fjvimming, they found their mi-
flake, fo they did not venture a fecond attack. Thus
ended our merry fight;'and, having got fome rice,
bread, roots, and fixteen good hogs, on board the
day before, we fet faif, not daring to go into ths bay
of Tonquin, but fleered N. E. towards the ifle of
Formofa, or as though we would go to the Manillas,
or Philippine iflands, for fear of meeting with any
European fhips. When we anchored at the ifle For-
mofa, the inhabitants, not only courteoufly fupplied us
•with provifions and frefh water, but dealt very fairly
and honeflly with us in their bargains nnd agree-
ments. From this place we fleered north, keeping
ftill off the coafl of China, till we were beyond all
its ports where European flaps ufually come; and, at
length, being come to the latitude of thirty degrees,
we refolved to put into the firft trading port we
fhould
fhould come at; and ftanding for the fliore, n boat
came off two leagues to us with an old Portuguefe
pilot on board, who offered his fervice; we very
gladly accepted him, and fent the boat back again.
And now, having the old man on board, 1 talked to-,
him of going to Nanquin, the moft northward part
of the coaft of China. What will you do there?
faid he, fmiling. I told Mm we would fell our car-
go, and purchafe callicoes, raw and wrought filks,
tea, &c. and fo return the fame way back. O, faid
he, you had better put in at Macao, where you may
buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin, and fell
your opium at a greater advance. But, faid I, we are
gentlemen as well as merchants, and defign to fee
the great city of Pekin, and the magnificent court of
the monarch of China. Why then, faid he, you
fhould go to Ningpo, where there is a navigable river
that goes through the heart of that vaft empire, two
hundred and fevcnty leagues from the fea, which
erofles all the rivers, pafles confiderable hills, by the
help of the fluices and gates, and goes even up to the
city of Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you pleafe,
and travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch fhip juft be-
fore bound that way. At the name of a Dutch or
Engliflv fhip, I was ftruck with confufion; they being
as great a terror to me in this veffel, as an Algtrine
man of war is to them in the Mediterranean. The
old man finding me troubled, Sir, faid he, I hope the
Dutch are not now at war with your nation: No,
faid I, but God knows what liberty they may take
•when out of the reach of the law. Why, fays he,
what occafion is there for peaceable merchants to
fear? For, believe me, they never meddle with any
but PIRATES.
At the mentioning of the word pirates, my coun-
tenance turned to that of fcarlet; nor was it poffiDie
for me to conceal it from the old pilot; who taking
notice of it, Sir, faid he, take -what courfe you pkafe,
I'll do you all the fervice I can. Seignior, faid I, I
A a 3 am
am a little concerned at your mentioning pirates, I
hope there are none fuch in thefe Teas, becaufe you
Jee in what a weak condition we are to defend our-
ielves. 0, Sir, faid he, if that's all, don't be concern-
ed, 1 don t remember one in thefe feas thefe fifteen
years, except about a month ago one -was feen in the lay
of biam, butjbe is gene to the fouthward; neither-was
Jbe built for a privateer, but -was run away -with by
a reprobate captain, and fame of his men, the ri"ht
captain having been murdered by the Malayans.
What! faid I, (as though ignorant of what had
happened) did they kill the captain? Aro, faid he, it
ts generally thought the Malayans murdered him; but
•perhaps they might procure them to do it, and therefore
theyjuflly deferve hanging. The rogues -were lately dif-
covered in the bay of Siam, in the river of Cambodia,
by Jome Dutchmen -who belonged to thejhip, and had
much ads to efcape the Jive boats that purfued them,
but they have all given fuch an exafl defcription of
the Jl,ip, that -where-ever they find her, they will be
jure to know her; and they have folemnlyfwore to give
110 quarter to the captain or thejeamen, hit hang them
every one up at the yard arm, -without any formal bu-
fwefs of bringing them to a court tfjudicature.
Being fenfible, that, having the old man on
board, he was incapable of doing me any mifchief,
Well, Seignior, faid I, it is for this very reafon I
would have you carry us up to Nanquin, where nei-
ther Englifh nor Dutch fhips come: and I muft tell
you, their captains are a parcel of rafh, proud,' info,
lent rafcals, that neither know what belongs to
juftice, nor how to behnve themfelves as the laws of
God or nature direct; fellows that would prove mur-
derers to punifh robbers, and take upon them to
adjudge innocent men to death, without any proof
to prove them guilty; but perhaps I may live to call
them to account for it, in a place where they may
be taught how juftice is to be executed. And fo
I told him all the ftory of buying the fhip, and how
we
•we were faved by the means of two men: that the
murder of the captain by the Malayans, as alfo the
running away with the fliip, I believed to be true ,
but that we, who bought it, were turned pirates,
•was a mere fiction, to cover their cowardice and
foolifh behaviour, when they attacked us, and the
blood of thofe men we killed in our own juft de-
fence, lay to their door, who fent to attack us by
furprife.
Sir, faid the old man amazed, you have taken the
right courfe tofteer to the north, and, if I might advifc
you, I -would have you fell ycurJLip in China, and buy
or build another in that country; and I'll procure people
to buy the one and fell the other. Well but, Seignior,
faid I, if I fell the fhip in this manner, I may bring
fome innocent perfons into the fame danger as I have
gone through, perhaps worfe, even death itfelf, where-
•by I fhould be as guilty of their murder as villanous
executioners. Tbfit need not trouble you, fays the old
man; I'itfind a way to prevent that sforthefe coyimand-
ers you talk of 1 know very -well, and will inform them
rightly of the matter as you have related, and lamper-
fuaded they will not only believe me, but afl more cau-
tioujlyfor the future. And will you deliver one meflage
from me to them? Yes, faid he, if you -will give it un-
der your hand, that I may prove it is nit of my own pro-
duflion. Hereupon I wrote a large account of their
attacking me in their longboat, the pretended reafon
and unjuft defign of it; that they had done what they
might be afliamed of, and could notanfwer for at any
tribunal in England. But this letter was writ in vain.
Providence ordered things another way. We failed
tlire£Uy for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days
fail, came to an anchor at the foutri weft point of the
great gulph of that place, where we learned, that two
Dutch fhips were gone the length before us, and that
we fhould certainly fall into their hands. We were
all at a great lofs in this exigency, and would very
gladly have been on fhore almoft any where; but our
old
old pilot told me, that if I would fail to the fbutrr-
\vard about two and forty leagues, there was a little
port called Quinchange, where no European fhips e-
ver came, and where we might confider what was fur-
ther to be done. Accordingly, we weighed anchor
the next day, calling only twice on fhore by the way
to g°t frefh water. The country people very cour-
teoufly fold us roots, tea, rice, fowls, and other pro-
vrfions. After five days fail we came to the port, and
landed with unfpeakable joy. We refolved todifpofe
of ourfelvcs and effefts in any other way poffible, than
enter on board that ill-fated veflel more; for no ftate
can be more miferable than a continued fear, which
is a lite of death, a confoundcr of our underftandings,
that fets the imagination at work to form a thoufand
frightful things that may never happen. And we
fcarce flept one night, without dreaming of halters,
yard-arms, or gibbets; of fighting, being taken, and
being killed; nay fo violent were'our apprehenfions,
th.it we would bruife our hands and heads again ft the
fides of the cabin, as though a£tually engaged. The
ftory ot" the Dutch cruelty at Amboyna often came in-
to our thoughts when awake; and, for my part, I
thought my condition very hard, that, after fo many
difficulties, and fuch fignal deliverances, I fhould be
hanged in my old age, though innocent of any crime
that deferved fuch punifhment; but then religion
would feem to reprefent to me, as though the voice
of it had faid, Confider, O man! what fins you have
been formerly guilty of, which now thou art called
to an account for, to expiate with thy blood! And
as to thy innocence, what art thou more innocent
than thy blefled Redeemer Jefus Chrift, who fuffered
for thy offences, and to whofe providence you ought
to fubmit, let what will happen? After this natural
courage would infpirs me to refift to the laft drop of
blood, and fooner die than fuffer myfelf to be taken
by boorifh, rafcalty Dutchmen, who had arts to tor-
ment beyond death itfelf.
But
But now, thank kind Heaven, being afhore, our
old pilot procured us a lodging and a warehoufe for
our goods; it was a little hut with a large warehoufe
joining to it, all built with canes, and pallifadoed
round with large ones, to keep out pilfering thieves,
which are very numerous in that country. The ma-
giftrates allowed us a little guard during the night,
and we employed a centinel with a kind of halbert for
three pence a day. The fair or mart, we found, had
been over for fome time; however, there remained
in the river four junks and two Japan fhips, the mer-
chants of the latter being on fhore. In the firft place,
our old pilot brought us acquainted with the miffion-
ary Pvoman priefts, who were converting the people
to Chriftianity: two of them were referved, rigid,
and auftere, applying themfelves to the work they
came about with great earneftnefs; but the third,
who was a Frenchman, called father Simon, was of a
freer converfation, not fecmingly fo ferious and grave,
yet no worfe Chriftian than the other two, one of
whom -was a Portuguefe, and the other a Genoefe.
Father Simon, it feems, was appointed to go to Pekin,
the royal feat of the Emperor of the Chinefe; and he
only waited for another prieft, who was ordered from
Macao to accompany him. We never met together,
but he was prompting me to keep him company in
that journey: Sir, faid he, 1 will fhew you the glo-
rious things of this mighty empire, and a city, the ci-
ty of Pekin, far exceeding London or Paris, put them
both together. One day in particular, being at din-
ner with him, I fl-iewed fome inclination to go; which
made him prefs the more upon me and my partner,
to gain our perfect confent. But, fathsr Simon, faid
my partner, whatfatisfaction can you have in our com-
pany, whom you ejleem as heretics, and confequently ob~
jetls not -worthy your regard? Oh! faid he, you may
be as good Catholics in time as thofe I hope to con-
vert to our religion. And fo, faid I, toe Jball have
you preaching to us all the way, i\iftcad of fkafing us
id Ith
•with a. defcription of the country. Sir, faid he, how-
ever our religion may be vilified by fome people, it
is very certain it neither divefts us of good manners
or Chriftian charity; and as we are gentlemen, as
fuch we may converfe together, without making one
another uneafy.
But we fhall leave him a while, to confider our
fliip and the merchandife which we had to difpofe of.
There was but very little trade in the place where we
were; and I was once rcfolved to venture to fail to
the river Kilam, and fo to the city of Nanquin: but
Providence ordered it otherwife, by our old pilot's
bringing a Japan merchant to us, to fee what goods
we had. He immediately bought our opium, for
•which he gave us a very good price in gold by weight,
fome wedges of which were about ten or eleven oun-
ces. It came into my head, that perhaps he might
buy the Qiip too; and I ordered his interpreter to
propofe it to him. He faid nothing then, but fhrunk
up his fhoulders; yet in a few days after he came ac-
companied by a miffionary prieft, who was his inter-
preter, with this propofal, That as he had bought a
great quantity of our goods, he had not money enough
topurch.ife ourjbip; but if Ipleafed, he would hire her,
•with all my men, te go to Japan, and from thence with
another loading to /^'Philippine i/lands, the freight of
both which he would verywi/linglf pay to us before; and
ut their return to Japan, would buy the Jhip. Upon
this we alked the captain and his men, if they were
•willing to go to Japan; te which they unanimoufty
agreed. While this was in agitation, the young man
my nephew left to attend me, told me, That as I did
not care to accept this proffef} of advantage, he would
manage it for me as I p leafed, and render me a faith-
ful account of his fuccefs, which Jhould be wholly mine.
Indeed I was very unwilling to part with him; but
confidering it might be for the young man's good, I
difcourfed my partner about it, who, of his own ge-
nerofity, gave him his fhare of the veflel, fo that I
could.
could do no otherwife than give him mine$ but, how-
ever, we let him have but the property of half of it,
and preferved a power, that when we met in England^
if he had obtained fuccefs, he fhould account to us
for one half of the profits of the fhip's freight, and
the other fhould be his own. Thus having taken a
writing under his hand, away he failed to Japan,
where the merchant dealt very honeftly by him, got
him a licence to come on fhore, fent him loaded to
the Philippines with a Japanefe fupercargo, from
whence he came back again loaded with European
goods, cloves, and other fpiceries. By this voyage he
cleared aconfiderable fom of money, which determi-
ned him not to fell his fhip, but to trade on his own
account: fo he returned to the Manillas, where, get-
ting acquaintance, he made his fhip free, was hired
by the governor privately to go to Acapulco in Ame-
rica, on the,Mexican coaft, with a licence to travel to
the great city of Mexico. This traffic turned out
greatly to account, and my friend finding means to
get to Jamaica, returned nine years after exceeding
rich into England. fe
In parting with the (hip, it conies in courfe to con-
Cder of thofe men who had faved our lires when in
the river of Cambodia : and though, by the way they
were a couple of rogues, who thought to turn pirates
themfelves, yet we paid them what they had before
demanded, and gave each of them a fmall fum of mo-
ney, making the Englifhman a gunner, and the
Dutchman a boatfwain, with which they were verv
well contented. } "i.' *
We were now above icoo leagues farther from
home, than when at Bengal. All the comfort we could
expett was, that there being another fair to be kept
in a month's time, we might not only purchase all
forts of that country's manufaaures, but very poffiblv
find fome Chmefe junks, or veflels from Tonquin, to
be fold, which would carry us and our goods where-
foever we pleafed. Upon thefe hopes, we refolved to
continue;
continue; and, to divert ourfelves, we took feveral
little journies in the country. About ten days after
we parted with our fhip, we travelled to fee the city
of Nanquin. This city lies in latitude 30 deg. north
of the line; it is regularly built, and the ftreets are
exactly ftraighr, and crofs one another in direct lines,
which fets it out to the greateft advantage. At our
return, we found the prieft was come from Macao that
was to accompany father Simon to Pekin. That fa-
ther earneftly folicited me to accompany him, and I
referred him to my partner. In fhort, we both agreed,
and prepared accordingly; and we were fo lucky as to
have liberty to travel among the retinue of one of
their Mandarins, who is a principal magiftrate, and
much reverenced by the people.
We were five and twenty days travelling through
this miferable country, infinitely populous, but as in-
differently cultivated ; and yet their pride is infinitely
greater than their poverty, infomuch that the priefts
themfelves derided them. As we paffed by the houfe
of one of their country gentlemen, two leagues off of
Nanquin, we had the honour, forfooth, to ride with
the Chinefe fquire about two miles. Never was Don
Quixote fo exactly imitated ! Never fuch a compound
of pomp and poverty feen before!
His habit, made of callico, was dirty, greafy, and
very proper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch, with
all its tawdry trappings, as hanging fleeves, taffels,
&c, though torn and rent in almoft every part: his
veft underneath it was no lefs dirty, but more greafy,
refembling the moft exquifite floven, or greafy but-
cher. His horfe (worfe than Rofinante, or the famous
fteed of doughty Hudibras) was a poor ftarved, de-
crepit thing, that would not fell for thirty (hillings
in England: and yet this piece of worfhipful pomp
was attended with ten or twelve flaves, who guarded
their mafter to his country-feat. We ftopped at a
little village for refrefhment; and when we came by
the country-feat of this great man, we found him fit-
ting
ting under a tree before his door, eating a mefs of
boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in the middle,
and a bag filled with green pepper "ay him, and ano-
ther plant like ginger, together with a piece of lean
mutton in it: this was his Worfhip's repaft; but
pray obferve the ftate of the fool! two women flaves
brought him his food, which being laid before him,
two others appeared to perform their refpe&ive offi-
ces; one fed him with alpoon, while the other fcra-
ped off what fell upon his beard and taffety velr, aad
gave it to a particular favourite to eat. And thus we
left the wretch pleafed with the conceit of our admi-
ring his magnificence, which rather merited our fcom
and deteftation.
At length we arrived nt the great city of Pekin, ac-
companied by two fervants, and the old Portuguefe
pilot, whofe charges we bore, and who ferved us as
zn interpreter by the way. We had fcarce been a
week at Pekin, but he comes laughing to us, 4h!
Seignior Inglife, faid he, tne famething tell you make
your heart glad, but make meforry; for you bring me
here 25 days journey, and now you liuive me go back
alone: and -which way jhall 1 make mv port after,
•without de Jbip, without tie harfff, -withunt pecune?
fo he called money in his broken Latin. He then in-
formed me, that there was a great caravan of Mufco-
vitc and Poliih merchants in the city, who were pre-
-paring to fet out for Mufcovy by land within fix
•weeks; and, that he was certain we would take this
opportunity, and confequently that he muft go home
by himfelf. Indeed this news infinitely furprifed and
pleafed me. Are you certain of this? faid I. Tes,
Sir, faid he, me fare it's true. And fo he told me,
that having met un old acquaintance of his, an Arme-
nian, in thejlreet, -who was among th?m, and -iibo
had coma from Aftracan, with a defign to gs to Ton-
quin, but for certain reafous having altered his r-fi-
lution, he -was now refolved to go with the caravan,
and to return by the river Wolga to Aftracan. Well,
Seignior, faid I, don't be difcontented about your re-
B b turning
turning alone; and, if by this means I can find apaflage
to England, it will be your own fault if you return to
Macao at all. And fo confulting with my partner,
what was beft to be done, he referred it to me as I
pleafed, having our affairs fo well fettled at Bengal,
that, if we could convert the good voyage we had made
in China filks, wrought or raw, he would be fatkfied to
go to England, and fo return to Bengal in the Compa-
ny's fhips. Thus refolved, we agreed, that, if our pi-
lot would go with us, we would bear his charges either
to Mufcow or England; and to give him in a prefent
the fum of 170 pounds Sterling. Hereupon we cal-
led him in, and told him the caufe of his complaint
fhould be removed, if he would accompany us with
the caravan; and, therefore, we defired to know his
mind. At this he fhook his head, Great long jour-
ney, faid he, me no pecune, carry me to Mufcow, or
keep me there. But we foon put him out of that
concern, by making him fenfible of what we would
give him here to lay out to the beft advantage; and,
as for his charges, we would fet him fafe on fhore,
God willing, either in Mufcovy, or England, as he
pleafed, at our own charge, except the carriage of his
goods. At this propofal, he was like a man tranfport-
ed, telling us, he would go with us all the world o-
ver; and we made preparations for our journey; but
it was near four months before all the merchants were
ready.
In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went
exprefs to tlie port where we firft put in, to difpofe of
•what goods had been left there, while I accompanied
a Chinefe merchant, who was going to Nanquin, and
there bought 29 pieces of damaik, with about 300
more of other fine filks ; and, by the time my partner
returned to Pekin, I had them all carried thither : our
cargo in filks amounted to 4500 1. Sterling, which,
together with tea, fine calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves,
loaded 18 camels for our fhare, befides what we rode
upon, with two or three fpare horfes, and two more
loaden with provifions: the company now was very
great,
great, making about 400 horfe, and above 120 men,
well armed and provided. We were of feveral nations,
among whom were five Scots merchants inhabiting
in Mufcow, and well experienced in trade.
We fet out from Pekin the beginning of February
our fkyle; and in two days more, we pafled through
the gate of the great China wall, which was creeled
as a fortification againfl the Tartars, being 100 Eng-
lifh miles long. We then entered a country not near
fo populous, chiefly under the power of plundering
Tartars, feveral companies of whom we perceived rid-
ing on poor ftarved horfes, contemptible as themfelves,
without order or difcipline. One time our leader for
the day gave us leave to go a-hunting. But what do
you think we hunted? only a parcel cf iheep, which
indeed exceeded any in the world for wildnefs and
fwiftnefs; but while we were purfuing this game, it
was oar chance to meet with about forty Tartars, who
no fooner perceived us, but one of them blew a horn,
at the found of which there foon appeared a rroop of
forty or fifty more, at about a mile's diftance. flfro
upon, one of the Scots merchants (who knew their
ways) ordered us to advance towards them, and attack
them immediately. As we advanced, they let fly a
volley of arrows, which happily fell a little fliort of us:'
this made us halt a little, to return the compliment
with bullets; and then being led up by the bold Scot,
we fired our piftols in their faces, and drew out Cur
fvvords; but there was no occafion; for they flevylike
timorous fheep, and only three of them remained,
beckoningto the reft tocomebaek. But our braveccm-
rnander gallops up to them by himfelf, fhot one dead,
knocks another offhis horfe, while the third ran away:
and thus ended our battle with the Tartars.
We travelled a month more through the Emperor
of China's dominions; and at length coming to one of
their towns about a day and a half's journey from the
city of Naum, I wanted to buy a camel. 1 he perfon I
fpoke to would have brought me one, but, like a fool,
1 muft go along with him, about two miles from the

village. My okl pilot and I walked on foot, forfopth,
for fome'variety, when coming to the' place where the
camels were kept as in a park guarded by Chinefe fol-
iliers, we there agreed and bought one, which the
Chinefe man that came with me led along the road.
But we had not gone far, before we were attacked by
Jive Tartars, mounted on horfeback, two of whom
feized the man, took the camel from him, and rode
away, while the other three approached us, the firft
of whom fuddenly feized me as I was drawing my
fwonl, the fccond knocked me down; but my old
trufty Portuguefe, taking a piftol out of his pocket,
which I knew nothing of, and coming up to the fel-
low that ftruck me, he with one hand pulled him off
his horfe, and then mot him dead upon the fpot; then
taking his fcymitar, he ftruck at the man that ftopt us,
but milling him, cut off one of his horfe's ears, the
pain of which rrudc him throw his rider to the ground.
The poor Chinefe, who had led the camel, feeing the
Tartar down, runs to him, and feizing upon his pole-
axe, wrenched it from his hands, and knocked his
brains oat. But there was anotherTartar to deal with,
who keming neiiher inclined to fight nor fly, and
my okl man having begun to charge his piftol, the
verytfight of it ftruck fuch a terror into the wretc'i,
that away he fcoured, leaving my old pilot, rather my
champion and defender, an abftlute vitlory.
By this time being awakened from rny trance, I be-
gan to open my eyes, wondering where I was, having
quite forgot all that pafled; but my fenfes returning,
and feeling a great pain in my head, and feeing the
blood was running over my clothes, 1 inftantly jump-
ed upon my feet, and grafped my fword in my hand,
with a refolution to take revenge; but no enemies now
remained, except the dead Tartar, with his horfe
Handing by him. The old man feeing me recovered,
whom he thought flain, ran towards me, and embra-
ced me with the greateft tendernefs, at the fame time
examining into my wound, which was far from being

manded payment for bis camel, which I refuting, we
brought the caufe before a Chinefe judge, who acted
with great impartiality: Having heard both fides, he
afked the Chinefe man that went with me, whofe fer-
vant he was? Sir, faid he, I am nobody's, but went
with the ftranger at his requeft: why then, faid the
judge, you were the ftranger's fervant for the time, and
the camel being delivered to his fervant, it is the fame
as though delivered to himfelf, and accordingly he
muf t pay for it. Indeed, the cafe was fo fairly ftated,
that I had nothing to object to it; fo, haying paid for
that I was robbed of, I fent for another, but did net
go myfelf to fetch it, as I had enough of that fport be-
fore.
The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinefe em-
pire, fo fortified, as fome will tell you, that millions
of Tartars cannot batter down their wall.;; by which
certainly one might think one of our cannons would
do more execution than all their legions.
When we were within a day's march of that city,
we had information that the governor had fent meC-
fengers to every part of the road, to inform the tra-
vellers and caravans to halt, till a guard was fent to
protect thtm from the numerous bodies of Tartars that
lately appeared about the city. This news put us in-
to great conflernation; but, obeying the orders, we
ftopt; and, two days after, there tame two hundred
foldiers from a garriibn of the Chinefe, and three him.-
.dred more from Naum: thus guarded both in trre.
front and rear, with our own men on the flanks, we
boldly advanced, thinking we were able to combat
with ten thoufand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared. .*
Early next morning, in our march from a little
well fituated town called Changu, after having paffed
a river, and entered upon a defert of about 15 cr 16
miles over, we foon beheld, by a cloud of duft that
was railed, that the enemy was approaching. -This .
much difpirited the Chinefe. My old pilot took no-
tice of it, and called out, Seignior Ingiefe, thofe fcL-
lows muft be encouraged, cr they will ruin us all:
B b 3 '- aiul

and I am afraid, if the Tartars attack us, they will all
'"unaway. Why, Seignior, faid I, what fhall be done
in this cafe? Don?, fays he, why, let fifty of our men
advance, and flank them on each wing. I know the
fellows will fight well enough in company. We ac-
cordingly took his advice, and marched, fifty to the
right wing, and the fame number to the left, anct
•with the reft made a line of referve, leaving the lafb
two hundred- men to guard the camels, or to affift us
as occafion required.
Thus prepared, a party of the enemy came forward,.
viewing our pofhire, and traverfing the ground on the
front of our line. Hereupon-, we ordered the two-
wings to mo-ve on, ami give them a falute with their
fhot; which accordingly was done. This put a flop
to their proceedings; for immediately wheeling off to
their left, they all marched away, and we faw no
more of them. They had undoubtedly given- an ac-
count to their companions of what reception they
might expect, which made them fo eafity give over
their enterprise.
When we came to the city of Nauru,, we returned^
the governor hearty thanks, and difperfed a hundred
crowns among the foldiers that guarded us. We reli-
ed there one day, and then proceeded on our travels,
»J>aff;ng feveral great rivers and deferts; and on the
j3th of April,- we came to the frontiers of Mufeovy,,
the firft town of which was called Argun*
This happy oecafion,. as I thought, of coming in*- •
to a Chriftiaii country, made me congratulate the
SScots merchant upon it. He fmiled at that, telling;
me not to rejoice too foon; for, fafd he, except the
Ruffian foldiers in garrifon, and a few inhabitants of
the cities upon the road, all the reft of this country,
for above a thoafand miles, is inhabited by the molt
ignorant and barbarous Pagans.
We advanced from the river Arguna, by moderate
journeys, and found convenient garrifons on the roadr
filled with ChrilHan foldiers, for the feeurityof com-
merce, and for the convenient lodgings of travellers;
buc
but the inhabitants of the country were mere Pagans,
•worfhipping the fun, moon, and ftars. We particu-
larly obferved this idolatry near the river Arguna, at
a city inhabited by Tartars and Ruffians, called Neri-
finkey. Being curious to fee their way of Irving,
while the caravan continued to reft themfelves in that
city, I went to one of their villages, -where there was
to be one of their folemn facrifkes. There 1 beheld,
upon the flump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more
ugly than the reprefentation of the devil himfelf: its.
head refembled no living creature; its ears were as
big and as high as goats horns, a crooked nofe, four
cornered mouth, and horrible teeth: it was clothed
in fheeps fkins, had a great Tartar bonnet, with tw&
horns growing through it, and was eight feet high,
•without feet, legs, or proportion. Before this idol
there lay 16 or 17 people, who brought their offerings,
and were making their prayers, while at a diftanca
flood three men, and one bullock, as victims to this
ugly monfter.
Such ftupendous facrifege as this, in robbing the-
true God of bis honour, filled me with tha greateft
aftonifhment and reflection; which foon turning to
rage and fury, I rode up to the image, and cut in
pieces the bonnet that was upon his head with my
fword, fo that it hung down by one of the horns,
while one of my men that was with me, pulled- at it
by his fheep's flcin garment. Immediately an hideous-
howling and outcry ran through the village, and two
or three hundred people coming about our ears, we
were obliged to fly for it.
But I had not done with the monfter; for the ca-
ravan being to reft tbree nights in the town, I told
the Scots merchant what I had'feen, and that 1 was
refolved to take four or five men weU armed with me,
in order to deltroy the idol, and fhew the people how
little reafon they had to truft in a God who could not
fave himfelf, At fkft he laughed at me, reprefenting
the danger of it, and when it was deftroyed, what
time had we to preach to them better things, whofe
zeal
zeal and ignorance was in the higheft degree, and
both unparallelled ? that if I fhould be taken by them,
I fhould be ferved as a poor ruffian, who contemned
their worlhip; that if, to be ftripped naked, and tied
to the top of the idol, there fhot at with arrows till
my body was full of them, and then burnt as a facri-
fice to the monfter: but, Sir, faid he, fince your
zeal carries you fo fir, rather than you fhould be alone
I will accompany you, and bring a flout fellow equal
to yourfelf, if you will, to affift you in this defign:
and accordingly he brought one captain Richardfon,
who, hearing the ftory, readily confented; but my
partner declined it, V:ing altogether out of his way:
and fo we three, and my man-fervant, refolved to ex-
ecute this exploit about midnight; but, upon fecond
thoughts, we deferred it to the next night, by reafoa
that the caravan being to go from thence next morn-
ing, we fhould be out of the governor's power. The
better to effectuate my defign, I procured a Tartar's
fheep fkin robe, a bonnet, with bow and arrows, and
every one of us got the like habits. The firft night
we fpent in mixing combuftible matter with aqua vi-
tx, gun-pounder, £c. having a good quantity of tar in
a little pot: next night we came up to the idol about
eleven o'clock, the moon being up. We found none
guarding it; but we perceived a light in the houfe,
where \ve had fecn the priefts before. One of our men
was for firing the hut, another for killing the people,
and a third for making them prifoners, while the idol
was (kftroyed. We agreed to the latter; fo knock-
ing at the door, we feized the firft that opened it, and
flopping his mouth, and tying his feet, we left him.
•We ferved the other two in the like manner; and then
the Scots merchant fet fire to the competition, which
frightened them fo much, that we brought them all
away prifoners to their wooden god. There we felt
to work with him, daubing him all over \vith tar
mixed with tallow and brimilone, flopping his eyes,
'ears, and mouth full of gun powder, with a great
piece of wild-fire in his bonnet, and.environed it with
dry
dry forage. All this being done, we unloofed and
ungagged the prifoners, and fet the idol on fire, which
the gunpowder blowing up, the fhape of it was de-
formed, rent, and fplit, which the forage utterly con-
fumed; for we ilaid to fee its deftruction, left the ig-
norant idolatrous people fhould have thrown themfelves
into the flame. And thus we came away undifcovered,
in the morning appearing as bufy among our fellow-
travellers, as nobody, could have fufpected any other,
but that we had been in our beds all night.
Next morning we fet out, and had gone but a fmall
diflance from the city, when there came a multitude
of the people of the country to the gates- of the city,
demanding fatisfaction of the Ruffian governor for in-
fulting their priefts, and burning their great Cham Chi-
Thaungu, who dwelt in the fun, and no mortal would
violate his image, but fome Chriflian mifcreants; and
being atready no lefs than thirty thoufand ftrong, they
announced war againft him and all bis Chriftians.
The governor afiured them he was ignorant of the
matter, and that none of his garrifon had been abroad;
that indeed there was a caravan that went away that
morning, and that he would fend after them to en-
quire into it; and whoever were the offenders, fhould
be delivered into their hands. This fatisfied them for
the prefent, but the governor fent to inform us, that
if any of us had done it, we fhould make all the hafte
away poffihle, while he kept them in play as long as
he could. Upon this we marched two days and two
nights, flopping but very little, till at laft we arrived
at a village called Plothus, and hafted to Jarawena,
another of the Czar's colcvues. On the third day,
having entered the defert, and pafled the lake called
Shaks Ufer, we beheld a numerous body of horfe on
the other fide of it to the north, whofuppofed we had
pafled on that fide of the lake; but having either found
their miftake, or being certainly informed of the way
•we took, they came upon us towards the dufk of the
evening, juft as we had pitched our camp between
two little but very thick woods, with a little rivec
running
running before our front, and fome felled trees with
which we covered our rear; a precaution we always
took, and which we had juft finiflied, when the ene-
my came up. They did not fall on us immediately,
but lent three meflengers, demanding the men who
had infulted their priefts, and burnt their god Cham
Cbi'Tkaungu, that they might be burnt with fire, that
if this was complied with, they would peaceably de-
part; but if not, they would deftroy one and all of us.
Our men ftared at one another on receipt of this mef-
fage, but Nobody was the word, as indeed nobody
knew it, but he who did it. Upon which the leader
of the caravan returned for anfwer, That they were
peaceable merchants, who meddled with none of
their priefts and gods; and therefore defired them
not to diflurb us, and put us to the neceffity of defend-
ing ourfelves. But fo far was this from fatisfying them,
that the next morning, coming to our right, they l^t
fly a volley of arrows among us, which happily did
not hurt any, bccaufe we Oieltered ourfelves behind
our baggage. We expected however to come to a
clofer engagement; but were happily faved by a cun-
ning fellow, a Coflack, who obtaining leave of the
leader to go out, mounts his horfe, rides dire£Uy from
our rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tartars,
as though he had been fent exprefs, and tells them a
formal ftory, that the wretches who had burnt the Cham-
Chi-Thaungu, were gone to Siheilka, with a refolu-
tion to burn the god Sbal-Ifar, belonging to the Ton-
guefes. Upon which, believing this cunning Tartar
who was fervant to our Mufcovites, away they drove
to Shiheilka, and in lefs fl'an three minutes were out
of our fight, nor did we. ever hear of them more.
When we came to the city of Jarawena, we refted
fi'/e days, and then entered into a frightful defert,
which held us twenty three days march, infefled with
feveral fmall companies of robbers, or Mogul Tartars,
who never had the courage to attack us. After we
had pafted over this deferr, we found feveral garrifons
to defend the caravans from the violence of the Tar-
^ tars.
tars. In particular, the Governor of Adinfkoy offered
us a guard of fifty men to the next ftation, if we ap-
prehended any danger. The people here retained
the fame paganifm and barbarity, only they were not
fo dangerous, being conquered by the Mufcovites.
The clothing, both of men and women, is of the
fldns of beafts, living under the ground in vaults and
caves, which have a communication with one another.
They have idols almoft in every family; befides, they
adore the fun and ftars, water and fnow; and the leaft
uncommon thing that happens in the elements, alarms
them as much as thunder and lightning does the un-
believing Jews.
Nothing remarkable occurred in our march through
this country. When we had got through the defert,
after two days farther travel, we came to Jenezoy, a
Mufcovite eity, on the great river fo called, which,
we were told, parted Europe from AOa. The inhabi-
tants here were very little better, though intermixed
with the Mufcovites; but the wonder will ceafe, when
I inform my reader of what was obferved to me, that
the Czar rather converts the Tartars with foldiers than
clergymen, and is more proud to make them faith-
ful fubjects, than good Chriftians.
From this city to the river Oby, we travelled over
a pleafant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country, for
want of good management and people, and thofe few
are moftly Pagans. This is the place where the Muf-
covite criminals are banifhed to, if they are not put
to death. The next city we came to, was the capi-
tal city of Siberia, called Tobolfki, when, having been
almoft feven months on our journey, and winter draw-
ing on apace, my partner and 1 ccnfulted about our
particular affairs, in what manner we fhould difpofe
of ourfelves. We had been told of fledges and rein
deer to carry us over the fnow in the winter feafon, the
fnow being frozen fo hard, that the fledges can run
upon the furface without any danger of going down.
.As I was bound to England, I no\v behoved either to
go with the caravan to Jeroflaw, from thence weft
to
to Narva, and the gulf of Finland, and fo by land or
fea to Denmark; or elfe I muft leave the caravan at a
little town on the Dwina, and fo to Archangel, where
I was certain of fhipping either to England, Holland,
or Hamburgh. One night I happened to get into the
company of an illuftrious but banifhed prince, whofe
company and virtues were fuch as made me propofe to
him a method how he might obtain his liberty. My
dear friend, faid he, as I am here happily free from
iny miferable grcatnefs, -with all its attendants of pride,
ambition, avarice, and luxury, if 1 Jhovld efcape from
this place, thofe pernicious feeds may again revive, to
iny lofting difquietude; therefore let me remain in a
lili'JJ'ed confinement, for 1 am but flf/b, a mete man,
•with paffions and affections as fuch; 0 be not my friend
and tempter too! Struck dumb with furprife, I flood
lilcnt a while; nor was he in lefs diforder, by which,
perceiving he wanted to give Vent to his mind, I de-
fired him to confider of it, and fo withdrew. But,
about two hours after,he came to my apartment: Dear
friend, faid he, though I cannot confent to accompany
you, IJia/l have this fatisfaclion in parting, that
you leave me an honeft man Jlill; but as a tcjiimony
of my affection to you, be pleafed to accept this prefent
of fables.
In return for his compliment, I fent my fervant
next morning to his Lordfhip, with a fniall prefent of
tea, two pieces of China damafk, and four little wed-
ges of gold; but he only accepted the tea, one piece
ofdamafk, and n piece, of gold, for the euriofity of
the Japan ftamp that was upon it. Not long after,
he fent for me, and told me, That what he had re-
fufed himfelf, he hoped, upon his account, 1 would
grant to another, whom he fliould name: In fhorr,
it was his only fun, who was about 200 miles diftance
from him, on the other fide of the Oby, whom he
laid he would fend for, if I gave my confent. This I
loon complied with; upon which he fent his fervants
next day for his Ion, who returned in twenty days
time, bringing feveu horfcs loaded with valuable furs.
At
At nighr, the young lord was conducted incognito into
our apartment, where his father prefented him to me.
. "We then concerted the beft ways for travelling, and
after having bought a confiderable quantity of fables,
black fox-fkins, fine ermines, &c. (which I fold ac
Archangel at a good price), we fet out from this city
the beginning of June, making a fmall caravan, being
about thirty two horfes and camels, of which I repre-
fented the head. My young lord had with him a ve-
ry faithful Siberian fervant, well acquainted with the
roads: we fhunned the principal towns and cities, as
Tirmen, Soli-Kamofkoi, and feveral others, by rea-
fon of their ftrictncfs in examining travellers, kit any
of the banifhed perfons of diftimStion fhould efcape,
Having patted the river Kama, we came to a city oii
the European fide, called Soloy Kamofkoi, where we
found the people moftly Pagans, as before. We then
pafied a defart of about two hundred miles over ; but
in other places, it is near feven hundred. In paffing
this wild place, we were befet by a troop of men on
horfeback, and about five and forty men armed with
bows and arrows. At firft they looked earneftly on
us, and then placed therr.felves in our way. We were
above fixteen men, and drew up a little line before
our camels. My young lord fent out his Siberian fer-.
vant, to know who they were; but, when he approach-
ed them, he neither knew a word they faid, nor would
they admit him to come near them at his peril, but
prepared to fhoot him. At his return, he told us he
believed them to be Calmuck Tartars; and that he
thought there were more of them upon the defart.
This was but a fmall comfort to us ; yet feeing a little
grove, about a quarter of a mile's diftance, we moved
to it, by the old Portuguefe pilot's advice, without
meeting with any oppofition. Here we found a mar-
fhy piece of ground, and a fpring of water running
into a little brook on one fide, which joined another
like it a little farther off, and thcfe two formed the
head of the river called Writfka. As foon as we ar-
C c rived,
rived, we went to work, cutting down great arms ofF
the trees, and laying them hanging (not quite off)
from one tree to another. In this fituation we waited
the motions of the enemy, without perceiving any ad-
.vancement they made towards us. About two hours
before night, being joined by fome others, in all a-
bout fourfcore horfe, among whom we fancied were
fome women, they came upon us with great fury. We
fired without ball, calling to them, in the Ruffian
tongue, to know their bufinefs: but they, either not
knowing, or feeming not to underfland us, came di-
rectly to the wood-fide, not confidering that we were
fo fortified, as that they could not break in. Our old
pilot, the Portuguefe, proved both our captain and en-
gineer, and defired us not to fire, till they came with-
in piftol fhot; and when he gave the word of command
then to take the fureft aim: but he did not bid us
give fire, till they were within two pikes length of us,
and then we killed fourteen of them, wounded feve-
ral, as alfo their horfes, having every one of us load-
ed our pieces with two or three bullets at leaft. So
much were they furprifed at our undauntednefs, that
they retired about an hundred roods from us. In the
mean while, we loaded our pieces again, and fallying
out, fecured four or five of their horfes, whofe riders
we found were killed, and perceived them to be Tar-
tars. About an hour after, they made another at-
tempt, to fee where they might break in; but finding
us ready to receive them, they retired.
All that night we wrought hard, in ftrengthening
our fituation, and barricading the entrances into the
woods; but, when day-light came, we had a very un-
welcome difcovery ; for, the enemy, being encouraged
by their affiftance, had fet up eleven or twelve tents
in form of a camp, about three quarters of a mile from
us. I muft confefs, I was never more concerned in
my life, giving myfelf and all that I had over for loft.
And my partner declared, that as the lofs of his goods
Avould be his ruin, before they fhould be taken from
Jam, he wculd fight to the laft drop of his blood.
As
AS we could not pretentHo force our way, we had
recourfe to a ftratagem; we kindled a large fire,
which burnt all night; and no fooner was it dark, but
we purfued our journey towards the pole, or north
ftar, and travelling all night, by fix o'clock in the
morning we came to a Ruffian village, called Kertza,
andfrom thence came to a large town named Ozonoys,
where we heard that feveral troops of Calmuck Tar-
tars had been abroad upon the defart, but that we were
paft all danger. In five days after we came to Veu-
ilima, upon the river Witzedga; from thence we came
to Lawrenfkoy, on the third of July, where, provid-
ing ourfelves with two luggage boats, and a conve-
nient bark, we embarked the feTenth, and arrived at
Archangel the eighteenth, after a year, five months,
and three days journey, including the eight months
and odd days at Tobolfki. We came from Archan-
gel the twentieth of Auguft in the fame year, and ar-
rived at Hamburgh the thirtieth of September. Here
my partner and I made a very good fale of our goods,
both thofe of China and Siberia; when dividing our
effects, my fhare came to 3475 /. 17 J. 3 d, after all
the loffes we had fuftained, and charges we had been
at. Here the young lord took his leave of me, in
order to go to the court of Vienna,, not only to feek
protection, but to correfpond with his father's friends.
After we had ftaid four months in Hamburgh, I went
from thence over land to the Hague, where embark-
ing in the packet, I arrived in London the tenth of Ja-
nuary r7O5, after ten years and nine months abfence
from England.

HOwever folitude is looked upon as a reftraint to
the pleafures of the world, in company and
converfation, yet it is a happy ftateof exemption from a

fea of trouble, an inundation of vanity and vexatior),
i>( confufionanddifappoiritment. While we enjoy our-
felvcs, neither the joy nor forrow of other men affect
i;S: we are then at liberty, wifh the voice of our foul,
to fpeak to God. By this we fhim fuch frequent tri-
vial difcourfe, as even becomes an obftruftion to vir-
tue: and how often do we find, that we had reafoii
to with we had not been in company, or faid nothing
•when we were there? for cither we offend God by
the impiety of our difcourfe, or lay ourfelves open to
the violence of defigning people by our unguarded ex-
preffions; and frequently feel the coldnefs and treach-
ery of pretended friends, when once involved in
trouble and affliction; of fuch unfaithful intimates (I
fhould fay enemies) who rather by f.ilfe'inuendces
would accumulate iniferies upon us, than honeflly af-
fift us when fuffcring under the hard hand of adver-
fity. But in a ftate of folitude, when our tongues can-
jsot be heard, except by the great Majefty of Heaven,
Low happy are we, in.the bleflcd enjoyment of con-
verfing uith our Maker! It is then we make him our
friend, which fets us above the envy and contempt of
•wicked men. When a man converfes with himfelf,
he is fure that he does net convcrfe with an enemy.
Our retreat fhould be to good company, and good
books. I mean not by folitude, that a man fhould
retire into a cell, a defart, or a monaftery: which
•would be altogether an ufclefs and unprofitable re-
itrpint: for as men are formed fo, fociety, and have
an abfolute neceffity and dependence upon one ano-
ther; fo there is a retirement of the foul, with which
it converfes in heaven, even in the midft of men;
;md indeed no man is more fit to fpeak freely, than
lie who can, without any violence to himfelf, refrain
his tongue, or keep filence altogether. As to reli-
gion, it is by this the foul gets acquainted with the
hidden myfteries of the holy writings; here flie finds
thofe flood of tears, in which good men wafli them-
felves day and night, and only makes a vifit to God,
a.nd his holy angels. In this converfation the trueft

pretended to by all perfons. In this there are feveral
degrees: to pay every man his own, is the common
law of honefty; but to do good to all mankind, is
the chancery law of honefty: and this chancery-court
is in every man's breaft, where his confcience is a lord
chancellor. Hence it is, that a mifer, though he pays
every body their own, cannot be an honeft man, when
he does not difcharge the good offices that are in-
cumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous perfon:
for, faith the prophet Ifaiah, chap, xxxii. ver. 7. 8.
The inftruments of a churl are evil: he devifeth wick-
ed devices to deftroy the poor -with lying words, even
•when the needy Jpeaketh right. But the liberal foul
devifeth 'liberal things, and by liberal things jhall he
Jland. It is certainly honefty to do every thing the
law requires; but fhould we throw every poor debt-
or in prifon till he has paid the utmoft farthing, hang
every malefactor without mercy, exact the penalty of
every bond, and the forfeiture of every indenture,
this would be downright cruelty, and not honefty:
and, it is contrary to that general rule, To do to ano-
ther, that -which you -would have done unto you. Some-
times neceftity makes an honeft man a knave; and a
rich man an honeft man, becaufe he has no occafion
to be a knave. The trial of honefty is this: Did
-.you ever want.bread, and had your neighbour's loaf
in keeping, and would ftarve rather than eat it?
Were you ever arrefted, having in your cuftody ano-
ther man's cafh, and would father go to goal, than
break it? if fo, this indeed may'be reckoned honefty.
For King Solomon tells us, That a good name is bet-
ter- than life, and is a precious ointment, and u'hich,
'C 03 , -when

Chap. .III. Of faring AFF L 1CT10 NS.
AFFLICTIONS nre common to all mankind; and,,
whether they proceed from lofles, difappointments, or
the malice of men, they often bring their advantages
along with them : for this fh-ews man the vanity and
ileceitfu'nefs of ibis life, and is an occafion cf recti-
fying our meafunes, and bringing us to a more mo-
cleft opinion of ourfelves : it tells us, how neceffary
the am fiance of divine grace is unto-us, when life itfelf
becomes a burden, and death even defireablc; but,
•when the greateft oppreffion comes upon us, ws muft
have recourfe to patience, begging of God to give us
that vir:ye; and, the more compoied, we are under a/-
iiy trouble, the more com,rnendabl2 is our wifdom,
and the larger will b.e our recompenfe. Let the pro-
vocation be -what it wjlJ, whether from a good natu-
led and conscientious, or awickc'd, pervecfe, and vex-
atious man; all this wefhould take as from the over-
ruling hand,of God, as a puni/kment for our fins..
Many times injured innocence may be abufed by falfe
Ciths, or the power of wicked, jshjous, or malicious
men ;. but \ve often find it,'lik,e the'palm, ri'fe the
'higher, th.e more it is deprefjed; while the juftice o£
God is eminently, remarkable in punifhing thofe, one.
way or other, whpdefire to endeavour, to procure the
downfal of an innocent man: nor does God fail com-
foiting an affli£ted perfoa, v'ho,,witb tears and prayers,,
iblicits the throne cf Heaven for deliverance and pro-
tection. 7?ni'WfavS, That his.fe;ul-was full cf trouble,

ly David's aflli£tions made him eminently remarkable,
;ib particularly when purfued by King Saul, and hunt--
cd as a partridge over the mountains. But one thing
uhich fl-inds by innocence, is the love of God ;. for,
\S-cre we tQ fuffer difgrace, nay, Rnjgnominious de
itfelf, what conrolf tion does our innocence procure at
our lateft con8i£l, our lafl moments!
Chap. IV. Of the immorality of ranverfation, and. the
vulgar errors of behaviour.
As converfation is a great part of human happinef%
fo it is a plegfa-nt fight to behold a fweet tempered
man, who ts always fit for it, to fee an air of humour
and pleafantnefs fit eyer upon his brow, and even
fomething angelic in his very countenance: whereas,
if we obferve a defigning man, we fhall find a mark
offinvoluntary fadnefs break in upon his joy, and a cer*
tain infurrciftion in the fouf, the natural concomitant
of profligate principles. '; ,
They err very much, who think religion, or a
ftricT;-morality, difcompofes the mind, and renders it
unfit for converfation; for, it rather infpires us to
innocent mirth, without fuch a counterfeit joy as vi-
cious men appear with; and indeed wit is as confif-
t-
ent with religion, as religion is with good manners;
nor is there any thing in the limitation of virtue and
religion that ihould abate the pleafures of this world,
buti on the contrary, rather ferves to increafe them.
On the other hand, many men, b-y their own vice
and intemperance, difqualify themfelves for converfa-
tion. 'Converfation is immoral, where the difcourfg
is indecent, immodeft, fcandalous, flanderous, and a-
bufive: How great is their folly, and how much do
they expofe themfelves, when they affront their bed
friend, even God himfel-f, who laughs at the fool when
bis fear comet h.
The great fcandal-atbeiftical and immoral difcourfe
gives to virtue, ought, methinks, to be punifhed by all
good magiftrates: make a man once ceafe to believe
a God, and he has nothing left to limit his foul.
How incongruous is it to good government, that a
man fhall he punifhed for drunkennefs, and yet have
liberty to affro:it, and even deny the Majefty of Hea-
V-en? when ifT even among men, one gives the lie to
a gentleman in company, or perhaps fpeaks an affronts
ing word, a quarrel will enfue, and a combat, and
perhaps murder be the confequence: at the leaft he
will profecute him at law with the utmoft virulence
and oppreffion..
The next thing to be refrained, is obfcene difcourfe,
•which is the language only of proficients in debauch-
ery, who never repent but in a goal or hofpital; and
whofe carcafes relifh no better than their difcourfe,
till the body becomes too nafty. for the foul to flay a-
ny longer in it.
Nor is falfe talking to be lefs avoided; for lying is
the fheep's clothing hung upon the wolf's back. It- is-
the pharifee's prayer, the whore's bufs, the hypocrite's
paint, the murderer's fmile, the thief's cloke, it is
Joab's embrace, and Judas's kifs; in a word, it is
mankind's darling fin, and the devil's diftinguifhing
character. Some add lies to lies, till it not only comes
to be improbable, but even impoifible too: others lie
for gain, to deceive, delude, and betray: and a third
lies for fport, or for fun. There are other liars, who
are perfonal and malicious; who foment differences^,
and carry tales from one houfe to another, in order to
gratify their own envious tempers, without any regard .
or reverence to truth.
Chap. V. Of the prefentjlate of religion in the -world. -
I doubt, indeed, there is much more devotion than
religion in the world, more adoration than fupplica-
tion, and more hypocrify than fincerity: and it is ve-
ry melancholy to confider, what numbers of people
there are furnifhed with the powers of reafon and gifts
of nature, and yet abandoned to the groffeft ignorance
and depravity. But it would be uncharitable for us
to imagine (as fome Papifts, abounding with too much
ill nature, the only fcandal to-religion, do) that they
will certainly be in the ftate of damnation after this
life; for how can we think it confiftent with the mer-
ty and goodnefs of an infinite Being, to damn thofe
creatures^
Creatures, when he has not furnifhed them with the
light of his gofpel? or how can fach proud, conceit-
ed, and cruel bigots, prefcribe rules to the jullice and
mercy of God?
We are told by fome people, that the great image
•which King Nebuchadnezzer fet up to be adored by
his people, held the reprefentation of the fun in its
right hand, as the principal object of adoration. But
to wave this difcourfe of Heathens, how many felf-
contradicting principles are there held among Chri«
* llians? and how do we doom one another to the de-
vil, while nil profefs to worfhip the fame Deity, and
to expect the fame falvation?
When 1 was at Portugal, there was held at that
time the court of jaftice of the inquifition. All the
criminals were carried in proceffion to thegreat church,
where eight of them were habited in gowns and caps
of canvafs, whereon the torments of hell were difplay-
ed, and they were condemned and burnt for crimes
againft the catholic faith and blefied Virgin.
I am forry to make any reflection upon ChriftianS .
but, indeed, in Italy the Roman religion feems the
moft cruel and mercenary upon earth; and a very
judicious perfon, who travelled through Italy from
Turkey, tells us, "That there is only the face and
«' outward pomp of religion there; that the church
"protects murderers and affaffins, and then delivers
"the civil magiftrates over to Satan for doing ju-
"ftice; interdicts whole kingdoms, and fliuts up the
"churches for want of paying a few ecclefiaftical
"dues, and fo puts a flop to religion for want of their
"money; that the court of Inquitition burnt two
(< men for fpeaking difhonourably of the blefled Vir-
"gin : and the mifllonaries of China tolerated the
"worfhipping the devil by their new converts: that
"Italy was the theatre, where religion was the grand
"opera; and that the Popifh clergy were no other
'' than the ftage-players."
As tG> religion in Poland, they deny Chrift to be the,
Meffiah, or that the Meffiah has come in the flejh.
And
And as to their Proteftants, they are the followers of
Ladius Socinus, who denied our Saviour's divinity;
and have no concern about the divine infpiration of
the Holy Ghoft.
In Mufcovy their churches are built of wood, and,
indeed, they have but wooden priefts, though of the
Greek church: they pray as much to St Nicholas, as-
Papifts do to the Virgin Mary, for protection in all
their difficulties or afflictions.
As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Romans
in believing confubftantiation, inftead of tranfubftan-
tiation 5 but, like them, they are much pleafed with
the external gallantry and pomp, more than the true
and real practice of it.
In France I found a world of priefts, the ftreets
every where erouded with them, and the churches full
of women; but furely never was a nation fo full of
blind guides, fo ignorant of religion, and even as
void ofmorals, as thofe people who confefs their fins
to them.
Does it not feem ftrange, that, while all men own
the Divine Being, there fhould be fo many different
opinions as to the manner of paying him obedience in
the Chriftian church? I know not what reafon to
affign for this, except it be their different capacities
and faculties.
And, indeed, upon this account, we have percei-
ved, in all Chriftian countries, what mortal feuds have
been about religion: what wars and bloodfhed have
molefted Europe, till the general pacification of the
German troubles at the treaty of Weftphalia; and,
fince thofe times, what perfecution in the fame coun-
try among the churches of the Lutherans: and fhould
I take a profpect at home, what unhappy divifions are
between Chriftians in this kingdom, about Epifcopa-
cy and Prefbytery, the church of England men and
the Diflenters; oppofmg one another like St Paul and
fit Peter, even to the face; that is, they carry on the
difpute to the utmoft extremity.
It might be a queftion, why there are fuch differen-
ces
ces in religious points, and why thefe breaches fhould
be more hot and irreconcileable ? All the anfwer I can
give to this, is, that we enquire more concerning the
truth of religion, than any other nation in the world;
and the anxious concern we have about it, makes us
jealous of every opinion, and tenacious of our own:
and this is not becaufe we are more furious and rafh
than other people ; but the truth is, we are more con
cerned about them, and being fenfible that the fcrip-
ture is the great rule of faith, the ftandard for life and
doctrine, we have recourfe to it ourfelves, without fub-
mitting to any pretended infallible judge upon earth.
There is another queftion, pertinent to the former,
and that is, What remedy can we apply to this mala
dy? And to this I muft negatively anfwer, Not to be
lefs religious, that we may differ the lefs. This is
ftriking at the very root of all religious differences;
for, certainly, were they to be carried on with a peace-
able fpirit, willing to be informed, our variety of opi-
nions would not have the name of differences; nor
fhould we feparate in communion of charity, though
we did not agree in feveral articles of religion.
Nor is there a lefs ufeful queftion to ftart, namely,
Where will our unhappy religious differences end?
To which, I hope, 1 may anfwer, In Heaven; there
all unchriftian and unbrotherly differences will find a
period; there we fhall embrace many a finner, that
here we think it a dHhonour to converfe with ; and
perceive many a heart we have broken here with cen-
fures, reproachings, and revilings, made whole again
by the balm of the fame Redeemer's blood. Here we
fhall perceive there have been other flocks than thofe of
cur fold; that thofe we have excommunicated, have
been taken into that fuperior communion: and, in a
word, that thofe contradicting notions and principles
which we thought inconfiftent with true religion, we
fhall then find reconcileable to themfelves, to one ano-
ther, and to the fountain of truth. If any man afk
me, Why our differences cannot be ended on earth? I
anfwer, Were we all thoroughly convinced, that then
they
they would be reconciled, we" would put an end to
them before; but this is impoffible to be done: for, ai
mens certain convictions of truth are not equal to one
another, or to the weight or fignificancy of fuc'i vera-
city; fo neither can a general effect of this affair be
expected on this fide of time, on this fide of the grave.
Before I conclude this chapter, I fhall beg leave to
difcourfe a little of the wonderful excellency of nega-
tive religion and negative virtue. The latter feis our,
like the pharilee, with, God, I thank thee; it is a piece
of religious pageantry, the hypocrite's hope: and, in
a word, it is pofitive vice: for it is either a maik to
deceive others, or a mi ft to deceive ourfclves. A
man tbat is clothed with negatives, thus argues: I
am not fuch a drunkard as my landlord, fuch a thief
as my tenant, fuch a fwearer as his neighbour: nei-
ther am I a cheat, an atheift, a rakifh fellow, or a high-
wayman: no! I live a fober, regular, retired life: I
am a good man, I go to church; God, I thank thee.
Now, though a man boafts of his virtue in contradic-
tion to the vices mentioned, yet a perfon had better
have them altogether, than the man himfelf; for he
is fo full of himfelf, fo perfuaded that he is good and
religious enough atready, that he has no thoughts of
any thing, except it be to pull off his hat to God Al-
mighty now and then, and thank him, that he has no
occafion for him ; and has the vanity to think that his
neighbours muft imagine well of him too.
The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is yet
intoxicated with the pride of his own worth: a good
neighbour and peace-maker in other families, but a
tyrant in his own: appears in church for a fhow, but
never falls upon his knees in his clofet; docs all.his
alms before men, to be feen of them -, eager in the du-
ties of the fecond table, but regardlefs ot the firft; ap-
pears religious, to be taken notice of by men, but
without intercourfe or communication between God
and his own foul: Pray, what is the man? or what
comfort is there of the life he lives? he is infenfible
of
of faith, repentance, and a Chriftian mortified life;
in a wurd, he is perfectly a ftranger to the effential
part of religion.
Let us for a while enter into the private and retired
part of his converfation: What notions has he of his
mif-fpent hours,and of the progrefs of time to the great
centre and gulf qf life, eternity? does he know how-
to put a right value on time, or efteern the life-blood
of his foul, as it really is, and acl in all the moments
of it, as one that muft account for them? If then you
can form an equality between what he can do, and
what he mail receive; Jefs can it be founded upon
his negative virtue, or what he has forborn to do, aml
if neither his negative nor pofitive piety can be equal
to the reward, and to the eternity that reward is to
laft for, what then is to become of the Pharifee, when
he is to Be judged by the fincerity of his repentance,
and rewarded, according to the infinite grace of God,
with a ftate of bleflednefs to an endlefs eternity?
"When the negative man converfes with the invifi-
ble world, he is filled with as much horror and dread
as Felix, when St Paul reafoned to him of temperance,
righteoufnefs, and of judgment to come: for Felix,
though a great philofopher, of great power and reve-
rence, was" a negative man, and he was made fenfible
by the apoftle, that, as a life of virtue and temperance
was its own reward, by giving a healthy body, a clear
head, and a compofed life; fo eternal happinefs muft
proceed from another fpring ; namely, the infinite un-
bounded grace of a provoked God, who having erect-
ed a righteous tribunal, Jefus Chrift would feparate
fuch as by faith and repentance he had brought home
and united to himfelf by the grace of adoption, and
on the foot of his having laid down his life as a ran-
fom for them, had appointed them to falvation, when
all the philofophy, temperance, and righteoufnefs in
the world befides had been ineffectual. And this, I fay,
it was, that made Felix, this negative man, tremble.
Chap. VI. Of lijlening t-j the voice of providence.
THE magnificent and wife king Solomon bids uscry
1> d after
after knowledge, and lift up our voice for un-^erftand-
ing; by which is meant, religious knowledge; for it
follows: Then/halt thou underftand the fear of the
Lord, and find, the knowledge of God. By which un-
doubtedly he meant, to enquire after every thing thgt
he has permitted us to know, and not to feafch into
thofe ways that are unfearchable, and are effectually
locked up from our knowledge. Now, as lijlening to
the voice of providence is my preft nt fubjecl:, I intend,
in the firft place, to write to thofe who own, i. That
there is a God, a firft great moving caufe of all things,
and eternal power, prior, and confequently fuperior
to all created power or being. 2. That this eternal
power, which is God, is the fovereign creator and go-
vernor of heaven and earth.
To avoid all needlefs diftindions, what perfons in
the Godhead exercife the creating, and what the go-
verning power, I offer that glorious text, Pfal. xxxifi.
6, where the whole Trinity is intitled to the whole
creating work: and therefore, in the next place, I
fhall lay down thefe two propofitions.
I. That the eternal God guides by his providence the
whole univerfe, which was created by his power.
II. That this providence manifejis a particular care
ever, and concern in, the governing and direfi-
ing man, the mo/l noble creature upon earth.
It is plain, that natural religion proves the firft, by
intimating the neceffity of a providence guiding and
governing the world, from the confequence of the
wifdom, juftice, prefcience, and goodnefs of the al-
mighty Creator: for otherwife it would be abfurd to
think, that God mould create a world, without any
care or providence over it, in guiding the operations
of nature, fo as to preferve the order of his creation.
Revealed religion gives us a light into the care and
concern of his providence, by the climate's being made
habitable, the creatures fubjected and made nourifh-
ing, and all vegetative life made medicinal; and all
this for the fake of man, whe is made viceroy to the
King of the earth. The fhort defcription I fhall give
of
of providence is this: That it is that operation of the
Kwer, of the wifdoni, juftice, and goodnefs of God,
which he influences, governs", and directs, not on-
ly the means, but the events of all things, which con-
cern us in. this fublunary world; the Ibvereignty of
which we ought always to reverence, obey its mo-
tions, obferve its dictates, and Jiften to its voice. The
prudent man forfeeth the evil, and hideth himfclf;
that is, as 1 take it, there is a fecret providence inti-
mates to us, that fome danger threatens, if we ftrive
not to fliun it.
The fame day that Sir John Hotham kept out Hull
againft the royal martyr King Charles I. the fame day
Sir John Hotham was put to death by the parliament
for that very action; the fame day that the King him-
felf Cgned the warrant for the execution of the Earl
of Stafford, the fame day of the month was he bar-
baroufly murdered by the blood-thirftyOliveriari crew;
arkd the fame day that King James II. came to the
cr own againft the bill of exclufion, the fame day he
•was voted abdicated by the parliament, and the throne
filled with King William and Queen Mary.
The voice of fignal deliverances from fudden dan-
gers, is not only a juft call to repentance, but a cau-
tion againft falling into the like danger; but fuch who
are utterly carelels of themfelves after, fhew a lethar-
gy of the worft nature, which feems to me to be a kind
or practical atheifm, or at leaft a living in a contempt
of Heaven, when he receives good at the hand of his
Maker, but is unconcerned from whence it comes,
or to thank the bountiful hand that gave it; neither,
when he receives evil, does it alter his manner of life,
or bring him to any ftate of humiliation.
We have a remarkable ftory of two foldiers being
condemned to death in Flanders. The general being
prevailed upon to fpare one of them, ordered them to
caft dice upon the drum-head for their lives; the firft
having thrown two fixes, the fecond fell a wringing
his hands, having fo poor a chance to .efcape: how-
ever, having thrown, he was furprifed when he alfo
D d 2 threw
threw other two fixes. The officer, appointed to fee
the execution, ordered them to throw again; they
did fo, ind each of them threw fives; at which the
foldiers that flood round, fhouted, and faid neither of
them was to die. Upon this, the officer acquainted
the council of war, who ordered them to throw a
third time, when they threw two fours; the general
being acquainted with it, fent for the men, and par-
doned them: I love, faid he, in fuch extraordinary
cafes, to liften to the voice of providence.
We read in the holy writings, how God fpeaks to
men, by appearance of angels, or by dreams and vi-
iions of the night. As God appeared to Abraham,
Lot, and Jacob; fo angels have appeared to many in
other cafes, as 10 Manoah and his wife, Zechariah, the
Virgin Mary, and to the apoflles; others have been
warned in a dream, as king Abimelech, the falfe pro-
phet Br.laam, and many others.
It is certainly a very great and noble enquiry, What
,'C fhall be after this life? for there is fcarce a doubt,
we
that there is a place referved for the reception of our
fouls after death: for if we are to be, we mull have
a where, which the fcriptures afll-rt by the examples
of Dives and Lazarus. The dodtrine of fpirits was
long believed before our Saviour's time ; for when the
difciples of the lleffed Jefus perceived our Saviour
walking on the L-a, they were much furprifed as tho'
they had feen a fpirit. Nay, in thofe ages of the world,
it was believed that fpirits intermeddled in the affairs
of mankind; and, throughout the Old Teftament, I do
not mul any thing that .in the leaft contradids it. All
the pains and labour that fome learned men have taken,
to confute the llory of the witch of Endor, and the ap-
pearance of an old man perforating Samuel, cannot
make fuch apparitions inconfiflent with nature or reli-
gion : and it is plain, that it was either a good or bad
fpirit, that prophetically told the unfortunate king what
ihould happen the next day; for, faid the fpirit, The
Lord will deliver thee into the hands of the Philiftines;
and tn-nwrro-wjhalt thou and thy fans be -with me.
Abundance
Abundance of ftrange notions poflcfled me, when
I was in the defolate ifland ; efpecially on a moonfhine
night, when every bufli feemed a man, and every tree
a man on horfeback. When I crept into the difmal
cave, where the old goat lay expiring, whofe articu-
late groans even refembled thofe of a man, how was I
furprifed! my blood chilled in my veins, a cold fwea-
ty dew fat on my forehead, my hair ftood upright,
and my joints, like Balfhazzar's knees, ftruck againft
one another. And, indeed, though I afterwards found
what it was, the remains of this furprife did not wear
off for a great while; and I had frequently returns of
thofe vapours on different occafions, and fometimes
without any occafion at all.
One night, afte* having feen feme appearance in
the air, as I had jufl lain down in my bed, one of my
feet pained me; after that came a numbnefs, lucfteed-
ed with a tingling in my blood; when on a fudden I
thought fomething alive lay upon me, from my knee
to above half my leg. Upon this I flung myfelf out
of bed where I thought the creature lay: but finding
nothing, Lord deliver me from an evilfpirit, faid I,
•what can this be? When I lighted a candle, I could
perceive no living creature in the place with me, but
the poor parrot, who being frighted, cried our, Hold
your tongue, and, What's the matter-with you? which,
words I had taught him, by faying fo to him, when, he
made fuch fcreaming noifes as I did not like. Lord,
faid I aloud, furely the devil has been here. Hold jour
tongue, fays Poll. I was then rhad at the bird, and
putting on my clothes, cried, I am terribly frighted.
What's the matter with you? fays Poll. You toad,
faid I, I'll knock your brains out. Hold your tongue,
cried he again, and fo fell a chattering, and calling
Kobinfon Crufoe, as he did before. But, after I had
compofed myfelf, and went to bed again, I began
plainly tofee it was a diflemper that alre&edhiy nerves,
and fo my terrors vanifhed at once.
How intelligences are given or received, we do not
know j nor are we ienfiblc how they are conveyed
D d 3 from
from fpirits embodied, to ours that are in life; or
on the contrary, from us to them : the latter certain
ly is done without the help of the organs, and the
fonr.er is conveyed by the underftanding, and the re-
tired faculties of the foul-
The fpirits, without the help of voices, converfe,
and the more particular difcoveries of the converfe of
fpirits, feem to me as follow; to wit, dreams, voices,
noifes, irnpulfes, hints, apprehenfions, involuntary
fadnefs, &c.
Dreams of old were the ways by whkh God himfelf
was pleafed to warn men what fervices to perform,
and what to flam. Jofeph was dire£ted of God in a
dream to go to Egypt; and fo were the wife men warn-
ed in a dream to depart into their own country ano-
ther way, to avoid the fury of Herod. I am not like
thofe who think dreams are the mere dofings of a de-
lirious head, or the relics of a day's perplexities or
pleafures; but, on the contrary, I mull beg leave to
fay, I never met with any capital mifchief in my life,
but I had fome notice of it by a dream; and, had I
not teen a thoughtlefs unbelieving creature, I might
have taken many a warning, and avoided many of the
evils 1 afterwards fell into, merely by total neglect of
thofe dreams.
I was once prefent at a difpute between a layman
and a clergyman, upon the fubject of dreams. The
firft thought no regard fhould be given unto them:
that their communication from the invifible to the
vifible world was a mere chimera; without any folid
foundation. For, i. faid he, if dreams were from
the agency of any prefcient being, the motives would
be more direct, and the difcoveries more plain; and
not by allegories and emblematic fancies, expreffing
things imperfect and obfcure. 2. Since, with the
notice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid
it, it is not likely to proceed from a fpirit, but mere-
ly fortuitous. 3, That the inconftancy of fuch no-
tices, in cafes equally important, proves they did not
proceed from any fuch agent. 4. That as cur moft
diftina
diftincl: dreams had nothing in them of any fignifi-
cancy, it would be irrational and vain to think that
they came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were
not always thus warned or fupplied with notice of
good or evil, fo all men are not alike fupplied with
them; and what reafon could we give, why one man
or one woman fhould not have the fame hints as a-
nother?
To all this the clergyman gave anfwer; i. That, as
to the fignification of dreams, and the objections a-
gainfl. them as being dark and doubtful, they are ex-
prcfled generally by hieroglyphical reprefentations,
fimilies, allufions, and figurative emblematic ways, by
which means, for want of interpretation, the thing
was not underftood, and, confequently, the evil not
fhunned. I. That we charge God foolifhly, to fay,
that he has given the notice of evil, without the power
to avoid it; for, if any one had not power to avoid the
evil, it was no notice to him; and it was want of -L
giving due heed to that notice, that men firft neglecl-
ed themfelves, and then charged the Judge of all the
earth with injuflice. 3. That we ought not to find
fault with the inconftancy of thefe notices; but rather
with our weak underftandings, by pretending dreams
were not to be regarded, and negligent when the
voice really fpoke to us for our good. It is a miftake
to fay, dreams have no import at all: we might, with
more reafon, have faid, none that we could perceive
the reafon of, owing to our blindnefs and fupine ne-
gligence, too fecure at one time, and too much a-
larmed at another; fothat the fpirit, which we might
be faid to be converfing with in a dream, was con-
llantly and equally kind and careful j but our powers
are not always in the fame flate of aclion, not equal-
ly attentive to, or retentive of the hints that were
given. And, 5. to anfwer the laft quellion, Why
people are not equally fupplied? This fecmed to be no
queftion; for Providence itfelf might have fome fhare
in the direction of it, and then that providence might
be limited by a fupcrior direction: that as to the
converts
converfe of fpirits3 he could not call it a ftated converfe;
fuch a thing there was, but why there was fo much
of it, and no more, was none of his bufinefs, and that
no fuch difcovery had ever yet been made to mankind.
Nor were we to imagine lefs of waking dreams, tran-
ces, vifions, noifes, hints, impulfes, and all the wak-
ing teftimonies of an invifible world, and of the com-
munication that there is between us and them, which
commonly entertain us with our eyes open.
One time my fancy foared on high, to fee what dif-
coveries I could make in thofe clearer regions. I found
that fuch immenfe bodies as the fun, flars, planets,
and moon, in the great circle of the lower heaven, are
far from being found in the ftudy of nature on the
furface of the earth. Here I faw many things that
we can entertain little or no notion'of, in a ilate of
common life, and the emptinefs of our notion, that
the planets are habitable worlds; that is, created like
ours, for the fubfiftence and exiftence of man and heaft,
and the prefervation of the vegetative and fenfitive
life: No, no, this is, I affure you, a world of fpirits;
for here I faw a clear demonftration of Satan being
the prince of the power of the air, keeping his court
or camp, with innumerable angels to attend him;
but his power is not fo great as we imagine, he" can
tempt us to the crime, but cannot force us to commit
it: Humanum eft peccare. Neither has the devil
power to force the world into a rebellion againft hea-
ven, though his legions are employed.among favage
nations, to fet up their mafter for a god, who make
the heathens either worfhip him in perfon, or by his
reprefentatives, idols and monfters, with the cruel fa-
crifices of human blood. Now, as to the limitations"
of the devil's power, you muft underfhand, thaf, as
there are numbers of evil fpirits employed in mifchief,
fo there are numbers of good "angels fent from the
higher and bleffed abodes to difconcert and oppofe
their meafures; and this every Chriftian, I hope, be-
lieves, when he prays to God, the father of fpirits, to
give
give his angels charge over him while he flurnbereth
and fleepeth. For if by thefe preventing powers the
devil was not retrained, the earth would be fubjected
to dearth, droughts, and famine; the air infected with
noxious fumes; and, in a word, mankind would be
utterly deftroyed, which might oblige our maker (if
I may be allowed the expreffion) to the neceffity of
a newjiai, or elfe have no more creatures to honour
and worfhip him.
As the devil never wanted infinuators, I fhall ob-
ferve, that I learned a way how to make a man dream
of what I pleafcd. For inftance, let us fuppofe one
to be found afleep; let another lay his mouth clofe to
his ear, and whifper any thing fo loftly as not to a-
wake him, the fleeping man fhall dream of what has
been fo whifpered in his ear ; nay, I can allure you,
thofe infinuating devils can do this even when we
are awake, which I call impulfes of the mind: for
from whence, but from thefe infinuators, come our
caufelefs paffions, involuntary wickednefs, or fin ful
defires? Who elfe form ideas in the mind of man
when he is sfleep, or prefent terrible or beautiful fi-
gures to his fancy? Mr Milton reprefems the devil
tempting Eve in the fliape of a toad, lying juft at her
ear, when in her bower me lay faft afleep; and brings
in,Eve telling Adam what an uneafy night's reft flie
had, and relating her dream to him. And likewife
I believe that good fpirits have the fume intercourfe
with us, in warning us againft thofe things that are
evil, and prompting us to that which is good.
Were we to have the eyes of our fouls opened,
through the eyes of our bodies, we fhould fee this ve-
ry immediate region of air which we breath in, throng-
ed with fpirits now invifible, and which otherwife
•would be the moft terrible : we mould view the fecret
tranfactions of thofe meffengers who are employed
when the parting foul takes its leave of the reluctant
body, and perhaps fee things nature would fbrink
back from with the utmoft terror and amazement.
In a word, the curtain of providence for the difpofi-
tion
tions of things here, and the curtain of judgment for
the determination of the ftate of fouls hereafter, would
\)2 alike drawn back; and what heart could fupport
here its future ftate in life, much lefs that of its fu-
ture ftate after life, even good or bad.
A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about fe-
ven miles diftant from London, a friend that came to
dine with hira, folicited him to go to the city. What,
faid the gentleman, is there any occafion for me? No,
Sir, faid the other, nothing at all, except the enjoy-
ment of your good company ; and fo gave over impor-
tuning him. Juft then a ftrong impulfe of mind ur-
ged the gentleman, -and purfued him like a voice,
•with, Co to London, Co to London. Hark ye, fays
he to his friend, is all well at London? Am I want-
ed there? Or, did you aflc me to go with you on any
particular account? Are all my family well ? Yes, in-
deed, Sir, faid he, I perceived them all very hearty;
and I did not afk you to go to London upon any parti-
cular account whatfoever, except it was for the fake of
your good company. • Again he put off his refdlution:
but ftill the impulfe fuggefted to him, Co to London;
and at length he did fo. When he came there, he
found a letter and meflenger had been there to feek
him, and to tell him of a particular bufinefs, which
was firft and lafl above a thoufand pounds to him, and
which might inevitably been loft, had he not gone to
London that night.
The obeying of feveral hints, or fecret impulfes ar-
gues great wifdom. I knew a man that was under
misfortunes, being guilty of mifdemeanors againil the
government; when, abfconding for fear of his ruin,
all his friends advifing him not to put himfelf in the
hands of the law, one morning as he awaked, he felt
a ftrong impulfe darting into his mind thus, Write a,
letter to them: and this was repeated feveral times to
his mind, and at laft he anfvvered to it, as if it had
been a voice, JVhomJball I-write to? Immediately it
replied, Write to the judge; and this impulfe purfu-
ed him for feveral days, till at length he took pen,
and
and ink, an'd paper, and fat down to write to him;
•when immediately words flowed from his pen, like
ftreams from a fair fountain, that charmed even him-
felf with hopes of fuccefs. In fhort, the letter was
fo ftrenuous in argument, fo pathetic in its eloquence,
and fo perfuafively moving, that when the judge had
read it, he font him an anfwer he might be eafy, he
would endeavour to make that matter light to him;
and, indeed, never left exerting himfelf, till he had
ftopt the profecution, and reftored him to his liberty
and family.
I know a perfon who had fo ftrong an impreffion
upon her mind, that the houfe fhe was in would be
burnt that very night, that fhe could not fleep; the
impulfe fhe had upon her mind prefled her not to go
to bed, which, however, fhe got over, and went to
bed; but was fo terrified with the thought which
run in her mind, that the houfe would be burnt, that
fhe could not go to fleep; but communicating her
apprehenfions to another in the family, they were both
in fuch a fright, that they applied themfelves to fearch
from the top of the houfe to the bottom, and to fee
every fire and candle fafe out, fo that, as they all faid,
it was impoffible any thing could happen in the houfe,
and they fent to the neighbours on both fides to do
the like. Thus far they did well: but had (he obey-
ed the hint which prefled upon herftrangely not to go
to bed, fhe had done much better; for the fire was
actually kindled at that very time, though not bro-
ken cut. About an hour after the whole family was
in bed, the houfe juft over the way, directly oppofite,
was all in flames, and the wind, which was very high,
blowing the flame upon the houfe this gentlewoman
lived in, fo filled it with fmoak and fire, in a few mo-
ments, the ftreet being narrow, that they had not air
to breathe, or time to do any thing, but jump out of
their beds, and fave their lives. Had fhe obeyed the
hint given, and not gone to bed, fhe might have la-
ved feveral things; but the few moments fhe had fpa-
red to her, were but juft fufficient to leap out of bed,
put
put fome clothes on, and get down ftairs, for the houfe
was on fire in half a quarter of an hour.
While I am mentioning thefe things, methinks it
is very hard, that we fhould obey the whifpers of evil
fpirits, and not much rather receive the notices which
good ones are pleafed to give. We never perceive
the misfortune of this, but when in real danger: and
then we cry, My mind mi/gave me -when I -was going
about it: but if fo, why do you flight the caution?
Why not liften to it as to a voice? and then there
had been no reafon to make this complaint.
I remember about 14 or 15 years ago (as to time I
cannot be very pofitive) there was a young clergyman
in tha city of Dublin in Ireland, who dreamed a ve-
ry uncommon dream, That a gentleman had killed
his wife, a relation of his, by ftabbing her in feveral
places; the fright of this awaked him, but finding it
a dream, he compofed himfelf again to fleep, when he
dreamed a fecond time the fame dream. This made
him a little uneafy; but thinking it proceeded from
the impreffion made on his mind by the former, h&
went to fleep again, and dreamed the fame dream a
third time alfo. So troubled was he at this, that he
arofc, and knocked at his mother's chamber, told his
concern, and his apprehenfions that all were not right
at his relation's houfe. Dear fon, fays the good old
gentlewoman, do not mind thefe foolifh dreams: and
I very much wonder, that you, being a perfon in ho-
ly orders, fhould have regard to fuch illufions. Up-
on this he went to bed again, fell afleep, and dreamed
a fourth time as before. And then indeed he put on
his night-gown, and went to Smithfield, the place
where his relation dwelt. Here it was, alas ! he per-
ceived his dream too fadiy fulfilled, by feeing his re-
lation, the young lady, big with child, who was a
Proteftant, ftabbed in feven places, by her barbarous
huIband Mr Euftace, a violent Papift, only for fome
difcourfes of religion that happened the day before.
After the wretch had ftabbed her in three places, he
went to make his efcape out at a window; but fhc cried
out.
ont, My dear! don't leave me, come back, and I Jbatl
be -well again. At which he returned in a hellifh
rage, and gave her four wounds more; when, even in
this condition, rifing from her bed, fhe wrapped her-
felf in her night-gown, and went to the Lord Bifhop
of llapho's chamber-door (the bifhop lodging at that
time in the houfe), My Lord, faid fhe, 0, My Lord,
•make hafte unto me; but as foon as his Lordfhip came
ihe expired in his arms, refigning her precious foul
into the hands of Almighty God. The cruel
wretch her hufband was fhot by the purfuers, too good
a death for one who deferved the gibbet; and the la-
dy was univerfally lamented by all tender and religi-
ous people. And this tragical relation I have men-
tioned, upon the account of that impulfe, or dream,
that the clergyman had at the fatal time of the bloody
aCtion.
It might be expe&ed T AiouW enter upon the fub-
ject of apparitions, and difcourfe concerning the rea-
lity of them; and whether they can revifit the place
of their former exiftence, and refume thofe faculties
of fpeech and fhape as they had when living; but,
as thefe are very doubtful matters, I fhall only make
a few obfervations upon them.
I once heard of a man that would allow the reality
of apparitions, but laid it all upon the devil, thinking
that the fouls of men departed, or good men, did ne-
ver appear. To this very man fomething did appear:
he faid, he faw the fhape of an ancient man pafs by
him in the dufk, who, holding up his hand in a
threatening pofture, cried out, 0, -wicked man, re-
gent, repent! Terrified with this apparition, he con-
fulted feveral friends, who advifed him to take the ad-
f ice. But, after all, it was not an apparition, but a
grave and pious gentleman, who met him by mere
accident, and had been fenfible of his wickednefs;
and who never undeceived him, left it fhould hinder
his reformation. Were we always willing to make
good ufe of Satan's real appearances, I know not
but it would go a great way to banifh him from the
E e vifible
vifible world; for I am very pofitive, he would fel- I
dom vifit us, if he thought his coming would do us \
any good: but fo abfolutely is he at the command of
heaven, that he muft go, even to do the work he ab-
hors.
Some people make a very ill ufe of the general no-
tion, that there are no apparitions nor fpirits at all:
which is worfe than thofe who fancy they fee them up-
on every occafion: for thofe carry their notions far-
ther, even to annihilate the devil, and believe no-,
thing about him, neither of one kind or other: the
next ftep they come to, is to conclude, There is no
Cad, and fo atheifm takes its rife in the fame fink, with
a careleflhefs about futurity. But there is no occa-
fion to enter upon an argument to prove the being of
the Almighty, or to illuftrate his power by words,
who has fo many undeniable teftimonies in the breafts
of every rational being, to prove his eviftence: and
we have fufficient proofs, enough to convince us of
the great fuperintendency of divine providence in the
minuteft affairs of this world; the manifeft exiftence
of the invifible world; the reality of fpirits, and in-
telligence between us and them. What I have faid, I
hope, will not miflead any perfon.or be a means where-
by they may delude themfelves; for I have fpoketi
of thefe things with the utmoft ferioufnefs of mind,-
and with a fincere and ardent defire for the general
good and benefit of the world.
