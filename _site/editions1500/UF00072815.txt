DE FOE

--......

DANIEL DE FOE was descended from a respect-
able family in the county of Northampton, and born
in London, about the year 1663. His father, James
Foe, was a butcher, in the parishpf St. Giles's, Crip-
plegate, and a protestaut dissenter. Why the subject
of this memoir prefixed the De to his family name
cannot now be ascertained, nor did he at any period
of his life think it necessary to give his reasons to the
public. The political scribblers of the day, however,
thought proper to remedy this lack of information,
and accused him of posessing so little of the amor
pair-tie, as to make the addition in order that he
might not be taken for an Englishman; though this
idea could have had no other foundation than the
circumstance of his having, in consequence of his
zeal for king William, attacked the prejudices of his
countrymen in his " True-born Englishman."

After receiving a good euucatlon at an academy at
Newington, young De Foe, before he had attained his
twenty-first year, commenced his career as an author,
by writinga pam let a'faiust a very prevailing senti-
ment in favour o the 'urks. who were at 'hat time
laying siege to Vienna. This production, being very
inferior to those of his maturer years, was very little
read, and the indignant author, despairing of success
with his pen, had recourse to the sword; or, as he
termed it, when boasting of the exploit his latter
years. " displayed his attachment to liberty and pro
testantism," by joining the ill-advised insurrection
under the duke of Monmouth, in the west. On the
failure of that unfortunate enterprise, he returned

Mr. De Foe, in the year 1685, joined that of a trader
he was first engaged as a hasier, in Cornhill, and at'
terwards as a maker of bricks and pantiles, near Til
bury Fort, in Essex; but in consequence of spending
those hours in the hilarity of the tavern which he
ought to have employed in the calculations of the
countin ~house, his commercial schemes proved un-
success ul ; and in 1694 he was obliged to abscond
from his creditors, not failing to attribute those mis-
fortunes to the war and the severity of the times,
which were doubtless owing to his own misconduct.
It is much to his credit however, that after having
been freed from his debts by composition, and being
in prosperous circumstances from King William's fa-
vmr, he voluntarily paid most of his creditors both
the principal and interest of their claims. This is
such an example of honesty as it would be unjust to
De Fee and to the world to conceal. The amount
of the sums thus paid must have been very consider-
able, as he afterwards feclingly mentions to Lord
Havershein, who had reproached him with covetous--
ness; "With a numerous family, and no helps but
my own industry, I have forced my way through a
sea of misfortunes, and reduced my debts exclusive
of composition, from seventeen thousand to less than
five thousand pounds."

At the beginning of the year 1700, Mr. De Foe
published a satire in verse, which excited very con
siderable attention. called the " True-horn English-
man." Its purpose was to furnish a reply to those
who were coutinuallyahusing King Vi'iliia m and some
of his friends asfm'ct'gners, by shewing that the pre-
sent race of Englishmen was a mixed and heteroge-
neous brood, scarcclv any ofwhiclt could lay riaim to

native purity of blood. The satire was in many parts
very severe; and though it gave high ofl'ence, it
claimed a considerable share of the public attention.
The reader will perhaps be gratified by a specimen of

this production, wherein he endeavours to account
for--

" What makes this discontented land appear
Less happy now in times of peace, than war;
Why civil feuds disturb the nation more,

Than all our bloody wars had clone before:

Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place,
And men are always honest in disgrace;

The court preferments make men knaves in course.
But they, who would be in them, would be worse.
'Tis not at foreigners that we repine, '

Would foreigners their perquisites resign :

The grand contention's plainly to be seen,

To get some men put out and some put in."

It will be immediately perceived that De Foo could
have no pretensions to the character of a poet; but
he has, notwithstanding, some nervous and well-ver-
sificd lines, and in choice of subject and moral he i:
in general excellent. The True-born Englishman
concludes thus:

Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate,

And see their oil'spring thus degenerate;

How we contend for birth and names unknown,
And build on their past actions, not our own;
They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface,
And openly disowu the vile degenerate race.
For fame of families is all a. cheat;

'TIS PERSONAL VIRTUE ONLY MAKES US GREAT.

For this defence of foreigners De Foe was amply
rewarded by King William, who not only ordered him
a pension, but as his opponents denominated it. ap-
pointed him pamphlet-writer general to the court,-
an office for which he was peculiarly well calculated.

tired to Newington with his family. and for a short
time lived at ease; but the death of his royal patron
deprived him of a generous protector, and opened a
scene of sorrow which proba ly embittered his future
life.

He had always discovered a great inclination to en-
gage in religious controversy. and the furious contest,
civil and ecclesiastical, which ensued on theaccession
of Queen Anne, gave him an opportunity of gratify-
ing his favourite passion. He therefore published a
tract entitled "The shortest Way with the Dissenters,
or Proposals for the Establislnnent of the Church,"
which contained an ironical recommendation of per-
secution, hut written in so serious 8. strain, that many
persons, particular Dissenters, at first mistook its
real intention. The high church party however saw,
and felt the ridicule, and by their influence, a prose-

mucn rigour himself and his pamphlet were about to
bu treated, he at first secreted himself; but his printer
and bookseller being taken into custodody, he surren-
dered, being resolved, as he expressed it, '1 to throw
himself upon the favour of government, rather than
that others should be ruined for his mistakes." In
July, 1703, he was brought to trial, found guilty, and
sentenced to be imprisoned, to stand in the pillory, and
to pay a fine of two hundred marks. He underwen
the infamous part of the punishment with great for-
titude, and it seems to have been generally thought
that he was treated with unreasonable severity. So
far was he from being ashamed of his fate himself,
that he wrote a hymn to the pillory, which thus ends,
alluding to his accusers :

Tell them, the men that plac'd him here
Are scandals to the times;

Are at a loss to find his guilt,

And can't commit his crimes.

Pope, who has thought fit to introduce him in hit
Dunciad (probably from no other reason than party
difference) cha'racterises him in the following line:

Earless on high stood unabash'd De Foe.

This is one of those instances of injustice and malig-
nity which so frequently occur in the Dunciad, and
which reflect more dishonour on the author than on
the parties traduced. De Foe lay friendless and dis-
tressed in Newgate, his Family ruined, and himself
without hopes of deliverance, till Sir Robert Harley,
who approved of his principles, and foresaw that dur-
ing a factions age such a genius could be converted
to many uses, represented his unmerited sufferings
to the Queen, and at length procured his release. The
treasurer, Lord, Godolphin, also sent a considerable
sum to his wife and family, and to him money to pay
his fine and the expense of his discharge. Gratitude
and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man; and
. it was this benevolent act that prompted De Fee to
support Harley, with his able and ingenious pen, when

'Anne lay lifeless, and his benefactor in the vicissitnde
ofperty was persecuted by faction. and overpowered,
though not conquered, by violence.

The talents and perseverance of De Foe began
now to be properly estimated, and ass firm sup orter
of the administration, he was sent by Lord odol-
phin to Scotland, on an errand which, as he says, was
far from being unfit for a sovereign to direct or an
honest man to perform. His knowledge of commerce
and revenue, his powers of insinuation, and above
all his readinese of pen, were deemed of no small
utility, in iromoting the union of the two kingdoms;
of which lhe wrote an able history, in 1709 with two
dedications. one to the Queen. and another to the
Duke of Queensbury. Soon afterwards he nnhappily,
oy some equivocal writings, rendered himself suspect-
ed by both parties, so that he once more retired to
Newington in hopes of spending the remaider of his
days in peace, His pension being withdrawn, and
wearied with politics, he began to compose works of
a different kind--The year 1715 may therefore be re-
garded as the period of De Poe's political life. Fflf'r
tion henceforth found other advocates. and parties
procured other writers to disseminate their sugges-
tions, and to propagate their falsehoods.

In 1715 Do Foe published the "Family Instruc-
tor ;" a work inculcating the domestic duties in a
lively manner, by narration and dialogue, and dis-
playing much knowledge of life it: the middle ranks
of society. "Religious Courtship" also appeared
soon after, which, like the " Family Instructor," is
eminently religious and moral in its tendency. and
strongly impresses on the mind that spirit of sobriety
and private devotion for which the dissenters have
generally been distinguished. The most celebrated
of all his works, " The Life and Adventures of R0-
binson Crusoe," appeared in 1719. This work has
passed through numerous editions, and been trans-
lated into almost all modern languages. The great
invention which is displayed in it. the variety of in-
cidents and circumstances which it contains, related

mon merit, and one of the most interesting work:

; ing the diliiculties of any external situation." It has
; been pretended, that De Foe surreptitiously appro-
$ priatetl the papers of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch
e mriner, who lived four years alone on the island of
; Juan Fernandez. and a sketch of whose story had

.n y foundation. De Foe probably took some gene-
ral hints for his work from the story of Selkirk, but
here exists no proof whatever, nor is it reasonable
0 suppose that he possessed any of his papers or
ncmotrs, which had been published seven years he-
ore the a pearance of Robinson Crusoe. As a far-
her proo of De Foe's innocence, Captain Rogue's
account of 'Selkirk may be produced, in which it is
aid that the latter had neither preserved pen, ink,
or paper, and had in a great measure lost his lan-
Juage ; consequently De Foe could not have received
any written assistance. and we have only the asser-
tion of his enemies to prove that he had any verbal.

The great success of Robinson Crusoe induced its
author to write a number of other lives and adven-
tures some of which were popular in their times,
though at present nearly forgetten. One of his latest
publications was " A Tour through the lsland of

Great Britain," a performance of very inferior merit;
but De Foe was now the garralous old man, and his
spirit (to use the words of an ingenious biogra )het)
"like a candle struggling in the socket, blaze and
sunk, blazed and sunk, till it disappeared at length in
total darkness." His laborious and unfortunate life
was finished on the 26th of April, 1731, in the parish
of St. Giles's, Cripplegate.

' Daniel De Foe possessed very extraordinary tao

ries, whatever may be their performances or their
fame. His distinguished characteristics are origina-
lity, spirit, and a profound knowledge of his subject,
and in these particulars he has seldom been surpassed.
As the author of Robinson Crusoe he has a claim
not only to the admiration, but to the gratitude of
his countrymen; and so long as we have a regard
for supereminent merit and take an interest in the
welfare of the rising generation. that gratitude will
not cease to exist. But the Opinion of the learner)
and ingenious Dr. Beuttie will be the best eulogiunl
that can be produced on that celebrated romance--
" Robinson Crusoe," says the Doctor, " must be al-
lowed by the most rigid moralist, to be one of those
novels which one may read, not only with pleasuru
but also with profit. It breathes throughout a s irit
of piety and benevolence ; it sets in a very stri inp;
light the importance of the mechanic arts, which they,

who know not what it is to be without them. are so >

apt to undervalue; it fixes on the mind a lively idea
of the horrors of solitude, and, consequently of the
sweets of social life, and of the blessings we derive
from conversation and mutual aid; and it shews
how, by labouring with one's own hands, one may
secure independence; and open for nne's self many
sources of health and amusement. I agree, there
fore, with Rosseau. that it is one of the best books
lltal can be put into the hands of children."

any trade, my head began to be filled very early with
rambling thoughts: my father, who was very ancient,
had given me a competent share of learning, as fat
as house education and a country free-school gene
rally go, and designed me for the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my in-
clination to this led me strongly vainst the will,
nay the commands of my father, an against all the
entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that
propension of nature 'tending directly to the life of
misery which was to be fatal to me. _
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my
design. He called me one morning into his chamber,
where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated
very warmly with me upon this subject: he asked
me what reason more than a mere wandering incli~
nation. I had for leaving my father's house and my
native country, where I might he well introduced,und
had a prospect of raising my fortune by application
and industry, with a "re of ease and pleasure. He
told me it was for me of desperate fortunes on one
hand, orof aspiring superior fortunes on the other,
who went abroad upon adventures, to raise by enter-
prise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of
a nature out of the common road-; that these things
were all either too far above me, or too far below
me ; that mine was the middle state, or what might be
called the upper station of low life, which he had
found by long experience was the best state in the
world, the most suited to human happiness, not ex-
posed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and
sull'eriugs of the mechanic part of mankind. and not
unbarrased with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me. I
might judge ofthe happiness of this state by this (me

things, and wish they had been placed in the middrc
of the two extremes, between the mean and the great;
that the wise man gave his testimony to this as the
just standard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
neither poverty nor riches.

He bld me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the up-
per and lower part of mankind ; but that the middle
station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed
to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part
of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many
distetnpers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind,
nsthoxe were, who by vicious living, luxury, and ex-
travagances, on one hand, or by hard lahour, want oi
necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet, on the other
hand, bring distempers upon themselves by the na-
tural consequences of their way of living; that the
middle station of life was calculated for all kind of
virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all
agreeable diversions, and ali desirable pleasures, were
the blessings attending the middle station of life; that
this way men went silently and smoothly through the
world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed
with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold
to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace,
and the body of rest; not enraged with the passion
of envy, or secret burning lust of ambition for great
things; but in easycircumstancesslidinggently through
the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day's experience to know it more
sensibly.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, not
to precipitate myself into miseries which nature and

mg my bread; that he would do well for me. and
endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of hfo
which he had been just recommending to me; and

that if I was not very easy and happy in the world

it must be my mere ate or fault that must hinder it

and that he should have nothing to answer for, having
thus discharged his duty in warning me against mea-
sures which he knew would be to my hurt : in a word,
that as he would do very kind things for me if I would
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give
me any encouragement to go away: and to close all,
he told me I had my elder brother for an example,
to whom he had used the same earnest persuasionsto
keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but
cou d not prevail, his young desires rompting him to
run into the army, where he was ki led; and though
he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he
would venture to say to me, that if I did take this
foolish step, God would not bless me, and I would
have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglect-
ed his counsel when there might be none to assist in
my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which
was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did
not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed the
tears run down his face very plentifully, and espe-
cially when he spoke of my brother who was killed ;
and that when he spoke of my having leisure to re-
pent, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that
to broke off the discourse, and told me, his heart was
so full that he could do no more.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as in-
deed who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to
think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home
according to my father's desire. But, alas! a few da 9
wore it all off; and in short, to prevent any of my a.--
ther's farther importunities, in a few week after I re-
solved to run uite away from him. However, I did

frequently expostulating with my father and mother
about their being so positively determined against
what they knew my incnnauon prompted me to. But
heingone day at Hull, wherel went casually, and 'with-
out any purp05e of makinv an elopement that time;
but I say, being there, and one of my companion:
being going by sea to London, in lus father's ship, and

rompting me to go with them, with the common al-
rurement of seafaring men, viz. that it should cost me
nothing for my passage, 1 consulted neither father or
mother any more, not so much as sent them word of
it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with-
out asking God's blessing, or my father's, without any
consideration of circumstances or conset uences, and
in an ill hour, God knows, on the first 0. September,
1651, l went on board a ship bound for London.
Never any young adventurer's misfortunes, I believe,
hogan sooner, or continued longer than mine. The
ship was no sooner gotten out of the Humber, but the
wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a most
frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea boa
fore, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and ter-
rified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon
what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by
the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my
father's house. and abandonin my duty; all the good
counsel of my parents, my fat er's tears and my mo-
ther's entrcaties, came now fresh into my mind; and
my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch
of hardness to which it has been since, reproached me
with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my
duty to God and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sea,
which I had never been upon be-fore. went very high,
though nothing like what I have seen many times
since; no, nor like what [saw a few days after: but
it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young
sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter.
I expected every wave would have swallowed us up,
and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought,

m the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never
rise more; and in this agony of mind I made many
vows and resolutions, that if it would please God here
to s are my life this one voyage, if ever 1 got once
my cot upon dry land again I would go directly home
to my father, and never set it into a ship again while
I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run
myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I
saw lainly the goodness of his observations about the
mid le station of life, how easy, how comfortably he
had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to
tempests at sea, or troubles on shore; and I resolved
thatl would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home
to my father. ~
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time af-
ter; but the next day the wind was abated, and the
sea calmer, and I began to be a little inored to it-
however, I was very grave for all that day, being alsc
a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather
deared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming
fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly
dear, and rose so the next momjng; and having little

' or no wind, and a smooth sea,-the sun shinin u on
. it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delight ul

wet I saw.

I had slept well in the ni ht, and was now no more
sea-sick, but very cheerful, coking with wonder upon
the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before,
and could be so calm and so,pleasant in so little time
after. And now, lest my good resolutions should
continue, my companion, who had indeed enticed me
away, comes to me: " Well, Bob," says he, (clappin
me upon the shoulder) " how do you do after it?
warrant you were frighted, wa'n't you, last night, when
it blew but acapful of wind 1'"--" A capful do you call
it?" said I ; ".it was a terrible storm."--" A storm.

Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch. and "'0'"
forget all that; do you see what charming weather
is now ?" To make short this sad part of my story, us
went the old way of all sailors; the punch was tirade,
und 1 was made drunk With it; and in that one night's
wickedness l drowned all my repentance, all my re.
flections upon my past conduct, and all my resolutions
for my future. in a word. as the sea was returned to
its smoothness of surface and settled Balmness by the
abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed u by the sea being forgotten, and the current
of my ormer desires returned, I entirely forgot the
vows and promises that I made in my distress. I
found, indeed, some intennls of reflection, and the
serious thoughts did, as it were. endeavour to return
again sometimes; but I shook them 03', and roused
thyself from them as it :1 ore from a distemper, and
applying myself to drink) 1:, and company, soon mas-
tered the return of those lie", for so I called them; and
I had in five or six days gul as com lete a victory
over conscience, as any yourg fellow t at resolved not
to be troubled with it could desire: but I was to have
smother trial for it still; and Providence, as in such
'eases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse: for if I would not take this fora de~
liverattce, the next was to be such a one as the worst
and most hardened wretclt among us would confes-
both the danger and the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary, and
the weather calm, we had made but little way since
the storm. Here we were obliged to come to anchor,
and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary, viz.
at south-west, for seven or eight days. during which
time a great many ships from Newcastle came into
the same roads, as the common harbour where the
ships might wait for a. wind fur the river.

We had not, however, rid here so long, but should

have tidetl it up the river, but that the Wind blew tm-
fresh; and after we had lain four or five days, blew
very hard. However, the roads being reckoned as
good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground
tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the
time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea ;
but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased,
and we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts
and make every thing snug and close, that the ship
migh ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went
very high indeed, and our ship rid firecaslle in,
shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice
our anchor had come home; upon which our master
ordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with
two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the
better end. '

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed ; and
now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves. The master, though
vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as
he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear
him softly to himself say several times, " Lord be
merciful to us! we shall be all lost, we shall be all un-
done 3" and the like. During these first hurries] was
stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steer-
age, and cannot describe my temper: I could ill re-
assume the first penitence w rich I had so apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myself against: I thought
the bitterness of death had been past, and that this
would be nothing like the first: but when the master
himselfcame by me, as I said just now, and said we
should be all lost, I was dreadfully frightened : 1 got up
out of my cabin, and looked out; but such a dismal
sight I never saw : the sea went mountains high, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes: when I
could look about,l could see nothing but distress round
us, two ships that ritl near us, we found had cut their
masts by .he board, being deep loadcn; and our men. A W M"W\V\\V\\\WWW msmw- .._~.

cried out, that a ship which rid about a mile ahead
of us was foundered. Two more ships being driven
from their anchors, were run out of the roads to sea,
at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much labour-
ing in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and
came close by us, running away with only their spritv
sail out before the wind. -

'l'owardsevening the mate and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let them cutaway the fore-mast,
which he was very unwilling to do: but the boatswin
protestin to him, that if he did not, the ship would
founder, e consented; and when they had cut away
the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, and
shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her
away also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in
at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had
been in such a fright before at but a little, But if I
can express at this distance the thoughts I had about
me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind
upon account of my formerconvictions, and the having
returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly
taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these,
added to the terror of the storm, put me in such a corn
dition, that I can by no words describe it. But the
.worst was not come yet; the storm continued with
su'ch fury, that the seamen themselves acknowledged
they had never knowu a worse. We had a good ship,
but she" was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea,
that the seamen every now and then cried out, she '
would founder: It was my advantage in one respect,
that I did not know what they<<meant by founder till
I inquired. However, the storm was so violent, that
[saw what is not often seen. the master, the boatswan,
and some others more sensible than the rest, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship
would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night,
and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men
that had heen down on purpose to see, cried out, we

had sprung a leak; another said. there was four foot
waterin the hold. Then all hands were called to the
nump At that very word my heart, as I thmwht, died
within me, and I fell backwards upon the Side of my
bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men
roused me. and told me, that Ithat was able tndo
nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
at which I stirrer] up, and went to the pump and
worked very heartily. While this was .doing, the
master seeing some light colliers, who not able to ride
out the storm, were obliged to slip and run away to
sea, and would come near us ordered to fire a gun as
a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what that
meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship had
broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a. word,
I wasso surprised, that i fell down in a swoon. As
this was a time when every body had his mvn life to
think of, nobody minded me, or what was become
of me; but another man stept up to tie pump, and
thtlrsting me aside with his foot, let me lie, tltinkinv
1- had been dead; and it was a great'whilelbeforel
came to myself.

We worked on; but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as it
was not possible she could swim till we might run
into a port, so the master continued firing guns for
help; and a light ship who had rid it out just ahead
of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the
utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was im-
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie
near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very
heartily. and venturing their lives to save ours. our
men cast them a rope over the stem with a buoy to it,
and then veered it out agreat length. which they after
great. labour and hazard took hold of, and we hauled
them close under' our stern. and got all into their
boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we
were in the boat, to think of reaclting'tb their own

ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull
her in towards shore as much as we could; and our
master promised them, that if the boat was slaved
upon shore he would make it good to their master.-
so partly rowing and (rartly drmng, our boat went
away to the nothwar , sloping towards the shore
almost as far as W interton-Ness.

We were not much more than a uarter of an hour
out of our ship but we saw her sin , and then 1 un.
derstood for the first time what was meant by a ship
thundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had
hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she
was sinking; for from that moment they rather put
me into the boat, than that I might be said to go in ;
my heart was, as it were, dca within me, partly
with frighth, partly with horror of mind, and the
thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet la-
bouring at the ear to bring the boat near the shore,
we could see, when our boat mounting the waves we
were able to see the shore, a great many people run-
ning along the shore to assist us when we should come
r ear; but we made but slow way towards the shore,
nor were we able to reach the snore, till being past
the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls elf to the
westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke at?
a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in.
and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe
on shore. and walked afterwards on foot to Yar-
month, where, as unfortunate men, we were used
with great humanity, as well by the magistrates ol
the townI who assigned us good quarters, as by par-
ticular merchants and owners of ships. and had
money given us suflicient to carry us either to Lon-
don or back to Huli. as we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull.
and have gone home, I had been happy, and, my
father. an emblem of our blessed Saviour'sparable, had
even killed the fatted calf for me; {or hearing the ship

was a great while before he had any assurance that!
was not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had se-
veral times loud calls from my reasOn and my more
composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power
to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I
urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries
us on to be the instruments of our own destruction,
even though it be before us, and that we push upon it
with oureyes open. Certainly nothing but some such
decreed unavoidable misery amending, and which it
was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed
me forward against the calm reasonings and persuao
sions of my most retired thoughts, and against two
such visible instructions as I had met with in my firs
attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before
and who was the master's son, was now less forward
than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were
at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days,
for we were separated in the town to several quarters;
1 say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone
was altered, and looking very melancholy, and shak-
ing his head, asked me how I did, and telling his fa-
ther who I was, and how I had come this vo age only
for a trial, in order to go farther abroad; his father
turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone,
" Young man," says he, " you ought never to go to
sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and
visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man."
--" Why, Sir," said I, " will you go to sea no more?"
" That is another case," said he; "it is my calling,
and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage
for a trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you
pf what you are to expect if you persist: erhaps this
is all befallen us on your account, like onah in the
ship of Tarshish. Pray, "continues he, " what are
you? and on what account did you go to sea. .7" Upon

that I told him some )f my story; at the end of which
he burst out with a stran e kind of passion; " What
had I done," says he, " that such an unhappy wretch
should come into my shi ? I would riot set my foot
in the same ship with t ee again for a thousand
unds." This indeed was, as I said, an excursion o:

is Spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his
loss, and was farther than he could have authority tc
go. However, he afterwards talked very gravely to
me, 'exhorting me to go back to my father, and not
tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a
visible hand of Heavenagainst me. "And young
man," said he, " depend upon it, if you do notgo
back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing

. but disasters and disappointments, till your farther'e

words are fulfilled upon you." _

We parted soon after; forI made him little answer,
and Isaw him no more: which way he \vent,I know
not. As for me, having some money in my pocket,
Itravelled to London by land: and there, as well as
on the road, had man struggles with myself, what
course of life I shoul . take, and whether I should
go home, or get to sea. i

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions
that offered to' my thoughts; and it immediately oc-
curred to me howl should he laughed at among the
neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my
father and mother only, but even every body else;
from whence I have since often observed, how incon-
gruous and irrational the common temper of mankind
is, especially of you'.h, to that reason which oughtto

guide them in such cases. viz. that they are not asham-.

ed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; nor ashamed
of the action for which they ought justly to be esteem>>-
ed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men.

uncertain what measure to take, and what course of
life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to

hr'ance of the distress I had been in were OE; and as
that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to a

' return were off with it, till at last I quite laid aside
the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage. ,

That evil influence which carried me first away

' from my father's heuse, that hurried me into the wild
and indigested notion of raising my fortune; and that .
impressed those conceits so forcibly upon me as to
make niedeaf to all good advice, and to the entreaties
and even the command of my father: I say, the same
influence, whateverit was, presented the most unfur-
tunate of all enterprises to my view; and I went on
board a vessel bound to the coast of Africa; or, as
our sailors vulgarly call it a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune that in all these adveno
tures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby,
though I might indeed have workedalittle harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learnt the
duty and oflice of a foremastman; and in time might
have qualified myselffor a mate or lieutenant, if not
for a master. But as it was always my fate to
choose for the worse, sol did here; for having money
in my pocket, and good clothes upon my back, I
would always go on board in the habit of a gentle-
man ; and so I neither had any business in the ship,
or learnt to do any.

i'It was my lot 'first of all to Ian'tnto pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young follows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with me.
I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship who
had been on the coast of Guinea; and who, having had
very good success 'there, was resolved to go again;
and who taking a fancy to my conversation, which
was not at all disagreeable at that time, hearing me
say I had a mind to see the world, told me ifl would
go the voyage with him I should be at no expense; I
should be Ins messmate and his companion : and if]
zouhl carry any thing with me, I should have all the

n embraced the offer; and entering into a strict
friendship with the captain. who was an honest and
plain--dealing man, I went the v0yage with him, and
carried a small adventure with me, which. by the (lie-
interested honesty of my friend the captain, Iincreas
etl very considerably; for I carried about 401. in such
toys and trifles as the captain directed me to buy.
This 401, I had mustered together by the assistance of
some of my relations whom Icorresponded with, and
who, I believe, got my father, or at least my mother,
to contribute so much as that to my first adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventuves, and which I owe to
the inte rity and honesty of my friend the captain,
under w tom also I got a competent knowledge of the
mathematics and the rules of navigation, learnt how
to keep an account of the ship's course, take an obser-
vatinn, and, in short, to understand some things that
were needful to he understood by a sailor: for, as
he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn;
and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor
and a merchant: for Ibrought home five pounds nine
ounces ot'gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded
me in London at my return almost 3001. and this fil-
led me with those aspiring thoughts which have so
completed my ruin.

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too ;
particularly, that I was continually sick,being thrown
into a Violent calenture by the excessive heat of the
climate; our principal trading being upon the coast,
I'ronlif the latitude of15 degrees north even to the lino
itse .

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again, and
I embarked in the same vessel with one who was his
mate in the former vo age, and had now got the com-
mand of the ship. 'this was the unhappiest voyage

this voyage; and the first was this, viz. our ship mak-
ing her course towards the Canary Islands, or rather
between those islands and the African shore, was sur-
prized in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover
ot' Sallee. who gave chase to us with all the sail she
could make. We crowded also as much canvass as
our yards would spread, or our masts carry, to have
got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and
would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we
prepared to fight; our ship having twelve gunsI and
the rogue eighteen. About three in the afternoon he
came up with us. and bringing to by mistake just
uth wart our quarter, instead ofathwart our stern, as
he intended. we brought eight of our guns to hear on
that side. and poured in a broadside upon him, which
made him sheer off again, after returning our fire,
and pouring in also his small-shot from nearly 200 men
which he had on board. However, we had not a man
touched, all our men keeping close. He prepared to
attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but lay-

ter. he entered sixty then u on our decks. who imme-
diately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rig-

powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our deck
of them twice. However, to cut short this melan-
choly part of our story, our ship being disabled, and
three of our men killed and eight wounded, we were
obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.

my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I look-
ed back upon my father's prophetic discourse to me,

that I should be miserable, and have none to relieve -

me, which I thought was now so efl'ectually brought to

)as, that I could not be worse; that now the hand 01
heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone with
out redemption: but alas ! this was but a taste of the
misery I, was to go through, as will appear in the
sequel of this story.

As my new patron, or master, had taken me home
to his house so I was in hopes that he would take me
with him when he went to sea again, believing that it
would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a
Spanish or Portugal man of war; and that then I
should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was
soon taken away; for when he went to sea, he left me
on shore to look after his little garden, and to do the
common drudgery of slaves about his house; and
when he came home again from his cruise, he order-
ed me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what
method I would take to effect it, but found no way
that had the least probability in it: nothing presented
to make the supposition of it rational; for i had no>>
body to communicate ittothat would embark with me,
no fellow slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or Scotsman
there but thyself; so that forum years, though Ioften
pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had
the leastencouraging prospect of putting it in practice,

After about two years an odd circumstance presenh
ed itself, which put the old thought of making some
attempt for my liberty again in my head: my patron
lying at home longer than usul without fitting out his
ship", which, as I heard, was for want of money, he
used constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes
oftener, if the weather was fair. to take the ship's
pinnace and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he
always took me and a young Maresco with him to
"ow the boat, we made him very merry, and 1 proved

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. W

very dexterous in catching fish ; insomuch that some
times he would send me -with a Moor, one of his
kinsmen, and the youth the Maresco, as they called
him, to catch a dish of fish forhim.

It happened one time, that going aofishing in a stark
calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we
were not half a leaoue from the shore we lost sight of
it; and rowing we new not whither or which way,
we laboured all day, and all the next ni ht, and when
the morning came we found we had pu led off to sea
instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were
at least two leagues from the shore : however, we got
well in again, though with a great deal of labour and
some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty fresh
in the morning; but particularly we were all very
hungry. - v

But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to
take more care of himself for the future; and havin
lying bylhim the long-boat of our English ship he ha
taken, he resolved he would not go a--fishing any more
without acompass and some provision ; so he ordered

. the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English

slave. to build a little state-room, or cabin, in the
middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a
place to stand behind it to steer and hale home the
main-sheet; and room before for a hand or two to
stand and work the sails: she sailed with what we call
a shoulder of mutton sail; and the boom gibed over
the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low,
and had'in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two,
and a table to eat on, with some small lockers to put
in some bottles of such' li uor as he thought fit to
drink; particularlv his brea , rice and coffee.

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing,'and
ISI was most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never
went without me. It happened that he had appointed
to a cut in this boat, either for pleasure or or fish,
witgh two or three Moores of some distinction in that
place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily,
and had therefore sent on board the boat over-night a

dered me to get ready three fusees with powder and
shot, which were on board his ship; for that they de-
signed some sport offowling as well as fishing.

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited
the next morning with the boat washed clean, her

modate his guests: when h and bye my patron came
on board alone. and to! me Hoguests had I ut ofi

the boat and catch then. some fish, {or that his friends
were to sup at his house; and commanded that as
soon as I got some fish I should bring it home to his
house; all which I prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was like
to have a little ship at my command; and my master
being gone, I prepated to furnish myself, not for fish.

neither did I so much us consider, whither I should
steer; for any way to get out or that place was my

My first contrivance was to make a. pretence to
spea to this Moor, to get something for our subsist-
ence on board; for I told him we must not presume
to eat of our patron's bread ; he said, that was true i
so he brought a large basket of rusk or hisket of their
kind. and three jars with fresh water, into the boat.
I knew where my patron's case of bottles stood,
which it was evident, by the make, were taken out 01
some English prize, and I conveyed them into the
heat while the Moor was on sherr- as if they had heen
there before for our master: I conveyed also a great
lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above
half a hundred weight, with a awe] of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a ammer, all which
were of great use to us afterwards, es ecrally the
wax to make candles. Another trick Iptried upon
him. which he innocently came into also; his name

was Ismael, whom they call Muly, or Moley; so I
called to him: " Molcy," said I, " our patron's guns
are on board the boat; can you not get a little powder
and shot? it may be we may kill some alcamies (a
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know he
keeps the gunner's stores in the ship."----" Yes," says
he, " I'll bring some ;" and accordingly he brought a

real leather pouch which held about a pound and a

all of powder, or rather more; and another with
shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets,
and ut all into the boat: at the same time l had
foun some powder of m master'sin the great cabin,
with which 1 filled one olythe large bottles in the case,
which was almost empty, pouring what was in it into
another; and thus furnished with every thing needful,
we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle, which
is at the entrance 0 the port, knew who we were,
and took no notice of us: and we were not above a
mile out of the or! before we haled in our sail, and
set us down to sh. The wind blow from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown
southerly, I had been sure to have made the coast ol

my resolutions were, blow which way it would, I
would be gone from that horrid place where 1 was,
and leave the rest to fate.

Moor, " This will not do ; our master will not be thus

the sails; and as I had the helm I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then 'brou ht her to as if I
would fish; when iving the boy the telm, I stepped
forward to where t e Moor was, and making as if I
stooped for something behind him, I took him by sup-
prise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him
clear overboard into the sea; he rose immediately,
for he swam like a cork. and called to me. begged to

be taken in, told me he would go all over the worla
with me. He swam so strong after the boat. that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being but
little wind; upon which I stepped into the cabin, and
fetching out one of 'the fowling-pieces, I presented it
at him, and told him, Ihad done him no hurt, and i!
he would be quiet I would do'him none: " But," said
I, "you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and
the sea is calm; make the best of your way to shore,
and I will do you no harm; but if ou come near tho
boat I'll shoot you through the hea . for I am resolved
to have my liberty ;" so he turned himself about,
and swim for the shore, and I make ho doubt but
he reached it with ease,' for he was an excellent
swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to trust him. When he was gone I
turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, and said
to him, " Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll
make you a great man; but if you will not stroke
your face to be true to me," that is, swear by Maho-
met and his father's beard, I must throw you into
the sea too." The boy smiled in my face, and spoke

- so innocently, that I could not mistrust him; and

more to be faithful to me, and go all over the world
with me.

While I was in view of the Moor that was swim--
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that the mivht think me
gone towards the Strait's mouth ; as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must have been supposed
to do) for who would have supposed we were sailed
on to the southward to the truly barbarian coast
where whole nations of Negroes were sure to sur
round us with their canoes, and destroy us; where
fie could never once go on shore but we should be
devoured by savage beasts. or more merciless savages
of human kind?

changed my course, and steered directly south and by

east, bending my course a little toward the east, thatJ

might keep in with the shore; and havinga fair, fresh

file of mod, and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such

sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in

the afternoon, when Ifirst made the land, I could not

be less than 150 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond

the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or indeed of

any other king thereabouts, for we saw no Eco 1e.

this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore '

as soon as it was dark, and discover the country; but

as soon as it was quite dark. we heard such dreadful

noises of the barking, roarin , and howling of wild

nreatures, of we knew not of w at kinds, that the poor

boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of me not

to go on shore till day. " Well, Xury," said I,

" then 1 won't; but it may be we may see men by

day, who will be as bad to us as those lions."-

"Then we give them the shoot gun," says Xury,

laughing, " make them run wey." Such English

Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves. How-

ever, I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave

him a dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to

cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was good,

and I took it; we dropped our little anchor, and lay

still all night; I say still, for we slept none; for in

two or three hours we saw vast great Creatures (we

down to the sea-shore and run into the water wallow-

and yellings, thatl never indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so was
1 too; but we were both more frighted when we heard
one of these mighty creatures come swimming to-
wards our boatg'we could not see him, but we might
hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous huge and

question too: for to have fallen into the hands ofany

The boy answered with so much afl'ection, that made
me love him ever after. Says he, " If wild mans
come, they eat me, you go wey,"----" Well, Xury,"
said i, " we will toth go, and if the wild manscomc,
we will kill them, they shall eat neither ofus." So I
gave Xury a piece of rusk bread to eat, and a dram
out of our atron's case of bottles which I mentioned
before; an we haled the boat in as near the shore as
we thought was proper, and waded on shore; carry
luv nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.

Cl did not care to go out of sight of the boat. fearing
the coming of canoes with savages down the river:
but the boy seeing a low place about a mile up the
country, rambled to it; and by and by I saw him
come running towards me. I thought he was pursued
by some savage. or frighted with some wild beast, and
I run forward towards him to help him; but when I
came nearer to him, 1 saw something hanging over his
shoulders. which wasa creature that he had shot1
like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs;
however, we were very glad of it, and it was very
good meat; but the great 'oy that poor Xury came
with, was to tell me that e had found good water,
and seen no wild mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water flesh'when the
tide was out, which flows but a little way up; so we
filled ourjars, and feasted on the hare we had killed.

} them, or when to stand off to sea towards them;
otherwise I' might now easily have found some o!
g these islands. But my ho me was, that if I stood air it;
this coast till I came to titat part where the English
{ traded. I should find some of their vessels upon thei)
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us
in. .

By the best of my calculation, that place where I
now was. must he that country, which, lying between
the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes,
lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild beasts;
the negroes ha. mg abandoned it, and gone farther
south for fear of the Moors; and the Moors not think-
ing it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness;
and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigi-
ous number of tigers. lions, leopards, and other furl

ous creatures which harbour there; so that the Moors

~ use if for their hunting only, where they go like an
army, two or three thousand men at a time; and in--
deed for near an hundred miles together upon this
coast, we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited coun-
try by day, and heard nothing but howlings and
tearing of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice in the daytime i thought I saw the
l'ico of Tenerifl'e, being the high top ofthe Mountain
Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a great mind to
venture out in hopes of reaching thither; but having
tried twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds,
the sea also going too high for my l.ttle vessel; so I
resolved to pursue my first design, and keep alotg
the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water,
after we had left this place; and once in particular,
being early in the morning, we came to an anchot
under a little point of land which was pretty high:
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him
than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells
me that we had best go farther off the shore: " for,"
says he. "look yonder lies a dreadful monster on the

.y-..' ~~~~\~v~\\\\ vex-v>> \1'>> \\\\\N'~\~'V'I'\ \ \Vw1\'v\\\\WN\-MW~'
side of that hillock fast asleep." I looked where he
pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it
was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the
shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that hung
as it were a little over him. " Xury," says I, " you
shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked fright-
ed, and said, " Me kill ! he eat me at one mouth ;"
one mouthful he meant : however, I said no more to
the boy, but bad him lie still, and I took our biggest
gun, which was almost'muskebbore, and loaded it
with a good charge of powder, and with two slugs,
and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with
two bullets; and the third, for we had three ieces, I
loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the est aim
I could with the first piece to have shot him into the
head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little above
his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee, and
broke the bone. He started up growling at first, but
finding his leg broke fell down again, and then got up
upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roarthat
ever I heard. I was a little surprised that I had not
hit him on the head ; however, I took up the second
piece immediately, and though he began to move off,
fired again, and shot him into the head,' and had the
pleasure to see him drap, and make but little noise,
but lie struggling for life. Then Xury took heart,
and would have me let him go on shore: " Well, go,"
said I; so the boy jumped into the water and taking
a little gun in one hand, swam to shore with the
other hand, and coming close to the creature, put the
muzzle of the iece to ris ear, and shot him into the
head again, w rich dispatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
and I was very sorry to lose three charges of powder
and shot upon a creature that was good for nothing to
us. However, Xury said he would have some of
him; so he comes on board, and asked me to give
him the hatchet. " For what. Xury ?" said I, " Me
out (If his head," said he. However, Xury could

 

l
not cut off his head, but be cut ofi' a foot, and brought
it with him, and it was a monstrous great one;

I bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin
of him might one way or other he of some value to
us; and I resolved to take off his skin if I could.
So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xur)
was much the better workman at it, for I knew very
ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole
day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and
9 reading it on the top 01 our cabin, the sun effectu-
a ly dried it in two days time, and it afterwards
served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward con-
tinually for ten or twelve days, living very sparing
on our provisions, which began to abate very much,
and gorng no oftener into the shore than we were
obliged to for fresh water: my design in this was, to
make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any
where about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes
to meet with some European ship: and if I did not,
I knew not what course I had to take, but to seek for
the islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I
knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the
East Indies, made this Cape, or these islands; and
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some ship,
or must perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days
longer, as I have said, Ibegan to see that the Ian-I
was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we
sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look
at us; we could also perceive they were quite black,
and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone
on shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor,
and said to me, " No go, no go," However. I
hauled in nearer the shore that I might talk to them,
and I found they run along the shore by me a good
way . 1 observed they had no weapons in their hands.y" "\Wyewwm~~xv~x-w-w~m~m~~x~mmm-3

except one, who had a long slender stick, which
Xury said was a lance, and that they would throw

.them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a dis-

tance, but: talked with them by signs as well as I
could; and particularly made signs for somethin to

top of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up
into the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some corn, such as is the produce of their coun-
try; but we neither knew what the one nor the other
was: however, we were willing to accept it, but how
to come at it was our next dispute, iorI was not for
venturin on shore to them, and they were as much
afraid 0 us; but they tool: a. safe way for us all, for
they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and
went and stood a great way of? till we fetched it on
board, and then came close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, f0: we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
ofi'ered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully:
for while we were lying by the shore came two
mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury from the mountains towards the
sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female
or whether they were in sport or in rage we could not
tell,.any more than we could tell whether it was usual
or strange, but I believe it was the latter; because, in
the first place, those ravenous-creatures seldom appear
but in the night; and in the second place, we found the
people terribly frigbtcd, especially the women. The
man that had the lance or dart did net fly from them,
but the rest did ; however, as the two creatures ran
directly into the water they did not seem to offer to
fall upon any of the Negroes. but plunged themselves
into the sea and swam about as if they had come for
their diversion. At last one of them be n to come
nearer our boat than at first I expecte ; but I lay
.ceady for him, for I had loaded my gun with all pox

as soon as he came fairly within my reach I fired, and
, shot him directly into the head; immediately he
sunk down into the water, but rose instantly, and
plunged up and down as if he was struggling for-life;
and' so indeed he was; he immediately made to the
shore; but between the wound, which was his mor
ml hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of these
i poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun;
some of them were even ready to die for fear, and
fell down as dead with the very terror. But when
they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the water,
and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and came to the shore, and began to
search for the creature. Ifound him by his blood
staining the water, and by the help of a rope, which I
slung round him, and gave the Negroes to hale, they
dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most
curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable de--
gree, and the Negroes held up their hands with admi-
g ration to think what it was I had killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire I
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up i
directly to the mountains from whence they came,
i nor could I at that distance know what it was. I SS
SS found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh 01
g this creature, 'so I was willing to have them take it as
a favour from me, which, when Imade signsto them
that they might take him, they were very thankful
for. Immediately they fell to work with him, and
though they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece
of wood they took off his skin as readily, and much
more readily, than we could have done with a knife.
They offered me some of the flesh, which I declined,
making as if I would give it them, but made signs for
the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provision, which,

of my jars to them, turning it bottom u wards. to
i show that it was em ty, and that I wante to have it
filled. They calle immediately to some of their
friends, and there came two women, and brought a
great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose,
in the sun; this they set down for me, as before, and
I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled them
all three. The women were as stark naked as the
men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,
I made forward for about eleven days more. without
offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run
out a great length into the sea, at about the distance
of four or five leagues before me; and, the sea being
i very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point, '
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues '
g from the land, I saw plainly land on the other side to
, seaward; then I concluded, as it was mest certain
i indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and those
the islands, called from thence Cape de Verd Islands.
However, they they were at a great distance, and I
could not well tell what I had best to do, for if I should
be taken with a fresh of wind I might neither reach
one nor the other.

~Mt to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak witu
them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, Ifound I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they would
be gone by before I could make any signal to them ;
but after I had crowded to the utmost, aud began to
despair, they, it seems, saw me by the he] of their
perspective-glasses, and that it was some uropean

Jill, which as they supposed, must belong to some
ship that was lost; so they shortened sail to let me
come up. I was encouraged with this; and as 1 had
my patron's ancient on board, I made a waft ofit to
them for a. signal of distress, and fired a gun, both
which they saw, for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun : upon these signals
they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me, and
in about three hours time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was in l'ortuguese, and in
Spanish, and in French; but I understood none 0!
them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board,
called to me, and I answered him, and told himl
was an Englishman, that 1 had made my escape out
of slavery from the Moors at Salee. Then they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
would believe thatI was thus delivered, as I esteemed
it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless con-
dition as I was in, and immediatelyofl'ered all I had to
the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliver-
ance; but he generously told me, he would take no-
thing from me, but that all I had should be delivered
safe to me when I came to the Brasils; " For," say
he, "I have saved your life on no other terms than
I would be glad to he saved myself; and it may one
time or other, he my lot to be taken u in the same

Englishtitan, I will carry you thither in charity, and
those things will help you to buy your subsistence
there, and your passage home again." v

' As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just
in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the sea-
men, that none should offer to touch any thing I had:
.hen he took every thing into his own possession, and
ave me back an exact inventory of them, that I might
ave them ; even so much as my three earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he
saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the ship's
use, and asked me whatl would have for it? I told
him, he had been so generous to me in every thing,
that I could not offer to make any price of the boat
but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me ne
would give me a note of his hand to pay me eighty
pieces of eight for it at Brasil; and when it came
there, if any one offered to give more, he would make
It up: he offered me also sixty pieces of eight more
for my boy Xury, which I was loath to take; not
that l was not willing to let the captain have him,
but I was very loath to sell the poor boy's liberty,
who had assisted me so faithfully in prccuring my
own. However, when I let him know my reason, he
owned it to be {use and offered me this medium, that '
he would give tte boy an obligation to set him free in
ten years, if he turned Christian. Upon this, and
Xury saying he was willing to go to him, I let the
captain have him.

We had a. very good voyage to the Brasils, and ar-
rived in the Bay do Todos los Santos, or All Saints'
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I
was once more delivered front the most miserable at
all conditions of life; and what to do next with my-
self l'was now to consider. . .

never enough remember; he would take nothing of

leopard's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, which I
had in my boat, and caused every thing I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles,
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-
wax, for I had made candles of the rest: in a. word.
I made about two hundred and twenty pieces of eight
of all my cargo; and with this stock I went on shore
in the Brasils.

I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the house of a. good honest man like himself, who
had an ingez'no as they call it; that is, a plantation
and a sugar-house; I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how
well the planters lived, and hmv they grew rich sud-
denly, I resolved, if I could get license to settle there,
I would turn planter among them, resolving, in the
mean time, to find out some way to get my money,
which I had left in London, remitted to me. To this
purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization. I

neighbour. because his plantation lay next to mine,
and we went on very sociable together. My stock
was but low, as well as his: and we rather planted
for food than any thing else, for about two years.
However. we began to increase, and our land began
to come into order; so that the third year we planted
some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece 0!

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 85

But, alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right,
was no great wonder: I had no remedy but to go on;
I was gotten into an employment quite remote to my
genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in,
and for which I forsook my father's house, and broke
through all his good advice; nay, I was coming into
the very middle station, or upper degree of low life,
which my father advised me to before; and which i'
I resolved to go on with, I might as well have staid at
home, and never have fatigued myself in the world as
I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I
could have done this as well in England amongst my
friends, as have gone live thousand miles ofi' to do it,
among strangers and savages in a wilderness, and at
such distauae, as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge ofmo.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour; no work to
be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used
to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon same
desolate island, that had nobody tnere but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men
reflect, that, when they compare their present condi-
tions with others that are worse. Heaven may oblige
them to make the exchange, and be convinced of their
former felicit , by their experience; I say. how just
has it been, t at the truly solitary life I reflector! on in
an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who
had so often unjustly compared it with the life. which
I then led, in which had I continued, I had in all
probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.

I was it: some degree settled in my measures for
carrying on the plantation, before my kind friend the
captain of the ship, that took me up at sea.- went
back: for the ship remained there, in providing his
loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three
months; when, telling him what little stock I had left
behind me in London, he gave me tnis friendly and
sincere advice : " Seignor Inglese," says he, for so he

brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it with
me. I went on the next year with great success in
my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on
my own ground, more titan I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours: and these fifty
rolls. being each of above one hundred weight, were
well cured and laid by against the return ofthe fleet

to make; all these miscarriages were procured by my
apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination
of wandering abroad, and pursuing that inclination,
in contradiction to the clearest views of doing mysell
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects
and those measures of life, which nature and Provi
deuce c0ncurred to present me with, and to make my
duty.

As I had done this in my breaking away from my
parents, so i could not be content now, butI must go
and leave the happy view i had of being a rich and
thriving man in my new rlantation, only to pursue a
rash and imtnoderate desrre of raising faster than the
nature of the thing admitted ; and thus I cast myscl!
down again into the deepest gulph ofhuman misery
that ever man fell into. or perhaps could be consist-
em with life and a stale ol'health in the world.

To come then by just degrees to the particulars of
this part of my story; you may suppose, that having
now lived almost four years in the Bmsils, and begin-
ning to thrive and prosper very well upon my plan-
tation, l had not only learnt the language, but had
contracted acquaintance and friendship among my
fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at St
Salvadore. which was our port; and that in my dis.
course among them, 1 had frequently given them an
account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea.

or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and
engrossed in the public, so that few Negroes were
bought, and those excessive dear.

It happened, being in company with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of those things very earnestly, three of them came to
me the next morning, and told me they had been
musing very much u on what I had discoursed with
them of, the last night, and they came to make
secret proposal to me ; and after en'oining me secrecy,
they told me, that they had a min to fit out a ship to

o to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well as
I, and were straitened for nothing so much as ser-
vants; that as it was a trade could not be carried on,
because they Could not ublicly sell the Negroeswhen
they came home, so tiey desired to make but one
voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately,' and
divide them among their own plantations; and in a
word, the question was, whether I would go their su-
percargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea? and they offered me that I
should have my equal share of the Negroes, without
providing any art of the stock.

This was a air proposal, it must he confessed, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable,
and with a good stock upon it. But for me, that was
thus entered and established, and had nothing to do
but go on as I had begun, for three or four years
more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds
from England, and who in that time, and with that
little addition, could scarce have failed of being worth
three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was
the most preposterous thing that ever man in such
circumstances could be guilty of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good

counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them 1
would go with all my heart, if they would undertake
to look after my plantation in my absence, and would
dispose of it to such asI should direct if I miscarried.
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings
or covenants to do so ; and I made a formal will,
disposing of my plantation and effects, in case of my
death, makin the captain of the ship that had save
my life as be ore, my universal heir, but obliging him
to dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will
one half of the produce being to himself, and the
other to be shipped to England,

In short I took all possible caution to reserve my
effects, and keep up my plantation: ha I used half
as much prudence to have looked into my own inter-
est, and have made a judgment of what [ought to
have done, and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an undertaking,
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
stance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with
all its common hazards; to say nothing of the reasons
I had to expect particular misfortunes to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dio-
tates of my fancy rather than my reason : and accord-
ingly the ship being fitted out, and the cargo furnish-
ed, and all things done as by agreement bytmy part-
ners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour,
the lst of September, 1659, being the same day eight
years that I went from my father and mother at Hull,
in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the
fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons
burden, carrying six guns, and fourteen men, besides

he master, his boy, and myself; we had on board no
arge cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit
for our trade with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of
glass, 'shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking.
glasses, knives, scissors, hatchcls, and the like.

Carribb'ee islands, and therefore resolveo to stand
away for Barliadoes, which by keeping all at sea, to
avoid the indrat't of the bay or gulf of Mexico. we
might easily erform, as we hoped, in about fifteen
days sail; w ereas we could not possibly make our
2 voyage to the coast of Africa without some assist-
, ance, both to our ship and ourselves.
5 With this design we changed our course, and steer
g etl away N. W. by W. in order to reach some of'our
zEnglish islands, where I hoped for relief ; but'our
voyage was otherwise determined; for being in the
latitude of12 deg. 18 min. a second storm came upon
us, which carried us away with the same impetuosity
t westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved,
as to the sea, we were rather in danger of being de-
voured by savages than ever returning to our own
country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men early in the morning cried out, Land!
and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look
out in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we
were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a mo-
ment, her motion being so stopped, the sen broke over
her in such a manner, that we expected we should
all have perished immediately; and we were imme-
diately driven into our close uarters to shelter us
from the very foam and spray o the sea.

g It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the

' like condition, to describe or conceive the consterna-

5 tion of men in such circumstances; we knew nothing

SS where we were, or upon what land it was we were-
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inha
bited or not inhabited: and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we
could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many
minutes without breaking in pieces, unless the wind:
by a kind oftniraele should turn immediately about.
in a word, we sat looking one upon another, and ex-
pecting death every moment, and every man acting

was little or nothing more for tts to do in this; that
which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was, that contrary to our expectation, the
snip did not break yet, and that the master said the
wind began to abate.

Now though we thought that the wind did a lit".

and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting off
we were iii a dreadful condition indeed, and had no-
thing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as
we could. We had a boat at our stern. just before the

but how to get her off into the sea was a doubtful
thing; however. there was no room to dehate, for we
fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute,
and some told us she was actually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat and with the help of the rest ofthe men they
got her slung over the ship's side. and getting all into
her, let go, and committed ourselves. being eleven in

the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea went
dreadful high upon the shore, and might well he cal-

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we
all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that the

drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if
we had. could we nut-e doneany thing with it: so we

After we had rowed or rather driven about.a league

with such a fury, that it overset the boat at once .
and separating us as well from the boat as from one

we were all swallowed up in a moment.

as furious as an enemy which I had no means at

toucem now being, that the sea, as it would carry me
a great way towards the shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave
back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at
once twenty or thirty foot deep in its own body; and
. could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftuess towards the shore a very great way; but I
held my breath, and assisted myself to swim still for5
ward with all my might. I was ready to burst with
holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up,
so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands
shoot out above the surface of the water; and though
it was not two seconds of time that 1 could keep my-
self so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and
new courage. I was covered again with water a good
while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding
the water had spentitself, and began to retum,l struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt
ground again with my feet. I stood still a few m0<
ments to recover breath, and till the water went from
me, and then took to my heels, and run with what
strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither
would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which
came pouring in after me again; and twice more I
was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as
before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well near been fatal
to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before,
landed me, or rather dashed me against a piece of a
rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless,
and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for
the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath
as t were quite out of my body; and had it returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the
water; but I recovered a little before the return of
the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with
the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock,
and so to hold my breath. if possible. till the wave
went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at

me so near the shore, that the next wave, though it

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to
look up and thank God that in; life was saved in a
case wherein there was some minutes before scarce
any room to hape. I believe it is impossible to ex-
press to the life what the ectasies and transports oi
the soul are, when it is so saved, asI may say, out
of the very grave; and I do not wonder now at that
custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who has the halo

turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him: I say,
I do not wonder that they bring a sturgeon with it, to
let him blood that very moment they tell him of it,
that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from
the heart, and overwhelm him :

For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands.

contemplation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe; reflect-

that there should not he one soul saved but myself;

sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, an
two shoes that were not fellows.

part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
see what Rim: of place I was in, and what was next
to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate,
and that in a word I had a dreadful deliverance; for
l was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thin?
either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did
see any prospect before me, but that of perisbing with
hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts; and that
which was particularly afllieting to me, was, that I
had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any
other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs:
in a word, I had nothing abottt me but a knife, 8
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was
all my provision, and thisthrew me into terrible ago-
nies of mind, that for a while] run aboutlike a mad--
man. Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
heart to consider what would be my lot if there were
any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing at night
they always come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time. was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir,
out thorny. which grew near me, and where l resolv-
ed to sit all night, and consider the next day what
death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of
life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see
ifl could find any fresh water to drink, which I did,
to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little
tobacco in my mouth to preve'nt'hunger, [went to
the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to place
myself so. as that if I should sleep, I might not fall,
and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for
my defence. l took up my lodging. and having been
excessively fatigued, lfell fast asleep, and slept as
comfortably as. I believe, few could have done in my
condition. and found myself the most refreshed with
it that I think i ever was on such an occasion.

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear,
and the storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and
swell is before; but that which surprised me most

was, that the shtp was lifted oil~ in the night from the
sand where she lay, by the swelling of tlte tide, son
was driven up almost as far as the rock which I first
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dash-
ing me against it; this being within about a mile from
the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand
upright still, I wished myself on board, that, at least
1 might save some necessary things for my use.

When I came dowtt from my apartment in the tree
I looked about me again, and the first thingI found
was the boat, which lay as the wind and the sea had
tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my
right hand. I w slked as far as I could upon the shore
to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of water
between me and the boat which was about half a mile
broad; so I came back for the present, being more
hitent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find
something for my present subsistence.

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and
the tide ebhcd so far out, that l could come within a
quarter ofo tnile ofthe ship; and here l found a fresh
renewing of thy grief: for I saw evidently, that if \VII
had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is to
say, we had all got safe on shore, and l had not been
so miserable as to he left entirely destitute of all com-
fort and company, as I now was. This forced tears
from my eyes again; but as there was little relief in
that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship; sol
pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to ex-
tremity, and took the water; but when I came to the
ship, tny difficulty was still greater to know how to
get on board; for as she lay aground, and high out oi
the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay

'iold of. I swam round her twice, and the second

time I espied a small piece ofa rope, tvhieh I wonder
tdl did not see at first, hang down by the litre-chains
tolow as that with great difficulty I got hold of it,
and by the help of that rope got u into the fore-castle

lay soon the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather
earth, and her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and
her head low almost to the water: by this means all
her quarter was free, and all that was in thal part was
dry ; for yort may be sure my first work was to search
and to see what was spoiled and what was free: and
first I found that all the ship's provisions were dry
and untouched by the water; and being very well dis-
posed to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled my
pockets with bisket. and ate it as I went about other
things, for 1 had no time to lose. I also found some
rum in the rent cabin, of which I took a large dram,
and which had indeet:l need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me. Now I .tt'anted-nothiug but

foresaw would be very necessary to me.

it was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not
to be had; and this extremity roused my application
We had several spare yards, and two or three large
spars of wood, and a spare teptuast or two in the
ship; I resolved to fall to work with these, and flung
as many of them overboard as l could manage of
'their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they
might not drive away. When this was done 1 went
down the ship's side. and pulling thetn to me] tied
four of them fast to ether at both ends as well as I

land all the planks or boards upon it that I could fet'

first got three of the seamen's chests, which I had
broken open and em tied. and lowered them down
upon my raft. The trst of these I filled with provio

a little remainder of European corn which had been
laid by {or some fowls which we brought to sea with
us, but the [owls were killed. There had been some
barley and wheat together. but, to my great disap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten
or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I found several cases
of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were
some cordial waters, and in all above five or six gal-
lons of rack: tltesel stowed by themselves, there being
no need to put them into the chest, nor no room for
them. While [was doing this, I found the tide began
to flow. though very calm, and I had the mortification
tn see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had
left on shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my
breaches, which were only linen, and open-knee'd, I
swam on board in them and my stockings: however,
this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I
found enough, but took no more than I wanted for
present use, forl had other things which my eye was
more upon; as. first, tools to work with on shore;
and it was after long searching that I found out the
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful

rize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-
oading ofgolil would have been at that time: I got
it down to my raft, even whole as it was, without
losing time to look into it. furl knew in general what
it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms.
There were two very good l'mvling-pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols: these I secured first, with some

rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels ol

two of them dry and good, the third had taken water,
those two I got to my raft, with the arms. And now
I thou ht myself pretty well freighted, and began to
think ow I should get to shore with them, having
neither sail, nar, or rudder, and the least capful of
wind would have overset all my navigation.

I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm
sea; 2. The tide rising and setting in to the shore; 3.
What little wind there was blewme towardsthe land :
and thus, having found two or three broken oars be-
longing to the boat, and besides the tools which were
in the chest, I found two saws, an axe, and a hammer:
and with this cargo I put to sea: for a mile, or there~
abouts, my raft went very well, only thatI found it
drive a little distant from the place where I had landed
before, by which I perceived that there was some in-
draft of the water, and consequently I hoped to find
some creek or river there, which I might make use
of as a port to get to land with my cargo.

As I imagined, so it was: there ap eared before
me a little opening of the land, and I {gund a strong

current of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as '

well as I could to keep into the middle of the stream ;
but here I had like to have suffered a second ship-
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for knowing nothingof the coast. my
rafttun aground at one end of it upon a shoal. and
not being aground at the other end, it wanted but a
little that all my cargo had slipped off towards that
end that was afloat. and so fallen into the water. I
did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests,
to keep them in their places, but could not thrust ofl
the raft with all my strength ; neither durstI stir from
the posture I was in. but holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in that manner nearhalfan hour.
in which time the rising of the water brought me a
little more upon a level; and a. little after, the water
still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her of?

was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping
the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the side

it did. As soon as] found water enough, for my raft

her by sticking my two broken oars into the ound;

that hill, where. after] had with reat labour and
ditficulty got to the top, I saw my ates to my great
atlliction, viz. thatl was in an island environed every
way with the see, no land to be seen, cxce t some
rocks which lay a great way off, and two smal islands
less than this, which lay about three leagues to the
west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren,
and as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, ere
cept by wild beasts, of whom, however, I saw none;
yet! saw abundance of t'owls, but knew not their
kinds; neither when I killed them could I tell what
was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back
I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree
on the side of a great wood--I believe it was the first
gun that had been fired there since the creation of the
world. I had no sooner fired, but from all parts of
the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls
of many sorts, makinga confused screaming, and cry-
ing every one according to his usual note; but not
one of them of any kind that I knew. As for the
creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its
colour and beak resembling it, but had no talons or
claws more'than common; its flesh was carrion, and
lit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, ,1 came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on sham,
which took me up the rest of that day; and what to
do with myself at night I knew not, nor indeed where
to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground,
not knowing but some wild beast might devour me;
though, as I afterwards found there was really no need
for those fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself
round with the chests and boards that I had brought
on shore, and made a kind of a hut for that night's
lodging As for food, I yet saw not which way to
supply myself, except that I had seen two or three

resolved to set all other things apart, till I got every
thing out of the ship that I could get. Then I caller!
a council, that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I
should take back the raft; but this appeared imprac.
ticable : so 1 resoived to go as before, when the tide
was down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I
went from my hut, having nothing on but a checked
shirt and a pair of linen trowsers, and a. pair of pumps
on my feet.

I got on board the ship, as before, and reparcd a
second raft; and having had experience 0!" the first, I
neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard,
but yet I brought away several things very useful to
me; as first, in the carpenter's stores I found two 0|
three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack,
a dozen or two of hatchets, and above all, that nmsl
useful thing called a grindstone; all these I secured.
together with several things belonging to the gunner
particularly two or three iron crows. and two barrel:
of musket-bullets, seven muskers, and anotherfowling-
piece, with some small quantity of powder more; a
large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet
lead ; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it
up to get it over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I look all the men's clothes
that I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock,
and some bedding; and with this [10? ded my second
raft, and brought them all safe on share to my very
great com fort. -

I was under some apprehensions during my absence

devoured on shore; but when I came back, I found
he sign of any visitor, only there sat a creature like a
wild cat upon one of the chests, which, when I came
towards it, ran away a little distance, and then stood
still; she sat very composed and unconcerned, and
looked full in my face, as if she had amind to be ac-
quainted with me; I presented my gun at her, but as
she did not understand it, she was perfectly uncon-
cerned at it, nor did she ofl'er to stir away; upon
which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way
I was not very free of it, for my store was not great;
however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she went to
it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked as pleased, for
more; but I thanked her, and could spare no more ;
so she marched oil".

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I
was fain to open the barrels of rowdcr and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
casks, I went to work to make me a little tent with
the sail and some poles which Icut for that purpose;
and into this tent brought every thing that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun; and I piled all
the empty chests and casks up in a circle round the
tent, to fortify it from any sudden attempt, either from
man or beast.

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the
tent with some boards within, and an empty chest set
up an end without, and spreading one of the beds
upon the ground, laying my two pistols just at my
head, and my gun at length by me, I went to bed for
the first time, and slept very uietly all night, for l
was very weary and heavy, as t te ni ht before I had
slept little. and had laboured very hart. all day, as well
to fetch all those things from the ship as to get them
on shore.

I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was
not satisfied still; for while the_ship sat upright in
dtat posture, I thought I ought to get every thing out

'her that I could : so every day at low water I went

on board, and brought away something or other; but
particularly the third time I went, I brought away as
much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small
ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a piece of spare
canvass. which was to mend the sails upon occasion,
and the barrel of wet gunpowder: in a word I brought
away all the sails first and last, only that I was t'ain
to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time a

I could ; for they were no more useful to he sails, bu

as mere canvass only.

But that which comforted me more still, was, that
at last of all, after I had made five or six such voyages
as these, and thought I had nothing more to expect
from the ship that was worth my meddling with; I
say, after all this, I found a great hogshcad of bread,
and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box
of sugar, and a barrel of fine flower; this was surpris
ing to me because I had given over expecting any
more provisions, except what was spoiled by the "'0-
ter: I soon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and
wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in piecesofthe sails,
which I cut out: and in a word, I got all this safe on
shore also.

The next day I made another voyage: and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable and
fit to hand out, I began with the cables: and cuttin
the great cable into pieces. such as I could move,
got two cables and a hawser on share, with all tlm
iron work Icould get ; and having out down the sprit
sail yard, and the mizen yard, and every thing i could
to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those neavy
goods, and came away: but my good luck began now
to leave me; for this rat't was so unwieldy and so
ovorladen, that afterl had entered the little cove wnerc
I had landed the rest of my goods, not being abie to
guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and
threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for
myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore,
hot as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, ospes
einlly the iron. which I expected would have been a.

great use to me: however, when the tide was out, I
got most of the pieces of cable ashore, and some of
the iron, though with infinite labour; for I was fair:
to dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued nee
very much. After this, I went every day on board,
and brought away what lcould get.

I had been new thirteen days on shore, and had
been eleven times on board the ship; in which time
I had brought away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring. though I believe
\'erily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but pie
paring the twelfth time to go on board, I found the
wind began to rise ; however at low water I went on
board, and though I thoughtl had rummaged the cabin
so effectually, as that nothing more could be found,
yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one
of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of
large scissars. with some ten ora dozen of good kuiv is
and forks; in another I found about thirty-six pounds
value in money, some European coin, some Brusil,
some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight ofthis money. " 0
drug 3" said I, aloud, " what art thou good for? thou
art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the

round; one of those knives is worth all this heap; l
nave no manner of use for thee; even remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose
life is not worth saving." However, upon second
thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all this in a
piece of canvass, I began to think of making another
raft, but while I was preparing this, I found the sky
overcast. and the wind began to rise, and in a quarter
of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. lt
presently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pro-
teud to make a raft with the wind offshore, and that
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, othertvise I might not be able to reach the shore
It all: accordingly I let myself down into the noter

I and swam across the channel which lay between the
ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty
enough, partly with the weight of things I had about
me, and parly the roughness of the water, for the wind _
, rose 'very hastily, and before it was quite high water
it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
lay with all my wealth about me very secure. it blew
t'erp hard all that night, and in the morning when I
looked out behold no more ship was to he seen. I
5 was a little surprised, but recovered myselfwith this
satisfactory reflection, viz. that! had lost no time, nor
SS abated no diligence to get every thing out ofher that
could be useful to me, and that indeed there was little
left in her that I was able to bring away, if] had had
I more time. .

f I now gave over any more thoughts of the Ship, or
ofany thing out of her, except what might drive on

' shore from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her

afterwards did; but those things were of small use 10
me.

5 My thoughts were now wholly employed about $9

curing myselt'against either savages, it'any should ap-

ar, or wild beasts, ifany were in the island; and l
tad many thoughts of the method how to tlo this, and
what kind of dwelling to make; whether l shoutu
make me a cave in the earth, ora tent upon the earth:
and, in short, I resolved upon both, the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to give
an account of.

[soon found the place I was in was not for my set-
tlement, particularly because it was upon a low moor-
isl'. wround near the sea, and I believed would not be
wholesome. and more particularly because there was

. no fresh water near it; so I resolved to find a more
healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation which I
found would be proper for me; lst, Health. and fresh
water, ljust now mentioned 2ndly. Shelterlrom the

Lures, whether man or beast. 4thly,A view to the
sea, that if God sent any ship in sight, 1 might not
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which 1 was
not willing to banish all my expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this,l found a little
plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards
this little plain was steep as a house-side, so that no-
thing could come down upon me from the top: on
the side of this rock there was hollow place worn a
little way in a like the entrance or door r-f a cave, but
therel was not really any cave or way into the rock
at al .

On the flat of the green,justbefore this hollow place,
I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was not above
an hundred yards broad. and about twice as long. and
lay like a green before my door, and at the end of it
descended irregularly every way down into the low
grounds by the sea-side. It was on the N. N. W. side
of the bill, so that I was sheltered from the heat every
day, till itcame to a W. and by 5. sun, or tbereabouts,
which in those countries is near the sitting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before
the hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its
semi-diameter from the rock. and twenty yards in its
diameter, from its beginning and ending.

In this half-circle [ pitched two rows of stron
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stoo
very firm, like piles. the biggest end being out of the
ground about five foot and a half, and sharppened on
the top; the two rows did not stand above six inches
from one another.

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in
the ship, and laid them in rows one above another,
within the circle between these two rows of stakes, up
to the tap, placing other stakes in the inside. leaning
against them, about two foot and a half high. like a
spur to a post : and this fence was so strong, that nei--
ther man or breast could, get into it or over it: this cost
me a great deal of time and labour. especially to cut
the piles in the woods, bring them to tlte (lace, and
drive them ittto the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a
door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top: which
ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me: and so
I wascompletely fenced in, and fortified, asI thought,
from all the world, and consequently slept secure in
the night, which otherwise I could not have done,
thouuh, as it appeared afterward, there was no need
of all this caution from the enemies that I apprehend-
ed danger from.

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition,
and stores, of which you have the account above; and
I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me from
the rains. that in one part of the year ttre very violent
there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent, within,
and one larger tent above it, and covered the upper-
most with a lage tarpaulin which I had saved among
the sails.

And now I lay no more for awhile in the bed which
I had brought on shore but in a hammock. which was
indeed a very good one, and belonged to the mate of
the ship. _

Into this tent I brought all my provisions. and every
thing that would spoil by the wet; and having thus
enclosed all my goods. I made up the entrance, which
till now I had left open, and so passed and repassed,
as I said, by a short ladder. '

When I had done this, I began to work my way in-
to the rock, and bringing all the earth and stones that
I dug down, out through any tent, I laid them up with-
In my fence in the nature ofa. terrace, that so it with
(fl the ground within about a foot and a half, and
thus I made me a cave just behind my tent, which
served me like a collar to my house.

It cost me much labour and many dat's, before all
these things were brought to perfection, and therefore
I must go back to some other things which took up

some of my thoughts. At the same time it happened,
after I had laid my scheme for the setting up my
tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain fall
ing from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of light
ning happened, and after that a great clap ofthunder,
us is naturally the eflectof it. I was not so much
surprised with the lightning, as I was with a thought
which darted into my mind as swift as the lightning
itself: 0 my owder! my very heart sunk within me,
when I thong it, that at one blast all my powder might
be destroyed: on which, not my defence only. but
the providing me of food, as I thought, entirely de-
pended: l was nothing near so anxious about my
own danger; though, had the powder took fire, I had
never known who had hurt me.

Such impression did thismake upon me, that, after
the storm was over, I laid aside all my works, my
building, and fortifviug, and applied myself to make
bags and boxes to separate the powder, and to keep
it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope, that, what-
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once,
and to keep it so apart, that it should not be possible
to make one part lire another. I finished this work
in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, whiclt
in all was about two hundred and forty pounds
weight, was divided in not less than a hundred par-
cels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not
apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in my
new cave, which in my fancy I called my kitchen;
and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very
carefully where Ilaid it.

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went
out once at least every day with my gun. as well to
divert myself, as to see ifl could kil. any thing fit fo.
food, and as near as I could to acquaint myself with
what the island produced. The first time I went ottt
I presently discovered that there were goats in the
Island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but than
't was attended with this tttisfot'tue to me, viz. that

they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that
:t was the most difficult thing in the world to come at
them. But I was not discouraged at this, not doubt-
ing but I might now and then shoot one, as it
soon happened; for after] had found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them : Iobserved,
if they saw me in the vallies, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright;
but if they were feeding in the vallies, and l was
upon the rocks, they took no notice of me; from
whence I concluded, that by the position of their
optics, their sight wasso directed downward, that they
did not readily see objects that were above them ; so
afterward I look this method; I always climbed the
rocks first to get above them, and then had frequent
ly a fair mark. The first shot! made among these
creatures I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid
by her which she gave suck to, which grieved me
heartily; but when the old one fell,'the kid stood
stock still by her till I came and took her u .i and not
only so; but when I carried the old one wit me upon
my shoulders, the aid followed me quite to my en--
closure; upon which I laid down the dam, and took
the kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in
hopes to have bred it up tame; but it would not eat;
so I was forced to kill it, and eat it myself. These
two supplied me with flesh a great while, for i ate
sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread espe-
cially) as much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it abso
lutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire in,
and fuel to burn; and what I (lid for that, as also
how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences!
made, I shall give a full account of in its place; but
I must first give some little account of myself, and of
my thoughts about living, which it may well be sup
posed were not a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as l
was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of the

course of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.
some hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary course
of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consi
der it as a determination of Heaven, that in this (le-
solate place, and in this desolate manner, I should
end my life. The tears would run plentifully down
my face when Imade these reflections; and some~
times I would expostulate with myself, why Provi-
dence should thus completely ruin his creatures, and
render them so absolutely miserable, so without help
abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such a life.

But something always returned swift upon me to
dieck these thoughts, and to reprove me; and partl-
cularly one day, walking with my gun in my hand by
the sea-side, l was very pensive upon the subject 0!
my present condition, when reason, as it were, ex-
postulating with me t'other way, thus: " Well, you
are in a desolate condition, his true, but pray remem-
ber, where are the rest of you? Did not you come
eleven of you into the boat? Where are the ten ? Why
were they not saved and you lost? Why were you
singled out? Is it better to be here or there ?" And
then I pointed to the sea. All evils are to be consi-
dered with the good that is in them, and with what
.vorse attended them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well Iwas {ur-
nished for my subsistence, and what would have been
my case if it had not happened, which was a hun-
dred thousand to one, that the ship floated from the
place where she first struck, and was driven so near
the share that I had time to get all these things out of
her. What would have been my case, if I had been
to have lived in the condition in which I at first came
on shore, without necessaries of life, or necessaries to
supply and procure them? " particularly," said I,
lead (though to myself), " what should i have done
without a gun, without ammunition, without any tools
to make any thing, or to work with ; without clothes,
bedding, a tent, or any manner of covering ?" and

that now I had all these to a sufficient quantity, and
was in a fair way to provide myself in such a man-
net, as to live without my gun when my ammunition
was spent; so thatl had a toleratle view of subsist-
ing, without any want, as long as I lived; for 1 com
sidered from the beginning how I should rovide for
the accidents that might happen, and or the time
hat was to come, even not only after mygatnmuni
ion should be spent, but even after tny health 0
trength should decay.

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my
powder being blown up by lightning , and this made
the thoughts of it so surprising to me when it light
mod and thundered, as I observetljust now.

And now, being about to enter into a melancholy
relation ofa scene of silent life, such perhaps as was
never heard of in the world before, [shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in its order, It
was, by my account, the 30m of September, when, in
the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this
horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its autum-
nal equinox, was almost just over my head, for l
reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the latitude
ofS) degrees 29. minutes north of the line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it
came into my thoughts, that I should k so my rcekow
ing of time for want of books, and pen and ink, and
should even forget the sabbath days from the working
days; but to prevent this, Icut it with myknife upon
a large post, in capital letters, and making it into a
great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first land-
ed, viz " I came on shore here on the 30th of Sep-
tember 1659." Upon the sides of this square post, I
out every day a notch with my knife, and every so--
venth notch was as long again as the rest, and every

.first day of the month as long again as that long one;

and thus i kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly. and
yearly reckoning of time.

tne many things which I broughtout ot' the ship in the
several voyages, which, as above mentioned, I made
to it, I got several things of less value. but not all less
useful to me. which I omitted setting down before t
as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels
in the captain's. mate's,gunner's, and carpenters keep
ing, three or four compasses, some mathematical in-
struments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of
navigation ; all which 1 huddled together, whether I
might want them or no. Also I found three very good
Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from England,
and which I had packed up among my things; some
Portuguese books also, and among them two or three
pupish prayer-books, and several other books; all
which I carefully secured. And I must not forget,
that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of "these
eminent history I may have occasion to say something
ln its place: for I carried both the cats with me; and
as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himsell,
nod swam on shore to me the day after I went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to
me many years; l wanted nothing that he could fetch
me, nor any company that he could make up to me ;
Ionly wanted to have him talk to me, but that he
could not do. As 1 observed before, I found pen,
ink, and paper, and l husbanded them to the utmost;
and I shall show, that while my ink lasted. I kept
things very exact; but after that was gone I could not,
for I could not make any ink by any means that 1
could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things,
notwithstanding all that I had amassed together; and
of these, this of ink was one, as also spade, pickaxe,
and shove], to dig or remove the earth; needles, pins,
and thread. As for linen, I soon learnt to want that
without much difficulty. '

This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habita-
tion ; the piles or stakes. which were as heavy as l

could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pro
aring in the woods. and more by far in bringing

Rome; so that I spent sometimes two days in cutting
and bringing home one of those posts, and athird day
in driving it into the ground ; for which purpose I
got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought
myself of one of the iron crows, which however,
though I found it, yet it made driving those posts or g
piles very laborious and tedious work.

ousness of any thingl had to do, seeing I had time
enough to do it in? Nor had I any other employment
if that had been over, at least that i could foresee,
except the ranging the island to seek for food, which
I did more or less every day.

i now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance l was reduced to, and I drew
up the state of my affairs in writing, not so much to
leave them to any that were to come after me, for l
was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and amicting
my mind ; and as my reason began now to master my
deswndcncy, l began to comfort myself as well as I
cordd, and to set the 00d against the evil that I might
have something to istinguish my case from worse ;
and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and cre-

68 'um AND ADVENTURES

I have already described my habitation, which was
a tent under the side of a rock. surrounded with a
strong pale of posts and cables ; hut I might now ra'
ther call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against
it of turfs, about two foot thick on the outside; and
after some time,l think it was a year and half, I
raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatch-
ed or covered it with boughs oftrees, and such things
as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at
some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how [brought all my goods
into this pale, and into the cave which I had made
behind me : but I must observe too that at first this
was a confused heap of goods, which as they lay in no
order, so they took up all my place : I had no room
to turn myself ; so I set myself to enlarge my cave,
and work farther into the earth ; for it was a loose
sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labour 1 be-
stowed on it : and so when I found I was pretty safe
as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right
hand into the rock; and then, turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to
come out, on the outside of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were
a back-way to my tent and to my storehouse, but
gave me room to stow my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, particu-
larly a chair and a table; for without these I was not
able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world ; 1
could not write or cat, or do several things with so
much pleasure without a table.

Sol wenmo work ,- and here I must needs observe,
hat as reason is the substance and original ofthe ma-
thematics, so by stating and squaring every thing hy
reason, and by making the most rationaljudgment of
things, every man may be in time master of'every
mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my life.
and yet in time, by labour, application, anti contriv-
uueeJ found at last that [wanted nothing but lcould

have made it, especially if I had had tools; however,
I made abundance of things, even without tools, and
some with no more tools than an adze and a hatchet,
which perhaps were never made that way before, and
that with infinite labour: for example, if! wanted a
board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set
it on an edge before me, and how it flat on either side
with my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a
plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It is
true, by this method I could make but one board out
of a whole tree; but this I had no remedy for but
patience, any more than I had for the prodigious
deal of time and labour which it took me up to make
u plank or board: but my time or labour was little
worth, and so it was as well employed one way as
4 another.
' However, I made me a table and a chair, as I ob-
; served above, in the first place; and this I did out of
the short pieces of boards that I brought on my raft
g from the ship: but when I had wrought out some
boards. as above, I made large shelves of the breadth
of a foot and a 'half one over another, all along one
nide of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-
5 work, and in a word, to separate every thing at large
in their places, that I might come easily at them. I
knocked pieces in the wall of the rock to hang my
guns and all things that would hang up.

So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things: and
I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it was a
great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such or-
der,- and especially to find my stock of all necessa-
nes so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a journal of
every day's employment; for indeed at first I was in
too much a hurry; and not only hurry as to labour.

stead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having first vomited with the great quantity of salt
water which was gotten into my stomach, and reco-
vering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing
my hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming
at my misery, and crying out, 1 was undone, undone;
till tired and faint I was forced to lie down on the
ground to repose, but durst. not sleep for fear of be-

Dome days after this, and afterl had been on board

could not forbear getting up to the top of aliltle
mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes ofseeinga

please myself with the hopes of it; and then after
ooking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite,
and sit down and weep like a child, and thus in-
crease my misery by my folly.

But having gotten over these things in some mea-

bitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my

had neither food. house, clothes, weapon, or place to
fly to, and in despair of any relief saw nothing but
dcnth before me. either that I should be devwrcd by
wild beasts, murdered by savages. or starved to death
for want of food. At the approach of night I slept
in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly,
though it rained all night.

October 1. [n the morning I saw, to In great sur-
prise, the ship had floated with the high ti e, and was
driven on shore again much nearer the island ; which
as it was some comfort on one hand, for seeing her
sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I he ed, if the
wind abated, I might get on board, an get some
food and necessaries out of her for my relief; so on
the other hand, it renewed my grief at the loss of my
comrades, who I imagined, if we had all staid on
board, might have saved the ship, or at least that they
would not have been all drowned, as they were; and
that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have
built us a boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have
carried us to some other part of the world. I s ent
great part of this day in perplexing myself on trese
things; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, 1
went upon the sand as near as Icould, and then
swam on hoard This day also it continued raining,
though with no wind at all.

From the ist of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in many several voyages to get all
I could out of the ship, which I brought on shore,

covering and securing the goods which I had saver).
that rain might not spoil them.

Oct. :26. I walked about the shore almost all day
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con-
cerned to secure mysell'from any attack in the night,
either from wild beasts or men. Towards night I
fixed upon a proper place tinder a rock. and marked
out a semicircle for my encampment, which I resolv-
ed to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortificfition
made of double piles, lined within with cable, and
without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.

The Si st in tbe morningl went out into the island
with my gun. to see for some food, and discover the
country; when I killed a she-goat, and her kid fol-
lowed me home, which I afterwards killed also, be:
cause it would not feed.

November 1. I set up my tent under a rock, and
lay there for the first night, making it as large asl
could with stakes driven in to swing my hammock
upon.

Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the
pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with them
formed a fence round me, a little within the place 1
had marked out for my fortification.

but a very sorry workman, though time and necessuy
made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as
. believe it would do any one else.

Nov. 5: This day went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft.

took off the skins and preserved them. Coming

ack by the sea-shore I saw many sorts of sea-{owls
which I did not understand ; but was surprised at A
almost frighted with two or three seals, which, while
I was gazing at, not well knowing what they were,
got into the sea, and escaped me for that time.

Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work
with my table again, antl'ftnished it, though not to my
liking; nor was it long before I learnt to mend it.

Nov. 7. Now it began to he settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for the
"lb was Sunday), I look wholly up to make me a
chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable
shape, but neverto please me; and even in the making
I pulled it in pieces several times. Note, I soon neg-
ltcted my keeping Sundays, for omitting my mark for
Liam on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was accom-
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder: as
men as it was over I resolved to separate my stock of

wder into as many little parcels as possible, that
it might not be in danger.

Nov. 14,15, 16. These three days I spent in making

ttle square chests or boxes, which might hold about
pound, or two pound, at-most, of powder; and so
utting the powder in, I stowed it in places as secure
nd remote from one another as possible. On one
of these three days I killed a large bird that was
good to eat, but I knew not what to call it.

min the rock, to make room for my farther conveni-
ency. .'V'otc, Three things I wanted exceedingly for
this work, viz. a pickaxe, a shovel, and a wheel-ban
row or uzisket; so I desisted from my work, and be-
gun to consider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools: as for a pickaxe, 1 made use of the
iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy; but the next thing was a shove or spade
this was so absolutely necessary, that indeed I could
do nothing effectually without it; but what kind of
one to make I knew not.

Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods!
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in the
Brasils they call the iron tree, for its exceeding hard-
ness: of this, with great labour and almost spoiling
my axe, 1 cut a piece, and brought it home too with
dilficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other wa , made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for worked it effectually by little and little
into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle exactly
shaped like ours in England, only that the broad part
having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not
last me so long; however, it served well enough for
the uses which 1 had occasion to put it to; but never
was a shovel, Ibelieve, made after this fashion, or
so long 3. making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket Ora
wheel-barrow; a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker-ware, at least none yet found
out ; and as to awheel-barrow, I fancied [could make
all but the wheel, but thatI had no notion of; neither
did I know how to go about it; besides, I had no pos.
sible way to make the iron gudgeons for the spindle
or axis ofthe wheel to run in, so I ve it over; and
so for carrying away the earth whic I dug out oftho
cave, I made me a thing like a bod which the labour-
ers carry mortar in, when the; serve the bricklayer:

This was not so difficult tu me as the making the

5 which I made in vain to make a wheel-barrow, took
5 me up no less than four days,I mean always except-
' ing my morning walk with my on, which I seldom
failed ; and very seldom faile also bringing home
something to eat.
1 Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they wer
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days on-
tirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
mi ht hold my goods commodiously.
I ate, During all this time, I worked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me as
a warehouse or magazine. a kitchen, a dining-room,
and a cellar: as for my lodging, Ikept to the tent,
except that sometimes in the wet season of the year,
it rained so hard that lcould not keep myself dry,
I which caused me afterwards to cover all my place
3 within my pale with long poles in the form of rafters,
l leaning against the rock, and load them with flags
and large leaves of trees like a thatch.
; Dec. 10. I began now to- think my cave or vault
5 finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had made in
too large) a great quantity ofearth fell down from the
top and one side, so much that in short it frighted me,
and not without reason too; for if I had been under
it I had never wanted a gravedigger. Upon this dis-
aster I had a great deal of work to do over again; for
I had the loose earth to carry out, and, which was of
more importance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that
1 might be sure no more would come down.

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two shores or posts pitched upright to
the top, with two pieces of boards across over each
post; this I finished the next day; and setting more
posts up with boards, in about a week more Ihad the
root' secured ; and the posts, standing in rows, served
me for partitions to part of? my house.

shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts to hano
every thing up that could be hung up: ar (I now
began to be in some order within doors.

Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnish my house, and set up some
pieces of boards like a dresser, to order my victuals
upon ; but boards began to be very scarce with me:
also I made me another table.

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no stir
rlng out. _

Dec. 25. Rain all day.

Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much colder than
before and pleasanter.

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
so that I caught it, and led it home in a string; when
I had it home, I bound and splintered up its leg,
which was broke. N. B. Itook such care of it that
it lived, and the leg grew well and as strong as ever;
but by nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed upon
the little green at my door, and would not go away.
This was the first time that I entertained a thought
of breeding up some tame creatures, that I might
have food when my owder and shot was all spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 30. 'reat heatsand no breeze; so that
there was no stirring abroad, except in the evening
for food. This time I spent in putting all my things
in order within doors.

January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early
and late with my gun, and lay still in the middle 01
the day. Thisevening, going farther into the vallies.
which lay towards the centre of the island, I found
there was plenty of goats, though exceeding shy and
hard to come. at; howeyer, I resolved to try if I
could not bring my dog to hunt them down.

Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day l went out with
my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I was this
taken, for they all faced about upon the dog; and he
knew his danger too well, for he would not'come

Itill jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I re-
solved to make very thick and strong.

N. B. This wall being describe before, I pur~
posely omit what was said, in the J oumal ; it
is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time
than from the 3d of January to the 14th of
April, working, finishing, and perfecting this
wall, though it was no more than about twenty-
four yards in length, being a half-circle from
one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it, the door of the cave being
in the centre behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hinder-
ing me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together ;
but I thought I should never be perfectly secure until
this wall was finished ; and it is scarce credible what
inexpressible labour every thing was done with, espe-
cially the bringing piles out of the woods, and driving
them into the ground, for I made them much bigger
than I need to have done.

When thiswall was finished, and 'he outside double
fenced with a turf wall raised up close to it, I per-
suaded myself that if any people were to come on
shore there, they would not perceive any thing like a
habitation ; and it was very well I did so, as may be
observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods
for me every day, when the rain admitted me, and
ma 6 frequent discoveries in these walks of somethin
or other to my advantage; particularly I found a kin
of wild pigeons, who built not as wood pi eons in a.
tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the ho es of the
rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did so ; but when they grew
older the flew away, which perhaps at first was for
want of ceding them, forl had nothing to give them;
however, I frequently found their nests, and got their
young ones, which were very good meat.

found myself wanting in many things, which' I

thought at first it was impossible for me to make, as
indeed as to some of them it was; for instance. I
could never make a cask to be hooped; I had a
small runlet or two. as I observed before, butI could
never. arrive to the capacity of makin one by them,
though I spent many weeks about it; could neither
putin the heads, or 'oint the staves so true to one
another as to make t em hold water: so I gave that
over also.

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle
so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was gene.
rally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed : I
remembered the lump of bees-wax with which I
made candles in my African adventure, but I had
none of that now ; the only remedy I had, was, that
wheuI had killed a goatl saved the tallow, and with
a little dish made of clay, which I baked in the sun,
to which I added a wick ofsome oakum, I made me
a lamp; and this gave me light, though not a clear
steady light like a candle. In the middle of all my
labours it happened, that, rummaging my things, I
found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been
filled with corn for the feeding of poultry, not for this

from Lisbon ; whatlittle remainder of com had been
in the bag, was all devonrded with the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and heing
willing to have the bag for some other use, I think it
was to put powder in, when I divided it for fear at
the lightning, or some such use, I shook the husks ct
corn out of it on one side of my fortification under

' the rook.

It was a little before the great rains, just now men
tioned. that] threw this stuff away, taking nonotice
of any thing, and not so much as remembering that I
had thrown any thing there ; when about a month
after or thereabout, I saw some few stalks of somov
thing green shooting out of the ground. which 1 fan.

surprised and perfectly astonished, when after a link

longer time 1 saw about ten or twelve cars come out,
which were perfect green barley of the same kind as
our European, nay, as our English barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious {Oundation at all ;
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any sense of any thing that
nad befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as
we lightly say, what pleases God ; without so much as
inquiring into the end of Providence in these things,
or his order in governing events, in the world; but
after I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I
knew was not proper for corn, and especially that I
knew not how it came there, itstartled me strangely,
and I began 10 suggest, that God had miraculously
caused this grain to grow without any help of seed
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sus
tenance on that wild miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself, that
such a progidy of nature should happen upon my ac-
count; and this was the more strange to me, because
I saw near it still, all along by. the side of the rock,
some other straggling stalks, which proved to be
stalks of rice, and which I knew, because I had seen
it grow in Africa, when I was ashore there.

not only thought these the pure productions oI
Providence for my support, but not doubting but that
there was more in the place, I went all over that part
of the island, where- I had been before, pt'cping in
every corner and under every rock tosee for more of
it, butI could not find any; at last it occurred to my
thought, that I had shcok a bag of chicken's meat out
in that place, and then me wonder began to cease;
and I must confess, my religious thankfnlness to
God's providence began to abate too upon discovering
that all this was nothing but- what was common;
though I ought to havr men as thankful for so strange
and U nfomseen a pr0\ mace as if it had been miracu-

lnus : for it was really the work of Providence us
me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve graim
of corn to remain unspoiled, when the rats had de-
stroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from
heaven ; as also, that I should throw it out in that
particular place, where, it being in the shade of a

igh rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas if I
had thrown it any where else at that time, it had been
burnt up and destroyed. -

l carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be sure
in their season, which was about the end of June. and
laying up every com, I resolved to sow them all
again, hoping in time to have some quantity sufficient
to supply me with bread ; but it was not till the
fourth year that I could allow myself the least gram
of this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly. as I
shall say afterwards in its order ; for I lost all that l
sowed the first season, by not observing the propel
time; for I sowed it just before the dry season, so
that it never came up at all, at least not as it would
have done: of which in its place.

Besides this barley there were, as above, twenty c t
thirty stalks of rice which I preserved with the 5am!
care, and whose use was of the same kind or to the
same purpose, viz. to make me bread, or rathu
food ; for I found ways to cook it up without baking,
though I did that also after some time. But to return
to my journal.

I worked excessive hard these three or four months
to get my wall done; and the 14th of April I closed
it up conniving to go into it, not by a door but ovet
the wall bya ladder, that there might be no sign in
the outside of my habitation.

April 16. I finished the ladder ; so I went up with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me,
and let it down on the inside: this was a complete
enclosure to me ; for withih I had room enough. and
nothing could come at me from without. unless it
could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I

had almost had all my labour overthrown at once, anti
myself killed ; tlte case was thus: As] was busy in
the inside of it behind my tent, just in the entrance
into my cave, i was terribly frightened with a most
dreadful surprising thing indeed ; for on a sudden i
found the earth come crumbling down from the root
of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over my
head and two of the posts I had set up in the cave
cracked in afrightful manner; [was heartily scared
but thought nothing of what was really the cause.
only thinking that the top of my cave, was falling, in
as some ofit had done before ; and for fear I should
be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and not
thinking myself safe there neither, I got over my wall
for fear of the pieces of the hill which I expected
might roll down upon me. 1 was no sooner slept
down upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was
a terrible earthquake, for the ground l stood on shook
three times at about eight minutes distance, with three
such shocks, as would have overturned the strangest
building that could be supposed to have stood on the
earth ; and a great piece of the top ofa rock, which
stood about half a tnile from me next the sea, fell
down with such a terrible noise as i never heard in
all my life : i perceived also the very sea was put in
violent motion by it : and I believe the shocks were
stronger under the water than on the island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never
felt the like, or discourscd with any one that had. that
i was like one (load or stupifted -, and the motion oi
the earth made my stomach sick, like one that was
tossed at sea ; but the noise of the falling of the rock
awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the stu-
pified condition I was in, tilled me with horror, and I
thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon '1."

for some time, I began to take courage, and yet I had
not heau enough to get over my wall again, for fear
of being buried alive, but sat still upon the ground,
greatly cast down and disconsolate, not knowing what
to do. All this while I had not the least serious reli-
gious thought, nothing but the common " Lord have
mercy upon me, I" and when it was over, that went
awav too. .

While Isat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow
cloudy. asif it would rain ; soon after that the wind
rose by little and little, so that in less than half an
hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane ; the sea was
all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth,
the shore was covered with the breach of the water,
the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible
storm it was 3 and this held about three hours, and

All this whileI sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came into
my thoughts, that these winds and rain being the con-
sequence of the earthqluake, the earthquake itself was
spent and over, and might venture into my cave
again ; with this thought my spirits began to revive,
and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in
and sat down in my tent; but the rain was so violent,
that my tent was ready to be beaten down with it;
and I was forced to go into my cave, though very
ppuch afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on my

ead.

The violent rain forced me into a new work, viz. to
cut a hole through my new fortification like a sink, to:
let water go out, which would else have drowned my
care. After I had been in my cave some time, and
found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow,
I began to be more composed; and now, to support
my spirits. which indeed wanted it very much,l went
to my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which
however I did then and always very sparingly, know
"mg I could lave no mura when that was gone.

0F ROBINSON CRUSOP. 83

It continued raining all that night, and great part of
he next day, so that! could not stir abroad ; out my

mind being more com osed, I began to think of what
I had best do, conclu ing that if the island was sub-
ieCK to these earthquakes, there would be no living for
me in a cave, but I must consider of building me
some little hut in an oxpeu place, which 1 might sur-
round with a wall as had done here, and so make
myself secure from wild beasts or men: but conclud-
ed, if I staid where l was, I should certainly, one
time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent
from the place where it stood, which was 'ust under
the hanging precipice of the hill, and w ich, if it
should be shaken again, would certainly fall u n my
tent. And I spent the two next days, being t e 19th
and 2(Jth of April, in contriving where and how to
remove my habitation.

The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that 1 never slept in quiet, and yet the apprehension
of lying abroad without any fence was almost equal
to it; but still, .whenI looked about and saw how
every thing was put in order, how pleasantly conceal-
ed Iwas, and how safe from danger, it made me very
loth to remove.

In the mean time it occurred to me that it would
require a vast deal of time for me to do this, and that
I must be contented to run the venture where I was,
till i had formed a camp for myself, and had secured
it so as to remove to it. So with this resolution 1
com osed myself for a time, and resolved that I
won d go to work with all speed to build me a wall
with piles and cables, 6w. in a circle as before; and
set my tent up in it when it was finished, but that I
would venture to stay where I was till it was finished
and fit to remove to. This was the Elist.

April 22. The next morning I began to consider 0!
means to put this resolve in execution, but] was at a
great loss about my tools. I had three large axes and
abundance of hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for

and cutting knotty hard wood. they were all uil of
notches and (lull ; and though I had a grindstone, I
could not turn it and grind my toolstoo : this cost me
as much thought as a statesman would have bestowed
upon a. grand point of politics, or a judge upon the
lite and death of a man. At lengtl~ I contrived a
wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I
might have both my hands at liltu-uy. Note, I had
never seen any such thing in England, or at least not
to take notice how it was done, though since I have
observed it was very common there ; besides that tny
grindstone was very large and heavy. This machine
cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.

April 23, 29. These two whole (lays I took up in
grinding my tools. my machine for turning my grind-
stone performing very well.

April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, now I took a survey of it and re-
duced myself to one biscuit-cake a day, which made
my heart very heavy. '

May 1. In the morning, looking toward the sea-
side, the tide being low, saw something lie on the
shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked like a cask;
when I came to it, I found a small barrel, and two or
three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which were
driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie
higher out of the water than it used to do. I examin-
ed the barrel which was driven on shore, and soon
found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken
water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however, I rolled it, farther on shore for the resent,
and went on upon the sand as near as I cool to the
wreck .of the ship, to look for more.

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely
removed ; the forecastle, which lay before buried in
sand, was heaved up at least six foot ; and the stern,
which was broke to pieces, and parted from the rest
by the force of the sea, soon after I had left rumma-

side, and the sand was thrown so high on that side
next her stern, that whereas there wasa great place of
water before, so that I could not come within a quar-
ter ofa mile of the wreck without swimming, I could
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I
was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded tt
must be done by the earthquake: and as by this vio-
lence the ship was more broken open than formerly
so many things came daily on shore, which the sea
had loosened, and which the winds and water rolled

of removing my habitation ; and I husied myself
mightily, that day especially, in seat-chin whether I
could make any way into the ship; but found no-
thing was to be expected of that kind, forthat all the
inside of the ship was choked up with sand : however
as I learnt not to despair of any thing, I resolver.
to pull every thing to pieces that I could of the ship,
concluding, that every thing I could get from her
would he ofsome use or other to me.

May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece ofa
beam through, which I thOught held some of the upper
part or quarter-deck together, and when I had cut it
through, I cleared away the sand as well as I could
from the side which lay highest; but the tide coming
in, I was obliged to give over for that time.

May. 4. I went a'fishin , but caught not one fish
that I durst eat at, till i was weary of my sport;
when just going to leave off, [caught a young dol hin.
I had made me a long line of some rope-yarn. ut I
had no hunks, yet I frequently caught fish enough, as
much as I cared to eat; all which 1 dried in the sun,
and ate them dry.

May 5. Worked on the wreck, out another beam

the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on

bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work,
worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts ofgiving it over.

May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent
not to work, but found the weight of the week had
broke itself down, the beams being cut, that several
pieces of the ship seemed to lie loose, and the inside
of the hold lay so open, that I could see into it, but
almost full of water and sand.

not break them up: Ifelt also the roll of English

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if Icoutti
not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing the
edge of one hatchet and driving it with the other;
but as it lay about a foot and a half in the water, I
could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.

May 16. It had blown hard in the night, and the
wreck appeared more broken by the force of the
water; but I staid so long in the woods to get pigeons
for food, that the tide prevented me going to the
wreck that day.

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on

resolved to see what the were. and found it was a

except the time necessary to get food, which I always
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be
when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it
was ebbed out; and by this timeI had gotten timber,
and plank, and iron-work enough to have built a good
boat, if I had known how; and also I got at several
times, and in several pieces, near one hundred weight
of the sheet-lead. '

June 16. Going down to the sea-side, I found a
large tortoise or turtle: this was the first I had seen,
which it seems was only my misfortune, not any de-
fect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened to
be on the other side of the island, I might have had
hundreds of them every day, as I found afterwards; '
but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.

threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at that time
the most savory and pleasant that ever hosted in my
life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since
I landed in this horrid place.

June 18. Rained all day, and stayed within. I
thohght at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in that
latitude. '

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forwards towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand to kill me ; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me.
or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to
express the terror of it ; all that I can say I under-
stood was this, " Seeing all these things have not
brou. ht thee to repentance, now thou shalt die ;" at
whic words I thought he lifted up the spear that was
in his hand to kill me.

No one, that shall ever read this account, will ex-
pect that I should be able to describe the horrors nl
my soul at this terrible vision; l mean, that even whib
it was a dream, I even dreamed of those horrors;
nor is it any more possible to describe the impression
that remained upon my mind, when I awaked, and
found it was but a dream.

I had, alas ! no divine knowledge ; what I had re
oeived by the good instruction of my father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight years,
of seafaring wickedness, and a constant conversation
with nothing but such as were, like myself, wicked
and profane to the last degree. I do not remember
that I had in all that time one'thought that so much
as tended either to looking upwards toward God, or
inwards towards a reflection u on my own ways.
But acertain stupidity ofsoul, wrtbout desire of good,
or conscience of evil, had entirely overwhelmed me,
and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors can be
supposed to be, not having the least sense, either of
the fear of God in danger, or of thankfulness to God
in deliverance.

In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, whenl shnll mhl.
that through all the variety of miseries that had In

on it as a judgment : I only said to myselfof'ten, that
I was an. tut/hrlmmle dog, and born to be always
miserable. .

It Is true, when I got on shore first here, and found
all my ships crow drowned. and myself spared, I was
surprised with a kind ofextasy, and some transport:
of soul, which, had the' grace of God assisted, might
have come up to truethankfulncss; but it ended where
it begun, in a mere counnon {light of joy, or, as I
may say, being glad I was alive, withOut the least
reflection upon the distinguishinggoodncssofthe Hand
which had preserved me, and had singled me out to
he preserved, when all the rest were destroyed ; or an
'nquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
me ; even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they have got safe on
shore from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the
next bowl of punch, and forget almost as soon as it is
over; and all the rest ofmy life was like it.

Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration,
made sensible of my condition, how I wascast on this
dreadful place, out nfthe reach of human kind, outoI
all hope of relief, or prospect of redemption, as soon

as I saw but a prospect of living and that I should
not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of my
affliction were off, and I began to be very easy, ap-
plied myself to the works proper for my preservation
and supply, and was far enough from being afflicted
at my condition, as a judgment from Heaven, or as
the hand of God against me: tliese were thoughts
which very seldom entered into my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
uurnal, had at first some little influence upon me, and
began to atl'ect me with seriousness, as long as I-
thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon
as ever that part of thought was removed, all the im-
ression which was raised from it wore ofi' also, as I

tare noted already. '

Even the earthquake, though nothing can he more
terrible in its nature, or more inunediatelv directing
to the invisible Power which alone directs such things;
yet no sooner was the first fright over, but the im-
pression it had made went ofi' also. 1 had no more
sense of God or his judgments, much less of the pre-
sent aflliction of my circumstances being from his
hand, than if 1 had been in the most prosperous con-
ditinn oflife. _.

But now, when Ibegan to be sick, and a leisurely
view of the miseries of death came to place itself lie-
fare me; when my spirits began to sink under the
burden of strong distemper, and nature was exhaust-
ed with the violence ofthe fever; conscience, that had
slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach
myselfwith my past life, in which I had so evidently.
by uncommon wickedness, provoked the justice of
God to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to dca
with me in so vindictive a manner.

These reflections oppressed me from the second of
third day of my distemper. and in the violence, as
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my
conscience. extorted some words from me like pray-
ing to (ind. though I cannot say they were either a
prayer attended with desires. or with hopes ; it was

rather the voice of mere fright .and distress, my
thoughts were confused, the convictions great upon
my mind, and the horror of dying in such a miserable
condition, raised vapours into my head with the mere
apprehensions; and, in these hurries of my soul, I
knew not what my tongue might express: but it was
rather exclamation, such as, " Lord 5 what a misera.
le creature am I I If I should be sick, I shall cer-
ajnly die for want of help, and what will become of
me !" Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could
say no more for a good while. ,

In this interval. the good advice of my father came
to my mind; and presently his prediction, which I
mentioned in the beginning of this story, viz. that if I
did take this foolish step, God would not bless me,
and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon hav-
ing neglected his counsel, when there might be none
to assist in my recovery. " Now," said I aloud,
" my dear father's words are come to pass: God's
{ustice has overtaken me, and I have none to help or
tear me: I rejected the voice of Providence, which
had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life
wherein I might have been happy and easy; but I
would neither see it myself, nor learn to know the
blessing of it from my parents; I left them to mourn
over my folly, and now I am left to mourn under the
consequences of it; I refused their help and assisb
ance. who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me; and now I
have dilliculties to struggle with, too great for even
nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help,
no comfort, no advice." Then l cried out, "Lord be
my help, for I am in great distress. !"

This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
Jhad made for many years. Bull return to my
journal.

June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the lit being entirely off, I
got up ; and though the fright and terror of my dream
was very great, yet I considered, that the fit of the

ague would return again the next day, and now was
my time to get something to refresh and support my-
self when I should be ill ; and the first thing l (lid,
I filled a large square case-bottle with water, and set
it upon my table, in reach of my bed ; and to take
all" the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I put
about a quarter ofa pint of rum into it, and mixed
them together; then I got me a piece of the goat's
flesh and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very
little. [walked about, but was very weak, and withal
very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense of my mi-
serable condition, dreading the return of my distem-
per the next day. At night I made my supper 0!
three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes,
and ate, as we call it, in the shell ; and this was the
first bit of meat I had ever asked God's bleSSing to,
even. as I could remember, in my whole life.

After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found my
self so weak that I could hardly carry the gun (for I
never went out without that) : so I went but a little
way, and sat down upon the ground, looking out upon
the sea, which was just before me, and very calm and
smooth. As I sat here. some such thoughts as these
occurred to me :

What is the earth and sea of which I have seen so
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I, and
all the other creatures. wild and tame, human and
brutal? whence are we ?

Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
is that.

Then it followed most naturally: it is God that
has made it all : well, but then it came on strangely ;
if God has made all these things, he guides and gov-
erns them all, and all things that concern them ; for
the Being that could make all things, must certainly
have power to guide and direct them.

Ifso, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his
works, either without his knowledge or appointment.

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he

knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful condi
tion: and if nothing happens without his appointment.
he has appointed all this to befal me.

Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any
of these conclusions; and therefore ll. rested upon me
with the greater force, that it must needs be, that God
had appointed this to befal me ; that I was brought
to this miserable circumstance by his direction, he
having the sole power, not of me only, but of every
thing that happened in the world. Immediately it
followed.

Why has God done this to me ? What have I done
to be thus used ? -

My conscience presently checked me in that inqui-
ry, asif I had blasphemed; and methought it spoke to
me like a voice _; " Wretch ! dost thou ask what thou
hast done? look back upon a dreadful mispent life,
and ask thyself what thou hast not done ? .ask, why is
it that thou wert not long ago destroyed? why wert
thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the
gin when the ship was taken by the Sallce man of
war? devoured by the wild beasts on the coast 0!
Africa ? or drowned here, when all the crew perished
but thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I done ?"

I was struck with these reflections as one astonish-
ed, and had nota word to say, no, not to answer to
myself ; but rose up pensive and sad, walked back
to my retreat and went up over my wall, as if I had
been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly dis-
turbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; so I sat
down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began
to be dark. Now as the apprehensions, of the return
of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred
to my thought that the Brasilians take no physio but
their tobacco, for almost all distempers ; and I had a
piece of a roll oftobacco in one of the chests, which
was quite cured, and some also that was green, and
not quite cured. '

Iwent, directed by Heaven, no doubt; for in this
chest I found acure both for soul and body. lopened

the chest, and found what I looked for, viz. the to-
bacco; and as the few books I had saved lay there too,
I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned be--
fore, and which, to this time, I had not found leisure,
or so much as inclination, to look into; I say I took
it out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me
to the table.

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not as to
my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no ;
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was re-
solved it should hit one way or other: I first took a

iece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which
Indeed at first almost stupified m brain, the tobacco
being green and strong, and that had not been much
used to it; then I took some, and steeped it an hour
or two in some rum, and resolved to take a dose of
it when Ilay down ; and lastly, l burnt some upon a.
pan of coals, and held my nose close over the smoke
of it, as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat

> its the virtue of it, and I held almost to suffocation.

In the interval of this operation I took up the Bible,
and began to read ; but my head was too much dis-
turbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at least at
that time ; only having opened the book casually, the
lisrt words that occurred to me were these: " Call on
me in the day oftrouble, and I will deliver, and thou
shalt glorify me." *

The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did after-
wards ; for as for being delivered, the word had no
sound as I may say, to me; the thing was so remote,
so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I
began to say as the children" of Israel did, when they
were promised flash to eat, " Can God spread a table
in the wilderness ?" So I began to say. Can God him-
self deliver me from this place? And as it was not
for many years that any hope appeared, this prevaiiud
very often upon my thoughts : hut, however. the
words made a vet y great impression upon me, and l

Inuscd upon them very often. It grew now late, and
the tobacco had, as I said, dozed my head so much,
that l inclined to sleep; so that I left my lamp burn-
ing in the cave, lest I should want any thing in the
night and went to bed ; but before I lay down, I did
what I never had done in all my life: I kneeled down,
and prayed to God to fulfil the romise tome, that
ifl called upon him in the day 0 trouble, he would
deliver me. After my broken and im erfect prayer
was over, I drank the rum in which lJ had steeped
the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the to-
bacco, that indeed l could scarce get itdown. Imme-
diately upon this I went to bed, and I found resently
it flew up into my head violently ; but I fel into a
sound sleep, and waked no more, till by the sun it
must necessarily be near three o'clock in the afternoon
the next day ; nay, to this hour I am partly of the
opinion that I sle tall the next day and night, and
till almost three the day after ; for otherwise I knew
not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in
the days of the week, as it appeared some years after
I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and re-
crossing the line, I should have lost more than a day;
but in my account it was lost, and I never knew
which way.

Be that however one way or other; when I awak-
ed, 1 found myself exceedingly refreshed, and my
spirits lively and cheerful; when I got up, I was
stronger than I was the day before, and my stomach
better ; for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit
the next day, but continued much altered for the bet-
ter: this was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far : I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them : so I ate some more of the
:urtle's e gs, which were very good. This evening]
renewed tie medicine which I had supposed did me
good the day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum;

only I did not take so much as before, nor did I chew
troy of the leaf, or hold my head over the smoke;
however, I was no so well the next day, which was
due lst ofJuly. as I hoped I should have been; for]
bad a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.

July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three ways,
and dozed myself with it at first, and doubled the
quantity which I drank.

July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I
did not recover my full strength for some weeks after.
Whilel was thus gathering strength, my thoughts ran
exceedingly upon thisscri lure, " I will delivcrthee;"
and the impossibility o my deliverance lay much
upon my mind. in bar of my ever expecting it: but as
I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it oc-
curred to my mind, that 1 mod so much upon my
deliverance from the main a iction, that I disregard-

were. made to ask myself such questions as these;
viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too,
from sickness? from the most distressed condition
that could he, and that was so frightful to me? and
what notice had 1 taken ofit? had I done my part?
God had delivered me: but I had not glorified him.-
that is to say, I had notowned and been thankful for
that as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater
deliverance?

This touched my heart very much, and immedi.
ately Iknccled down, and gave God thanks aloud,
for my recovery from my sickness. .

July 4. In the morning I took the Bible; and, be
ginning at the New Testament. I began seriously to
read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. it was not long after I set seri-
ously to this work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my past

life: the impression of my dream revived. and the

words, " All these things have not brought thee to re
pentance." ran seriously in my thoughts: Iwas ear-
nestly begging of God to give me re renlance, when it
happened providentmlly the very ay, that, readin
the Scripture, I came to these words, " He is exalte
a Prince, and a Saviour. to give repentance, and to
give remission." I threw down the book, and with
my heart as well as my hand lifted up to heaven, ina
kind of ecstacy of joy, I cried out aloud, " Jesus,
thou Son of David. Jesus, thou exalted Prince and
Saviour, give me repentance 5"

This was the first time that] could say, in the this
sense of the words, that] prayed in all my life; for
now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and with

. a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the encou-

ragement of the word of God; and from this time, I
may say, I began to have hope thatGod would hear me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, "Call on me, and I will deliver thee," in a
different sense Ii'om what I had ever done before; for
then I had no notion of any thing being called deli
verauce, but my being delivered from the captivity I
was in: for though I was indeed at large in the place,
yet the island was certainly a prison to me, and that
in the worst sense in the world ; but now I learnt to
take it in another sense. NowI looked back upon
my past life with such horror, and my sins appeared
so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of God, but
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all
my comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing;
I did not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or
think of it; it was all of no consideration in comv
parison of this: and I added this part here, to hint tn
whoever shall read it, that whenever they come to a
true sense of things, they; will find deliverance from
sin a much greater blessing than deliverance from
aflliction.

But leaving this part, I return to my journal.

My condition began now to be, though not leso
miserable as'to my way of living, yet much easrer to

my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a con-
stant reading the Scripture, and prayin to God, to
things of a higher nature, I had a great eal of com-
t'ort within, which till now I knew nothing of: also
as my health and strength returned, I bestirred my-
self to furnish myself Wllh every thing that I wanted,
and make my way of livin as regular as I could.
From the 4th ofJuly to t te 14th, I was chiefly em-
ployed in walking about with my gun in my hand a
ittle and a little at a time, as a man that was gather--
ing up his-strength after a fit of sickness ; for it is hard-
ly to be imagined how low I was, and to what weak-
ness I was reduced. The application which I made
use of was perfectly new, and perha 5 what had
never cured an ague before; neither can recommend
it to any one to practise by this ex crimenl: and
though it did carry off the fit, yet it rat ter contributed
to weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions in my

nerves and limbs for some time.

I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in those
rains which came attended with stormsand hurricanes
ofwind; for as the rain which came in a dry season
was always most accompanied with such storms, so I
found this rain was much more dangerous than the
min which fell in September and October.

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten
months; all possibility of deliverance front this con-
dition. seemed to be entirely taken from me; and I
firmly believed that no human shape had ever set
foot upon that place. Having now secured my habi-
tation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the island,
and to see what other productions I might find, which
yet I knew nothing of.

It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular survey of the island itself. I went u the
truck first, where. as I hinted, I brought my re. s on
shore. I found, after I came about two miles up, that

the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no
more than a little brook of running water, and very
fresh and good: but this being the dry season, there
was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least not
enough to run into any stream, so as it could be
perceived.

0n the bank of this brook I found many pleasant
savannasor meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with
grass; and on the rising parts of them next to the
higher grounds, where the water, as it might be sup-
posed, never overflowed. I found a great deal of to-
bacco, green, and growing to a great and ver strong
stalk ; there were divers other plants which had no
notion of. or understanding about; and might perhaps
have virtues of their own, which lcould not find out.

I searched for the cassave root. which the Indians
in all that c1itnate make their bread of, but I could
find none. I saw large plants of aloes. but did not
then understand them: I saw several sugar-canes, but
wild. and, for want ofcultivation, imperfect I cou- ,
tented myself with these discoveries for this time, and -

when I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes

kill ed several of our Englishmen who were sluves

'here, by throwing them into fluxes and favors: but I g
round an excellent use for these grapes. and that was g
to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried

grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, E
as indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable '
to eat when no grapes might be had.

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to
my habitation, which by the way was the lirst night. 5
as I might say, I had lain from home. In the night I '
took my first contrivance, and got up into a tree, E
where I slept well, and the next moming proceeded (
upon my discovery, travelling near four miles, asl 3
might judge by the length of the valley, keeping still 5
5. the north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north

side of me.
At the and of this march I came to an opening,
, where the country seemed to descend to the west; and
5 a little spring of fresh water, which issued out of the
i . side of the hill by me, ran the other way. that_is. due
east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green. so g
flourishing, every thing being in a constant venture or
I'ourish of spring. that it looked like a planted garden. 3
I descended a little on the. side of that delicious val-
ley, surveying itwith a secret kind ofpleasure (though
i mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to think that this
was all my own, that I was king aml lord of all this
country indefeasibly, and had a right at possession;
and ifI could convey it, I might have it in inheritance,
as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I
I saw here abundance afcocoa-trees. Jrange and lemon,
and Citron-trees, but all wild, and few hearing any
fruit: at least, not then: however the green limos that
Igatltered were not Only pleasant to eat, but very
wholesome; and I mixed theirjuice afterwards with
water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool
and refreshing.

I found now I had business enough to gather and
carry home; and resolved to lay up a store, as welltl

grapes as limes and lemons. to furnish myself for the
wet season, which I knew was approaching.

In order to do this I gathered a great heap of grapes
tn one place, and a lesser heap in another place, and
a great parcel of limes and lemons in another lace;
and taking a few of each with me, I travelled ome-
ward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or
sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home

Accordingly, having spent three days in this jour
my, I came home (so I must now call my tent, and
my cave :3, but before I gm thither, the grapes were
spoiled; t e richness of the fruit, and the weight of
the juice, having broken them, and bruised them, they
were good for little or nothing : as to the limes, they
were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having
made me two small bags to bring home tny harvest:
But I was surprised when coming to my heap of
grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered
them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to pieces,
and dragged about, some here, same there, and abun-
dance eaten and devoured. By this [concluded there
were some wild creatures the'reahouts, which had
done this; but what they were I knew not.

However; as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the other
way they would be crushed with their own weight, I
took another course; for I gathered a large quantity
of the ra es, and hung them upon the out branches
ofthe trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, Icontem-

ated with great pleasure on the fruitfulness of that
valley, and the pleasantness of the situation, the secu-
rity from storms on that side of the water, and the
wood ; and concluded that] had pitched upon a pla'ce
to fix my abode, which was by far the worst part at
mt~ countrv. Upon the wlmle,l began to cunsulot

of removmg my habitation, and to look out for a
place equany safe as where I now was situated, it
possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the island.

This thought ran long in my head, and I was ex-
ceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasantness o'
the place tempting me: but whenI came to a nearer
view of it, and to consider that I was now by the sea
side, where it was at least possible that something
might happen to my advantage, and that the same ill
fate that brought me hither, might bring some other
unhappy wretches to the same place ; and though it
was scarce probable that any such thin should ever
happen, yet to enclose myself among tie hills and
woods, in the centre of the island was to anticipate
my bondage, and to render such an affair not only
improbable, but impossible ; and that therefore I
ought not by any means to remove.

However, [was so enamoured with this place, that
I spent much of my time there for the whole reinain~
ing part of the month of July ; and though, upon se-
cond thoughts,I resolved as above, not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind ofa bower, and surround-
ed it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled
between with brushwood; and here I lay very secure,
sometimes two or three nights together, always going
over it with a ladder, as before ; so that I fancied now
I had my country house, and my sea-coast house t
and this work took me up the be inning of August.

I had but newly finished my ence, and began to
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made
me stick close to my first habitation : for though I had
made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail,
and spread it very well, yet I had not the shelter of
an hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me
to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower and began to enjoy myself. The
3d of August I found the grapes I had hung up were
perfectly dried. and indeed were excellent good raisins

of the sun; so I began to take them down from the
trees, and it was very happy that 1 did so; for the
rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I
natl lost the best part of my winter food ; for I had
above two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner
had [taken them all (lawmand carried most of them
home to my cave, but it began to rain ; and from
thence, which was the 14th of August, it rained war

or less everyday, till the middle of October; an

sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out o
my cave for several days.

In this season I was much surprised with the in-
crease of my family: Iliad been concerned for the
loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or,
as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no more
tale or tidings of her. till to my astonishment she came
home about the end of August, with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because though I
had kilIed a wild cat as I called it, with my gun, yet
I thought it was a quite different kind from our Euro-
pean cats; yet the young cats were the same kind oi
house breed like the old one; and both my cats being
females, I thought it very strange : but from these
three cats I afterwards came to be so pcstered with
cats, that I was forced to kill them like vermin, or
wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much
as ossible.

mm the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain,
so that 1 could not stir, and was now very careful not
to be much wet. In this confinement I began to he
straitened for food; but venturing out twice. I one
day killed a goat: and the last day, which was tie
26m, found a very large tortise which was a treat to
me, and my food was regulated thus : I ate a bunch
of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for, to my
great misfor'une, I had no vessel to boil or stew any
thing ;) and two or three of the turtle's eggs for supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my

side, till I came to the outside oi the hill, and made
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or
wall; and so I came in and out this wa : but! was

unhappy anniversary of my landing: Icasl up the
notches on m post, and found I had been on shore
thre'e hundre and sixty-live days. Ikept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious exer-
:ise. prostrating myself to the ground with the most

I serious humiliation, confessing myself to God ne-
5 knowledging his righteous judgment upon me, and
raying to him to have mercy on me, through Jesus
Ehrist; and having not tasted the least refreshment
for twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun,
I then ate a biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and

went to bed, finishing the day as Ibegan it.

I had all this time observed no sabbath-day ; for as
At firstl had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had
after some time omitted to distinguish the weeks. by
making a longer notch than ordinary for the sabbath-
iay, and so did not really know what any of the days
were; but now, having cast up the days as before, I
found I had been there a year; so I divided it intn
weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a sabbath;
though I found at the end of my account I had lost
I day or two of my reckoning.

A little after this my ink began to fail me and so I
contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to
write down only the most remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of
other things.

appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide them so
as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought all
my experience before I had it; and this I am going to
relate. was one of the most discouraging experiments
that I made at all. I have mentioned, that I had saved
the few ears of barley and rice which i had so sur-
prisingly found spring up, as I thought. ofthemselves,
and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and
mmut twenty of barley: and now I thought it a pro-
per time to sow it after the rains, the sun being in its
southern position going from me.

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as
I could, with my wooden spade, and divrding it into
two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it
casually occurred to my thought, that I would not
sow it all at first, because I did' not know when was
the proper time for it: so Isowed about two thirds of
the seeds, leaving about a handful of each.

It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did
so, for not one grain of that I sowed this time came
to any thing; {or the dry months following, the earth
has ving had no rain after the seed was sown, it had
no moisture to assist its growth, and never came up
at all, till the wet season had come again, and then
it grew as if it had been newly sown.

Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought {or a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I du
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and sowe
the rest of my seed in February, alittle before the
vernal equinox; and this,-having the rainy months
of March and April to water it, s rung up very plea-
santly, and yielded a very goo crop; but havin
part of the seed left only, and not daring to sow al
that] had yet, I had but a small quantity at last, my
whole crop not amounting to above half a peek of
each kind.

. But by this experience I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly when the proper season

was to sow; and that I might expect two seed-times,
and two harvests, every year.

While this corn was growing, I made alittle disco-

very, which was of use to me afterwards. As soon
as the rains were over, and the weather began to set-
tle, which was about the month of November, I
made a visit up the country to my bower, where
though I had not been some months, yet 1 found all
hings just as I left them. The circle or double
hedge that l had made, was not only firm and entire,
but the stakes which I had cut 03' of some trees that
grew thereabonts, were all shot out, and grown with
long branches, as much as at Willow tree usually
shoots the first year after lopping its head. I could
not tell what tree to call it that these stakes were cut
from. I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to
see the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and
led them up to grow as much alike as I could; and
it is scarce credible, how beautiful a figure they grew
into in three years; so that though the hedge made a
circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the
trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered
it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge
under all the dry season. i

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle round
my wall, I mean that of my first' dwelling, which I
did ; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row,
at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they
grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my
iahitation, and afterwards served for a defence also,
as I shall observe in its order.

I 'fnund now, that the seasons of the you: might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter, as

in Europe, but into the rainy "seasons and the dry '

seasons, which were generally thus:

experience, the ill consequence of being abroad in the
rain, I took care to furnish myself with provision be-
fore-hand, that 1 might not be obliged to go out; and
I sat within doors as much as possible during the wet
months.

In this time I found much employment, (and very
suitable also to the time) for I found teat occasion
of many things which! had no way to urnislt mysell
with, but by hard labour anti constant application;
particularly, i tried man ways to make myself a
basket; but all the twigs could get for the purpose
proved so brittle, that they world do nothing. it

raved of excellent advantage to me now, that when

was a boy I used to take great delight in standing at
a basket maker's in the town where my father lived,
to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as
hnys usually are, very officious to help, and a grea
observer of the manner how they worked those things,
and sometimes lent an hand. I had by this means so
full knowledge of the methods of it, that i wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence l cut

swallows, and willows, and osiers, in England; and
I resolved to try.

Accordingly the next day I went to m country-
house, as I called it, and cutting some of tie smaller
twigs, I found them to my pur ose as much as I could
destre; whereupon 1 came tie next time pre ared
with an hatchet to cut down a. quantity, which soon
found, for there was a great plenty of them : these I
set up to dry within my circle or hedges; and when
they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave; and
here during the next season I employed myself in
making (as well as Icould) a great many baskets,
both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing,
as I had Occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet! made them sufficiently service-
able for my purpose; and thus afterwards I took care
never to be without them; and as my wicker'warc
decayed Imade more; especially I made strong deep
baskets to place my com in, instead of sacks, when I
should come to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no vessels
to hold any thing that was liquid, except two runlcls,
which were almost full of rum, and some glass bot-
tles, some of the common size, and others which
were case-bottles square, for the holding of waters,
Spirits, the. I had not so much as a pot to boil any
thing in, except a. great kettle which I saved out of
the ship, and which was too big for such uses as I
desired it for. viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of
meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have
had, was a tobaccoopipe, but it was impossible for
me to make one; however, I found a contrivanoo
for that too at last.

I employed myself in planting my second rows of
stakes or piles, and in this wicker-work, all the sum.
mer, or dry season; when another busineSS took me
up more time than it could be imagined lcould spare.

see the whole island, and that I had travelled up the
brook, and so on to where [built my bower, and
where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other
side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite
across to the sea-shore on that side. So taking my
gun and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity
of powder and shot than usua , with two biscuit-cakes
and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch, for my
store, I began my journey. When I had passed the
vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within
View ofthe sea, to the west; and it beinga very clear
day, l fairly descricd land, whether an,island or con-
tinent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extend-
ing from the west to the W. S. W. at a very great
distance ; by my guess it could not be less than fifteen
or twenty leagues 03.

I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwise than that I knew it must be part of Ame-
rica; and, as I concluded by all my observations,
must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps
was all inhabited by savages, where if I should have

landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was '

now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions
of Providence, which I began now to own, and to
believe ordered every thing for the best; I say, I qui-
eted my mind with this, and left afl'licting myself
with fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I consi-
dered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I should
certainly, one time or other, see some vessels pass or
repass one way or other ; but if not, then it was the
savage cost between the Spanish country and Brasil,
which were indeed the worst of savages; for they are
sannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and
devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.

With these considerations l walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I now
was, much pleasanter than mine, the 0 en or savanna
fields sweet, adorned with flowers ant grass, and full
of very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and

fain would I have caught one, if possible, to have
kept it to he tame, and taught it to Speak to me. I
did, after some {tins-taking, catch a young parrot;
for I knocked it own with a. stick, and havtug rocnv
vered it, I brought it home, but i: was some years
before I could make him speak._ However, at last I
taught him to call me by my name very familiarly:
but the accident that followed, though it be a trifle
will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journeyzl
found in the low grounds, hares, asI thou ht them to
be, and foxes, but they dill'ered greatly rom all the
other kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy my-
self to eat them, though I killed several: but I had no
need to be venturous; forI had no want of food, and
of that which was very good too; especially these
three sorts. viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise;

which added to my grapes, Leadenhall-market could a

not have furnished a better table than I, in propos-
tion to the company: an'd though my case was de--
plorable enough, yet I had a great cause for thankfuL
ness, that I was not driven to any extremities for
food ; but rather plenty, even to dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereahouts; but I took so many
turns and returns, to see what discoveries I could
make. that I came weary enough to the place where}
resolved to sit down for all night; and then either
reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with
a row of stakes set upright in the ground, either from
one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could
come at me without waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised
to see that I had taken up my lot on the worst side
of the island ; for here indeed the shore was covered
with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side
I had found but three in a year and an half. Here
was also an infinite numbcr of fowls of many kinds,
some of which I had not seen before, and many oi

names of except those called pengiuns.

1 could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot: and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if 1 could, which I
could better feed on: and though there were many
goats here more than on the other side of the island,
yet it was with much more difficulty that I could
come near them ; the country being flat and even,
and they saw me much sooner than when 1 was on
the hills.

I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation,
it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while]
was here to be, as it were upon aljourney, and from
home: however, I travelled along t 1e shore of the sea
towards the cast, I suppose, about twelve miles,- and
then setting up a great pole upon the shore fora mark,
I concluded Iwould go home again; and the next jour:
ney I took should be on the other side of the island
east from my dwelling, and so round, till I came tt
my post again : of which in its place .

I took another way to come back than that [went
thinking I could easily keep all the island so much in
my view, that I could not miss finding my first dwell-
ing by viewing the country; but I found myself mis-
taken; for being come about two or three miles, 1
found myself descended into a very large valley; but
so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with
woods, that I could not see which was my way by
any direction but that of the sun ; nor even then,
unless I knew very well the position of the sun at

bat time of the day.

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I
was in this valley; and not being able to see the sun,
I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at last was
obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post. andceeding hot; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and
other things, very heavy.

ln thisjourney my dog surprised a young kid, and
seized upon it ; and l runninu in to take hold ol' it,
cauglt it and saved it alive awn the dog. I had a
great mind to bring it home. if I could: for I had
often been musing whether it might not be possible to
get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats,
which might supply me when my powder and shot
should be spent.

1 made a collar for this little creature, and with a
string which I made of some rope-yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him along, though
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there l enclosed him. and left him; for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
absent abovt a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my hatn-

that my own house, as I called it to myself, was a
perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it
rendered every thing about me so comfortable, that I
resolved I would never go a great way from it again,

I went, and found it where I left it: for indeed it
could not get out, but was almost starve'l for want of

having fed it, I tied it asl did before to lead it away,
but it was so tame with being hungry, that 1 had no
need to have tied it; for it followed me like a dog,
and as l continually fed it, the creature became so
loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became from
that time one of my domestiCs also, and would never
leave me afterwards,

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now
come, and'l kept the 30th of September in the sane
solemn manner as before, being the anniversary 0
my landing on the island, having now been there two
years, and no more prospect of bein delivered than
the first day I came there. I spent t e whole day in
humble and thankful acknowledgements ofthe many
wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was
attended with, and without which it might have been-
infinitely more miserable. I gave humble and hearty
thanks, that God had been pleased to discover to me
even that it was possible I might be more happy in
this solitary condition than I should have been in at
liberty of society, and in allthe pleasuresof the world :
that he could fully make up to me the deficiencies of
my solitry state, and the want of human society, by
his presence, and the communication of his grace to
my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me
to depend upon his providence here, and hope for
his eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much
more happy the lifel now lod was, with all its miscr-
ahle circumstances, titan the wicked, cursed,abomina-
ble life I led all the past part of my days; and nowI
having changed both my sorrows and my '03s, my
very desires altered, my affections changed tlicirgttst,
and my delights were perfectly new from what they
were at first coming, or indeed for two years past.

Before as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of thy soul at
my condition would break out n on me on asudden,
and my very heart would die wrthin me, to think ot
the woods, the mountains, the deserts l was in: and

or ROBINSON causba n:

how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal bars
and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness,
without redemption. ln,the midst of the greatest
composures of my mind, this would break out upon
me like a storm, and made me ring-my hands, and
weep like a child. Sometimes it would take me in
the middle of my work. and I would immediately sit
down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour
or two together, and this was still worse to me; for if
I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words,
it would go off; and the grief, having exhausted
itself, would abate.

But now l began to exercise myself with new
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and applied
all the comforts of it to my present state.- One morn-
ing being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these
words, "I will never, never leave thee, nor forsake
thee!" Immediately it occurred, that these words
were to me, why else should they be directed in such

a manner. just at the moment when I was mourning ,

over my condition, as one forsaken of God and man?
'Well then," said I, " if ,God does not forsake me,
of what ill conse uence can it be, or what matters it,
though the war] should all forsake me; seeing, on
the other hand, if I had all the world, and should lose

- the favour and blessing of God, there would be no

comparison in the loss ?"

From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was proba-
ble I should have ever heen in any other particular
state in the world; and with this thought 1 was going
to ive thanks to God for bringing me to this place.

know not what it was, but something shocked my
mind at that thought, and l durst not speak the words,
" How canst thou be such an hypocrite," said I, even
audibly, " to pretend to be thankful for a condition,
which, however thou mayst endeavour to he contented
with, thou wouldost rather ray heartily to be deliver-
ed from E" So I stopped t rere; but though I could

not say I thanked God for being there, yet I sincerely
gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by what-
ever afllicting providences, to see the former condition
of my life, and to mourn for my wickedness, and re-
pent. I never opened the Bible. or shut it, but my
very soul within me blessed God for directing my
friend in England, without any order of mine, to pack
it up among my goods; and for assisting me after
wards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, 1 began my
third year; and though I have not given the reader
the trouble of so particular an account of my works
this year as at the first, yet in general it may be ob-
served, that l was very seldom idle; having regularly
divided my time, according to the several daily em~
ployments that were before me; such as, first, my
duty to God, and reading the scriptures, which I cum
stantly set apart some time for, thrice every day:
secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food,
which generally took me up three hours every morn
ing when it did not rain: thirdly, the ordering, cur-
ing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
catched for my supply; these took up great part of
the day: also it is to be considered. that in the middle
of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the vio-
lence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that
about four hours in the evening was all the time I
could be supposed to work in; with this exception,
that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afiemoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may
be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work;
the many hours, which for want of tools, wantof
help, and want of skill, every thing that I did, took
up out of my time: for exam le, 1 was full two-and-
forty days making me a boar for along shelf, which
I wanted in my cave; whereas two sawyera, With
their tools and saw-pit, would have out six of them
out of the same tree in a half a day.FM" ~"w~\~\w\~~s~v\\w'M.\\\\\v\.\\.\~VVM\-\\x \ V\.'\ \. \\,~ \. >>\ \mesa'

My nase wastlus: it was to be a large tree which
was to he cut down. because my board was to be u.
broad one. The tree 1 was three daysacuttingdown,
and two more cutting of? the boucrhs, and reducing it
to a log. or piece of timber. With inex ressible
hackiug and hewingl reduced both the si es of i:
into chips. till it began to be light enough to move '
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth an
flat, as a board, from end to end : then turning tha
side downward, cut the other side till I brought the
plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on
both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my
hands in such a piece of work ; but labour and pa-
tience carried me through that and many other things;
1 only observe this in particular. to show the reason
why so much of my time went away with so little
work, viz. that what might be a little to be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a pro-
di ious time to do alone, andby hand.

ut notwithstanding this, with patience and labour,
I went through many things, and indeed every thing
that my circumstances made necessaty for me to do,
as will appear by what follows.

lwasnow in the mouths of November and De,
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck : for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but now
my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I
found I was in danger of losing it all again by ene~
mies of several sorts, which it was scarce possib.e to
keep from it; as first the goats and wild creatures
which I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of
the blade, lay in it night and day as soon as it came
up, and ate it so close, that it could get no time to
shoot u into stalks.

This saw no remedy for, but by making an enclo~
sure about it with a hedge, which I did with a great
deal of toil; and the more, because it required agreat

deal of speed ; the creatures daily spoiling my cont
However, as my arable land was but small, suited tt
my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three
weeks time, and shooting some of the creatures in the
day-time, I set. my dog to guard it in the night, tying
him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand
and bark all night long : so in a little time the one
tnies forsool: the place and the corn grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my cart.
was in the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin
me now, when it was in the ear; for going along by
the place to see how it throve, _I saw my ittle crop
surrounded with {owls of I know not how many sorts,
which stood as it were watching till I should be gone.
I immediately let fly among them (for I always had
my gun with me.) I had no sooner shot, but there
arose up a little cloud of (owls, which I had not seen
at all, from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that in u
few day they would devour all my hopes; that I
should be starved, and never be able to raise a crop at
all : and what to do I could not ten? t however, i!
resolved not to loose my corn, if possible, though it
should watch it night and day. In the first place, I
went among it to see what damage was already done .
and found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but

- that, as it was yet too green for them, the loss war

not so great, but the remainder was like to be a good
crop, if it could be saved.

I stayed by it to load my gun, and,then coming
away, could easily see'the thieves sitting upon all
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I wa.|
gone away. and the event it proved to be so; for asll
walked off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out cl
their sight, but they dropped down one by one into
the corn again. I was so provoked, that I could not
have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that
every grain that they now ate was, as it might be said,
a peck loaf to me in the consequence; but coming

to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of them.
This was what I looked for ; so I took them up, and
served them as we serve notorious thieves in Eng-
land, viz. hanged them in chains for a terror to others.
It is impossible to imagine almost, that this should
have such an effect as it had; for the {owls would
not only not come at the com, but in short they for-

' sock all that part of the island, and [could never see

:1: bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung
ere.

This I was very glad of, you may be sure: and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my com.

I was sadly (put to it for a scythe or a scickle to
cut it down, an all [could do was to make one as
well as I could out of one of the broad-swords, or
cutlasses which I saved among the arms out of the
ship. However, as my crop was but small, l had no
great difl'ieulty to cut it down: in short I reaped it

cut nothing 00' but the ears, and car-
ried it away in a great basket which i had made. and
so rubbed it out with my hands: and at the end of all
my harvesting I found, that out of my half-peck oi
seed I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley, that is to say, by my
guess, for I had no measure at that time.

However, this was a great encouragement to me ;
and I foresaw, that in time it would please God to
supply me with bread : and yet here I was'perplexed
again ; for l ne'ther knew how to grind or make meal
of my corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it ;
nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it;
and if how to make it, yet i knew not how to bake
it. These things being added to my desire of having
a good quantity for store, and to secure a'constant
supply, I resolved not to taste any of this crap, but
to preserve it all for seed against the next season, and
in the mean time to employ all my study and hours
of working to accomplish this great work of providing
myself with corn and bread.

120 LEE AND ADVENTURES

It might be truly said, that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe
few peo le have thought much upon; viz. the strange
multitut c of little things necessary in the providing,
producing, curing, dressing, making, and finishing
this one article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a more state of nature. found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made
more and more sensible of it every hour, even after
I got the first handful of seed corn, which, as I have
said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.

First. I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this 1 conquered by male
in; a wooden spade, as l observed before ; but this
did my work but in a wooden manner; and though
it cost me a great many days tomake it, yet, for want
of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but made
my work the harder, and made it be performed much
worse.

However, this I bore with too, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badnest
of the performance. When the corn was sowed, l
had no barrow, but was forced to go over it myself,
and dmgagreat heavy bough of a tree over it. to
scratch the earth. as it may he called, rather than rake
or harrow it.

When it was growing or grown, I have observed
already how many things] wanted, to fence it, secure
it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home, thresh,
part it from the chaff, and save it. 'I hen I wanted a
mill to grind. sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in ; and all
these things I (lid without, as shall be observed ; and
yet the corn was an inestimable comfort and advan-
tage to me too; but all this, as i said, made every
thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there was
no help for; neither was my time so much loss tome,
because I had divided it ; a certain part of it was
every day appointed to these works: and as I resolved
to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater

quantity by me, I had the next six months to app]
myself wholly by labour and invention, to funds:
myself with utensils proper for the performing all the
operations necessary for the making the com, when I
had it, fit for my use.

But first I was to prepare more land, forI had now
need enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before
I did this, I had a week's work at least to make me a
spade, which, when it was done, wasa very sorty one
indeed, and very heavy, and required double labour
to work with it; however, I went through that, and
sowed my seeds in two large flat pieces ofgrouud, as
near my house as I could ind them to my mind, and
fenced them in with a good hedge, the stakes of which
Were all cut 03' that wood which lhad set before,
which I knew would grow; so that in one year's time
I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that
would want but little repair. This work was not
so little as to take me up less than three months; be.
cause great part of that time was in the wet season,
when 1 could not go abroad.

' VVithin-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following 00-
casion, always observing, that all the while 1 was
at work. l diverted thyself with talking to my parrot,
and teaching..im to speak ; and I quickly learnt him
to know his own name; at last, to speak it out retty
loud, Pol; which was the first word I ever teard
spoken in the island by any mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my work, but an assistant to my
work; for now, as I said, I had a great employment
upon my hands, as follows: viz. I had long studied,
by some means or other, to make myself some earthen
vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not
where to come at them: however, considering the
heat of the climate, l did not doubt but, if i could
find out any such clay, I might hotch up some such
pot as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough
and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any

some as large as lcould, and fit only to stand like
jars to hold what should he put into them

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many awkward ways 1 took to
raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly things
made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell
out, the clay not being still enough to hear its own v
weight; how many cracked by the over-violent heat
ofthe sun, being set out too hastily; and how many
fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as.
after they were dried; and, in a word, how, after
having laboured hard to [ind the clay, to dig it, to
temper it, to bring it home. and work it, Icoul : not
make above two large earthen ugly things, I cannot
call them jars in about two months labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up and set them down
again in two great wicker-baskets, which I had'made
on purpose for them that they might not break ; and,
as between the pot and the basket there was a lid):
room to spare, l stufl'ed it full of the rice and barley
straw; and these two pots being to stand always dry,
I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the
meal when the corn Nas bruised,

Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,

stone, and red as a tile. I was greatly surprised to
see it, and said to myself, that certainly they might be
made to burn whole, it' they would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to
make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of a
kiln such as the putters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though 1 had some lead to do it with ; but
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
in a pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it with a great' heap of embers under them -.
I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and
upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot.
quite through, and observed that they did not crack
at all : when 1 saw them clear red, I let them stand
in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; for
the sand which was mixed with the clay melted by
the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradu-
ally, till the pots began to abate of the red colour; .

wanted oatmeal. and several other ingredients reqni
site to make it so good asl would have had it.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to
stamp or beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. Tn supply this want, I was
at a great loss; for of all the trades in the world I was
as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with.
I spent many a day to find out a great stone bi
enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, an
could find none at all except what was in the solid
rock, and which i had no way to dig or cut out; our
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness suffi--
cient, but were all ofa sandy crumbling stone, which
would neither hear :he weight of an heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand; so,
after a. great deal of time lost in searching fora stone,
1 gave it over, and resolved to look out a great block
of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier;
and getting one as big as i had strength to stir, l
rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my axe
and hatchet; and then with the help of fire and infi-
nite labour. made an hollow place in it, as the Indi-
ans in Brasil make their canoes. After this, i made

to grind or rather pound, my corn or meal to make

My next difficulty was to make a sieve or scarce,
to dress my meal, and art it from the bran and the
husk, without which I id not see it possible I could
have any bread. This was a most diflicult thing, so
much as but to think on ; for to be sure I had nothing
like the necessary things to make it with; l mran lino

did I really know what to do: linen I had none left

knew I how to weave or spin it t and had I known
how, here were no tools to work it with. All the
remedy that I found for this, was, that at last I did
remember I had among the seamen's clothes which
were saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico
or muslin; and with some pieces of these I made
three small seives, hut proper enough for the work :_
and thus I made shift for some years; how I did
afterwards, I shall show in its place.

The bakiu part was the next thing to (reconsidered,
and how I s lOtlId make bread when I came to have
corn ; for, first, I had no yeast: as to that pan, there
was no supplying the want, so I did not concern my
self much about it. But for an oven, I was indeed in
great pain. At length I found out an experiment tor
that also, which was this ; I made some earthen ves--
sels very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about
two feet diameter, and not above nine inches deep;
these I burnt in the fire. as I had done the other, and
laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a
great fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with
some square tiles of my own making and burning
also; but I should not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon this
hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I let
them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then sweeping
away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves ;
and whehning down the ea rthcu pot upon them, drew
the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep
13, and add to the heat ; aud thus, as well as in the
best ovens in the world, I halted my barley-loaves,
and became in a little time a mere pastry-cool: into

he bargain ; for l made myself several cakes of the
rice, and puddings; indeed I made no pics, neither
had I any thing to put into them, supposing I had,
except the flesh either of fowls or goats.

It need not he wondered at, if all these things took
me up most part ofthc third year ofmy ahodc here;
fir it is to be observed, that in the intervals of these

things I had 'my new harvest and hushandry to ma
nage: for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried
it home as well as I could, and laid it u in the ear,
I" my large baskets, till I had time to ru it out; for
I had no floor to thresh it on, or instrument to thresh
it with. _

And now indeed my stock of corn increasing, I
really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted I
pace to lay it up in ; for the increase of the corn now
yielded me so much. that I had of the barley about
twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or more ;
insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use it freely,
for my bread had been quite gone agrcat while ; also
I resolved to see what quantity would' be sufficient
for me a whole year, and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could con-
sume in a year : so I resolved to sow just the same

uautity every year thatI sowed the last, in hopes
amt such a quantity would fully provide me with
bread, &c.

All the while these things were doing, you may be -

sure my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect
of land which I had seen upon the other side of the
island ; and I was not without secret wishes, that I

'was on shore there, fancying that seeing the main

land, and an inhabited country. I might find some
way or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps
at last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such acondition, and how I might fall
into the hands of savages, and perhaps such as I
mi ht have reason to think far worse than the'limu
ant tigers ofAfrica: that if I once came into thci
power, I should run an hazard more than a thousan'l
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eatenv.
for I had heard that the people of the Caribeancoasls
were cannibals, or men-eaters; and I knew by the
latitude that I could not be far off from that shore
that. suppose they were not cannibals, yet they might

kill me, as many Euro eans who had fallen into their
hands had been serve , even when they had been ten
or twenty together : much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. -All these things,
I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and
I did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took
none of my apprehensions at first; and my head ran
nE'ightily upon the thoughts of getting over to that
!' ore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the shoulder of mutton sail, with which I sailed
above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa ; but
this was in vain. Thenl thought I would go and
look on our ship's boat, which, asI have said, was
blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where
she did at first but not 'qu'ite; and was turned by the
force of the waves and the winds almost bottom up-
wards, against the high ridge of a beachy rough sand,
l~ut no water about her as before.

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have

hunched herinto the water, the boat would have done
well enough, and I might have gone back into the
llrasils with her easy enough ; but I might haveeasily
foreseen that I could no more turn her, and set her
t'pright upon her bottom, than I could remove the
island. However, I went to the wood, and cut levers
and rollers, and brought them to the boat, resolving to
try what I could do ; suggesting to myself, that if I
could but turn her down, I might easily repair the
damage she had received, and she would be a very
good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.
_ I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about it;
at last finding it impossible to heave it up with my
little strength, I fell to digging away the sand to uu.
dermine it ; and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it
up again, or to get under it, much less to move 'I

it over; and, yet though I gave over the hopes of the I

boat, my desire to venture over for the mam increas

ed, rather than decreased, as the means of it seemed

impossible. . .

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was g
not ossible to make myself a canoe or pettagua. such I
as t e natives of those climates make, even wnhout g

thoughts ofmaking it, and with my having much mme
convenience for it than any of the Negroes or ind:- 5
ans; but not at all considering the particular Inconvo- g
nience which I lay under more than the Indians (lltL ,
viz. want of hands to move it into the water, when 3
it was made :, a difficulty much harder for me to sur. I

could be to them : for what was it to me that when I
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with
great trouble cut it down, ifafterl might be able with
my tools to hew and dub the outside into a proper
shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to
make it hollow, so as to make a boat of it, if, after all
this. I must leave it just there where I found it, and
was not able to launch it into the water ?

One would have thought I could not have had the
least reflection upon my mind of this circumstance,
while I was making this boat, but I should have im-
mediately thought how I should get it into the sea :
but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage over
the sea in it, that I never once considered how I
should get it off the land; and it was really in its own
nature more easy for me to guide it over forty-lite
miles of sea, than about forty-five fathoms of land,
where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.

1 went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
that ever man did, who had any of his senses awake.
I pleased myself with the design, withont determin-
ing whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but

i that thc difi'iculty of launching my lmal came urn-u
Into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it- by this l'oolish answer. which I gave myself;
Let me first make it, I'll warrant I'll find some way
or other to get it along. when it is done.
Thiswas a most prepOsterous method; but the eager
g ness of my fancy prevailed. and to work i went. and
g relied a cedar tree: I question much whether Solomon
ever had such an one for the building the temple at
3 Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the
lower part next the stump, and {our feet eleven inches
i diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a while. and then it parted into branches.
g It was not without infinite labour that l felled this
tree: 1 was twenty days hacking and hcwing at it at
the bottom; l was fourteen more getting thehrmiches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it. cut off,
which I hacked and hewed through witlt my axe and
hatchet, with inexpressihle lahour: after this it cost
me a month to shape it, and duh it to a proportion.
and to samething like the bottom of a boat, that it
might swim upright as it ought to do. it cost me near
three months more to clear the inside. and work it
out so as to make an exact boat ofit: this i did in-
deed without fire. by mere mallet and chissel, and by
the dint of hard labour; till l had brought it to be a
very handsome periagna, and big enough to have car-
ried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough
to have carried me and all my cargo.

When 1 had gone through this work, I was ex:
tremely delighted with it: the boat was really tnuch
bigger than i ever saw a. canoe or pcriagua. that was
made ofone tree, in my life ; many a weary stroke it
had cost. you may he sure, for there remained nothing
but to get it into the water; and had i gotten it into
the water, I make no question but I should have be--
gun the maddest voyage. and the most unlikely to be
oerformed. that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed

me, though they cost infinite labour too; it lay about i

one hundred yards from the water, and not more; I

but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill toward: g

the creek. Well, to take away this discouragement,

I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so g

make a declivity; this I began, and it cost me a pro-

digious deal of pains: but who grudge pains, that

have their deliverance in view? but when this was

worked through, and this difficulty managed, it was

still much at one; for I could no more stir the canoe,

than I could the other boat. .

Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-

solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water up g
to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down
to the water; well. I began this work, and when I
began to enter into it, and calculated how deep it was
to he_dug, how broad, how the stuff to be thrown out,
I found, that by the number of handsl had, being '
none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve
years before I should have gone through with it; for
the shore lay high, so that at the upper end it must
have been at least twenty feet deep: soat length, though
with great reluctancy, I gave this attem t over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we count
the cost. and before we judge rightly of our own
strength to go through with it. .

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with the
same devotion. and with as much comfort, as ever
before : for by a constant study, and serious applica-
tion of the word of God, and by the assistance of his
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I

ad before; I entertained different notions of things;
l looked now upon the world as a thing remote;
which 1 had nothing to do with, no expectation from,
and indeed no desires about: ina word, I had no-
thing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to have; ,
so l thought it looked as we may perhaps look upon '
it hereafter viz. as a place I had lived in. but wal E

come out of it ;-and well I might say, as father Abra-
ham to Dives, " Between me and thee there is a
great gulph fixed."

In the iirst place, I was removed from all the wick--
edness of the world here: lhad neither the lust of
the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life: [
lsad nothing to covet, forl had all I was now capable
of enjoying ; I was lord of the whole manor, or, if I
pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the
whole country which 1 had possession of: there were
no rivals: I had no competitor, none to dispute sove-
reignty or command With me; Imight have raised
ship-loads of corn, but I had no use for it; so i let
as little grow as I thought enough for my occasion:
I had tortoise or turtles enough; but now and then
one was as much as Ieould put to any use: I had
timber enough to have built a fleet of ships; I had
grapes enough to have made wine, or to have cured
into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when they had
been built. '

But all [could make use of, was all that was valu-
trble: I had enough to eat. and to supply my wants,
and what was all the rest to me? if I killed more
flesh than I could eat. the dog must eat it, or the ver-
min; if I sowed more com than I could eat, it must
be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were lying to
rot on the ground, I could make no more use of them
than for fuel ; and that I had no occasion for, but to
dress my food. .

ln 3. word, the nature and experience of things dio-
tated to me upon just reflection, that all the good
things of this world are no farther good to us, than as
they are for our use: and that whatever we may heap
up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much-as we
can use, and 'no more. The most eoveteous griping

'miser in the world would have been cured of the Vine

of coveteousness. if he had been in my case; for l
possessed infinitely more than I knew what to do
with. I had no room for desire, except it was of
things which I had not, and they were but trifles,

though indeed of great use to me. 1 had, as I hinten
before, a parcel of money, as well gold as silver,
about thirty-six pounds sterling; alas! there the nasty,
sorry, useless stuli' lay; I had no manner of business
for it; and I often thought with myself. that I would
have given an handful of it for a gross of tobacco-
pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay, I
would have given it all for six-penny-worth of turnip
and carrot seed out of England, or for an handful of
peas and beans, and a bottle of ink : as it was, I had
not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but
there it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the
damp of the cave, in the wet season; and if I had
had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the same
case; and they had been of no manner of value to
me because of no use.

i had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itselfthan it was at first, and much easier to
my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently sat
down to my meat with thankfulness, and admired the
hand ofGod's providence, which had thus spread my
table in the wilderness: l learn to look more upon

dark side: and to consider what I enjoyed, rather
than what I wanted: and this gave me sotnetimessuch
secret comforts, that 1 cannot express them; and
which l took notice ol'hcre, to putthose discontented
people in mind of it. who cannot enjoy comfortably
what God hathgiveu them. because they see and covet
something that he has not given them : all our discon-
touts about what we want, appeared to me to spring
from the want of thankfulness for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me. and

out of her to the shore for my relief and comfort ,
without which I had wanted tools to work, weapons
for defence, or gunpowder and shot for getting my
load.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in re-
presenting to myself in the most lively colours. how I
must have acted, ifl had got nothing out ofthe ship;
how I could not have so much as got any food, ex-
cept fish and turtles; and that, as it was long beforel'
found any of them, i must have perished first: that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere
savage - that ifI had killed a goat or a fow' by any
contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or

art the flesh from the skin and the bowels, or to cut
it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it
with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the good-
ness of Providence to me. and very thankful for my
present condition, with all its hardships and misfnr>>
tunes: and this part also I cannot but recommend to
the reflection of those who are apt in their misery to
say, 15 any affliction like mine? Let them consider,
how tnuch worse the cases of some eople are. and
what their case might have been, if 'rovidence had
thought fit.

I had another reflection which assisted me also to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was compar-
ing my present condition with what I had deserved,
and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of
Providence. I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly des-
titute of the knowledge and fear of God ; I had been
well instructed by father and mother: neither had they
been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infil$
a religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my
duty, and of what the nature and end of my being ro-

uired of me. But. alas ! (ailing, early into the sea

iigio'n which I had entertained. was laughed out of me
by my messmates; by an hardened uespising of dan-
gers, and the views of death. which gre'w habitual to
me; by my long absence from all manner of upper
tunities to converse with any thing but what was like
myself, or to hear any thing of what was good, or
tended towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of
the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the

reatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my escape from
callee, my being taken up by the Portuguese master
of the ship my being planted so well in Brasil. my
receiving the cargo from England, and the like I never
once had the words. Thank God, so much as on my
mind, or in my mouth ; nor in the greatest distress
had I so much thought as to pray to him ; nor so
much as to say Lord, have mercy upon me ! no, not
to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear
by, and blaspheme it. '

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months. as I have already observed, on the account at
my wicked and hardened life past; and when I looked
about me, and considered what partiCular providen-
ces had attended me, since my coming into this place,
and how God had dealt hountit'ully with me ; had
not only punished me less than my iniquity deserved,
but had so plentifully provided for me; this gave me
great hopes that my repentance was accepted, and
that God had yet mercies in store for me.

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to resignation to the will of God in the present
disposition of my circumstances, but even to a sincere
thankfulness of my condition ; and that I, who was
yet a living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had
not the due punishment of my sins; that I enjoyed so

many mercies, which I had no reason to have expected '

in that place, that I ought never more to repinc at my
condition. but to rejoice. and to give daily thanks,
for that daily hread, which nothing but a cloud of
wonders could have brought: that I ought to consider

I had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as
thatnt' feeding Elijah by ravens: nay, by a long series
of miracles: and that I could hardly have named a
place in the uninhabited part of the world, where I
could have been cast more to my advantage; a place,
where as] had no society, which was my amiction
on one hand, so I found no ravenous beast, no furious
wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no venomous
creatures, or poisonous, which I might have fed on to
my hurt ; no savages to murder and devour me.

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way,
so it was a life of mercy another ; and I wanted no,
thing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able to
make my sense of God's goodnes to me, and care
over me in this condition, be my daily consolation ;
and after I made ajust improvement of these things,
I went away, and was no more sad.

I had now been here so long, that many things
which 1 brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as i observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with water
a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce left any
appearance of black upon the paper: as lon as it
lasted, I made use of it to minute down the ays o!
the month on which any remarkahic thing happened
to me ; and first, by casting up times past, l remem-
ber that there was a strange concurrence of days in
the various providences which hefel me, and which,
if I had been supersticiously inclined to observe days
as fatal or fortunate, i might have had reasOn to have
looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed, that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull in order to go to sea, the same day of.
terwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and
made a slave.

The same day of the year I was born on. viz. the
20th ofSeptembcr, the same day I had tny lile so mi-
raculously saved twenty-six years after, when l u as
cast on shore in this island ; so that my wicked life,
and solitary life, both began on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that
of my bread, I mean the buiscuit which [brought out .
of the ship. This I had husbanded tothelast degree
allowing myself but one cake of bread a day. for
above a year: and yet I was quite without bread for
a year before I got any corn of my own : and great
reason I had to he thankful that I had any at all, the
getting it being, as has been already observed, next to
miraculous.
M y clothes too began to decay mightily: as to linen,
I had none :1 good while, exce t some chequred shirts g
which I found in the chests o the other seamen, and
which I carefully preserved, because many times I i
could hear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was '
aver-y great help to me, that I had among all the
men's clothes of the ship almost three dozen of shirts.
There were also several thick watch-coats of the sea-
men. which were left behind, but they were too hot
to wear ; and though it is true, that the weather was
so violent hot, that there was no need of clothes, yet 5

place, would give me the headach presently, by dart-
mg so directly on my head, without a cap or hat on,
so that Icould not bear it; whereas, if I put on my

but, it would presently go away.
U n these views I began to consider about putting

the ew rags I had, which I called clothes, into some
order . I had worn out all the waistcoats I had, and
my business was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch-coats which] had 1;
me, and with such other materials as I had ; so I set
to work a-ta'iloring, or rather indeed o-botching ;, for
I made most piteous work ofit. However, I made
shift to make two or three waisteoats, which I hoped
would serve me a great while ; as for breeches or
drawers, I made but very sorry shift indeed, till af-
wards.

l have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean four footed ones; and
I had hung them up stretched .out with sticks in the
run; by which means some of them were so dry and
Lard, that they were fit for little; but others, it seems,
were very useful. The first thing I made of these
"as agreat cap for my head, with the hair on the out-
side to shoot off the rain; and this] performed so
well, that after this I made a suit of clothes wholly
of those skins; that is to 53 , a waistcoat and breaches
open at the knees, and hot loose; for they were m-
ther wanted to keep me cool, titan to keep me warm.
I must not omit to acknowledge, that they were
wretchedly made ; for if I wasabad carpenter, I was
a worse tailor: however, they were such as] made a
very good shift with; and when I was abroad, if it

' happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap

being outmost, I was kept very dry.

After this 'I spent. a deal of time and pains to make
mean umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one,
and had a great mind to make one: I had seen them
made in the Brasils, where they are very useful in the
great heats which are there: and I felt the heats every
jut as great here, and greater too, being nearer litemmxfim A M Mwmy~sxs s~.~\\~.- \<<AmM-Mw "MW

i eqinox; besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad,
it was a must useful thing to me, as well for the rain:
as the heals. I took a world of pains at it, and was a
great while before [could make any thing likely to
, hold; nay, after Ithoughtl had hit the tvay, I spoiled
5 two or three before 1 made one to my mind; but at
g last i made one that answered indifl'erently well. The
5 main dilliculty I found was to make it to let down
g 1 could make it to spread ; but if it did not let down
I too, and draw in, it would not he ortablc for me
any way, but just over my head, \vhic I would not do.
However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer;
I covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it
cast off the rain like a penthouse, and he totl'thc sun
so effectually, that I could walk out in t e hottest o!
the weather, with greater advantage than I could be:
fore in the coolest; and when I had no need of it, I'
could close it, and carry it under my arm. .
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed by resigning to the will ol'God,
g attd throwing myself wholly upon the disposal ofhiq
5 providence; this made my life better than sociable;
4; for when I began to regret the want of conversation,
1 I would ask myself, whether thus conversing tnutu.
g ally with my own thoughts, and as Ihope I may say,
with even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions,
$ was not better than the utmost enjoyment of human
e society in the world?
' I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any ex
SS ttaordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on in
5 the same course, in the same osture and place, just
as before. The chief thing {was employed in, be--
sides my yearly labour of planting my barley and rice
and curing my raisins, of both which I always kept
up just enough to have sufficient stock of the year's
rovision beforehand; I say, besides this yearly la.
our, and my daily labour of going out with my gun,
I had one labour to make me acanoe, which at last]
finished: so that by digging a canal to it, six (eel
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek.

almost half a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly
big, as I made it without considering beforehand, as
I ought to do, how I should be able to launch it; so
never being able to bring it to the water, or bring the
water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was,
as a memorandum to teach me to be wiser next time.
Indeed the next time, though I could not get a tree
proper for it, and was in a place where I could not
get the water to it at any less distance than, as! have
said, of near halfa mile; yet as I saw it was practi-
cable at last, I never gave it over; and thoth I was
near two years about it, yet I never 1grudgeil my la-
bour, in hopes of having a boat to go o to sea at least.
However. though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the de-
sign which I had in view, when l made the first; I
mean of venturing over to the Terra Firma. where it
was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the small-
ness of my boat asststed to put an end to that design.
and now [thought no more of it. But as] had a
boat, my next design was to make a tour round the
island: for as I had been on the other side, in one
place, crossing. as I have already described it, over
the land. so the discoveries] made in that journey
made me very eager to see the other parts of'thc

.coast; and nowl had a boat, I thought of nothing

but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing
with discretion and consideration, I fitted up a little
mast to my boat, and madea sail to it out of some of
the Rieces of the ship's sail, which lay in store, and
of w ieh I had a great store by me.

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
I found she would sail very well. Then I made litt'c
lockers and boxes at each end of my boat, to put pro.
visions, necessaries and ammunition. &.c. into. to
be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea-
and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside oi
the boat, where Iconld lay my gun, making a flap to
hang down over it to keep it dry.

l fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stem, like
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat oi -
the sun off me, like an awning; and thus I every now
and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never
went far out, nor far from the little creek ; but at last,
being eager to view the circumference of my little
kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accordingly
I victualled my ship for the voyage; putting in two
dozen of my loaves (cakes I should rather call them)
of barely-bread; an earthen pot full of parched rice,
a food I ate a great deal of. a little bottle of rum, hall
a goat, and powder with shot for killing more, and
two lar e watch-coats, of those which, as] mentioned
before, had saved out of the seamen's chests; these
I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in
the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of
my reign, or tny captivity, which you please, that I
set out on this voyage, and I found it much longer
than I expected; for though the island itself was not
very large, yet when I came to the east side of it, l
found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the sea, some above water, some under it; and
beyond this a shoal of sand, lying dry halfa league
more; so that l was obliged to go a great way out to
sea to doule that point.

When I first discovered them, i was going to give
over my enterprise, and come back again, not know-
ing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and
above all, doubting how i should go back again ; so i
came to an anchor, for I had made me a kind of an
anchor with a iece of a broken grappling which i
got out ofthe ship.

Having secured my boat, 1 took my gun, anti went
on shore, climbing up an hill, which seemed to over
look that point, where i saw the full extent of it, and
resolved to venture.

in my viewing the sea from that hill where lflood,
l perceived a strong, and indeed a most furious cur--
rent, which ran to the east, even came close to the

point and I took the more notice of it, tecausel
saw there might be some danger, that when I came
into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength
of it, and not be able to make the island again. And
indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill, I believe
it would have been so ; for there was the same current
on the other side of the island, only that it' set of? at
a farther distance 3 and Isaw there was a strong eddy
under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get
out of the first current, and I should presently be in
an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days ; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (at E. S. E. and that being just
contrary to the said current? made a great breach of
the sea upon the point; so t rat it was not safe for me
to keep too close to the shore for the breach, nor to
go too far off because of the stream.

The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over-night, the sea was calm, and I ventured;
but I am a warning-piece again to all rash and igno-
rant pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point,
when I was not my boat's length from the shore, but
I found myself in a great depth of water, and a cur-
rent like a sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along
with it with such violence, that all l-could do could
not keep her so much as on the edge of it ; "but 1 found
it hurried me farther and farther out from the eddy,
which was on the left hand. There was no wind stir-
ring to help me, and all that I could do with my
paddles signified nothing; and now I began to give
myself over for lost ; for, as the current was on both
sides the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they
must join again. and then I was irrecoverably gone;
nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it; so that I
had no [prospect before me but of rishing; not by
the sea, or that was calm enough, ut of starving for
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise on the shore,
as big ahnOst as I could lift, and had tossed it into
the boat : and I had a great 1th of fresh water, that
u to say. one of my earthen pots ; but what was all

this to being driven into the vast ocean, where to be
sure, there was no shore, no main land or island, for
a thousand leagues at least?

And now I saw how easy it was {or the providence
of God to make the most miserable condition that
mankind could be in, worse. Now I looked back
upon my desolate solitary island, as the most pleasant
place in the world, and all the happiness my heazt
could wish for, was to be there again . l stretched out
my hands to it with eager wishes; " 0 happy desert."
said I, " I shall never see the more! 0 miserable
creature !" said I, " whither am Igoing !" Then I
reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and
how I had repinetl at my solitary condition; and now
what would give to be on shore there again ? Thus.
we never see the true state of our condition, till it is
illustrated to us by its contraries ; nor know how to
value'what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is
scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was
now in, being driven from my beloved island (for so it
appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean. al--
most two leagues, and in the utmost despair of ever
recovering it again : however, 1 worked hard, till in-
deed my strength was almost exhausted ; and kept
my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards
the side of the current which the eddy lay on, as pos-
sibly I could ; when about noon,as the sun passed the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in
my face springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered
my heart a little, and especially when in about half
an hour more it blew a. pretty small . entle gale. By
this time I was gottenata frightful distance from the
island ; and, had the least cloud or hazy weather in--
tervened, I had been undone another way too ; for I
had-no compass on board, and should never have
known how to have steered towards the island, if I
had but once lost sight of it ; but the weather contin-
uing clear, [applied myselfto get up my mast again,
and spread my sail standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out ofthe current.

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 143

Just as I had set my mast and sail. and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of
tile water, some alteration of the current'was near; .
for where the current was so strong, the water was
foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found the cur-
rent abate, and presently I found to the east, at about
half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks:
these rocks I found caused the current to part again
and as the main stress of it ran away more southerly
leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the other re.
turned by the repulse of the rock, and made a strong
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with a
very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who have
been in such like extremcties. may guess what my
rresent surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my
mat into the stream of this eddy ; and the wind also
freshcning, how gladly l 5 read my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wint , and with a strong tide or
eddy under foot. _

This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the island. but about two
leagues more towards the northward than the current
lay, which carried me away at first ; so that when I
came near the island, I found myself open to the
northern shore ofit, that is to say, the other end of
the island, opposite to that which I went out frmr.

When I had made something more thatth league
of way by the help ofthis current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and served me no farther. However I
fuund,that being between the two great currents. viz.
that on the South side which had hu'rried me away
and that on the north which lay about two leagues
on the other side; Isay, betweenthese two,in the
west of the island, Ifound the water at least still,
and running no way; and having still a breeze 0!
wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the
tsland,though not makingsuch fresh wayas before.

l44 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within
about a league of the island. I found the point of the
rocks which occasioned the distance stretching out as
is described before, to the southward, and casting of!
the current more southwardly, had of course made
another eddy to the north ; and this I found very
strong, but directly settin the way my course lay,
which was due west, but a most full north. However,
having a fresh gale. [stretched across this eddy slam>>
in; north-west, and in about an hour came within
about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth wa~
ter, I soon got to land. '

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave
God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside
all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat; and re-
freshing myself with such things as I had, 1 brought
my boat close to the shore, in a little cove that I had

espied under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, .

being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.

l was now at a. great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and know
too much the case to think of attempting it by thin
way I went out; and what might be at the other sidu
(I mean the west side) I knew not, nor had I any
mind to run any more ventures; so I only resolved
in the morninglo make my way westward along the
shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might
lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again it
I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts,
coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet, or
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came
to a very little rivulet, or brook, wherel found a cor>>
venient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as
if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for
her ; here I put in, and having stowed my boat very
safe I went on shore to look about me, and see where

was.

l soon found I had but a little passed by the place
where I had been before when I travelled on {00' to

that shore; so taking nothing out of my boat but my
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I
began my march: the way was comfortable enough
after such a voyage asl had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening. where I found every
thing standing as I left it; for I always kel')! it in good
order, being, asl said before, my country- muse.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade
to rest my limbs, for I was very weary. and fell asleep
butjudge you if you can. that read my story, what a
surpries I must be in when I was awaked out of my
sleep by a voice calling me by my name several times,
" Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe? Where are you?
Where have you been ?"

l was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing. or paddling, as it is called, the first art of
the day, and walking the latter part, that l t' id not
awake thoroughly ; and dozing between sleeping and
waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me: but as the voice continued to repeat Robin Cru--
soe. Robin Crusoe; at last I began to awake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and
startled up in the utmost consternation : but no sooner
were my eyes open, but I saw my Pol sitting on the
top at the hedge, and immediately knew that this was
he that spoke to me : for just in such bemoaning lan-
guage l had used to talk to him, and teach him ; and
he had learnt it so perfectly. that he would sit upon
my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, anu' cry,
" Poor Robin Crusoe, where are you? Where have
you been? How came you here ?" and such things as

had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be no body else, it was a good
while before I could compose myself. First. I was
amazed how the creature got thither, and then how he
should just keep a put the place, and no where else:

nest Pol, I got it over; and holding out my hand, and
calling him by his name, Pol, the sociable creature
came to me, and sa't upon my thumb, as he used to
do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe
and, how did I come here? and where had I been:
just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and
so I carried him home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some
time, and had eno'ugh to do for many days to sit still
and reflect upon the danger I had been in. I would
have been very lad to have had my hoat again on
my side of the island, but I knew not how it was

racticable to get it about: as to the east side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way;'my very heart would
shrink, and my very blood run chill, but to think of
it: and to the other side ofthe island, I did not know
how it might be there; but supposing the currant ran
with the same force against the shore at the east, as it

.. passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk

of being driven down the stream, and carried by the
island, as 1 had been before of being carried away
from it. So with these thoughts I contented myself
to. be without any boat, though it had been the pro.
duct of so many months labour to make it, and ofsn
many more to get it into the sea.

In this govemment of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very sedate retired life. as you may
well suppose ; and my thoughts being very much com-
posed, as to my condition. and fully comforted in re-
signing myself to the disposition of Providence, I
thought I lived really very happily in all things, ex-
ce t that of society.

improved myself in this time, in all the mechanic

exercises which my necessities put me upon applymg
myself to; and I believe could, upon occasion, have
made a. very good carpenter. especially considering
how few tools! had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection
in my earthenwre, ar d contrived well enough to

make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
easier and better; because I made things round and
shapcable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or morejoyful {or any thing I found
out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe ;
and though it was a very ugly clumsy thing when it
was done, and only hurnt red like other earthenware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the
smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for!
had been always used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards,
when I searched the ship again, I could not come at
any pipes at all.

In my wicker~ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as my
invention shewed me, though not very handsome, yet
convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a cat,
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and rest!
t, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket:
and the like by a turtle ; I could cut it up, take out
the eigs and a piece or two of the flesh, which was
enoug for me, and bring them home in a basket, and
leave the rest behind me. Also large deep baskets
were my receivers for my corn, which I always rub
bed out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept
it in great baskets instead of a granary.

I began now to perceive my powder abated consi-- '

derably; and this was a want. which it was impossi-
hle for me to supply, and I began seriously to consider
what I must do when I shouh have no more powder;
that is to say, how I should do to kill any goats. I
had, as I observed, in the third year of my being here,
kept a youg kid, and bred her tame; I was in hopes
of getting an he kid, but I could not by any means
bring it to pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I
could never find in my heart to kill her, till she died
at last of mere age.

dence, and, as l have said, my ammunition growing
low, I set myself to study some art to trap and snare
the goats, to see whether I could not catch some (ll
them alive; and particularly I wanted a she-goal
great with young.

To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and believe they were more than once taken in them;
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
always found them broken, and my bait devoured.

At length I resolved to try a pitfall; sol dug se-
veral large pits in the earth, in places where I had
observed the goats used to feed, and over these pits I
placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and several timeslput ears 0!
barley, and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I
eould easily perceive, that the goats had gone in, and
eaten up the corn, that I could see the mark of their
feet: at length, I set three traps in one night, and
going the next morning, I found them all standing,
and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very disl
couraging; however, I altered my trap; and, not to
trouble you with particulars. oing one morning to
see my traps, I found in one 0 them a large old he-
goat; and in one'of the other, three kids, a male and
two females.

As to the old one,I knew not what to do with
him; he was so fierce I durst not go into the pit to
him ; that is to say, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted; Icould have killed
him, but that was not my business, nor would it an-
swer my end; so I e'en let him out, and he ran away
as if he had beeu fri hted out of his wits; but I did
not then know what afterwards learnt, that hunger
would tame a lion : ifl had let him stay there three
or four days without food, and then have carried him
some water to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are
mi hty sagacious tractable creatures, where thew are
we 1 used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no
boner at that time; then I went to the three kids ,
anS, taking them one by one, 1 tied them with smut-.5
together ; and with some difliculty brought thetn all
home. 5
it was a good while before they would feed: hut
throwing them some sweet corn it tempted them, and
they began to be tame: and now l found, that ii I
expected to supply myself with goats flesh. wheni
had tto powder or shot left, breeding some up tame
was my only way, when perhaps I might have them
about tny house like a flock of sheep. E
But then leresetIlly occurred to me, that I must 5
keep the tame from the wild, or else the would al- g
ways rttn wild when they grew up; and t e only way ,
'or this was to have some enclosed piece of ground, S
well fenced either with hedge or pole, to keep them i
up so elTectually, that those within might not break
out, or those without break in. 5
This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands;
yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity of doing
tt, tny first piece of work was to find out a proper
piece of ground, viz. where there was likely to he I
erbage for thetn to eat, water for them to drink, and
mver to keep them from the sun. -
Those who understand such enclosures, will think
I had very little contrivance, when l pitched upon a a
place very proper {or'all these. being a plain open I
piece or meadow-land or savana (as our people call
it in the western colonies) which had two or three
little drills of fresh' water in it, and at one end was
very woody; lsay they will smile at my forecast,
when I shall tell them I began by enclosin of this
piece of ground in such a manner, that my edge 0
pale must have been at least two miles about: nor n'a
the madness ofit so great as to the contpas . L- -r If it
was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough '
to do it in; but I did not consider. that my goats '
would be as wild in so much compas, as if they had $2

had the whole island ; and I should have so much
room to chase them in, that I should nevercatch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me;
so I presently stopped short, and for the first begin-
ning I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hun~
dred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred yards
in breadth, which as it would maintain as many as I
should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock
increased, I could add more ground to the enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to
work with courage. I was about three months hedg-
ing in the first new ; and, till I had done it, I tethered
the three kids in the best art of it, and used them to
feed as near me as possib e, to make them familiar ;
and very often I would go and carry them some ears
of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of
my hand ; so that after my enclOsure was finished,
and I let them loose they would follow me up and
down bloating after me for a handful of com.

This answered in end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flockb about twelve goats, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three-und-forty, besides
several that I took and killed for my food; and alter
that l enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed
them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take
them as I wanted them ; and gates out of one. piece of
ground into another.

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's
flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk too,a thing
which indeed in my beginning I did not so much as
think of, and which when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable surprise; for nowl setup my
dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in
aday. And as nature who gives supplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it, so I, that never milked a cow much less a

cat, or saw butter or cheese made, very readily and

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his crea-

to be overwhelmed in destruction! How can he sweet-

ing ways to ether about the island, and at othert'imca
I satmyselft own contented enough without her. But
I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to
the point of the island, where, as I have said in my
last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what!
had to do. This inclination increased upon me every
day, and at length I resolved to travel thither by land,
and following the edge of the shore, I did so; but had
any one in England been to meet sech a man as I was,
it must either have frighted them, or raised a great
deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood still to
look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of
my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equi-
page, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a
sketch of my figure as follows:

I had a great high shapcless cap, made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep
the sun from me, as to shoot the rain otT from run-
ning into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these
climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.

I had a shortjacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs; and a pair 01
open-knead breaches of the same ; the breeches were
made of a skin of an old he goat, whose hair hung
down such a. length on either side, that, like panta-
loons. it reached to the middle of my legs. Stmkings
and shoes I had none ; hutI had made me a pair 0!
smnething, I scarce knew what to call them, like hus-
kins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either side like
spatterdashes : but of a most barbarous shape, as in
deed were all the rest army clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the same, instead
ofbncklos; and in a kind ofa frog on either side at
this, instead of a sword anti dagger, hung a little saw
and a hatchet; one on one side, one on the other : I
had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
same manner, which hung, over my shoulder; and at
the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches,

.h nade of goat's skins too; in one of which I hung
.ny powder, in the other my shot: at my back 1 car-
ried my basket, on my shoulder my gun. and over my
head a great clumsy ugly goat's skin umbrella; but
which. after all, was the most necessary thing I had
about me, next to my gun. As for my face, the co-
lour of it was really not so Mullatto-like as one might
expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox, My beard
[ had once sull'ered to grow till it was about a quar-
ter of a. yard long; but as I had both scissors and

razors sufficient, I had it out pretty short, except what -

grew on my up er lip, which I had trimmet into a
large pair of ahometan whiskers, such as i had
seen worn by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee: for
the Moors (lid not wearsuch, though the Turks (lid: of
these mustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were
long enough to hang my hat upon them; but they
Mere of length and shape monstrous enough. and such
as in England would have passed for frightful.

But all this is by the by ; for as to my figure, 1 had
so few to observe me, that it was of no manner 01
consequence; so I say no more to that part. in this
kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out
five or six days. [travelled first along the sea-shore,
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to
an anchor, to get up upon the rocks: and. having no
boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer
way, to the same height that I was upon before; when
looking forward to the point of the rock which lay
out, and which l was to double with my boat, as I
said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any
more there than in other places.

I was at a. strange loss to understand this. and re.
solved to spend some time in the observing ofit, to
see it'nothing from the sets of the tide had occasioned
it: but I was presently convinced how it was: viz.
that the title of ehb setting from the west, and ioining

i that according as the wind blew more forcible front
the west, or from the north, this current came near,

being near half a league from the shore: whereas, in
my case, it'set close upon the shore, and hurried me
in my can be along with it, which at another time it
would not have done.
E This observation convinced me, thatl had nothing,
I to do but observe the ebbing and the flowing or' the
. tide, and I might very easily bring my boat al.out
i the island again: but when I began to think of put-
ting it in practice, I had such a terror upon my spi-
-- rits at the remembrance 'of the danger I had been in,
that I could not think ofit again with any patience:
but on the contrary, I took up another resolution
which was more safe, though more laborious ; and thin
"as, that I would build, or rather make tnc anothe
periagua, or canoe: and so have one for one she cu
the island, and. one for-the other. '

You are to understand, that now I had, as? tray
call it, two plantations in the island; one my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under the
rock. with the cave behind me, which'by this time I
had enlarged into several apartments or cat-cs, one
within another. One of these, which was the dr'ns.
and largest, and had a'door out beyond my wall or

mined to the mck, was all filled up with large earthen
. pots, of which I have given an account. and witt
tburteen or fifteen great baskets. which would hold

or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much. that
there was not the least aopearance, to any one's view,
of any habitation behind them.

Near this dwellingol' mine, but alittle farther with-
in the land, and upon lower ground, lay my two
pieces of corn-ground ; which I he tduly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielde me their han'est
in its season : and whenever i had occasion for more
corn, 1 had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this I had my country-scat, and I had now
a tolerable plantation there also; for first, l had my
little bower. as [called it, which [kept in repair;
that is to say, i kept the hedge which circled it in con-
stantly fitted up to its usual height. the ladder stand-
mg always in the inside; I kept the trees, which at
first were no more than my stakes, but were now
grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut,
that they might spread and grow-thick and wild. and
make the more agreeable shad. which they did efl'cc-
tually to my mind. In the middle of this I had my
tent always standing, being a piece of a. sail spread
over poles set up for that purpose, and which never
wanted any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me a. squab or couch, with the skins of the
creatures I had killed, and with other softthings, and
a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sear
bedding, which I had saved. and a great watch-coat
0 cover me; and here, whenever] had occasion to
be absent from my chief seat, I took up my county
habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my enelosures for my cattle,
this is to say, my goats: and as I had taken an in-
conceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this
ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the
goats sltould break through, that! never left off, till
with infinitelabaurl had stuck the outsideof the hedge
so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was
scare room to put a hand through between them.

which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they
all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure
strong, like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that [was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever ap~
peared necessary for my comfortable support; for I
considered the keeping up a breed of tatne creatures

bus at my hand, would be a living magazine offlesh,

milk, butter, and cheese, for me as long as I lived
in the place, if it were to be forty years: and that
keeping them in my reach, depended entirely upon
my perfecting my enclosures to such a degree, that I
might be sure of keeping them together: which by
this method indeed I so effectually secured, that when
these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them
so very thick, I was forced to pull some of them up
gain.

In this place also I had tny grapes growtng, which
I Principally depended on for my winter store at
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve vorv
carefully. as the best and most agreeable dainty nt
my whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable
only, but physical, wholesome, nourishing, and re
freshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my hunt,
I generally staid and lay here in my way thither; for
I used frequently to visit my boat, and I kept all
things about or belonging to her in very good order:
sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no
more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever
above a stone's cast or two from the shore, I was St'
apprehensive of being hurried out of my knowledge
again- by the curren's, or winds, or any other acci
dent. But now I come to a new scene of my life.

It happened one day about noon going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print
of a man's naked foot on the shore, which was very
plain to be seen in the sand: [stood like one thunder-
struck, or as if I had seen an apparation; I listened,

I looked round me, [could hear nothing. nor see any
thing; I went up to a rising ground to look fartner :
I went up the shore, and down the shore, but it was
all one, i could see no otherin'rpression but that one;
I went to it again to see i." there were any more, and
to observe if it might not be my fancy ; but there was
no room for that. for there was exactly the very print
of a. foot, toes, heel, and every part of foot ; how it
came thither I knew not. nor could in the least ima-
gine. But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like
a man perfectly confued, and out of myself. I canto
home to my mortification, not feeling. as we say, the
ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
taking every bush and tree, and faucying every stump
at a distance to he a man : nor is it possible to de
scribe how many various shapes an affrighted imagi-
nation represented things to me ilt ; how many wild
ideas were formed every moment in my fancy, and
what strange unaccountable whimsies came into my
thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I tied into it like one pursued; who-
ther I went over by the ladder, as first contrived, or
went in at the hole in the rock, which i called a door,
lcanuot remember; for never frighted hare fled to
cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than
I to this retreat.

i had no sleep that night ; the farther l was from
the occasion of my fright the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary tothe nature
of such things. and especially to the usual practice at
all creatures in fear. But i was so embarrassed with
my own frightful ideas of the thing, that l formc
nothing but dismal inmginzttiousto myself, even though
I was now a great way of? it. Sometimes i fancied
it must be the devil : and reason joined in with me
upon this supposition. For how should any other

of any other footsteps? And how was itpossible a man
should come there> But then tothink thatSatan should
take human shape upon him in such a place where
there could be no manner of occasion for it, but to
leave the print of his foot behind him, and that-even
for no purpose too (for he could not be sure I should
see it ,3 this was an amazement the other way'; I con

sidere that the devil might have found out abundance
of other ways to have terrified me, than this of the
single print ofa foot; that as I lived quite on the oth

er side of the island, he would never have been so sim

' ple to leave a mark in a place where it was ten thou.-

sand to one whetherl should ever see it or not. and in
the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upml an
high wind would have defaced entirely. All this
seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with all
notionswe usually entertain of the subtlety of the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue
me out of all apprehensions of its being the devil.
And I presently concluded that it must be some more
dangerous creature ; viz. that it must be some of the
savages of the main land over against me, who had
wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driv-
en by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made
the island, and had been on_ shore, but weregone away
again to sea, being as loath, perhaps, to have staid in
this desolate island, as I would have been to have
had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my mind,
I was very thankful in my thought, that.I was so
happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that
they did not see my boat, by which they would have
concluded, that some inhabitants had been in the
place, and perhaps have searched farther for me
'hen terrible thoughts racked my ima inations about
their having found my boat, and that t ere were pco
ple here; and if so, I should certainly have them
come again in great numbers, and devour me; that
if it should happen so that they should not find me
yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my cam

Thus my fear banished all tny religious hope ; a?
that former confidence in God, which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I hatl had of his
goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed me by
miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his power the

revision which he had made for me by his goodness,
freproached myself wit.) my uneasiness, that i would
not sow any more com one year, than would just
serve me till the next season. as if no accident could
intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was
upon the ground. And thisl thought so just a re-
proof, that I resolved [or the future to have two or
three years corn beforehand, so that, whatever might
come, l might not perish for want of bread.

wards, when I hada little recovered my first sue
prism I considered that this was the station of life
the infinitely wise and good rovidence of God had
determined for me : that as Pcould not foresee what
the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, sell
was not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his
creature had an undoubted right by creation to govern
and dispose of me absolutely as he thought fit ; and
who, as l was a creature who had ofl'ended him, had
likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what pun-
islunent he thought tit: and that it was my part to
submit to hear his indignation, because I had sinned
against him.

I then reflected, that God who was not only right-
eous, but omnipotent, as he had thought tit thus to
pnnish'and afflict me, so he was able to deliver me:
that ifhc did not think fit to do it, it was my unques-
tioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely
to his will ; and on the other hand, it was my duty
also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend
the dictates and directions of his daily providence.

These thoughts took tne up many hours, days. nay,
I may say, weeks and months : and one particulat
effect of my cogitations on this occasion I cannot
omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my bed, and
filled with tnoughts about my danger from the appear-
ance of savages. I found it discomposed me very
much: upon which those words of the Scripture came
into my thought, " Call upon me in the day of trou-
ble,"aud I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
me.

Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged to tray earnestly to God for deliverance.
When I had done praying, I took u my Bible. and
opening it to read. the first words dim presented to
me were. " Wait on the Lord. and he of good cheer
and he shall strengthen thy heart : Wait, I say. on
the Lord." [t is impossible to express the comfort
this gave me; and in return,l thankfully laid downi

the book, and was no more sad, at least. not. on that
occasion.

In the middle of these cogitatiOus, apprehenstons,
and reflections. it came into my thoughtsone day, that
all this might be a in -re chimera of my own, and that
this foot might be the print of my own feet. when 1
came on shote from my boat. This cheered me up a
little too, and l began to persuade myself it was all a.
delusion ; that it was nothing else but my own foot;
and why might not I come that way from the boat. as
well as l was going that way to the boat? Again, I
considered also. that I could by no means tell for cer-
tain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that
if at last this was only the print ol'my own foot, I
had played the part ol'tbose fools, who strive to make
stories of'spectres and apparations. and then are them
selves frighted at them more than any body else.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again ; for I had nor stirred out of my castle for three
days and nights, so that l began to starve for provi-
sion; for I had little or nothing within doors, but
some barley cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was
my evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in
great pain and inconvenience for want ofit ; and in-
deed it almost spoiled some of them, and almost
dried up their milk.

l-leartening myself therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing but the print at one of my own feet
(and so I might be truly said to start at tny own sha-
dow.) I began to go abroad again. and went to my
country-house to milk my flock: but to see with what
fear I went forward, how often l looked behind me,
how I was ready, every now and then, to lay down
my basket. and run for my life; it would have made
any one have thought I was haunted with an evil
conscience. or that I had been lately most terribly
frighted : and so intli-ed I had.

However, as i went down tbns two or three days,
and having seen nothing. I began to be a little bolder

and to think there was really nothing in it but my
own imagination; but I could not persuade myself
fully of this, till I should 'go down to the shore again.
and see this print of a cot, and measure it by my
own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness,
-.hat i might be assured it was my own foot. But

when I came to measure the mark with my own foot,

these things filled my head with new imaginations,
and gave me the vapours again to the highest degree;
so that l shock with cold, like one in an ague, and 1
went home again, filled with the belief. that some
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited, and [might be sur-

' sessed with fear! It deprives them ofthe use ofthose
means which reason offers for their relief. The first
thing I proposed to myself was. to throw down my

the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the island in prospect of the same, or
the like hooty : then to the simple thing of digging up
my two corn-fields, that they might not find such a
grain there, and still to be prompted to frequent the
island ; then to demolish my bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of my habitation, and
he prompted to look arther, in order to findput the
persons inhabiting. .
These were the subjects of the first night's cogita~

and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much
than the evil which we are anxious about: but, which
was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this
trouble from the resignation I used to practise. that I
hoped to have. I looked, l thOught. like Saul, who
complained not only that the l-'hilistines were upon
hint, but that God had forsaken him; forl did not
now take (lure ways to compose my mind, by cryingto
lud in my distress, and resting upon his providence,
as I had done before. for my defence and deliver-
ance; which ifl had done| I had, at least, been more
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and
perhaps carried through it with more resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts'kept me waking all
night; but in the morning I fell asleep. and having
by the amusement ofmy mind been, as it were. tired,
and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and
awaked much better composed than I had ever been
before. And now I began to think'sedately ; and,
upon the utmost debate with myself, I concluded, that
this island, which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful,
and no further from the main land than asl had seen,
was not so entirer abandoned as I might imagine,
that although there were no stated inhabitants who
lived on the spot; yet that there might sometimes

. some boats ad from the shore. who either with de-

sign, or perhaps never but when they were driven
by cross winds, might come to this place.

That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had not
met with the least shadow or figure of any people be
fore; and that if at any time they should be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as soon
as ever they could, seeing they had never thought fit
to fix there upon any occasion, to this time.

That the most [could suggest any danger from
was from any such casual accidental landing of
stragglin people from the main, who, as it was
likely. i they were driven hither. were here against
their wills: so they made no stay here, but went off

again with all possible speed, seldom striving one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help of
the tides and day light back again; and that there-
fore I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe
retreat, in case l should see any savages land upon
the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that 1 had dug my
cave so large, as to bring a door through again, whiizh
door, as I said, came out beyond where my fortificat-
tion joined to the rock. Upon maturely considering
this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a second forti-
fication, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance
from my wall, just where I had planted a double row
of trees about twelve years before, of which l made
mention: these trees having been planted so thick
bafore, there wanted but a fetv piles to be driven hex
tween them, that they should be thicker and stronger,
and my wall would be soon finished.

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and every thing I could think of to make .it strong;
having in it seven little holes, about as big as i might
put my arm out at. In the inside ofthisl thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually hringiu;
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot ol' the
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven
holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of which]
took notice that I got seven on shore out of the ship:
these, I say, I planted like my cannon, and fined
them into frames that held them like a carriage, that
so I could fire all the seven guns in two minute: time.
This wall I was many a weary month in finishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without
my wall, for a great way every way, as full with
stakes or sticks oftho osier-like wood, which I (blind

that i believe i might set in ucatr twenty thousand oi

my wall, that! might have room to see an enemy,
and they might have no shelter from the young trees,
if they attempted to approach my outer wall. .
Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and or
five or six years time i had a wood before my dwcl.
ling, grown so monstrous thick and strong that it was
indeed perfectly impassable ; and no man of what
kind soever would ever imagine that there was any
thing beyond it, much less an habitation : as for the
way I proposed myself to go in and out (for i left no
avenue), it was by setting two ladders: one to a part
of the rock which was low, and then broke in, and
left room to place another ladder upon that; so when
the two ladders were taken down, noman living could
come down to me without tnischiefing himself; and it

2 they had come down, they were still on the outside
i of my outer wall.
Thus i took all the measures human prudence could
i suggest for my own preservation ; and it will be seen
g at length, that they were not altogether without just
reason ; though i foresaw nothing at that time more
e than my mere fear suggested.
; While this was doing, I was not altogether careless
Lt" my other atl'airs ; for i had a great concern upon
Inc for my little herd of goats ; they were not only a
present supply to me upon every occasion, and began
. to be sufficient for me, without the expense ofpowder
and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my hunting
after the wild ones; and l was loath to loose the a -
vantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up
over again.

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them, one was to
find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground. on! to drive them into it every night : and
the other was to enclose two or three little hits of
land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as i could, where l might keep about hair a

. dozen young goats itt each place, ; so that ifany (lis-
aster happened to the flock in general, I might be able

to raise them again with little trouble and time 2 and
this, though it would require a great deal of time and
labour, I thought was the most rational design.

Accordingly I spent some time, to find out the
most retired parts of the island ; and I pitched upon
one which was as private indeed as my heart could
wish ; for it wasa little damp piece of ground in the
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as ,is
observed, i almost lost myself once before, endeav
During to come back that way from the eastern part
of the island : here I found a clear piece of land near
three acres, so surounded with woods, that it was
almost an enclosure by nature; at least it did not
Want near so much labour to make it so, "as the other
pieces of ground I had worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this Ipiece of
ground, and in less than a month's time had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to he, were well enough
secured in 1!. So without any farther delay, I re-
moved ten she-goats, and two hc-goats to this piece;
and when there, I continued to perfect the fence, till
I had made it as secure as the other, which, however,
I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time
by a great deal.

All this labour l was at the expense of, purely
from my apprehensions on account of the print of
a man's foot which I had seen ; for as yet, I never
saw any human creature come near the island, and
I had now lived two years under these uneasinesses,
which indeed made my life much less comfortable
than it was before: as may well be imagined. by any
who know what it is to live in the consant snare ot
the fear of man ; and this I must observe with grief
too, that the discomposure of my mind had too
great impressions also upon the religious part of my
thoughts ; for the dread and terror of falling into the
hands of savages and cannilralslzty so upon my spirits,

plication to my Maker , at least not with the sedate
calmness and resignation of soul which I was want In
(lo. I rather prayed to God as under great affliction

' and pressure of mind, surrounded with danger. and in

expectation every night of being murdered and de-
voured before the morning; and I must testify from
my experience, that a temper of peace, thankfulness,
ove, and afl'ectipn, is much more the proper frame
for prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and
hat under the dread ofmischief impending, a mum is
to more fit for a comforting performance of the tint
of praying to God, then he is for repentance on a tie
bed ; for these discomposures affect the mind as the
others do the body; and the diseomposure of the
mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that
of the body, and much greater; praying to God being
properly an act of the mind, not of the body.

But to 0 on : after I had thus secured one part 0!
my little living stock, I went about the whole island,
searching for another private place, to make such
another deposit ; when wandering more to the west

oint of the island than I had ever done yet, and
coking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the
sea at a great distance; I had found a perspective
glass or two In one of the se'amen's chests, which I
saved out of our ship; but I had it not about me, and
this was so remote, that [could not tell what to make
of it, though [looked at it till my eyes were not able
to look any longer : whether it was a boat or not, I
do not know; but as I descended from the hill, I
could see no more of it, sol gave it over; only I

resolved to go in more without a perspective glass In
my pocket.

When 1 was come down the hill, to the end of the.

island, where indeed I had never been before, I was
presertly convinced, that the seeing the print of a
man's foot, was not such a strange thing in the island
us I imagined ; and, but that it wasa special provi-
dence that l was cast upon the side of the island where
the savages never came, I should easily have known

that nothing was more frequent than for the canoe:
from the main. when they happened to be a little tot;
far out at sea, to shoot over to that side of the island
for harbour ; likewise, as they often met, and fought
in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prison-
ers, would bring them over to this shore, where, ac
cording to their dreadful customs, being all canniba'a
they would kill and eat them : of which hereafter.

Vthn I was come down the hill to the shore, .4". I
said above, being the S. W. point of the island, I was
pefectly confounded and amazed; nor is it possible
for me to ex mass the horror of my mind at seeing the
shore sprea with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones
of human bodies; and particularly l observed a data
where there had been a fire made, and a circle ug in
the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is supposed the
savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feast-
ings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures.

l was so astonished with the sight of these things,
that l entertained no notions of any danger to thyself
from it, fora long while: all my apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a itch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, anti the horror t g, the degeneracy 0!
human nuture ; which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before : in short, I
turned away my face from the horrid spectacle ; my
stomach grew sick, and l was just at the aim at
fainting, when nature discharged the tlisort er from
my stomach,and. having vomited with an uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill
again with all the speed I could, and walked on to
wards my own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island
I stood still a while as amazed ; and then recovering
myself, I looked up with the utmost affection or my
soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes. gave
God thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part oft'..c
world where l was distinguished from such dreadful
creatures as these; and that though i had esteemed

my present condition very miserable, had yet given
me so many comforts in it, that I had still more to
give thanks for than to complain of; and this above
all, that! had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of himself, and the
hope of his blessing, which was a felicity more than
sufiiciently equivalent to all the misery which I had
suffered, or could suffer.

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my
castle, and began to be much easier now, as to the
safety of my circumstances. than ever I was before;
for Iohserved, that these wrctches never came to this
island in search of what they could get; perhaps not
seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any thing
here, and having often. no doubt, been up in the co-
vered woody part of it, without finding any thing to
their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost
eighteen years, and I never saw the least footsteps of
a human creature there before; and might be here
eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now, if
I did not discover myself to them, which! had no
manner of occasion to do, it being my only business
to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
3' found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to.

Yet I entertained such an ahhorrence of the savage
wretches that I have been speaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman custom of their devouring and eat-
mg one another up, that Icontinued pensive and sad,
and kept close within my own circle for almost two
years after this: when I say my own circle, I mean
by it my three plantations, viz, my castle, my coun-
try-seat, which I called my bower, and my enclosure
in the woods; nor did I look after this for any other
use than as an enclosure for my goats: for the aversion
which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was
such, that I was as fearfiil of seeing them as of seeing
the devil himself; nor did Iso much as go to look
nf'tm- mv heat in all this time, but began rather to

think of making me another; for: I could not think of
ever making any more attempts to bring the other
boat round the island to me, lestl should meet with
some of those creatures at sea, in which, if I had
happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew
what would have been my lot. .

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these people
began to wear of? my uneasiness about them; and I
began to live just in the same composed manner as
before; only with this difference. that I used more
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my
gun lest any of them on the island should happen to
hear it; and it was therefore a very good provi-
dence to me. that I had furnished myself with a tame
breed of gaats, that I had no need to hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and ifl did catch
any more of them after this, it was~ by traps and
snares, as I had (lone before; so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once ofl',
though i never went out without it; and, which was

' more, as l had saved three pistols out of the ship, 1
always carried them out with me, or at least two of

' them, sticking them in my goatskin belt: I likewise
furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I had out
of the ship, and made me a belt to put it in also; so
that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at
when I went abroad, if you add to the former descrip-
tion of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a
great broadsword. hanging at my side in a belt, but
without a scnbbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some
time. I seeme , excepting these cautions, to be re
duced to my former calm sedate way of living. All
these things tended to show me more and more how
far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others: nay, to many other particulars of life,
which it might have pleased God to have made my

5 not. It prt me upon reflecting, how little repimn
there would be among mankind, at any condition 0
life, if people would rather compare their condition
with those that are worse, in order to be.thankful,
than be always comparing them with those which are
better, to assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
man things which I wanted, soindeed i thought that
the rights I had been in about these savage wretches,
and the concern I had been in for my own preservae
tiou, had taken all the edge of my invention for my
own conveniences, anti I had (lro ped a good design,
which I had once bent my'thougtts upon; and that
was, to try if] could not make some of my barley
into malt, and then try to brew myself some beer:
this was really a whimsical thought, and l reproved
myself often for the simplicity of it, for l presently
saw there would be the want of several things neces-
sary to 'he making my beer, that it would be impos-
sible for me to supply; as. first, casks to preserve it
in, which wasa thing that, as l have observed-already, '
l could never compass; no, though I spent not many
days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to
' no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to
make it keep, no yeast to make itwork, no copper or ,
kettle tomake it boil; and 'et, had not all these things
intervened, I mean the ti'ights and terrors l was in
about the savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps
brought. it to pass too ;- for] seldom gave any thing
over without accom lishing it, when I once had it in
my head enough-to 'egin it. '
But my invention now run quite another away ; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how l
might destroy some of these monsters in their crue'
bloody entertainment, and, if possible, save the victim
they should bring hither to destroy. it would take up
a larger volume than this whole work is intended to _

or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot "as true to a mark as I could with my gun ?

where they made their fire, and put in five or si
pounds of gunpowder, which, when they kindled thei
fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up al
that was near it; but, as in the first place lshould he
very loath to waste so much powder upon them, my
store being now within the quantity of abarrel. st
neither could I be sure of its oing off at any certain
time, when it might surprize t cm ; and, at best, that
it would do little more than just blow the fire about
their ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make
them forsake the place ; so I laid it aside, and then
proposed, that I would place myself in ambush in
some convenient place, with my three guns all douhle
loaded, and in the middle of their bloody ceremony
let fly at them, when [should be sure to kill orwonnd

erhaps two or three at every shot; and then falling!
in upon them with my three pistols, and my sword,
made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I should
kill them all : this fancy pleased my thoughts for
some weeks, and. I was so full of it that I often dream-
ed of it; and sometimes, that I was just going to let
fly at them in my sleep.

I went so far with it in my indignation, that I em-
ployed myself several days to- find out proper places
to put myself in amhuscade. as I said, to watch for
them ; and I went frequently-to the place itself, which
was now grown more familiar to me: and especially
while my mind was thus filled with thoughtslot' re-

0F ROBINSON UKUSOE. I73

Well, at .ength I found a place in' the side of the
mil, whereI was satisfied I might securely wait' till I
saw any of the boats coming, and might then, even'
before they would be ready to come on shdre, convey
myself unseen into thickets of trees, in one of which
there was an hollow large enough to conceal me en-
tirely; and where I might sit, and observe all their
bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads,
when they were so close together, as that it would be'
next to impossible that! should miss my shoot, or
that I could fail wounding three or four 0 them at the
first shoot.

In this place then I resolved to fix my design ; and
accordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary
fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a
brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets,
about the size of pistol-bullets, and the fowling-piece
I loaded with near an handful of swan-shot of the
largest size ; I also loaded my pistols with about four
bullets each : and in this posture, well provided with
ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared
myself for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and in my imagination put it in practice, I continue
ally made my tour every morning up to the top of the
hill' which was from my castle, as I called it, about
three miles or more, to see if I could observe any
boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or stand-
ing over towards it ; but I began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had [or two or three months constantly

I kept my watch ; but came always back without any

discovery, there having not in all that time been the
least ap earnncc, not only on or near the shore, but
not on t re whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses
could reach every way.

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look out. so long also I kept up the vigour of my de
sign, and my spirits seemed to be all the while in a
suitable trame for so outrageousan execution, as the
killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an offence,

which I had not at all entered into a discussion of In

' my thoughts, any further than my passions were at

first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural
custom of the people of that country, who, it seems,
had been suffered by Providence, In his wise disp05i-
tion of the wo'ld, to have no other guide than that of
theimwn abominable and vitiated passions; and con-
nequently were left, and perhaps had been for some
ages, to act such horIid things and receive such dread-
ful customs, as nothing but natuIe entirely abandoned
of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy,
could have run them into; but now, when, as I have
said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion
which I had made so long, and so far, every morning
in vain; so my opinion of the action itself began to
alter, and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts,
to consider what it was I was going to engage in;
what authority or callI had to pretend to be judge
and executioneI II on these men as criminals, whom
Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer, un.
punished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the execn.
tioners of his judgments upon one another; also, how
far these people were ofi'enrieis against me, and what
rialItl had to engage in the quarrel of that blood,

which they shod prmniscuously one u on another. I
debated this very often with IIIyselftI us: How do!
know what God himselfjudges In this particular case'
It is certain these people do not commit this as a
crime- , It is not arrainst their own consciences repr0v-
ing, or their light reproaching them. They do not
know it to' be an offence. and then commit it in deft-
ance of divine justice as we do' In almost all the sins
we commit They think it no more a crime to kill a
captive taken In war, than we do to kill an ox; nor
to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When I considered this a little, it followed he.
cessarily, that I was certainly In the wrong in it; that
these people were not murderers" In the sense that I
had before condemned them" In my thoughts, any more
than those Christians were murderers, who often put

to death the prisoners taken in battle; or more fre-
quently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of
men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they '
threw down their arms and submitted.
In the next place, it occurred to me. that albeit the
usage they gave one another was thus brutish and it>> '
human, yet it was really nothing to me ; these people
had done me no injury .- that if they attempted me.
orI saw it necessary for my immediate preservation
to fall upon them, something might be said for it ; but ,
that I was yet out of their power, and they had really
no knowledge of me, and consequently no design
upon me; and therefore it could not he just for me )
to fall upon them - that this would justify the conduct '
of the Spaniards, in all their barbaritiCS practised in 2
America, where they destroyed millions of these g
people, who however they were idolators and har- 5
rians. and had several bloody and barbarous rites in
these customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to g
their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards verv inno-
cent people: and that the rooting them out ofthe coun--
try is spoken of with the utmost abhorrence and detes-
tation, even by the Spaniards themselves, at this time,
and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a
mere butchery. a bloody and unnatural piece of cru- e
elty, unjustifiable either to God or man : and such, as
for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to 5

the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is '

less they first attacked me, and this it was my bus!
ness, if possible, to prevent; but that if I were disco-
vered and attacked. then I knew my duty.

0n the other hand, I argued with myself that this
really was the way not to deliver myself, but entirely
to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was sure to
kill every one that not only should be on shore at that
time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards,
If but one of them escaped to tell their country peOple
what had happened, they would come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows; and I
should only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which at presentI had no manner of occasion for.

Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in prin-
ciples nor in policy, I ought one way or other to con-
cern myselfin this affair: that my business was by
all possible means to conceal myself from them, and
not to leave the least signal to them to guess by, that
there were any living creatures upon the island, I

'mean of humnn shape.

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I wa r.
convinced now many ways that I was perfectly out of
my duty when I was laying all my bloody schemel
for the destruction of innocent creatures I mean in-
nocent as to me; as to the crime they were guilty 0!
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them;
they were national punishments to make a gust retri-
bution for national offences; and to bring publicjudg-
ments upon those who afl'end in a public manner, by
such ways as best please God.

This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was
agreater satisfaction to me, than that I had not been
sufl'ered to do a thing which I now saw so much rea-
son to believe would have been no less a sin than that
of wilful murder, if I had comitted it; and I gave
most humble thanks on my knees to God, that had
thus delivered me from blood-guiltincss; heseeching
him to grant me the protection of his Providence. that
I might not fall into the hands of borbarians ; or that
I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had a

more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of
to own life.

In this disposition I continued for neara year after
this: and so far was I from desiring an occasion for
falling upon these wretches, that in all that time I
never once went up the hill to see whether there were
any of them in sight, or to know whether any ofthem
had been on shore there, or not; that I might not he
tempted to renew any of my contrivauces against
them, or he provoked, by any advantage which might
present itself, to fall upon them; only thisl didl
went and removed my boat. which I had on the other
side of the island, and carried it (low to the east end
of the whole island. and carried it down to the east end
of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove
which I found under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by reason of the currents, the savages du'rst
not, at least would not, come with their boats upon
any account whatsoever.

With my boat I carried away every thing that I had
left there belonging to her, though not necessary for
the bare going thither; viz. a mast and soil, which I
had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but in-
deed which could not be called either anchor or grap-
ling; however, it was the best I could make of its
kind. All these I removed. that there might not be
the least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance
ofmy boat,or of any habitation upon the island.

Besides this, I kept myself. as I- said. more retired
than ever, and seldom went from my cell. other than
upon my constant employment, viz. to milk my she-
goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which,
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger: for certain it is, that these
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island,
never came with any tltoughtsvof finding any thing
here, and consequently never wandered off from the
coast; and I doubt not but they tnight have been
several times on shore, after my apprehensions of
them had made me cautious, as well as hefore; and

)les of the success of this conduct in the course ofmy
ife; but more especially in the latter part of my in
habiting this unhappy island ; besides many occasions
which it is very likely I might have taken notice of,
if I had seen with~the same'eyes then that I saw with
now : but 'tis never too late to be wise; and I cannot

tended with sueh extraordinary incidents as mineI or
en en though not so extraordinary, not to slight such
secret intimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible intelligence they will; that I shall not
discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but certainly

secret communication between those embodied, and
those unembodied ; and such a proof as can never be
withstood : of which .I shall have occasion to give

some very remarkable instances, in the remainder of ,

my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange,
if I confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers
I lived in, and the concern that was now upon me,
but an end to all invention, and to all the contrivance
that I had laid for my future accommodations ano
conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now
upon my hand than that of my food. I cared not to
drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the
noise I should make should be heard; much less would

betray me; and for this reason I removed that pan
of my business which required fire, such as burning
of pots and pipes, 850. into my new apartment in the
wood; where, after Ihad been some time, I found,
to my unspeakable cansolation, a mere natural cave
in the earth, which went in a vast way, and where.
I dare say, no savage, had he been in the mouth ofit'
would be so hardy as to venture in. nor indeed would
any man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing
so much as a safe retreat.

The mouth of this llullow was at the bottom of n

' from rock, where, by mere accident, (I would say, it

did not see an abundant reason to ascribe all such
things to Providence,) I was cutting down somt
thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and before
I go on, I must observe the reason of my making thin
charcoal, which was thus:

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tion, as I said before; and yet i could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &,c. ; so
I contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England under turf, till it became chark, or
dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved
the coal to carry home, and perform the other ser-
vices. which fire was wanting for at home, without
danger or smoke.

But this by the by: while I was cutting down
some wood here, I Kerceived thatbehind a very thick
branch of low brus wood, or underwood, there was
a kind of hollow place ; I was curious to look into it,
and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it. I
found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for
me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with
me; but I must confess to you. I made more haste
out than I did in. when, looking further into the place.
which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining
eyes of sort!n "mature, whether devil or man l'lmew

from the cave's mouth shining directlyin and making
the reflection.

However, after some pause, I recovered myself.
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone, and
that l durst to believe there was nothing in this care
that was more frightful titan myself; upon this, pluck-
ing up my courage, 1 took up a large firebrand, and
in I rushed agin, with the stick flaming in my hand:
i had not gone three steps in, but I was almost as
much frightened as l was before ; for] heard a very
loud sigh, like thatot'a man in some pain; and it was
followed by a broken noise, as if of words half-ex-
pressed, and then a deep sigh again : I stepped back,
and was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put
me intoa cold sweat; and ifl had had an hat on my
head, I will not answer for it that my hair might
not have lifted it off. But still plucking up my spirits
us well as i could, and encouraging myself a little,
with considering that the power and presence of God
was every where, and was able to protect me ; upon
this l stepped forward again, and by the light of the
firehrand, holding it up it little over my head, i saw
lying on the ground a most monstrous frightful old
he goat, just making his will, as we say, gasping for
life, and dying indeed of mere old age.

I stirred him a little to see in could get him out,
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and i thought with myself, he might even
lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there. while he had
any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began
to look round me, when i found the cave was hut
very-small: that IS to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, either ruuml tn
square, no hands havmgever been employed in n uk-
ing it but those of mere nature: 1 observed also, that

there was a place at the farther side of it that went

upon my hands and knees to get into it, and whithut
It wentl knew not; so having no candle, 1 gave it
over for some time, but resolved to come again the
next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box,
which 1 had made of the lock of one of the muskcts,
with some wildfire in the pan. '

Accordingly, the next day,l came provided with
six large candles of my own making, for i made very
good candles now of goats taliow ; and going into
this low place, I was obliged to cree ) upon all fours,
as l have said, almost ten yards ; wnich, by the way,
I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that
I knew not how far it might go, or what was beyond
It. When I was got through the streight, I found the
roof rose higher u a, I believe near twenty feet; but
never was such a g orious sight seen on this island, I
dare 'say as it was, to look round the sides and root

' of this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred

thousand lights to me from my two candles; what it
was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other pre-
cious stones, or gold,which I rather supposed it to
be, I knew not.

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto. of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had
a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that there was
no nauseous creature to be seen; neither was there
any damp or wet on the sides of the roof; the only
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as
it wasa lace of security, and such a retreat as I
wanted. thought that was a convenience ; so that l
was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolver],
without any delay, to bring some of those things which
i was inOst anxious ahout to this place ; particularly,
I resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder,
anti all my spare arms. viz. two fowling--pieces (for I
had three in all) and three muskcts; (for of them i
'mel eight in all) sol kept at my castle only five, whichrwwxmw~~wsm&\\mws\

any expedition. ' .
Upon this occasion of retrieving my ammunition,
l was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
g took up out of the sea, and which had been wet; and
I found, that the water had penetrated about three or
four inches into the powder on every side, which,
coking and growing hard, had preserved the inside g
like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the cask ; i

pitulated for spendingthe rest of my time there, even
to the last moment, till I had laid me down and died,
like the old goat, in the cave: I had also arrived to
some little diversions and amusements, which made
the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal
than it did before ; as. first, I had taught my l'ul, as

but if he did, he would certainly believe it was the

that l was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to
keep them from devouring me, and all I had ; but at
length, when the two old ones I brought with me

them from me, and letting them have no provision
with me, they all ran wild into the woods, except two
or three favourites, which I kept tame, and whose

these were part of my family: besidesthese, l always
kept two orthree household kids about me, which I

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. l85

we seek most to shun, and which, when we are fallen
'nto, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very
neans or door of our deliverance, by which alone we
can be raised again from the affliction we are fallen
into. I could give many examples of this in the
course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing was
it more particularly remarkable, than in the circum-
stpncss of my last years of solitary residence in this
IS an .

It was now the month of December, as I said above,
In my twenty-third ear; and this being the southern
solstice, for winter cannot call it, was the particular
time of my harvest, and required my being pretty
much abroad in the fields; when going out pret
early in the morning, even before it was thornug
day-light, I was surprised with seeing a light of
some fire upon the share, at a distance front me of
about two miles, towards the end of the islands, where
I had observed some savages had been, as before ; but
not on the other side; but, to my great affliction, it
was on my side of the island.

l was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my rove, not daring to go out,
lest I might be surprise ; and yet I had no more
peace within, from the apprehensions I had, that if
these savages, in rambling over the island, should find
my corn standing, or cut, or any of my works and
improvements, they would immediately conclude that
there were pen le in the place, and would then never
give over till trey found me out. In this extremity
i went back directly to my castle, pulled up the lad-
der after me. having made all things Without look as
\\ :lul and natural as l could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a
posture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, asl
called them, that is to say, my muskets, which were
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pis-
tols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gas );
not tirrgettiug seriously to recommend myself tot is
divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to de

Lver me out of me hands of the barbarians; and in
this posture I continued about two hours, but began?
to he mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for
' had no spies to send out.
5 After sitting awhile longer, and musing what l
5 should do in this case, i was not able to bear sitting
5 in ignorance longer; so sitting. up my ladder to the
r side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as 1 01)-
$ served before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top ofthe
hill; and pulling out my petspective glass, which l had
taken on purpose, l laid me down flat on my belly on
the ground, and began to look for the place. i
presently found there were no less than nine naked
savages sitting round a small fire they had made,- not
to 'varm them, for they had no need ofthat, the wea-
ther being extreme hot; but as I supposed, to dress
some of their barbarous diet of human flesh which
they had brought with them, whether alive or dead 1
could not know.

They had, two canoes with them, which they had
haled up upon the shore ; and as it was then tide of
ebb, they seemed to me to wait the return of the
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine
what confusion this sight put me into, especiaily see-
ing them come on my side the island, 'and so near me
too; but when 'I observed their coming must be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards
to be more sedate in my mind, being satisfied that I
might go abroad with safety all the time ot' tide ol
flood, if they were not on shore before; and having
made this observation, I went abroad about my har
vest work with the more'composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take boat,
and row (or paddle, as we call it) all away ; I should
have observed, that for an hour and more before they
went off; they went to dancing. and I could easily
discern their postures and gestures by my glasses: 1
could only perceive, by my nicest observation, that

i

they were stark naked, and had not the least cover-
ing u on them ; but whether they were men orwoinen,
that could not distin uish.

As soon as I saw t rem shipped and gone, I took

two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my

girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard ; and With all the speed I was able to make,
I went away to the hill, where I had discovered the
first appearance of all. As soon as I got thither
which was not less than two hours, (for I could not go
apace, being so loaded with arms asI was,) l per-
ceived there had been three canoes more of savages
on that place; and looking out further. lsaw they
were all at sea together, ma ing over for the main.

This was a dreadful sight to me. especially when,
Foing down to the shore, I could see the marks 0!
tor-rm- which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and part
of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured by
those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so
filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now
to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw
there, let them be who or how many soever.

It seemed evtdem to me, that the visits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent; for
it was above fifteen months before any more of then:
came on shore there again; that is to say, I never
saw them, or any footsteps or signals of them, in all
that time; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are
sure not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet all
this while iltved uncomfortably, by reason of the
constant apprehensions I was in of their coming upon
me by surprise; from whence I observe, that the ex
pectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering
especially if there is no room to shake off that ex
pcctation or those apprehensions.

During all this time, [was in the murdering htt-
mour: and look up most of my hours, whicn should
have been better employed, in contriving how to cir-
tumvent and fall upon them the very next time I,memw \wwnmm\ww \wu>>\-\MW~WM\\M' _

should see them ; especially it they should be divided,
as they were the last time, into two parties; nor did
I consider at all, that if l killed one party, suppose
ten or a dozen, l was still the next day, or week, or
month, to kill another, and so another, even ad infi-
m'lum, till Ishould be at length no less a murderer
than they were in being men-eaters, and perhaps
much more so.

I spent my daysnow in great perplexityand anxiety
of mind, expecting that I should one day or other fair
into the hands of those merciless creatures; if I did
at any time venture abroad, it was not without look-
ing round me with the greatest care and caution ima-

inable; and now I found, to my great com-fort, how
apjiyjt was that I had provided a tame {lock or
her ofgoats; for l dursl not, upon any account, fire
my gun, especially near that side of the island, where
they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages;
and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have
them come back again, with perhaps two or three
hundred canoes with them in a few days, and then l
knew what to expect.

However. i wore out a year and three months more
before I ever saw any more of the savages, and then
I found them again, as I shall soon observe. It is
true, they might have been there once or twice, but
either they made no stay, or, at least, I did not hear
them: but in the month of May, as near as l cauld
calculate, and in my four-aml-twentieth year, I had

dat- would reckon, for l marked all unon the post
still; 1 say, it was on the sixteenth of Mav that it
blew agreat storm of wind all day, with a 5")3', deal
of lightning and thunder, and a very foul nigi' was
after it; I know not what was the particular occasion
ofit; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken
up with serious thoughts about my present condition,
I was surprised with the noise of a gun as I thought,
fired at. sea.

This was, to be sure, a surprise ofa quite different
nature from anyI hall met with before ; for the no
tions this put into my thoughts were quite of another
kind : I started up in the greatest haste imaginable ,
and in a triee clapped up my ladder to the middle
piece of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mount--
ing it the second time, got to the top of the hill ; that
very moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a second

ttn, which accordingly in about half a. moment I
teard, and by the sound knew that it was from that
part of the sea where l was driven out with the cur-
rent in my boat.

Iimmediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or
some other ship in company, and fired these guns for
signals of distress, and to obtain help I had this

rescnce of mind at that minnteas to think.that though

could not help them, it may be they might help me;
so I brought together all the dry wood I could get .at
hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on
fire upon the hill; the wood was dry, and blazed
freclv, and though the wind blew very hard, yet it
burnt fairly out, so that lwas certain, if there was any
such thing as a ship, they must need see it, and no
doub they did; for as soon as ever my fire blascd up
I he: at another gun, and after thatseveral others, all
from the same quarter. l plied my fire all night long,
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance
at sea full east of the island. whether a sail, or an
hull. Icoul not distinguish, no not with my glasses.

the distance was so great and the weather still some.
thing hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.

- I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon per-
ceived that it did not move; sol resently concluded
that it was a ship at anchor; ang being eager, you.
may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my
hand and ran towards the south-east side of the island,
to the rocks. where I had been formerly carried away
with the current ; and getting up there, the weather
by this time being perfectly clear, i could plainly see,
to my great sorrow the wreck of a ship cast away in
the night upon those concealed rocks which I found
wlten [ was out in my boat: and which rocks. as thy
checked the violence ofthe stream, and made a ltind
ofcounter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my
recovering then from the most desperate hopeless con-
dition that ever i had been in all my lile.

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's .ie-
struction : for it seems these men, whoever they were,
being out of their knowledge, and the rocks being
wholly under water, had been drived upon them in
the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E. N. E.
Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily sup
pose they did not, they must as] thou ht, have endea-
voured to have saved themselves on s ore hy the help
of their boat; but the firing of their guns for help,
especially when they saw, as I imagined, my fire,
filled the with many thoughts: first, I imagined, that,
upon seeing my light, they might have put themselves
into their boat, and have endeavoured to make the
shore; but that the sea going very high, they might
have been cast away ; other times I imagined, that
they might have iost their boat before, as might be
the case many ways; as particularly, by the breaking
of the sea upon their ship, which many times ohliges
men tovstave, or take in pieces their boat ; and some-
times to throw it overboard with their own hands.
other timesl imagined, they had some other ship 0!
ships in company. who, upon the signals of distress
they had made, had taken them up, and carried them

ofi; other whiles I fancied they were all gone oil to
sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the cur-
rent that I had been formerly in, were carred out into
the great ocean, where there was nothing but misery
and perishing; and that perhaps they might by this
time think of starving, and of being in a condition to
eat one another.

All these were butconjcctures at best, so, in the
xonllillon I was in, I could do no more than look
.tpun the misery of the poor men, and pity them;
which had still thisgood effect on my side, that it gave
me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who
had so happily and comfortably provided for me in
my desolate condition; and that of twoships' compa--
nies who were now cast away upon this part of the
world, not one life should be spared but mine. I
learnt here again to observe, that it is very rare that
the providence of God casts us into any condition of
life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see
something or other to be thankful for, and may see
others in worse circumstances than our own.

Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom
I could not so much as see room to suppose any of
them were saved ; nothing could make it rational, so
much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish
there, exce tthe possibility only of their being taken
up by anot er ship in company: and this was but
mere possibility indeed ; for I saw not the least signal
or appearance of any such thing. '

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words
what a strange longing, or hankering of desire, I felt
in my soul upon this sight ; breaking out sometimes
thus: " 0 that there had been but one or two, nay,
but one soul saved out of the ship, to have escaped to
me, thatl might but have had one companion. one
fellow-creature to have spoken to me, and to hate
conversed with 1" In all the time of my solitary life,
I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the so-
riety of my fellow-creatures or so deep 3 regret at
the want of it

There are some secret moving springs in the afl'ec'
Hons, which, when they are set a going by some ob-
ject in view, or be it some object though not in view,
yet rendered present to the mind by the power of
Imagination, that motion carries out the soul by its
impetuosity to such violent eager embracings of the
object, that the absence of it is insupportable.

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the rea-

son and manner of them : all I can say of them is to
describe the fact, which was ever surprising to me
when I found it, though l knew not from what it
should proceed ; it was doubtless the afl'ect of ardent
wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, reav
lizing the comfort which the conversation of one of

l m - fellow-Christians would have been to me. .

; ut it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine, or

5 both, forhad it; for till the last year of my being on

f this island, l never knew whether any were saved
out of that ship, or no ; and had only the affliction
some days after to see the-corpse of a drowned boy
come on shore, at the end of the island which was

a next the shipwreck ; he had on no clothes but a sea-

; man's waiscuat, a pair of open-knead linen drawers,

5 and a blue ltnen shirt; but nothing to direct me so

I much as to guess what nation he was of: he had no-

; out itt my boat to tltis wreck, not doubting butl
; might find something on board that might be useful
to me; but that did not altogether press me so much,
as the possibility that there might be yet some living
creature on board, whose life might not only save,
but might, by saving that life, comfort my own tn
the last degree: and this thought clung so to my heart,
SS that I could not be quiet night nor day, but I must
venture out in my boat on board this wreck; and
committing the rest to God's providence,l thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind, that it
could not be resisted, that it must come from some
invisible direction, and that i should be wanting to
myself i" did not go.

Under the power of this impression, l hastened
hack to my castle, prepared every thing for my voy-
age, took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh
water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum, (for 1
had still a great deal of that left) a basket full of
raisins: and thus loading myself with every thing
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water out
of her, and got her afloat. loaded all my cargo in her,
and then went home again for more: my secend
cargo was a great bag full of'rice. the umbrella to set
up over my head for shade, another large pot full 0!
fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves,

' or barley-cakes, more than before, with a bottle of
goat's milk, and a cheese: all which, with great In.--

currents I should he carried a vast way out to sea,
and perhaps out of my reach, or sight of the island
again; and that then. as my boat was but small, ifany
little gale of wind should rise, 1 should be inevitably
lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began
to give over my enterprise, and having haled my bout
into a little creek on the shore, I stepped out, and set
me down upon a little spot of rising ground, very pen
give an Ianxious, between fear and desire. about my
voyage; when, as l was musing. I could perceive that
the title was turned. and the flood came on, upon
which my going was for so many hours impracticable:
this it presently occurred to me, that I should go up
to the highest piece of gtound I could find, and ob-
serve, if I could, how the sets ofthe tide or currents
lay, when the flood came in, that I might judge
whether, if I was driven one way out, I might not
expect to be driven another way home, with the same
rapidness of the currents. 'l'his thought was no
sooner in my head, but 1 cast my eyes upon a little
hill which suliiciently overlooked the sort both ways,
and from whence I had it clear view ofthe currents,
or sets of the title. and which way lwas to guide
myself in my return: herel found, that as the current
of the ebb set out close by the south point of the
isiand. so the current of the flood set in close by the
shore ofthe north side; and that l had nothing to do
but to keep to the north ofthc island in my return,
and I should do well enough.

I'Incouragcd with this observation, l resolved the
next morning to set out with the first of the tide ; and
reposing myself for that night in the canoe, under
the great watch coat l mentioned, I launched out. I
made first a title out to sea full north, till 1 began to
feel the benefit ofthe current, which sat eastward, and
which carried the at a great rate, and yet did not so
hurry me as the southern side current had done before,
and so as to take from me all government of the
boat; but having a strong steerage with my puddle. l

went, I say, at a great rate, directly for the mesh
and in less than two hours l came up to it.

It was a dismal sight to look at: the ship, whioh
by its building was S anish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; allt iestern and quarter ofhcr was
beaten to pieces with the sea: and as her forecastle,
which stuck in the rocks, had run on with great VIO-
lence, her-main-mast and fore-mast were brought by
the board, that is to say, broken short off, but her
boltsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared
firm. When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon
her, which, seeing me coming, yelped'and cried, and
as soon as l called him, jumped into the sea to come
to trie : and I took him into the boat, but found him
almost dead for hunger and thirst: [gave him a cake
of my bread, and he ate like a ravenous wolfthat
had been starving a fortnight in the snow: I then gave
the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if J
would have let him. he would have burst himself.

After this 1 went on board. The first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the shi , with their armn 'ast about one
another. I conclu ed, as is indeed probable, that
when the ship struck, it being in a storm,the sen broke
so high, on so continual] ' over her, that lie n~en
were not able to bear it, an were strangled with the
constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they
had been under water Besides the dog, there was
nothing left in the ship that had life, nor any goods
that I could see, but what were spoiled by thewaler:
there were some casks of liquor, whether wine at
brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and
which, the water bein ehbed out, [could see; bu
they were too big to me the with: l saw several chests

' which I believed belonged to some of the seamen,

I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal oi
wealth on board ; and if I may guess by the course
she steered, she must have been bound from the flue
nos Ayres, or. the Rio de la Plate,.in the south part 01
America, beyond the Brasils. to the Havanna, in this
Gui h of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain: she had
no oubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use at tha:
shoe to any body; and what became of the rest 0
her people I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full 0
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into m)
boat with much difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in a cabin, and a great powder--ham, with about
four pounds of powder in it: as for the muskets. I
had no occasion for them, sol left them, but took the
owder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which
wanted extremely; as also two little brass kettles,
a copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and
with this cargo, and the do , I came away, the tide
beginning to make home again; and. the same even-
ing. about an hour within night, I reached the island, '
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning
I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new.
cave, not to carry it home to my castle. Afterw-
freshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and began
to examine the particulars: the cask ofliquor I found
to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the
llrasils; and, in a word, not all good; but whenl
came to Open the chests, I found several things which
i wanted : for example, I found in one a fine case 0!
bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cos- /
dial waters, fine, and very good, the bottles held i

I found two pots of very good succades, or sweet

the water had spoiled : I found some very good shirts,

Besides this, when l came to the till in the chest. I

three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their fowl-

little by this voyage that was of much use tome; for,
as to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it;
it was tu me as the dirt under my feet ; and l would
havegiven it all for three or four pair of English
shoes and stockings which \'vere things I greatly want

I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which 1

laiJ her up, and made the best of my way to my
old habitation, where I found every thing safe and
quiet ;. so I began to repose myself; live after my old
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for
awhileI lived easy enough ; only that I was more vi
gilant than I used tobe, looked out oftener, and did
not go abroad so much ; and if at any time I did stir
with any freedom, it was always to the east part of
the island, where! waspretty well satisfied the savages
never came, and where I could go without so many
precautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition
as I always carried with me, if I went the other way.

I lived in this condition near two years more ; but
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it
was born to make my body miserable, was all these
two years filled with projects and designs, how, if it
were possible, l might get away from this island : for
sometimes I was for making another voyage to the
wreck. though my reason told me, that there was no-
thing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; some-
times for a ramble one way, sometimes another; and
I believe verily, if I had. had the boat thatI Went from
Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound any
where, [knew not whither. '

to those who are touched with that general plague of
mankind, whence, for alight I know, one halfof their
miseries flow; I mean. that of not being satisfied with
the station wherein God and nature hath placed them;

or, not to look back upon my primitive condition,
and the excellent advice of my father. the opposition
to which was, as I may call it, my original sin, my
subsequent mistakes of the same kind have been the
tneans of my coming into this miserable condition
for had that Providence. which so happily had seated
me at the Brasils as a planter, blessed me with con.
fitted desires, and could I have been contented to have
gone on gradually, I might have been by this time. I

the most considerable planters in the Brasils ; nay. I
am persuaded, that by the improvementsl had made
in that little time I lived there, and the increase i
should probably have made if I had stayed, I might
have been worth a hundred thousand moidores; an:
what business had I to leave a settled forture, well
stocked plantation, improving and increasing, to tun
supercargo to Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when patienct
and time would have so increased our stock at. home
that we could have bought them at our own doors
front those whose business it was to fetch them? Alli
though it had cost us something more, yet the differ
ence of that price was by no means worth saving a
so reatahazard.

ut as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads
so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought expe-
rience oftimn ; and so it was with me now ; and yet,
no deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was
continually {poring upon the means and possibility of
my escape rent this place; and that I may, with the
greater pleasure to the reader, bring on the remain-
tng part of my story, it may not be improper to give
name account of my first conceptions on the subject
of this foolish scheme for my escape; and how, and
upon what foundation, I acted.

I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up. and secured under water as usual. and my
condition restored to what it was before; I had more
wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not at ah
the richer; for 1 had no more use for it than the in-
dians of Peru had before the Spaniards came hither.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first setting
foot in this island of solitariness. I was lying in my
bed or hammock. awake, and very well in health, had
no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body. nu,

could by no means close my eyes, that is. so as to

sleep; no, not a wink alt night long, otherwise than

as follows:

It is as impossible as needless to set down the innu-
merable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that
great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this
night's time: I ran over the whole history :f my life
in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to
my coming to this island , and also of that part of my
life since lcame to this island; in my reflections upon
the state of my case, since I came on shore on this
island ; I was comparin the happy posture of my af-
fairs, in the first years 0% my habitation here, to that
course of anxiety, {ear and care, which I had lived in
ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand;
not that I did not believe the savages had frequented
the island even all the while, and might have been
several hundred of them at times on the shore there;
but as I had never known it, and was incapable 0!
any apprehensions about it, my satisfaction was per~
fcct. though my danger was the same ; and l was as 5
happy in not knowing my danger, as if I had never
really been exposed to it; this furnished my thoughts ~
with many very profitable reflections, and particularly
this one: How infinitely good that Providence is,
which has settled in its overnment of mankind such
narrow bounds to his sig it and knowledge of things '
and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand
dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him,
would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is ke'tt
serene and calm, by having the events of things lnd
from his eyes and knowing nothing of the danger:
which surround him. '

After these thoughts had for some time entertained
me. I came to reflect seriously upon the real danger
I had been in for so many years in this very island;
and how i had walked about in the greatest security,
and with all possible tt .tnquility, even perhaps when
nothing but a brow on a hill, a great tree or the ca i
Iual approach of night, had been between me and the g

worst kind of destruction, viz. that of falling into the
hands of cannibals and savages, who would have
seized on me with the same view as 1 did on a goat
or a turtle, and have thou ht. it no more" a crime to
kill and dev iur me, than 1 id of a pigeon or curlew.
I should unjustly slander myself, if! should say I
was not sincerely thankful to my great l'reserver, to
whose singular protection I acknowledged, with great
humility, that all these unknown deliverances were
due, and without which I should inevitably have ful-
leu into their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for
some time taken up in considering the nature of these
wretched creatures, I mean. the savages ; and how it
came to pass in the world, that the wise Governor of
all things should give up any of his creatures to such
inhumanity, nay, to something so much below even
brutality itself, as to devour its own kind ; but as this
ended in some (at. that time fruitless) s eculations, it
occurred to me to inquire what part oft ie world these
wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from
whence they came; what they ventured so far from
home for; what kind of boats they had; and why I
might not order myself, and in business so, that
l might be as able to go over thit ier, as they were to
come to me.

lnever so much as troubled myself to consider
what I should do with myself when I came thither '
what should become of me if I fell into the hands oi'
the savages; or how lshould escape from them, if
they attempted me; no. nor so much as how it was
possible {or me to reach the coast, and not be attacked
by some or other of them. without any ossibilit ' of
delivering myself ; and if I should not all into I eir
hands, what I should do for provision, or whither!
should hend my course: none of these thoughts, I say.

wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in

present condition as the most miserable that could
possibly he; that l was not able to throw myself into
any thing but death that could be called worse; that
ifl reached the shore ofthe main, 1 might, rhaps
meet with relief; or I might coast along, as did on
the shore of Africa, till I came to some inhabited
country, and where I might find some relief; and after
ll. perhaps, I might fall in with some Christian ship
that might take me in; and if the worst came to the
worst, I could but die, which would put an end to all
these miseries at once. l'ray, note all this was the
fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made,
as it were, desperate by the long continuance of my
troubles, and the disappointments Ihad met in the
wreck l had been on boarder, and where I had been
so near the obtainingof what I so earnestly longed for,
viz. somebody to s cal: to, and to learn some know-
ledge from of the p ace where l was, and of the pro-
bable means of my deliverance; I say,l was agitated
wholly by these thoughts. All my calm of mind in
my resignation to Providence, and waiting the issue
of the disposition of Heaven, seemed to besuspended '
and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to any thing but the project of a voyage to the main;
which came upon me with such force, and such an
impetuosity of desire that it was not to be resisted.
When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours
or more, with such violence that it set my very blood
into a ferment, and my pulse beat as high as if I had
been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fer-
vour of my mind about it; nature, as if I had been
fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a sound slee : one would have thought

any thing relating to it; but I dreamed, that as l was
going out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I
saw upon the shore two canoes and eleven savages
coming to land, and that they brought with them an-
other savage, whom they were going to kill, in order
to eat. him; when on a. sudden, the savage that they

were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his life.
then I thought in my sleep, that he came running into
my little thick grove, before my fortification, to hide
himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not pcrceiv

in: that the others sought him that way, shewetl my-
self to him, and, smiling upon him, encouraged him .-
that he kneeled down to me, seeming to pray me to
assist him; upon which i showed my ladder, made
him go up it, and carried him into my cave, and he
became my servant; and that as soon as I had got
this man, [said to myself, " Now [may certainly
venture to the mainland; for this fellow will serve me
as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and whither
to go for provisions, and whither not to go for fear of
being devoured; what places to venture into, and
what to escape. I waked with this thought, and was
under such inexpressible impressions of joy at the
prospect of my escape in my dream, that the disap--
pointments which I felt upon coming to myself, and
finding it was no more t an a dream, were equally
extravagant the other way, and threw me into a very
great dejection of spirit.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusxon, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was if poSsible, to at a savage in my possession ;
and if passible, it s ould he one of their prisoners
whom they had condemned to be eaten, and should
bring hither to kill: but these thoughts still were at-
tended with this difficulty, that it was impossuble to
effect this, without attackinga whole caravan ofthem.

need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me
against this, they being the same mentioned before :

highest degree, to deliver myself from this death tf a
life. and was acting in my own defence, as much as
if they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I
say, though these things argued for it, yet the thoughts
of shedding human blood for my deliverance were
very terrible to me, and such as I could by no means
reconcile myself to a great while.

However. at last, alter many secret disputes with
myself, and after great perplexities about it, (for all
these arguments, one way and another, struggled in
my head a long time,) the eager revailing desires of
deliverance at length mustered all the rest, and I're-
solved, if possible, to get one ofthesc sav a es into my
hands, cost what it would : the next thing t ten was to
contrive how to do it; and this indeed it as very diffi-
cult to resolve on: but as I could pitch upon no pro-
bable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon
the watch to see them when they camet-n shore, and
leave the rest to the event, taking such mmsures as the
opportunity should present, let it be what .i would. .

With these resolutions in my thoughts, (set myself
upon the scout as often as possible, and. it deed so
often. till I was heartily tired of it: for it van above
a year and a half that I waited, and for a. great part
of that time went out to the west end, arm to the
south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to
see the canoes, but none appeared. This was very
discouraging, and began to trouble me much; though
I can't say that it did in this case, as it had done some
time before that, viz. wear of the edge off my desire
to the thing; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,
the more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at
first more careful to shun the sight of these savages,
and avoid being seen by them, than I was now eager
to be upon them. -

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
two or three savages. if I had them, so as to make

them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever I should
direct them, and to prevent their being able, at any
time, to do me any hurt. It was a great while that!

pleased myself with this afl'air, but nothing still pre.

for no savages came near me for a reat Willie.

morning early, with seeing no less than five canoes all
on shore to ether, on my side the island, and the peo-
ple who belonged to them all landed, and out of my
sight: the number of them broke all my measures:
for seeing so many, and knowing that they always
came four, or six, or sometimes more, in a boat, I
could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
measures, to attack twenty or thirty men sin lediaud
ed ; soI lay stillin my castle. perplexed ant discern
forted ; however. I put myself into all the same pos
tures for an attack thatI had formerly provided, and
was just ready for action, if any thing had presented.
Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they
made any noise; at length being very impatient, I set
my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up
to the top of the bill by my two stages, as usual,
standing so, however, that my head did not appear
above the hill. so that they could not ercieve me by
any means. Here Iobserved, by the elp of my per-
spective glass, that they were no less than thirty in
number ; that they had a fire kindled, and that they
had had meat dressed ; how they cooked it, that I
knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing
in I know not how many barbarous gestures and
figures, their own way, round the fire.

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived by
my ersPectives two miserable wretches dragged from
the oats, where, it seems. they were laid by, and
were now brought out for the slaughter: l perceived
one of them immediately fall, being knocked down, I
suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that was
their way; and two or three others were at work im-

the other victim was left standing by himself, till they
should be ready for him. In that very moment this
poor wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, nature
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away
from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along
the sands, directly towards me, i mean towards that
part of the coast where my habitation was.

i was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge,
when I perceived him to run my way; and especialv
when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole
hody; and now I expected that part of my dream was
coming to pass, and that he would certainly take
shelter in my grove ; but I could not depend, by any
meanfi upon my dream for the rest ofit. viz. that the
other savages would not pursue him thither, and find
him there. However, kept my station, and my
spirits began to recover, when I found that there were
not above three men that followed him; and still
more was I encouraged, when I found that he out-
atript them exceedingly in running. and gained ground
of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an
hour,l saw easily he would fairly get away from
them all.

There was between them and my castle the creek,

when I landed my cargoes out of the ship; and this

ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness. When
the three pursuers came to the creek, I found that two
of them could swim, but the third could not, and that.

fellow was that fled from them. it came now very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly,
that now was my time to get a servant and pethapsa
companion or assitant, and that l was called plainly
by Providence to save this (poor creature's life. I im
tnediately got down the la ders with all possible ex-
pedmon, fetched my two guns. for they were both at
the foot of the ladder, as observed above : and get-
ting up again with the same haste to the top of the hill
[crossed towards the sea; and having a very short
cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way be-
tween the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud
to him that fled. who, looking back, was at first per
haps as much frighted at me as at them ; but! beckon-
ed with my hand to him to come back ; and in the
meantime I slowly advanced toward the two that fol-
lowed ; then rushing at once u on the foremost, I
knacked him down with the smell of my piece; I was
loath to fire, because I would not have the rest hear,
though at that distance it would not have been easily
heard ; and being out of sight of the smoke too, they
would not have easily known what to make of it.
Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pur-
sued him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and l
advanced apace towards him; but as I came nearer, I
oerceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was
fitting it to shoot at me; so i was then necessitated to
shoot at him first; which I did, and killed him at the
first shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopped,
though he saw both his enemies fallen, and killed, (as
he thought) yet was so frighted with the fire and noise
of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither came
forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather
nclined to fly still, then to come on. lhallooed again
to him. and made signs to come forward, which he
easily understood, and came a little way, then stopped
again, and then a little farther, and stopped again;

if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been to
be killed as his two enemies were. I beckoned him

in token of acknowledgement for saving his life.
smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned
to him to come still nearer. At length he came close
to me, and then he kneeled down again, kissed the
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking
me by the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, 1
seems, was in token of swearing to be my slave for
ever. I took him up. and made much of him, and
encouraged him all I could. But there was more
work to do yet ; for I perceived the savage, whom I
knocked down, was not killed, but stunned with the
blow, and began to come to himself; so I pointed to
him and shewed him the savage, that he was not
dead : upon this he spoke some words to me; and
though I could not understand them, yet I thought
they were pleasant to hear,for they were the first sound
of a man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted,
for above five--and-twenty years. But there was no
time for such reflections how ; the savage, who wat
knocked down, recoved himself so far as to sit up
upon the ground ; and I perceived that my savage be-
gan to be afraid; but whenl saw that, I presented
my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him:
upon this my savage, for so [called him now, made a
motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side: so I did : he no sooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow out
ofl" his head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany
could have tlone it sooner or better; which I thought
very strange for one,who, I had reason to believe,
never saw a sword in his life before, exce ttheir 0th
wooden swords: however, it seems, as l earnt after-
wards they make their wooden swords so sharp, so
heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they will cut of!

blow too. When he, had done this, he comes laughin

<<gun. and, with abundance of gestures, which I did
not tmrlerstand, laid it down, with the head of the
Iavages that he had killed,just before me.

But that which astonished him most was, to know
how I had killed the other Indian so far off: so point-
ing to him, he made signs to me to let him go to him
so I bade him go, as well asIcould. When he came
to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him;
turned him first on one side, then on t'other; looked
tat the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was
just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no
great quantity or blood had followed; hut he had bled
inwardly, for he was quite dead. Then he took up
his bow and arrows, and came back; so I tumed to
go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making
signs to him that more might come after them.

Upon this he signed to me, that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by the
rest. if they followed; and so I made signs again tr-
nim to do so. He fell to work, and in an instant ho
had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands. big,
enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into
it, and covered him, and did so also by the other ;' i
believe he had buried them both in a quarter of an
hour: then calling him away, [carried him not to m)
castle, but quite away to my cave, on the farthcv
part ofthe island; so I did not let my dream cometo
pass in that part; viz. that he came into my grove
for shelter.

Here 1 gave him bread and a bunch of raisinstr
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he war
indeed in great distress for, by his running; and hav
ing refreshed him, 1 made signs for him to go to lie
down and sleep: pointing to a place wherel had laid i
a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it,
which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes; so the
poor creature lay down and went to sleep.

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well
made. with straight long limbs, not too large, tall. .
and well shaped. and, as I reckon, about twenty-six

years of age. He had a very good countenance, not
a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have some
thing very manly in his face, and yet he had all the
sweetness and softness of an European in his coun-
tenance too, especially when he smiled: his hair was
long and black, not curled like wool; his forehead
very high and large, and a oreat vivacity and spark
ling sharpness in his eyes. ' he colourofhis skin was
not quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of an
ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians and
Virginians, and other natives of America are, but :' f a
bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had ir it
something very agreeable, though not very easy to de-
scribe. His face was round and plump, his nose
small, not flat like the Negroe's, a. very good mouth,
thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-set, and white as
ivory. After he had slumbered, rather than slept,
about half an hour, he waked again, and comes out of
the cave to me, for I had been milking my goats,
which I had in the enclosure just by ; when he cspied
me, he came running to me, laying himself down
again upon the ground, with all the possible signs 01
an humble thankful disposition, making many antic
gestures to shew it. At last he lays his head flat upon
the ground, close to my foot, and sets my other foot
upon his head, as he had done before ; and after this,
made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and
submission imaginable, to let me know how much he
would serve me as long as he lived. I understood
him in many things, and let him know I was very
well pleased with him. In a little time I began to
speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and first,
I made him know his name should be Friday, which
was the day I saved his life: and I called him so for
the memory of the time: [likewise taught him to say
Master, and then let him know that was to be my
name; I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and
to know the meaning ofthem. I gave him some milk
m an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before
him, and sop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake

of bread to do the like, which he quickly enntplied
With, and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as
it was day, l beckoned him to come with me, and let
him know I would give him some clothes; at which
he seemed very glad, for he was stark-naked. As we
went by the place where he had buried the two men,
he aimed exactly to the 5 0t, and showed me the
mar s that he had made to nd them again, making
signs to me that we should dig them up again, and eat
them: at this lappeared very angry, expressed my
abhorrence of it, mnde as if I would vomit at the
thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him to
come away, which he did immediately, with great
submission. I then let him up to the top of the hill,
to see if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my
glass, I looked, and saw plainly the place where they
had been, but no appearance of them, or of their
canoes; so that it was plain that they were gone. and

had left their two comrades behind them, without any
search after them.

But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more court: e, and consequently more
curiOsity, I took my man riday with me, giving him
the sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his
back, which I found he could use very dexterously,
making him carry one gun {or me, and l two for my-
self, and awe we marched to the place where these
creatures had in; for! had a mind how to get some
fuller intelligence of them. When I came to the
place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and my

eart sunk within me at the horror of the spectacle .
indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it was so to me,
though Friday made nothinv of it: the place was co-
vered with human bones, t e ground dyed with the
blond, great pieces of flesh left here and there, half-
eaten, mangled, and scorched; and, in short, all the
tokens of the triumphant feast they had been making
there, after a victory over their enemies. I saw three
skulls, five hands, and the bones ot'three or four legs

and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies
and Friday, by his signs made me understand that
they brought over {our prisoners to feast upon; that
three ofthetn were eaten up, and that he, pointing to
nimself, was the fourth; that there had been a great
battle between them and their next king, whose sub-
jects, it seems, he had been one of; and that they had
taken a great number of prisoners, all which were car-
ried to several places by those that had taken them in
the flight, in order to feast upon them, as was done
here by these wretches u on those they brought hither.
I caused Friday to gatlier all the skulls, bones, flush,

and whatever remained, and lay the'm to ether on an
heap, and make a great fire upon it, an burn them
to ashes. I found Friday had still an hankering
stomach after some of the flesh, and was still a canni-
bal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhor~
rence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least ap~
Kearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for-I

ad, by some means, let him know that 1 would kill
him if he offered it. n '

When we had done this, we came back to cut

castle, and there I fell to work for my man Friday;
and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which I had out of the poor gunner's chest I men-
tioned, and which I found in the wreck; and which,
with a little alteration, fitted him very well; then I
made him a jerkm of goat's skin as well as my skill
would allow, and I was now grown a tolerable good
tailor; and I gave him a cap, which I had made ofa
mare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough .
and thus he was dressed. for the present, tolerably
well, and mighty well was he pleased to see himself
almost as well clothed as his master. It is true, he
went awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him, and the sleeves
of the waistcoat galled his shoulders and the inside
of his arms; but a little easing them, where he com>>

lained they hurt him, and usm himself to them, at

The next day afterl came home to m hutch With
him, l began to consider where l shonl lodge him ;
and that i might do well for him, and yet be perfeclty
easy ntyselfl made a little tent for him in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in the inside of
the last. and in the outside of the first: and as there
was a'door or entrance there into my cave, I made a
formal framed door-case, and a door to it of boards,
and set it up in the passage, 2 little within the en-
trance : and causing the door to open to the inside, i
barred it up in the night,tuking in my ladders too; so
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of
the innermost well without making so much noise in
getting over, that it must needs awaken me ; for my

rst wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, covering all my tent; and leaning up to the side
of the hill, which was again laid cross with small
sticks instead of laths, and then thatched o'vera great
thickness with the rice straw, which was streng like
reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go
in or out by the ladder, i had placed a kind of trap-
door, which if it had been attempted on the outside.
would not have opened at all, but would have fallen
down, and made a great noise; and as to weapons, l
took them all in to my side every night.

But I needed none of all this precaution: for never
man had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than
Friday was to me; without passions, sullennes, or
designs: perfectly obliging and engaging ;' his very
affections were tied to me, like those of it child to a
father ; and l dare say, he would have sacrificed his
life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatso-
ever the many testimonies he gave me of this put it
out m doubt; and soon convinced me, that l needed
to use no precautions as to my safety on his account.

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that, however it had pleased God
in his providence, and in the government of the
works of his hands, to take from so great a part 01
the wood of his creatures the lzest uses to which theiIt

faculties, and the powers of their souls, are adapted ,
yet that he has bestowed upon them the same power!
the same reason, the some affections, the same senti-
ments of kindness and obligation, the same passions
and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of roti-
tude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of oing
good, and receiving good, that he has given to us;
and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of
exerting these, they are as ready, nay more ready, to
apply them to the right uses for which they were be-
stowed, than we are. And this made me very melan-
choly sometimes, in reflecting. as the several occasions
presented, how mean an use we make of all these,
even though we have these powers enlightened by the
great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by
the knowledge of his word, added to our understand-
ing; and why it has pleased God to hide the like saw
ing knowledge from so many millions of souls, who,
if i might judge by this poor savage, would make a
much better use of it than we did.

From hence I sometimes was led too far to invadr
the sovereignty of Providence ; and, as it were, an
raign the justice of so arbitrary a. disposition of things,
that should hide that light from some, and reveal it to
others, and yet expect a like duty from both : hutl
shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conch>>
lion: first, that we do not know by what light and law
these should be condemned; but that as God was ne-
cessarily, and by the nature of his being infinitely
holy and just, so it could not be, but that if these crea-
tures were all sentenced to absence from himself, it
was on account of sinning gainst that light, which,
as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves. and by
such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to
be just, though the foundation was not discovered to
us; and. secondly, that still. as we are all clay in the
hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, "Why
east thou formed me thus P"

him every thing that was proper to make him useful,
handy, and hel ful; but es ecially to makchim speak
and understan me when spake ; and he was the
uptest scholar that ever was: and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he
could but understand me, or make me understand
him, that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him.
And not" my life began to be so easy, that I began to
say to myself, that could I but have been" safe from
more savages, I cared not if 1 was never to remove
from the place where I lived.

AfterI had been two or three days returned to my
castle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday 03'
from this horrid way of feeding, and from the relish
of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him taste other
flesh ; so I took him out with me one morning to the
woods : I went, indeed intending to kill a ki out of
my own flock, and bring it home and dress it: but as
I was going, I saw a she goat lying down in the shade,
and two young kids sitting by her. Icatched hold of
Friday; "Hold," said I, " stand still ;" and made
signs to him not to stir. Immediately I resented my
piece, shot and killed one of the kids. 'Ifite poorcrea-
ture, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill the
savage his enemv, but did not know, or could imagine
how it was done, was sensibly sur rised, trembled
and shook, and looked so amazed, hat I thought he
would have sunk down : he did not see the kid I had
shot at, or pe-ceive I had killed it, but ripped up his
waiscoat to feel if he was not wounded; and, as I
found, presently thought I was resolved to kill him ;
for he came and kneeled down to me. and, embrac-
ing my knees, said a. great many things I did not un-
derstand ; but I could easily see that his meaning was
to pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him, that I would
do him no harm ; and taking him up by by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he
did , and while he was wondering and looking to son

and by and by Isaw a great fowl, like a hawk. si

upon a tree within shot; so, to let Friday understand'
a. little what I would do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been a hawk ; I say. pointing
to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the art-0t, to let him seeI would make him fall, 1
mat e him understand that I would shoot and kill that
bird ; accordingly I fired, and bid him look, and im

mediately he saw the parrot fall ; he stood like one

frighted again, notwithstanding all that I had said In -

him ; and i found he was the more amazed, because
he did not see me put any thing into the gun; but
thought there must be some wonderful fund of death
and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, beast,
bird, or any thing neztr or far off; for the astonish-
ment this created in him was such, as could not wear
off for a, long time ; and l believe, if I would have
let him, he would have worshipped tne and my gun ,
as for the gun itself, he would not so much as touch i
for several days. after; but would speak to it, anti talk

' to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by him-

self; which, as l afterwards leant of him, was to do
sire it not to kill him. '

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 217

gave some to my man, who seemed very glad of it,
and liked it very well; but that which was strangest
to him, was, to see me eat salt with it. He made a
sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and put-
ting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate
it, and would spit and s utter at it, washing his mouth
with fresh water after it. On the other hand, I took
some meat In my mouth without salt, and [pretended
to spit and sputter {or want of salt, as fast as he had
done at the salt; but it would not do, he would never
care for salt with meat, or 'in his broth ; at least, not
a greatwhile. and then but a very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, l
was reserved to feast him the next day with roasting a
piece of the kid: this i did by hanging it before'the
fire in a string, as I had seen many people do in Eng-
land, setting two poles up, one on each side the fire,
and one cross on the top, and tying the string to the
cross stick, letting the meat tum continually; this Fri-
day admired very much; but when he came to taste
the flesh, he took-so many ways to tell me how well
he liked it, that 1 could not but understand him ; and
at last he told me he would never eat man's flesh any
more, which I was very glad to her.

The next day l set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the mannerl used to do, as
l observed before; and he understood how to do
it as well as l, especially after he had seen what the
meaning of it was, and that it wasto make bread of;
for after that i let him see me make my bread. and
bake it toe; and in a. little time Friday was able to do
all the work for me, as'well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that, having two months
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn,
than l used to do: so I marked out a larger piece or
land, and began the fence in the same manner as be-
fore, in which Friday not only worked very willingly
and very hard, but did it very cheerfdty; and i told

'.\'\ \RAW \\~ <<and M \a mysxwxx w \WKN'VKM
him what it was for, that it was for com to make
more bread, because he was now with me, and that I
might have enough for him and thyself too: he ap-
peared very sensible of that part, and let me know,
that he thought I had much more labour upon me on
his account, than I had for myself, and that he would
work the harder [or me, if I would tell him what to
do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in
this place. Friday l egan to talk pretty well, and un-
derstand the names of almost every thingl had oc-
casion to call for, and of every place I had to semi him
to, and talk a great deal to me; so that, in short, I
began now to have some use for my tongue again,
which indeed I had very litt'e occasion forbefore;
that is to say, about speech. Besides the pleasure oi
talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fel-
low himself; his simple unfeigned honesty appeared
to me more and more every day, and I began really
to love the creature; and on his side, I believe, he
loved me more than it was possible for him ever to
love any thing before.

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learnt him English so well, that he could answer me
almost any questions, I asked him, whether the nation
that he belonged to never conquered in battle? At
which he smiled, and said, " Yes, yes, we always
fight the better; that is, he meant, always get the
better in ii ht; and so we began the following dis-
course. " ou always fight the better !" said I
" how came you to be taken prisoner then. Friday ?"

Friday. My nation beat much for all that.

.Master. How beat? if your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken ? .

Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me:
my nation over beat them in the yonder place, where
me no was; there my nation take one two great thou-

and
JlIasler. But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe that
time.

Master. Well. Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them as these did?

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans, too, eat all up

Master. Where do they carry them ?

Friday. Go to other place where they think.

Master. Do they come hither?

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else lace.

Jl' aster. Have ou been here with them?

Friday. Yes, been here: [points to the N. W.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their side})

By this i understood, that my man Friday ad
formerly been among the savages, who used to come
on shore on the farther part of the island, on the said
man eating occasions that he was now brought for;
and some time after, when I took the courage to carry
him to that side, being the samel formerly mention-
ed, he presently knew the place, and told me, he was
there once when they ate up twenty men, two women,
and one child: he could not tell twenty in English.
but he numbered them by layin so many stones in a
row, and pointing to me to tell t em over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what
follows; that after I had had this discourse with him,
I asked him, how far it was from our island to the
shore, and whether the canoes were not often lost?
He told me there was no danger, no canoes ever lost;
but that after a little way out to sea, there was a cur-
rent, and a wind always one way in the morning, the
other in the afternoon.

This I understand to he no more than the sets oftha
tide, as going out, or coming in; lmtl afterwards un
:lerstmd it was occasioned by the great draught and
reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque; in the mouth.xmwwwmv \VszMVWW\~\\&MW~W~WWW V v

220 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

ofwhich river, as l thought afterwards, our island lay,
and that this land, which I erceived to the W. and
N. W. was the great islan Trinidad, on the north
point of the month of the river. i asked Fridaya
thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants,
the sea, the coast, and what nations were near: he
told me all he knew with the greatest openness ima-
ginable. I asked him the names of the several nations
of his sort of people, but could get no other name
than Caribs; from whence I easily (understood, that
these were the Caribees, which our maps place on the
part ofAmerica which reaches from the mouth ofthe
river Oroonoque to Guinea, and onwards to 8'
Martha. _ He told me, that up agreat way beyond the
moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon,
which must be W. from their country, there dwelt
white-bearded men, like me. and pointed to my great
whiskers, which I mentioned before; and that they
had killed much mans. that was his word ~. by which
I understood he meant the Spaniard, whose cruelties
in America had been spread over the whole coun.
tries, and were remembered by all the nations from
father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come

told me, Yes, yes, might in two canoe; i could
not understand what he meant by two canoe ; til] at
last, with great difficulty, I found he meant, that it
must be in a large great heat as big as two canoes.

This part of Friday's discourse began to relish with
with me very well; and from this time I entertained
some hopes, that one time or other I might find ar-
opportunity to make my escape from this place, and
dhat this poor savage might be a means to help me to

o it.

During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and under--
stand me, i was not wanting to lay a foundation m
)eligious knowledge in his mind ; particularly I asked
him one time, Who made him? T he poor creature

did not understand me at all but thought I had asked
who was his father; but I took it by another handle,
and asked him, Who made the sea, the ground he
walked on, and the hills and woods? He told me it
was one old Bettamuckee that lived beyond all ; he
could describe nothing of this great person, but that
he was very old; much older, he said, than the sea
or the land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him
then, if this old person had made all things, why did
not all things worship him? He looked very grave,
and with a perfect look of innocence said, All things
said O! to him. I asked him, if the People who the
in his country, went away any where. He said, Yes,
they all went to Benamuckee. 'Then I asked him,
whether those they ate up, went thither too? he said,
Yes. -

From these things I began .to instruct him in the
knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up to-
wards heaven ; that he governs the world by the same
power and providence by which he made it; that no
was omnipotent, could do every thing for us; give
every thing to us, take every thing from us; and thus,
by degrees, I opened his eyes. Helistened with great
attention, and received with pleasure the notion of
Jesus Christ being sentto redeem us. and ofthe man-
ner~ of making our prayers to God, and his being able
to hear us, even into eaven : he told me one day,
that'if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, he
must needs be a greater God than their Bcnamuekee,
who lived but a little way off, and yet could not hear,
till they went up to the great mountains, where he
dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him, if ever he went
thither to speak to him? He said, No, they never
went that were young men; none went thither but
the old men ; whom he called their Oowookakee, that
is, as i made him explain it to me, their religious, or
clergy ; and that they went to say 0 ! (so he called
saying prayers.) and then came back, and told them
what lienamucl: ec said. By this! observed, that there

is pricstcraft even among the most blinded ignorant
Pagans in the world ; and the policy of making a se-
cret reli ion, in order to preserve the veneration of
the peap e to the clergy, is not only to be found in the
Roman, but perhaps among all religions in the world,
even among the most brutish and barbarous savages.

[endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my may
Friday; and told him, that the pretence of their old
men gain up to the mountains to say 0! to their god
Bcnamuc ee, was a cheat ; and their bringing word
from thence what he said. was much more so ,- that
if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one
there, it must be an evil spirit: and then i entered
into along discourse with him about the devil, the
original of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity
to man, the reason ofit, his setting himself up in the
dark parts of the world to be worshipped instead of
God, and as God, and the many stratagems he made
use of, to delude mankind to their ruin : how he had
a secret access to our passions and to our affections,
to adapt his snares to our inclinations, as to cause
us even to be our own tempters, and to run upon our
own destruction by our own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notion:
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being
of a God : nature assisted all my arguments to evi-
dence to him even the necessity of a great FirstCause,
and over-ruling governing Power. a. secret directing
Providence, and of the equity and fustice of pa ing
homage to Him that made us, and 1 to like: butt tern
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil
spirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and, above
all of his inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to
do so too: and the poor creature puzzled me once in
such a. manner, by a question merely natural and in
nocent, that l scarce knew what to say to him. I
had been talking to him a great deal of the power 0
God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to sin,
his being aconsuming fire to the workers at iniquity;
how, as he had made us all, he could destroy us, and

all the world, in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while.

After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was God's enemy in the hearts of men, and used all
his malice and skill to defeat the good designs of Pro-

vidence, and to ruin the kingdom of Christ in the

world, and the like : " Well," says Friday, " but you
say God is so strong, so great, is he not much stron
much might, as the devil "'--" Yes, yes," said ,
Friday, " God is stronger than the devil, God is above
the devil, and therefore we pray to God to tread him
antler our feet, and enable us to resist his temptations,
and quench his fiery darts."----" But" says he again,
" if God much strong, much might, as the devil, why
God not kill the devil, so make him nomore wicked E"
l was strangely surprised at hisquestion; and after
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a
young doctor and ill enough qualified for acasuist. or
a solver of difi'ieuities: and at first I could not tell
what to say; so I pretended not to hear him, and
asked him what he said? but he was too earnest {or
an answer to forget his question ; so that he rel-peeled
II. in the very same broken words, as above. y this
time I had recovered myself a little, and I said, " God
will at last punish him severely; he is reserved for
the jud ment, and is to be cast into the bottomless pit,
to dwel with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy
Friday ; but he returns upon me, repeating my words,
"Reserve at last ! me no understand : but why not
kill the devil now, not kill great ago ?"---" You may
as well ask me," said I, " why God does not kill you
and me, when we do wicked things here that offend
him: we are preserved to repent and be pardoned."
He muses awhile at this; " Well, well," says he,
mighty affectionately, " that well; so you I, devil, all
wicked, all preserve, repent, God pardon all." Here

due to the supreme being offlod as the consequence
of our nature; yet nothing but divine revelation can
form the knowledge of J esnsChrist, and of a redemp-
tion purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new cove<<
uant; and of an lntercessor at the footstool of God's
throne; I say, nothing but a revelation from Heaven
can form these in the soul; and that therefore the
Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Imean
the word of God, and the Spirit of God, promised
for the guide and sauctifier of his people, and the ab
solutely necessary instructors of the souls of men in
the_saving knowledge of God, and the means of so]

l therefore diverted the present discourse between
me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon some sud-
den occasion of goin out; then sending him for some-
thing a great way 0 , I seriously prayed to God that
he would enable me to instruct savingly this pool
aavnge, assisting, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor
ignorant creature to receive the light of the know ede
of God in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and
would guide me to speak so to him from the word of
God, as his conscience might be convinced, his eyes
Opened, and his soulsaved. When he came again to
mo, I entered into a long discourse with him upon
the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour
of the world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel
preached from Heaven, viz. of the re entance towards
God, and (aith of our blessed Lord esus: I then ex-
plained to him, as well as I could, why our blessed

edeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but
the seed of Abraham, and how, for that reason, the
fallen angels had no share in the redemption; that he
came only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,
and the like. '

I had. God knows, more sincerity than knowledge,

had more affection in my enquiry after things upon

I this poor wild wretcb was the better for me or no,

flected, that in this solitary life, which l had been '

things, a secret joy ran through every part of my
soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought
~ to this place, which I had often thought the most
d rendful of all afflictions that could possibly have be- 3

In thisthankful frame lcontinued all the remainder
of my time; and the conversation which employed
the hours between Friday and me was such as made,
the three years which we lived here together perfectly
and completely happy, if any such thing as complete
happiness can be found in a sublunary state. The
savage was now a good Christian, a. much better than
J; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for g
it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted re-
stored penitents: we had here the Word of God to i
read, and no farther off'from his spirit to instruct than
if we had been in England. '

and questions, made me, as I said before, a much beb
ter scholar in the Scripture knowledge. than I should
ever have been by my own private reading. Another
thing l cannot refrain from observing here, also from
experience, in this retired part of my life; viz. how
infinite and inex ressible a blessing it is, that the
knowledge of Got , an 'l of the doctrine of salvation by
Christ Jesus, is so plainly laid down in the Word 0!
God, so easily to be received and understood, that as
the bare reading the Scripture made me capable ol
understanding enough of my duty to carry me directly
on to the great work of sincere repentance for my
sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and salva-
tion, to a stated reformation in practice, and obedience
'0 all God's commands, and this without any teacher
or instructor (I mean. human :) so the plain instrue

the place, how I had lived there, and how lung: 1 let
him into the mystery (for such it was to him) ot gun-
powder and bullets, and taught him how to shoot ; I
gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted
with : and I made him a belt with a frog han ing to
it. such as in England we wear hangers in ; an in the
frog, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon many occasions.

I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from ; how we

ived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in ships to all the
parts of the world. I gave him an account ofthe
wreck which I had been on board of, and showed him
as near as I could, the place where she lay ; but she
was all beaten in pieces, long before, and quite gone.

I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost
when we escaped, and which I could not stir with
my whole strength then, but was now fallen almost all
to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood mus-
tngagreat while, and said nothing: I asked him what
it was he studied upon? At last, says he, " Me see
such boat like come to place at my nation."

I did not understand him a good while; hut at last,
when I had examined further into it, I' understood
by him, that a boat, such as that had been, came on
shore upon the country where he lived ; that is, as he
explained it, was driven thither b stress of weather.
1 presently imagined, that some uropean ship must
have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat
might get loose, and drive ashore ; but was so dull,
that I never once thought of men making escape from
a wreck thither, much less whence they might come;
so 1 only enquired after a description ofthe boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but
brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with some warmth, " We save the white mans from
drown." Then I presently asked him, if there were
any white mans, as he called them in the boat ? "Yes,"

he said, " the boat full of white mans." I asked hi
how many? he told upon his fingers seventeen.
asked him then, what became of. them? he told mo.
" They live, they dwell at my nation."

This put new thoughts into my head again ; for l
presently imagined, that these might be the men he-
longing to the ship that was cast away in sight of my
island, as i now call it; and who, after'the ship was
struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost

-had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed
upon that wild shore among the savages.

Upon this I enquired of him more critically, what
was become of them i He assured me they lived still
there, that they had been there about four years, that
the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to
live. I asked him, how it came to pass they did not
kill them, and eat them? He said, " No, they make
brother with them :" that is, as l understood him, a
truce : and then he added, " They eat no mans but
when make the war fight ;" that is to say, they never ,
eat any men, but such as come to fight with them, and
are. taken in battle. -

It was after this, some considerable time, thntbeing
on the top of the hill, at the east side of the island,
from whence, as l have said, 1 had in a clear day diu-
covered the main or continent of America. ; Friday,
the weather being very serene, looks very earnestly

tenance discovered a strange eagerness, as if he had a
mind to be in his own chuntry again ; and this ob
servation of mine put a great many thoughts into me ,

his obligations to me; and would be forward enough

added, they learnt much of the bearded mans that
came in the boat. Then I asked him, if he would go I
back to them? He smiled at that, and told me he
could not swim so far. I told him I would make a 5
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would
go with him. "I go I" said I, "why, they will eat
me if 1 come there."----" No, no," says he, " me make
them no eat you, me make they much love ou :" he
meant he would tell them how l had killet his ene-
mies and saved his life, and so he would make them
love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how
kind they were to seventeen white men, or bearded
men, as he called them, who came on shore in dis~
tress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture
over, and see if I could possibly join with these beard-
ed men, who, [made no doubt, were S aniards or
Portuguese; not doubting but, if I coul , we migh
find same method to esca e from thence, being upon
the continent, and a goo company together, bette
than I could from an island forty miles oil" the shore,
and alone without help. So, alter some days, I took
Friday to work again, by way of discourse; and told
him, would give him a boat to go back to his own
nation ; and accordingly l carried him to my fri ate,
which lay on the other side of the island ; and raw-
ing cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in
the water), I brought it out, shewed it him, and we
both went into it.

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at manag-
Ing it, would make itgo almost as swiftand fast again
as I could; so when he was in,l said to him, " Well,
now, Friday, shall we go to yournation ?" He looked
very dull at my saying so, which, it seems, was be-
cause he thought the boat too small to go so far. I
told him then I had a bigger; so the next day I went
to the place where the first boat lay which I had made,
but which I could not get into the water; he said
that wasbig enough : but then. as I had taken no care

there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was In a

"manner rotten. Friday told me, such a boat would

do very well, and would carry " much enough vntle,
drink, bread ;" that was his way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon
my design of going over with him to the continent,
that I told him we would go and make one as big as
that, and he should go homein it. He answered not
one word, but looked very grave and sad. I asked
him, what was the matter with him? He asked me
again thus, "Whydyou angry mad with Friday? what
me done ?" I aske him, what he meant I told him
I was not angry with him at all: "No angry! no
angry I" says he, repeating the words several times,

" why send Frida home away to my nation ?"--'

" why," said I, " riday, did you not say you wish-
ed you were there ?"--" Yes, yes," says he, " wish be
both there; no wish Frida there, no master there."
In a word, he would not think of going there with-
out me. " I go there, Friday !" said I ; "what should
I do there ?" He turned very quick upon me at this;
"You do great deal much good," says he; "you
teach wild mans be good. sober. tame mans; you tell
them know God, pray God, and live new life."--
" Alas, Friday," said I, "thou knowest not wh'at
thou sayest; 1 am but an ignorant man myself."--
"Yes, yes," says he, " you teechee me good, you
teechee them good."--" No, no, Friday," said I,
" you shall go without me; leave me here to live by
myself, as Idid before." He looked confused again
at that word, and running to one of the hatchets which
he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, and gives it
me. H What must [do with this?" said I to him

" You take kill Friday." says he. "What must I,

kill ou for ?" said I again. He returns very quick,
" W at you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday,
no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly,

that I saw tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so

plainly discnvrrorl the utmost affection in him tome,

often after, that I would never send him away from
me if he was willing to stay with me.

Upon the whole, as 1 found by all his discourse a
settled affection to me, and that nothing should part
him from me, so] found all the foundatiOn of his de
sire to go to his own country was laid in his ardent
affection to the )eople, and his hopes of my doing
them good; a thing, which I had no notion of my
self. so I had not the least thought, or intention, or
desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong
inclination to my attempting an escape, as above.
founded on the supposition gathered from the former
discourse; viz. that there were seventeen bearded
men there; and therefore, without any delay, I went
to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper
to fell, and make a large periagua or canoe, to under-
take the voyage : there were trees enough in the
island to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas and
canoes only, but even of good large vessels: but the
main thing I looked at, was to get one so near the
water, that we might launch it when it was made, to
avoid the mistake committed at first.

At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he
knew much better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to
call the tree we cut down, except that is was very
like the tree we call fustick, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or ca-
vity of this tree out, to inake it into a boat: butI
showed him how rather to cut it with tools, which
after I shewed him how to use, he did very handily;
and in about a month's hard labour we finished it1
and made it very hadsome, especially, when. with
our axes, which I shewed him how to handle, we
cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a
boat; after this, however, it cost us neara formight's
time to et her along, as it were inch by inch, upon
great ro let's, into the water: but when she was in,
tube would have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, and though she was
so big, it amazed the to see with what dexterity and
how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn
her, and addle her along; so I asked him if he
would, an it we might venture over in her? " Yes."
he said, " he venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind." However, I had a farther design
that he knew nothing of, and that was, to make a
mast and sail, and to fit her with an anchor and cable.
As to a mast, that was easy enough to get; 301 pitch-
ed upon a straight young cedar tree, which I found
near the place, and which there was a great plenty of
in the island ; and I set Friday to work to cut it
down, and gave him directions how to shape and
order it: but as to the sail. that was my particular
care ; I knew i had old sails. or rather pieces of old
sails enough; but as I had them now twenty-six
years by me, and had not been very careful to pre-
serve them, not imagining that i should ever have this
kind of use for them, I did not doubt but they were
all rotten: and indeed most of them were so; how-
ever I found two pieces which appeared pretty good,
and with these i went to work, and with a great deal
of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may he
sure) for want of needles, l at length made a three-
cornered ugly thing. like what we call in England a
shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom,
and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually our
ships' long-boats sail with, and such as 1 best knew
how to manage; because it was such a one as I used
in the boat in which i made my escape from Barba-
ry, as related in the first part of my story.

I was near two months performing this last work.
viz. rigging and fitting my mast and saiis; forl finish-
ed them very complete, making a small stay. and a
sail or foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn to
windward ; and. which was more than all, I fixed a
rudder to the stern of her, to steer with; and though
I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as i knew the
usefulness. and even necessity of such a thing, i ap-

plied myself with so much pains to do it, that at inst
brought it to pass, though,- considering the many
dull contrivances [ had for it that failed, 1 think it
cost me almost as much labour as making the boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
tench as to what belonged to the navigation ofyiy
boat; for thouah he knew very well how to paodlu
.he canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail
and a rudder, and was the more amazed when he saw
me work the boat to and again in the sea by the
rudder, and how the sail gihed, and filled this way or
that way, as the course we sailed changed: Isay,
when he saw this, he stood like one astonished and
amazed : however, with a little use, I made all these
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sain
10:, except that as to the compass I could make him
understand very little of that: on the other hand, as
there was very little cloudy weather, and seldom or
never any fogs in those parts, there was the less oco
casion for a compass, seeing the stars were always
to be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in
the rainy seasons; and then nobody cared to stir
abroad, either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentioth year
of my captivity in this place; though the three last
years that I had this creature with me, ought rather
to be left out of the account, my habitation being quite
of another kind than in all the rest of my time. I
kept the anniversary of my landing here with the
same thankfulness to God for his mercies as at first;
and if I had such cause of acknowledgement at first, I
had 'much more so now, having such additional tes-
timonies of the care of Providence over me, and the
great ho s I had of being effectually and speedily
delivere ; for I had an invincible impression upon
my thoughts, that my deliverance was at hand, and
that I should not be another year in this place. How-
ever, I want on with my husbandry, digging, plant,
ing, and fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing, as before.

0F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 235

The rainy season was in the mean time upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
to had i stowed our new vessel as secure as we could,
bringing her u? into the creek, where, as 1 said in
the beginning, landed my rafts from the ship; and
haling her up to the shore, at high-water mark, I made
my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough for
her to float in; and then, when the tide was out,
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep
the water out; and so she lay dry, as to the tide,
from the sea; and to keep the rain off, we laid a great
many boughs of trees so thick, that she was as well
thatched as a house; and thus we waited for the
months of November and December, in which I de-
signed to make my adventure. '

When the settled season began to come in, as the
thought of my desivn returned with the fair weather;

'.l was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first

thing i did was to lay up a certain quantit of provi-
sion, being the store for the voyage: an intended,
in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock; and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon
oometlting of this kind, when I called to Friday, and
bid him go to the sea-shore, 'and see if he could find
it turtle or tortoise, a thing which we generally got
once a week, for the sake of the eggs, as well as the
flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps
he set his feet on; and before I had time to speak to
him, he cried out to me, "0 master} Omaster! O
sorrow! 0 bad!"---" What's the matter, Friday .3"
said I. " O yonder there." says he, " one, two,
three canoe! one, two three!" By this way of speak-
ing l concluded ther were six; but on inquiry I
found there were but three. " Well, Friday," said I,
" do not be frighterl ;." so I heartened him u as well
as i could. However, I saw the poor fel ow most
terribly scared: for nothing ran in his head, but thAI

to pieces, and eat him ; the poor fellow tremHed so
that l scarce knew what to do with him ; l comforted
him as well as I could, and told him l was in as
much danger as he, and that they would eat me as
well as him. " But," said I, " Friday, we must re-
solve to fight them: can you fight, Friday ?"--" Me
shoot," says he, " but them come many great num-
ber."----" No matter for that," said 1 again ; " our
uns will fright them that we do not kill." Sol asked
im, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would
defend me, and stand by me, and do Just lbadc
him? He said, " Me die, when you bid die, master,"
so I went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave
him; for I had been so good a husband of my rum,
that I had a great deal left. When he had drank it,
1 made him take the two fowling-pieces which we
always carried, and load them with large swan-shot
as big as small pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets,
and loaded them with two slugs and five small bul-
lets each; and my two pistols l loaded with a brace
of bullets each: Ihung my great sword, as usual,
naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my per-
spective-glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to
see what I could discover; and I found quickly, by
my glass, that there n ere one-and-twenty savages,
three prisoners. and three canoes; and thattheirwhole,
business seemed to be the triumphant banquet upon
these three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed,
but nothing more than as I had observed was usual
with them.

1 observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
warm to my creek, where the share was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to the
sea: this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand
these wretches came about, so filled me with indigna
lion, that i came down again to Friday, and told him,
I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them
all; and asked him if he would stand by me. He

was now gotten over his fright, and his spirits being a

ittlc raised with the dram I had given him, he was
very cheerful ; and told me, as before he would die
when I did die.

In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the arms
which I had charged, as before between us: I gave
Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and three guns
.upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol, and the
other three, myself; and in this posture we marched
out. I took a. small bottle of rum in my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bul-
let; and as to orders, I chargcd him to keep close be-
hind me, and not to stir, shoot, or do any thing till I
bid him; and in the mean time, not to speak award.
In this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand
of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get
into the wood ; so that I might come within shot at
them before I could be discovered, which I had seen
by my glass it was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts
returning, I began,to abate my resolution ; I do not
mean. that I entertained any fear of their number; for
as they were naked, unarmed wretches, it is certain I
was superior to them; nay, though I had been alone:
but it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what occa-
sion, much less what necessity, I was in to go and dip
my hands in blood, to attack people who had neither
done or intended me any wrong, who, as to me, were
innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their
own disaster; being in them a token indeed of God's
having left them, with the other nations of that part
of the world to such stupidity and to such inhuman
courses; but did not call me to take upon me to be a
judge of their actions, much less an executioner of his
justice ; that whenever he thought fit, he would talus
the cause into his own hands, and by national ven.
geance punish them for national crimes ; but that in
the mean time, it was none of my business; that it was
true, Friday might justify it, because he was a de-
clared enemy, and in a state of war with those very

particular people, and it was lawful for him to attack .

them, but could not say the same with respect to
me. These things were so warmly ressed u on my
thoughts all the way asl went, that resolved would
only go place myself near them, that I might observe
their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as
God should direct ; but that unless something oflered
that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I
would not meddle with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible wariness and silence (Friday following
close at my heels) I marched till I came to the skirt
of the wood, on the side which was next tothem;
only that one corner of the wood la between me and
them : here I called softly to Fri ay, and shewing
him a reat tree, which was just at the corner of the
wood, bade him go to the tree, and bring me word
if he could see there plainly what they were doing 2
he did so, and came immediately back to me, and told
me they might plainly be viewed there; that they
were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the sand,

alittle from them, whom he said they would kill'

next, and which fired the very soul within me. He

' told me, it was not one of their nation, but one of the

bearded men whom he had told me of, who came to
their country in the- boat. I was filled with horror
at the very naming the .white bearded man, and, going
to the tree, Isaw plainly, by my glass, a white man,
who lay upon the beach of the sea, with his hand-
and his feet tied with flags, or things like rushes; and
that he was an European, and had clothes on.

There was anothertree, and a little thicket beyond
it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the plac
where I was, which, by going a little way about, I
saw [might come at undiscovered, and that then I
should be within half-shot of them; sol withheld my
passion, though] was indeed enraged to the highest
degree; and going back about twenty paces, lgot he-

Vto the other tree, and then I came to a little rising

round, which gave me a full View of them, at the
(giistance of about eighty yards.

I had now not a moment to lose ; for nineteen o!
the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all close
huddled together, and had just sent the other two to
butcher the poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps
limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped

down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri- ,

day; " Now, Friday," said I, "do as I bid thee."

Friday said, he would. " Then, Friday," said I, " do .

exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing." 501
set down one of the muskets and the fowling-piece
upon the ground, and Friday did thelike by his ; and
with the other musket I took my aim at the savages,
bidding him do the like. Then asking him if he was
ready, he said, " Yes."----" Then fire at them," said
I ; and the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and on my side, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were. you may be sure, in
a. dreadful consternation ; and all of them, who were
not hurt, jumped u upon their feetimmediately, but
did not know whic way to run, or which way to
look; for they knew not from whence their destruca
tion came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that,
as I had bid him, hemight observe what I did ; so
as soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the
piece, and took up the fowling-piece. and Friday did
the like; he sees me cock, and present; he did the
same again. " Are you ready, Friday ?" said I.
" Yes," says he. " Let fly then," said I, " in the

- name of God; and with that l fired again among

the amazed wretches. and so did Friday; and as out
pieces were now loaden with what I call swan shot,

or small pistol-bullets, we found only two drop : but '

miserably wounded most of them ; whereof threemoro
fell uickl after though not quite dead.

" t ow, riday," said I, laying down the discharg-
ed pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, " follow me," said I :, which he did, with a
dealof courage; upon which I rushed onto!" the wood,
and shewed myself, and Friday close at my foot ; as
soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud
as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running
as fast asl could, which by the way was not very
fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly
towards the poor victim, who was, as Isaid, lying
upon the beach, or shore, between the place where
they satand the sea; the two butchers who were just
going to work with him, had left him, at the surprise
of our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the
sea-side, and had jumped into a canoe, and three more
of the rest made the same way : I turned to Friday,
and bade him step forwards, and fire at them; he un
derstood me immediately, and running about forty
yards to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought
he had killed them all ; for I saw them all fall on an
heap into the boat; though I saw two of them, up
again quickly: however, he ltilled two of them, and
wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom
of the boat as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the nor vie-
ttm; and loosing his hands and feet I lifte him up,
and asked him in the Portuguese tongue, what he was .'
He answered in Latin, Christiana: ,- but was so
weak and faint that he cauld scarce stand, or speak;
Itook my bottle out of in pocket, and gave it him,
making signs that he shou d drink, which he did ; and
I gave him a piece of bread. which he ate ; then I
asked him, what countryman he was? and he said.

know, by all the signs he could possibly make. how

said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up,

" we will talk afterwards, but we must fight now ; i!

you have any strength left, take this pistol and sword,

and lay about vou." He took them very thankfully,

and no sooner ad he the arms in his hands, but as if -
they had put new vigour into him, he flew u on his

murderers like afury, and had out two of t em in

pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole was

a surprise to them, so the oor creatureswere so much

frighted with the noise 0 our pieces, that they fell
down for mere amazement and fear, and had no more
power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh
had to resist our shot; and that was the case of those
five that Friday shot in the boat; for as three oflhem
fell with the hurt they received, so the other two {ell
with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I had
given the Spaniard my postal and sword ; so I called
to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from
whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there that had been discharged, which he did with
great swiftness; and then giving him my musket, I
sat down myself to load a the rest again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted. While I was
loading the pieces, there happened a fierce engage- ,
ment between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who made at him with one of their great wooden g
swords, the same weapon that was to have killed him _

was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, E

and ad cut him two great wounds on his head; bu ,

perhaps, with two or three hundred of their canoes
and devour us by mere multitudes; so I consented to
pursue them by sea; antl Tunnin to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade riday follow me ;
but when l was in the canoe, l was surprised to find
another oor creature lie there alive, bound hand and
foot, as the Spaniard was. for the slaughter, and almos
(lead with fear, not knowing what the matter was; fo
he had not been able to look up over the side of lh
boat, he was tied so hard, neck and heels, and had
been tied so long, that he had reall littlelife in him.

I immediately cut the twistedV lie 5, or rushes,
which they had bound him" with, an would have
helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak, but
graaned most piteously, believing, it seems still, that
he was only unbound in order to be killed,

When Friday came to him,l bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and ulling out
my bottle, made him give the poor wretch) a dram,

which with the news of his being delivered, revi'ved'

him, and he' sat up in the boat ; but when Friday
came to hear him speak, and looked in his face, it
would have moved any one to tears, to have seen how
Friday kissed him, embraced him,hugged him, cried,
laughed, hallooed,jumped about, danced, sung, then
cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and
head, and then sung and jumped about avain like a
distracted creature. It was a good while before I
could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the
matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told
me that it was his father. . .

It was not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasy and filial afl'ection had work
ed in this poor savage, at the sight of his father, an
of his being delivered from death ; nor indeed can I
describe half the extravagances of his affection after
this ; for he went into the boat and out of the boat a
great many times: when he went in to him, he would
sit down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's

nourish it ; then he took his arms and ankles, which
were numbed and stifl' with the binding, and chnfed
and rubbed them with his hands; and l, perceiving
what the case was, gave him some rum -out of my
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal
of good.

This action put an end to our pursuit of the cano
with the other savages, who were now gotten almos
out of sight; and it was happy for us that "-0 di
not; for it blew so hard within two hours after, and
before they could begotten a quarter of their way,
and continued blowing so hard all night. and that
from the north-west, which was against them, that 1
could not suppose their boat could live, or that they
ever reached to their own coast.

But to return to Friday; he was so busy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
off for some time : but after I thought he could leave
nim a little, I called him to me, and he came jump-
ing and laughing, and pleased to the highest extreme.
Thenlasked him, if he had given his father any
bread ? He shook his head, and said, " None : ugly
dog eat all up self," So I gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on purpose; [also
gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste
it, butcarried it to his father; I had in my pocket
also two or three bunches of my resins, so I gave

"'he:: he came up to me, 1 found he had been quite
home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father
some fresh water; and that he had got two more cakes
or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me, but the
nater he carried to his father: however, as l was
very thirsty too,l took a little sup of it: this water
revived his father more than all the rum or spirits i
had given hint ; for he was just fainting with thirst.

When his father had drank, I called him, to know
if there was any water left? he said, " Yes;" and l
bade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as
much want of it as his father; and I sent one of the
cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who
was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself
upon a green place, under the shade of a tree, and
whose limbs were also very stiff, and very much
swelled with the rude bandage he had been tied with :
when I saw that, upon Friday's coming to him with
the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and hogan to eat, 1 went to him, and gave him a
handful of raisins: he looked up in my face with all
the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness that could
appear in any countenance; but was so weak, not-
withstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight,
that he could not stand upon his feet ; he tried to do
it two or three times. but was really not able, his
ankles were so swelled and so painful to him; so!
bade him sit still, and caused Friday to rub his ankles,
and bathe them with rum. as he had done. his fathers.

I observed the poor affectionate creature every two
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here,
turned his head about, to see if his father was in the
same place and posture as he left him sitting; and at
last he found he was not to be seen; at which he
started up, and, without speaking a word, flew with
that swiftncss to him, that one could scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ground as he went : but when he
came, he only found he had laid himselfdown to case
his limbs: so Friday came back to me presently. and

up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then
he should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him : but Friday, a lusty young fellow,
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried
him away to the boat, and set him down softly upon
the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the in-
side of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him
close to his father, and presently stepping out again
aunched the boat otl', and paddled it along the short
aster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; so he brought them both safe into our
creek, and leaving them in theboat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to
him, and asked him whither he went? He told me,
" Go fetch more boat ;" so away he went, like the
wind; for sure never man or horse ran like him, and
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as
I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and then
went to help our new guests out of the boat, which he
did ; but they were neither of them able to walk; so
that poor Friday knew not what to do.

To remedy this, I went to work in my thoughts, and
calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank
while he came to me, I soon made a kind of hand-
ltarrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried them
up both together upon it between us; but when we
got them to the outside of our wall or fortification,
we were at a worse loss than before; for it was im-
posstble to get them over; and I was resolved .not to

reak it down: sol set to work again; and Friday
and I, in about two hours time, made a very handsome
tent, covered with old sails, and above that with
boughs of trees, being in the space without our out-
ward fence. and between that and the grove of young
wood which I had planted: and here we made two
beds of such things as I had; viz. of good rice-straw,
with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to
cover them on each bed.

My island was now people, and I thought myself
very rich in subjects; and it mas a merry reflection

which I frequently made,_how like a king I looked .
first'of all, the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty; so that! had an undoubted right of dominion:
2dly, My people were perfectly subjected: I was ab-

me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there
had been occasion for it, (or me : it was remarkable
too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three
difi'erent religions. My man Friday wasa Protestant

was a Papist, however. l allowed liberty of con-
science throughout my dominions: butthisby the way.

As soon asI had secured my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to rest
them upon, I began to think of making some provi-
sion for them; and the first thing i did, i ordered
Friday to take a. yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a
goat, out of my particular flock, to he killed : then i
cut of the hind quarter, and chopping it into small
pieces, I set Friday to work to boiling and stewing,
and made them avery good dish, 1 assure you, 0!

' into the broth; and as I cooked it without doors, (for

I made no fire within my inner wall) so I carried it
all into the new tent; and having set a table there for

see them, if I went that way: all which he punctu-
ally performed, and defaced the very appearance o!
the savages being there; so that when I went again, I
could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.

I then began to enter Into a little conversation with
my two new subjects; and first I set Friday to inquire
of his father, what he thought of the escape of the
savages in that canoe ? and whether he might expect a
return of them with a power too great for us to resist?
His first 0 )ion was, that the savages in the boat
never with live out the storm which blew that night
they went off, but must of necessity be drowned or
driven south to those other shores, where they were as
sure to be devoured, as they were to be drowned if
they were cast away; but as to what they would do if
they came safe on shore, he said, he knew not; but it
was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully frighted
with the manner of being attacked, the noise, and the
fire, that he believed they would tell their peo le they
were all killed by thunder and lightning, an not by
the hand of man; and that the two which appeared
(viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies
come down to destroy them. and not men with wea-
pons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard them
all cry out so in their language to one another; for it
was impossible for them to conceive that a man should
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance,
without lifting up the hand, as was done now. And
this old savage was in the right; for, as I understood
since by other hands, the savages of that part never
attempted to go over to the island afterwards. They
were so terrified,\vith the accounts given by these four
men, (for it seems they did escape the sea) that the
believed, whoever went to that enchanted islan ,
would be destroyed with fire from the gods.

This however, I knew not, and therefore was under
DOntinual apprehensions for a good while, and kept
always upon my guard, l and all my army; for as
there were new four of us, l would have ventured

upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field at any
time.

In a little time, however, no more canoes appear-
ing, the fear of their coming were off, and I began to
take my former thoughts of a voyage to the main into
consideration, being likewise assured by Friday's
father, that I might depend upon good usuage from
their nation on his account, if I would go.

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I
nad a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when
I understood, that there were sixteen more of his
countrymen and Portuguese, who having been cast
away, and made their escape 'Io that side, lived there
at peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore
put to it-fnr necessaries, and indeed for life; I asked
rim all the particulars of their voyage; and fuuml
they were a Spanish ship, bound from the Rio de la
Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and
to bring back what European goods they could meet
with there ; that they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another wreck: that
five of their own men were drowned when first the
ship was lost; and that these escaped through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrive 2 almost starved on
the cannibal coast, where they expected to have been
devoured every moment.

He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder nor ball, the washing of the sea having Spollell
all their powder, but a little which they used at their
first landinv to provide themselves some food.

I asked im what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making any escape? He said, they had many consui
tations about it ; but that having neither vessel. nor
tools to build one, or revisions of any kind, their
counsels always endedP in tears and despair,

I asked him, how he thought they wolud receive a

proposal: from me, which might tend towards at

not be done? I told him with freedom,l feared mostly
their treachery and ill usage of'me, if I put my life
s in their hand; for that gratitude was no inherent
virtue in the nature of man; nor did men always
square their dealings by the obligations they had re
ceived so much asthey did by the advantages they
expected; I told him, it would he very hard. that I

' they should afterwards make me their prisoner inva

a sacrifice, what necessity, or what accident SOCVCI',
brought him thither; and'that I had rather he delirt-r-
g ed up to the savages, and he devoured alive, than fall
1 into the merciless claws of the priests, and be carried
' into the lnqnisition. I added, that otherwise I was
persuaded, if they. were all here, we might with so
many hands build, a bark large enough to carry us all
away either to the Brasils southward, or to the islands
or Spanish coast nortward: bttt that if in requital
they should, when I had put weaponsinto their hands,
carry me by force among their own people, 1 might
be ill used for my kindness to them, and make my
case worse than it was before.

He answered, with a great deal ofcandour and tn-.
genuity,'that their condition was so miserable. and
they were so sensible of it, that he believed they
would abhor the thought of using any man unkinrlly
that should contribute to their deliverance; and that,
if I pleased, he would go to them with the old man,
and discourse with them about it, and return again,
and bring me their'answer: that he would make con-
ditions with them upon the solemn oath, that they
would be absolutely under my leading, as their com
mauder and captain; and that they should swearupon
the holy Sacraments anti Gospel. to be true to me,
and go to such Christian country asl should agree to,

such country as I intended ; and that he would bring
a contract from them under their hands for that pur-
ose.
P Then he told 'me, he would first swear to me him

lived, till I gave him order; and that he would take
my side to the last drop of blood, if there should
happen the least breach of faith among his country.
men.

He told me, they were all of them verycivil honest
men, and they were under the greatest distress imagin-
able, having neither weapons or clothes, nor any
food, but atthe mercy and discretion of the savages ;
out of all hopes of ever returning to their own coun-
try; and that he was sure, if i would undertake their
relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to re-
lieve, them, 'f possible; and to send the old savage and
this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when lie had
gotten all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard him--
self started an oh'ection, which had so much prudence
in it on one han , and so much sincerity on the other
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it ;
and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of his com-
rades for at least half a year. The case was thus:

He had been with us now about a month ; during
which time I had let him see in what manner I had
provided, with the assistance of Providence. for my
support; and he saw evidently what stock of corn and
rice I had laid up ; which, as it was more than suffi-
cient for myself. so it was not sufficient, at least with-
out good husbandry, for my family, now it was in-
creased to number four ; but much less would it he
sufficient, if his countrymen, who were, as he sai '
fourteen still alive, should come over; and least
all would it be suflicicnt to victual our vessel, if we
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian
colonies of America. So he told me, he thonght.it
would be more adviseablc, to let him and the other
two dig and cultivate some more land. as much as I

could spare seed to sow: and that we should wait an-
other harvest, that we might have a supply of com

might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to
think themseves delivered, otherwise than ottt of one
diflieulty into another : " You know" says he, "the
children of Israel, thou h they rejoiced at first at men
being delivered out of gypt, yet rebelled even against
God himself, that deiived them, when they came to
want bread in the wilderness."

His caution was so seasonahle, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased with
his proposal, as well as l was satisfied with his fidelity,
So we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the
wooden tools we were fumished with permitted :, and
in about a month's time, by the end of which it was
seed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and
trimmed up as we sowed twenty-two bushels ofbarlcv
on and sixteen jars of rice, which was in short, all
the seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave
ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the
six months that we had to expect our crop, that is t1
say, reckoning from the time we set our seed aside for
sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six months
in the ground in that country.

Having now society enough, and our number being
sufficient to put us out of fear ofthe savages, if they
had come, unless their number had been very great,

inches to four inches thick: what prodigious labour
it took up, any one many imagine.

At the same time I contrived to increase my link
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard to go out
One da , and myself with Friday, the next day, for
we too our turns: and by this means we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest; for
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and
added them to our flock: but above all, the season
for curing the grapes coming on, I caused such a pro.
digious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that l be-
lieve, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the
sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty
barrels; and these, with our bread, was a great part
of our food, and very good living too, I assure you;
for it is an exceeding nourishing food.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; it
was not the most plentiful increase I had seen in the
island, but, however, it was enough to answer our
end ; for from twenty-two bushels of barley, we
brought in and threshcd out above two hundred and
twenty bushels, and thelike in proportion of the rice,
which was store enough for our food to the next har-
vest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on
shore with me ; or, if we had been ready for a voyage,
it would very plentifully have victualled our ship, to
have carried us to any part of the world, thatis to say,
of America. When we had thus housed and secured
our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more
wicker work ; viz. great baskets, in which we kept it;
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at
this Part, and often blamed me, that I did not make
some things for defence of this kind of work; but I
Saw no need ofit. And now having a full supply of

him, who would not first swear, in the presence at
himself and of the old savage, that he would no way
injure, from with, or attack the person he should find
in the island, who was so kind to send for them in
order to their deliverance; but that they 'would stand
by and defend him against all such attempts; and
wherever they went, would be entirely under, and
subjected to his comand; and that this should be put.
in writing, and signed with their hands: how we were
to have this done, when I knew they had neither
pen or ink, that indeed was a question which we
never asked.

Under these instructions, the. Spaniard, and the old
ravage, (the father of Friday) went away in one of
the canoes, which they might be said to come in, or
'nther were brought in, when they came as prisoners
to be devoured by the savages.

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. '25

when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in
history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one momin
when my man Friday came running into me, an
called aloud, " Master, master, they are come, they
are come."

I jumped up, and regardless of danger, I went out
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my
little grove, which (by the way) was by this time
grown to be a very thick wood; I say, regardless of
danger, I went without my arms, which was not my
custom to do ; but I was surprised, when, turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a
leaaue and a half distance, standing in-for the shore,
wit a shoulder of mutton sail, as they call it, and the
wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in. AlsoI
observed presently, that they did not come from that
side which the shore lay on, but from the southern-
most end of the island. Upon this I called Friday
in, and bid him lie close for these were not the peo-
ple we looked for, and that we did not know yet
whether they were friends or enemies.

' In the next place, I went in to {etch my perspective
glass, to see what I could make of them; and having
taken the ladder out, I climed up to the top of the
hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any
thing, and to take my view the plainer without being
discovered. . .

I had scarce set my foot on the bill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's distance from me S. S. E

. but not above a league and a half from the shore By

my observation it appeared plainly to be an Engl
ship, and the boat appeared to be an English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom llhad reason
to believe was manned by my own countrymen. and
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe;
but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me, I
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep

upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to
me to consider what business an English ship could
have in that part of the world; since it was not the
way to or from any part of the world where the Eng-
lish had any traffic; and I knew there had been no
storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and that
if they were English really, it was most probabl

that they were here upon no good design; and tha
I had better continue as l was, than fall into the hand

of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise t'.te secret hints and notices o
danger, which sometimes are given him when he may
think there is no possibility of its being real. That
such hints and notices are given us, l believe few that
have made any observation of things can deny; that
they are certain discoveries ofan invisible world. an"
a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the
tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger,
why should we not suppose they are from some
friendly agent, (whether supreme, or inferior and sub.
ordinate, is not the question,) and that they are give.
at for our good?

The present question abundantly confirms me in the
justice of this reasoning; for had [not been made
cautious by thissecret admonition, come from whence
It will, I had been undone inevitabl , and in a far
worse condition than before, as you wili sec presently.

I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of land-
ing; however, as they did not come uite far enough,
they did not see the little inlet w ere l formerly i

>> fiancerned in eed, but not to such a degree as the 5

rst.

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew

not what the meaning of it should be; Friday called
out to me in English, as well as he could, " 0 master!
5 you see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage
mans"--" Why," said I, " Friday do you think they
g are going to eat them then ?"--" Yes," says Friday,
" they will eat them."~----" No, no," said I, " Friday ;
I am afraid they will murder them indeed; but you
. may be sure they will not eat them."

All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of
the sight, expecting every moment when the three pri- .
soners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the
villains lift up his arm with a great cutlase (as the sea.
men call it) or sword to strike one of the poor men ;
and I expected to see him fall every moment, at
. which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill
In my veins. _

I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him ; or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might have rescued the three men : for I saw
no fire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to
my mind another way.

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the
three men by the insolent seamen, I observed the fel-
lows ran scattering about the land. as if they wanted i
on see the country. I observed also, that the three i

g other men had liberty to go where they pleased; bnt g'

' they sat down all three upon the ground very penshe

and looked like men in dispair.

This put me in mind of the first time when I came
on shore, and began to look about me; how I gave
myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round me,
what d1eadful apprehensions I had, and howl lodged
in the tree all night for fear of being devou1ed by
wild beasts.

As I. knew nothing that night of the supply I was
to receive by the providential driving of the ship '
nearer the land, by the storms and tides, by which
I have since been so long nourished and supported;
so these three poor desolate men knew nothing how
certain ofdeliverance and supply they were, how near
it was to them, and how effectually and really they.
were in a condition of safety, at the same time they
thought themselves lost, and their case desperate.

So little do we see before us in the world, and so
much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the
I great Maker of the world, that he does not leave his
g at eatuies so absolutel' destitute, but that' 1n the worst
" circumstances they ave always something to be
i thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliver-

5 ance than they imagine- nay, are e'ven brought to
their deliverance by the means by wnich they seem
to be brought to their destruction.

' . ole came on shore, and while pa1 11y they stood
par eying with the Jmsoners they brought. and partly
while they ramble about to see what kind of place
they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably
away, leaving their boat aground.

They had left two men in the boat, who, asl found
afterwards, having drank a little too much brandv, -
fell asleep; however, one of them waking sooner than
the other, and finding the boat too fast aground for
him to stir it, hallooed for the rest who were straggling
about, upon which they all soon came to the boat;
but it was past all their strength to launch her, the

boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side be
ing a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand.

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, per-
haps, the least of all mankind given to forethought
theygave it over, and away they strolled about the
country again ; and I heard one of them say aloud to
another, (calling them off from the boat) " Why, let
her alone, Jack, can't ye? she'll float next tide." By
which I was fully confirmed in the main enquiry, of
what countrymen they were.

All this while I kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place
of observation, near the top of the hill; and very glad
I was, to think how well it was fortified. I knew it
was no less than ten hours before the boat could be
on float again, and by that time it would be dark, and
I might be more at liberty to see their motions, and
to hear their discourse, if they had any.

In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, as
before, though with more caution, knowing I had to
do with another kind ofenemy than I had at first: I
ordered Friday also, whom I had made an excellent
marksman with his gun, to load himself with arms :
. 100k myself two fowling--pieces, and I gave him three
muskets. My figure indeed, was verv fierce ; I had
my formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap
I mentioned, a naked sword, two pistols in my belt,
and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, asI said above, not to have made
any attempt till it was dark: but about two o'clock,
being the heat of the day, 1 found that in short they
were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as l
thought, were all laid down to sleep. The three poor
distressed men, too anxious tor their condition to get
any sleep. were however set down under the shelter

of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, '

and as I thought out of sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover thyself to them,

and learn something of their condition. immediately

as I but not making quite so staring a spectre-like
figure as I did.

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them in Spanish, " What are ye, gentlemen?"

They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth
figure that I made : they made no answer at all, but
I thought I perceived them 'ust going to fly from me,
when I s oke to them in lilnglish : " Gentlemen,"
said I, " (r0 not he surprised at me ; perhaps you
may have a friend near you, when you did not expect
it."-----" He must be sent directly from heaven then,"
said one of them very gravely to me, pulling off his
hat at the same time, " for our condition is past the
help of inan."-" All help is from Heaven, Sir," said
I : " but can you put a stranger in the way how to
help you ? For you seem to me to be in some great
distress: I saw you when you landed ; and when you ,
seemed to make application to the brutes that came
with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword to kill

on."

y The poor man. with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned,
" Am I talking to God or man .7 Is it a real man, or
an angel ?"--" Be in no fear about that, Sir," said I:
" if God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and armed after another
manner than you see me in ; pray lay aside your
fears; I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to
assist you; you see I have one servant only; we have
arms and annnunition; tell us freely can we serve
you ?--what is your case ?"

H Our case," said he, " Sir, is tco long to tell you,

" Where are those hru'es, your enemies ?"----" said
I; " do you know where they are gone ?"-" There
they are sir," said he, " pointing to a thicket of trees; g
" my heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and I
heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly g

" Have they any fire arms ?" said I. He answered, 5

in the boat."----" Well then," said I, "leave the rest g
to me; 1 see they are all asleep; itis an easy thing to ,
kill them all; but shall we rather take them prison-- ;
ers ?" He told me there were two desperate villinns
among them, that it was scarce safe to shew any i
mercy to; but if they were secured, he believed all
the rest would return to theirduty: I asked him, which
they were? He told me, he could not at that distance '
describe them; but he would ohey my orders in
any thing] would direct. " Well," said I, "let us re
treat outot' their view or hearing, lest they awake, and
we will resolve farther ;" so they willingly went back
with me, till the woods covered us from them. 3

" Look you, Sir," said 1, " if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me?" He anticipated my proposals, by telling
me, that both he and the ship, it" recovered, should be
wholly directed and commanded by me in every
thing: and if the ship was not recovered, he would
live and die with me in what part of the world socver
1 would send him; and the two other men said the
same. '

" Well," said I, I' my conditions are but two: L
That while you stayon this island with me, you will
not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms
into your hands, you will upon all occasions give them
up to me. and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon
this island, and in the mean time to be governed by I
my orders.

" 2. That if the ship is or may be recoverered, you
will carry me and my man to England passage tree."

He gave me all the assurance that the invention and
faith of man could'devise, that he would comply
with these most reasonable demands, and besides
would owe his life to me. and acknowledge it upov
all occasions as long as he lived.

" Well then," said I, "here are three muskets for -
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you
think is roper to he done." He shewed all the testiv
mony 0 his gratitude that he was able; but offered to
be wholly guided by me: I told him, I thought it
was hard venturing any thing, but the best method I
could think of, was to fire upon them at once. as they
lay; and if any were not killed at the first volley, and
offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it
wholly upon God's provi once to direct the shot.

He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were in-
corrigible villians, and had been the authors of all the
mutiny in the ship; and ifth'ey escaped, we should be
undone still; for they would 0 on board, and brin
the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. " Wel
then," said I, " necessity legitimates my advice; for
it is the only way to save our lives." However, see-
ing him still cautious ofshedding blood, I told him,
they should go themselves, and manage as they found

' convenient. .

In the middle of this discourse we heardsome at

He said, No. " Well then," said I, "you may let
them esape, and Providence seems to have \vakened
them on purpose to save themselves."--" Now," said
I " ifthe rest esca 8 you, it is your fault."

Animated with t is, he took the musketl had given

lives, if they would give him any assurance of their
abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of i
and would swear to be faithful to him in recovering
the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to J a-

the rotestations of their sincerity that could be de

their lives, which I was not against; only 1 obliged
him to kee them bound hand and foot while they
were u n no island.

tain's mate to the boat. with orders to secure her, and
bring away the oars and sail, which they did; and

for them.) parted from tho rest, came back upon

an attention even to amazement, and particularly a
the wonderful manner of nty being furnished with
provisions and annuunition; and indeed, as my story
is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deep-

'ly; but when he reflected from thence upon himself,

and how l seemed to have been preserved there on
purpose to save his life, the tears ran down his lace,
and he could not Speak a word more.

After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartments, leading
them in just where I came out, viz. at the top ofthe
house; where l refreshed them with such provisions
as I had. and showed theme" the contrivaneesl had
made during my long, longiuhabitiug that place.

All l shewed them, all lsaid to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my for~
tification; and how erfectly I had concealed my re
treat with a grove ol') trees, which, having now been
planted near twenty years, and the treesgrowing much
faster than in England, ,was become a little wood,
and so thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it,
but at that one side where I had reserved my little
winding passage into it: this I told him .was my eas-
tle, and my residence; but that] had a seat in the
country, as most princeshave, whither -I could retreat
upon occasion, and I would shew him that too ano-
ther time ; but at present our business was to consider
how to recover the ship. He agreed with me as to
that; but told me, he was perfectly at a loss what mea-
sure to take; for that there were still six-and-twenty
hands on board, who having entered into a cursed
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited theirlives
to the law, would be hardened in it now by desperar
tion; and would carry it on, knowing that, if they
were reduced, they should be brought to the gallows
as soon as they came to England, or to any .of the
English colonies; and that therefore there would be
no attacking them with so small a number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and
found it wasayery rational conclusion, and that there

' are something was to be resolved on very speedily,
as well to draw the men on board into some snare
for their surprise, as to prevent their landing upon its,
and destroying us. Upon this it presently occurred
to me, that in a little while the ship's crew, wonder-

; ing what was become of their comrades, and of the
boat, would certainly come on shore in their other
boat to see for them; and that then perhaps they

' might come armed, and he too strong for us : this he
allowed was rational. '

' Upon this i told him, the first thing we hadto do

I - was to stavc'the boat, which lay upon the heach, so

_ that they might not carry her oh"; and taking every
thing out of her, leaving her so far useless as not to
be fit to swim ; accordingly we Went on board, took
the arms which were left on board out of her, and

'2 whatever else we found there, which was a bottle at
brandy, and enothor of mm, a few biscuit cakes, an
horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece
of canvass; the sugarwas five or six pounds; all
. which was very welcome to me, especially the brnntly
ind sugar, of which I had had none left for many
i tears. I

- . When we had carried all these things on shore, (the
' oars. mast, sail, and rudder of the boat were carried
before as above,) we knocked it great hole in her
_ bottom, that if they had come stronv enough to mas-

ter us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
. Indeed it was not 'much in my thoughts, that we
' could be capable to recover the ship ; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, l did
- not tnnch question to make her fit again to carry us
. awa to the Leward Islands, and call upon our friends
- ' the paniards in my way. for I had them still in my

thoughts. . ~

her bottom too big to he quickly stopped, and we h
sat down musing what we should do ; we heard the
ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her
ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board;
but no boat stirred; and they fired several times,
making other signals for the boat.
g At last, when all their signals and firings prove
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we saw
} them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another boat
out, and row towards the shore; and we found, as
they approached that there were no less than ten mer.
in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore,
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain
sight of the men, even of their faces; because the tide
having, set them a little to the east of the other boat,
they rowed up under shore, to come to the same place
where the other had landed, and where the boat lay.

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the ersons and characters of

5 all the men in the boat ; o whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows, who he was sure were
led into this conspiracy by the rest, being overpower-
ed and frighted ; but that for the boatswain, who, it
seems, was the chief oficer among them, and all the

g rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's

' crew ; and were no doubt, made desperate in their
new enterprise: and terribly apprehensive he was.
that they would be too powerful {or us.

I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our cine
cumstances were past the operations of fear; that
seeing almost every condition that could be was better
than that we were supposed to be in, we ought to
expect that the consequence. whether death or life
would be sure to be a deliverance: I asked him, what-
he thought of the circumstances of my life, and who-
ther a deliverance were not worth venturing for!
" And where, Sir," said I , " is your belief of my he-
htg preserved here on purpose to save your life, which
elevated you a little while ago? For my part," said I.

"there seems to he but one thing amiss in all the
prospect of it."---" What's that .3" says he. " Why,"
said l, " 'tis that as you say, there are three or four
honest fellows among them, which should be spared ;
had they been all of the wicked art 01 the crew, l
tumult! have thought God's prov1dence had singled
them out to deliver them into your hands , for, depend
upon it, ever man of them that comes ashore, are
our own. an shall die or live as they behave to us."

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him ; so
we set vigorously to our business. We had, upon the
first appearance of the boat's coming from the ship,
considered of separating out prisoners and had in-
deed secured them effectually.

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured
than ordinary,l sent with Friday, and one of the
three (delivered men) to my cave, where they weie
remote enough and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods,
if they could have delivered themselves ; here they
left them bound but gave them provisions, and pro.
mised them, if they continued there quietly, to give
them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they
attempted their escape, they should be put to death
without mercy. They promisied faithfully to bear
their confinement with patience. and were vet y thank-
ful that they had such good nsuage as to have provi-
sions and alight left them ; for Friday gave them
candles (such as we made ourselves) for their com-
{ort : and they did not know but that he stood sentinel
over them at the entrance. -

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them
were kept pinioned indeed, because the captain was
not free to trust them ; but the other two were taken
into my service upon their captain's recommendation,
and upon their solemny engagin to live and die with
us; so. with them'and the threeioncst men, we were

should be able to deal well enough with the ten that
were a'coming, considering that the captain had said,
there were three or four honest men among them also.

As soon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came
all on shore; hauling the boat u ) after them, which
I was glad to see; for l was afraid they would retire
have left the boat at an anchor, some distance from
the shore, with some hands in her to guard her an
no we should not be able (0 sieze the boat.

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to the other ooat; and it was easy to see they were
under agreat's'urprise to find her strip ed as above,
of all that was in her, and agrent hole In her bottom.

After they had mused awhile upon this, they set
up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but all was to no purpose; than they came all
close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small arms,
which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the
woods ring; but it was all one : those in the care, we
were sure, could not hear; and those in ottr keeping.
though they hear-l it well enough, yet durst give no
answer to them. ' "

They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told tts afterwards, they resolved to go
all on board again to their ship, and let them' know

there, that the men were all murdered, and the long-.
boat staved ; accordingly, they immediately launched

the boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
feunded at this, believing they would go on boa'rd the
ship again and set sail, giving their comrades up to
lost, and so he should 'still lose the ship, which he wa
in hopes we should have recovered; but he was quick.
ly as much frighted the other way. -

They had not, been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them coming on shore again ; but with
this new measure in their conduct. whiclt it seems

hey consulted together upon; viz. to leave three men
In the boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up
into the country to look for their fellows.

This was agreat disappointment to us; for now -

we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing tho-o
seven ,men on shore would be no advantage to us it
we let the boat escape, because they would-then row
away to the ship; and then the rest of them would he
sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our recovering the
ship would be lost.

However, we had no-remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present. The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in
the boat put her off to a good distance from the shore,
and came to an anchor to wait for them; so that it
was impossible for us to come at them in the boaL

Those thatcame on shore ke t close togethermarch-
ing towards the to of the litt e hill, under which my
habitation lay; an we could see them plainly, though
they could not perceive us; we could have been very
glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we
might have fired at them; or that they would have
gone farther off, that we might have come abroad.

But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they could see a. great way in the valley and
woods, which lay towards the north-east art, and
where the island lay low'est, they shouted.aii$hallooed
till they were weary; and not caring, it seems, to
venture far, from the shore, nor far from one another,
they sat down together under a tree, to consider of
it: had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there,
as the other party of them had done, they had done

he '0!) for us; but they were too full of apprehensions
of anger, to venture to go to sleep, though they could
not tell what the danger was they had to {ear neither.

The captain made avery just proposal to me u on
this consultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps t ey
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make
their fellows hear, and that we shoutl all sally upon
them, Just at the juncture when their pieces were all

dischar ed, and they would certainly yield, and we
should ave them without bloodshed. I liked the
pmposal, provided it was done while we were near
enough to come up to them, before they could load
their pieces again.

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a
long timevery irresolute what course to take ; at length
i told them, there would be nothin to be done in
my opinion till night; and then, if t ey did not re-
turn to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get
between them and the shore, and so might use some
stratagem with them in the boat, to getthem on shore.

We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy: when, af-
ter long consultations, we saw them start all up, and
march down toward the sea: it seems, they had such
dreadful apprehensions upon them of the dangerofthe
place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go
on with their intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was; that they had
given over their search,and were forgoing back again;
and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughtn,
was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it; but 1
presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back
again, and which answered my end to a tittle.

I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, togo
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued ; and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground, at about half a mile's distance, I bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it
again, and then, keeping out of sight, take a round,
always answerin when the others hallooed, to draw
them as far into t 1e island, and among the woods, 3:
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by such
ways as I directed.

and the mate hallooed,and they presentlyheard them,
and answering, run alongtheshorewestward, towards
the voice they heard, when they were presently stop-
ped by the creek, where the water being up, they
could not get over. and called for the boat to come
up, and set them over, as indeed I expected.

When they had set themselves over, I observed that
the boat being gone up a. good way into the creek,
and as it were in a harbour within the land, the
took one of the three men out of her to go along with
them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.

This was what I wished for, and immediately learn
ing Friday and the captain's mate to their business,l
took the rest with me, and, crossing the creek out of
their sight, we surprised the two men before they were
aware, one of them lying on shore, and the other he-

sleepin and waking, and going to start up, the ca

here needed vety few arguments to persuade a ;
tingle man to yield, when he saw five men-upon him, i
and his comrade knocked down,- besides, this was, it ,
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the g
mutiny as the rest of the crew, and therefore was I
easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to g
join very sincerely with us. ,
In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate so i
well managed their business with the rest, that they $
drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill f;
to another, and from one wood to another, till they $
not only heartily tired them, but left them where they '
were very sure they could not reach back to the in it
before it was dark ; and indeed they were heartiy

in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to ma} -
sure work with them. ~

It was several hours after Friday 'came back to me
be'l'ore theyvcame back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long' before they came
quite up,'calling to those behind to come along; and
could also hear them answer, and complain how lame
and tired they were, and not being able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us. '

At length they came up to the boat; but it is impos-
elble to express their confusion, when they-found the
boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and
their two men gone: we could hear them call to one
another in a most lamentable manner, telling one an-
other thoy were gotten into an enchanted island ; that
either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered; or else there were devils or spirits in
it, and they should be all carried away and devoured.

The'y hallooed again, and called their two com.
ratio: by their names a great many times, but no an-
swer: afler some time, we could see them, by the NHL:
light there was, run about ringing their hands, lilal
men in despair; and that sometimes they would gt;
and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then
come ashore, and walk about again, and so the same
thing over again. , '

My men would fain have had me given them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but i was wil-
ling to take them at some advantage, so to spare them,
and kill as few of them as I could; and especially]

. was unwilling to hazard the killind any of our men,

knowing the other men were ve well armed: I re-

. .nolved to wait to see if they dl not separate; and
therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my ambus-

cade heater; and ordered Friday and the captain to
creep upon' their hands and feet asclose to the ground
as they could. that they might not. be discovered, and
get as near them as they could possibly. before they
offered to tire.

They had not been long in that posture, till the

houtswain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most deject-
ed and dispiritcd of all the rest, came walkingtowards
them with two more of the crew; the captain was so
eager at having the dprincipal rogue so much in his
power, that he coul hardly have patience to let him
come so near as to he sure of him; for they only
heard his tongue before: but when they came nearer
the captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let

, 'l'he boatswam was killed upon the spot ; the next

with my whole army, which was now eight men ; viz
myself generalissimo; Friday my lieutenant~gencro1 ,
the captain and his uvo men. and the three prisoners
of war whom he had trusted with arms.

We came upon-them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number: and l made the man
they had left in the boat who was now one of us, to
cal them by name to try if I could bring them to a

The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for God's sake, Tom

% " Will they give us quarter then ?" says Tom Smith,
" and we will yield."--" I'll go and ask, if you pro-
mise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked the cap-
tain, and the captain himself then calls out, " You

3 Smith. you know my voice, if you lay down your
arms immediately and submit, you shall have your
lives, all but Will Atkins."

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake,
captain, give me quarter: what have l done? they
have all been as had as I." (which by the way was
not true either; for it seems this Will Atkins was the
first man that laid hold ofthe captain when they first
mutinied, and used hint barbarously, in tying his
hands and giving him injurious language :) however,
the captain told him he must lay down his arms at
discretion, and trust to the governors's merry, by

which he meant me: forthey all called me governor,

ln a word, they all laid down their arms, and beg-

) god their lives: and I sent the man that had parleyi-d
with them. and two more. who bound them all z and
then my great army of fifty men, which, particularly
with those three, were all but eight, came up and
seized upon them all, and upon their boat. only Ihat I
kept myself and one more out of sight, for reasons 01
state.

Our next work was to repair the boat. and to think
of seizing the ship ; and as for the captain. now he
had leisure to parlcy with them, he expostnlated with
them u on the villainy of their practices with him,
and al ength, upon the farther wickedness of limit
design: and how certainly it must bring them to mis>>
cry and distress in the end,nnd perhaps to the gallows.

2 They all appeared very penitent. and begged hard

3 for their lives: as for that. he told them they were
none of his prisoners, but the Commander's of the

3' island : that they thought they had set him on shore
in a barren uninhabited island: but it had pleased

2 God so to direct them. that the island was inhabited,
and that the governor was an I'Znulislnnan: that he

had given them all quarter, be supposed he would
send them to England, to be dealt with there as jus~
tice required eycept Atkins, whom he was cmnmand-
ed by the governor to advise to prepare for death 5
for that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had
Its desired efi'ect. Atkins fell upon his knees to beg
the ca tain to intercedc with the governor for his life;
and al the rest begged of him for God's sake, that
they might not be sent to England.

1: now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would be a most easy
thing to hrin these fellows in to he hearty in getting
possession o the ship ; so I retired in the dark from
them, that they might not see what kind of a governor
they had, and called the captain to me: when I called,
as at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to
speak again and say to the ca tain, " Captain, the
commander calls for you :" an presently the captain
re lied, " Tell his excellency I am just a-coming."
T Iis more perfectly amused them ; and they all be-
lieved that the commander was just by with his fifty
men.

Upon the ca tain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
ully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next
morning. .

But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be
secure of success, I told him we must divide the pri-
soners, and that he should go and take Atkins, and
two more of the worst of them, and send them pinion-
ed to the cave where the others lay : this was com-'
mitted to Friday, and the two men who came on shore
with the captain.

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison ,
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition.

The others I ordered to my bower, as Icalled it, 04
which I have given a full description; and as it was

to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to try

He talked to them ofthe injury done him, of the con'
tlition they were brought to; and that though the
governor had given them quarter for their lives, as to
theJnesent action, yet that ifthey were sent to Eng-
lan , they would all be. hanged in chains, to he sure;

recover the ship, he would have the governor's engage-
ment for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted'by men in their c'ondition : they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and promised
with the deepest imprecations, that they would be
faithful to him to the last drop, and that they should
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all
over the world ; that the would own him for a father
to them as long as they ived. .
" Well," says the captain, " I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do'to
bring him to consent to it."_ So he brought me an
account of the tem er he found them in ; and that
he verily believed ey would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told him
he should go back a in, and choose out five of them,
and tell them that t ey should see that. they did not
want men ; but he would take out those five to be his
assistants, and that the governor Would keep theothel

was employment enough for us to keep them asun-

about midnight. As soon as they came within call at
the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them
he had brought ofl' the m'en in the boat, but that it
was a long time before they had found them, and the
like; holding them in a chat, till they came to the
ship's side; when the captain and the mate, entering
first with their arms, immediately knocked down the
second mate and car enter with the but end of their
muskets; being very aithfully seconded by their men,
they secured all the rest that were upon thcmain and
quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to
keep them down who were below; when the other
boat, and their men, entering at the fore chains, se-

cured the forecastle of the ship, and the shuttle which .

went down into the cook.room, making three men
thea'lound there prisoners.

hen this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate with three men to break
into the round-house, where the new rebel captain
lay, and, having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and
With two men and a boy had gotten fire arms in their
hands; and when the mate with acrow split open
the door, the new captain and his men fired boldly
among them, and wounded the mate with a musket-
ball, which broke his arm. and wounded two more at
the men, but killed nobody.

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and with his
pistol shot the new captain through the head, the bul--
ets entering at his mouth, and came out again behind
one of his ears; so that he never spoke a word; upon
which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effec-
tually, without any more lives being last.

As soon as the ship was thus secured. the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the signal
agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his sue.~
cess; which you may be sure i was very glad to hear,
having sat watching upon the shore for it, till neat
two of the clock in the morning.

town; and it having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I slept very sound, tillI was something surprised
with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I
heard a man call me by the name of governor, govep
nor; and presently I knew the captain's voice; when
climbing up to the top ofthe hill, there he stood, and
pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms:
" My dear friend'and delivercr," says he, " there's
your ship. for she is all yours, and so are we, and all
that belong to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and

the shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her; and the weather being g

fan, had brougnt her to an anchor just against the
mouth of a. little creek; and the tide being up, the
captain had brought the pinnace in near the place
where I first landed my rafts, and so landed just at
my door.

I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sub '

rise: for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
mto my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away whither I pleaded to go: at
first, {or some time, I was not able to answer one 5
word ; butas he had taken me in his arms, Iheld fast
by him, or I should have fallen to the ground.

He etceived the surprise, and immediately pulled
a bott e out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of I
cordial, which he had brought on purpose for me:
after I drank it, l sat down upon the ground, and
though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him.

All this while the poor man was in as great an
ecstacy as I, only not under any surprise. as I was;
and he said a thousand kind tender things to me, to
com ose and bring me to myself ; but such was the
fine of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits
into confusion; at last it broke into tears, and in a
little while after i recovered my speech.

Then I took my turn. and embraced him as my
deliverer: and we rejoiced together: I told him. I

looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to do
liver me, and that the whole transaction seemed to be
a chain of wonders; that such things as these were the
testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence
governin the world, and an evidence, that the eye:
of. anlin nite Power could search into the remotest
corner of the world, and send help to the miserable
whenever he pleased:

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to
Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless Him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for one in such a wilderness. and such a desolate
condition, but from whom every deliverance mus
always be acknowledged to proceed? .

When we had talked awhile, the captain told me
he had brought me some little refreshments, such an
the ship afl'orded, and such as the wretchcs who hat
been so long his masters, had not plundered him of.
Upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bids his
men brin the things ashore that were for the gover-

' nor; an indeed it was a present, as if I had been

one, not that] was to he carried alon with them, but

asjt' l had heen to dwell upon the island still, and-

they were to go without me.

First, he had brought me a case of bottles full 0!
excellent cordial waters; six large bottles of Madeira
wine, the bottles held two quarts apiece; two pounds
of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces of the
ship's beef, and six pieces ofpork, with a bag ofpeas,
and about a hundred weight of biscuit. Y

He brought me also a box of sugar; a box of flour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice,
and abundance of other things: but besides these, and,
what was a thousand times more useful to me, he
brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck-
cloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat,
and one pair of stockings. and a very good-suit of
clothes of his own, which had been worn hut very
little. In a word, he clothed me from head 'o'foot'

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his
good things were brought into my little apartment, .
we began to consult what was to be done with the '
prisoners we had ; for it was worth considering whe-
ther we might venture totake them away with us or '
no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be in-
corrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the
captain said. he _knew they were such rogues, that
there was no obliging them; and it' he did carry them
away, it must he in irons, as malefactors, to be de- e
Iivered over to justice at the first English colony he
wuld come at; and I found that the captain himsel!
was very anxious about it. _
Upon this, I told him, that, if he desired it, I durst .
- undertake to bring the two men he spoke of to make '
it their own request that he should leave thetn upon
the island: " I should be very glad of that,"_ says the
captain, " with all my heart." ,
"Well," said "I, "l will send for them, and talk
with them {or ouz" so I caused Friday and the two '
hostages, for t e were now discharged, their com-

them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men,

be the gallows; so that I could not tell what was bent
for them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island; if they desired that, I did not care, as I
had liberty to leave it; I had some inclination to give
them their lives. if they thought they could shift on
shore. They seemed very thankfiil for it; said they
would much rather venture to stay there, than to be
carried to England to be hanged; so I left it on that
tssue.

However the captain seemed to make some diffi-
culty of it, as if he durst not leave them there: upon
this I seemed to be a little angry with the captain, and
told him, that they were my prisoners, not his; and
that seeing I had offered them so much favour, I
would he as good as my word ; and that if he did not
think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty
as I found them ; and if he did not like that, he migh!
take them again iI'he could catch them.

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac-
cordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire
inlu the woods. to the place whence they came. and I

would leave them some fire-arms, some ammunition
- and some directions how they should live very well,
if they thought fit.

Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship; but
i told the captain, that I would stay that night to pre-
pare my things; and desired him to go on board in
5 the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and
' send the boat on shore the next day for me; ordering
him in the meantime to cause the new captain who
was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these
;' men might see him.
l When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up
, to me to my apartment, and entered seriously into
5 discourse with them of their circumstances: I told
l them, I thought they had made a right choice; that
5 if the captain carried them away, they would cer-
5 tainly be hanged : I shewed them their captain hang-
5 ing at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they
E had nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them I would let them into the story
of my living there, and put them in the way of mak-
ing it easy to them: accordingly I gave them the
whole history of the place, and of my coming to it x
shewcd them my fortifications, the way I made my
bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a
word, all that was necessary to make them easy. I
told them the story of the sixteen Spaniards that were
to he expected; for whom I left a letter, and made

thpin promise to treat them in common with them-
ae ves.

I left them my firearms; viz. live muskets, three
iowling-pieces, and three swords: I had about a ban-
rel of powder left; for after the first year or twol
used but little, and wasted none. I gave them a de-
scription of the way I managed the goats, and dircc~
tions to milk and fatten them, to make both butter
and cheese.

In a word, leave them every part of my own
story; and I told them, 1 would prevail with the cap~\\\\\V\AM~W w"wwwMMw\\xmw>>Wm . __

tain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more

and some 'garden seed, which 1 told them l would

have been very glad of; also [gave them the bag of

teas which the captain had brought me to eat, and
ade them be sure to sow and increase them.

_ Having done all this, I left them the next day, and
went on board the ship: we prepared immediatelyto
sail, but did not weigh that night: the next mornitg
early, two of the five men came swimming to the
ship's side, and making a most lamentable complaint
ofthe other three, begged to be taken into the ship for
God's sake,_ for they should be murdered; and hog.
fed the captain to take them on board though he

ranged them immediately. .

Upon this the ca )tain pretended to have no- power
without me ; but a ter some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment. they were taken on
board, and were some time after soundly whipped
and pickled; after which they proved very honest
and quiet fellows. '

Some time after this, I went with the boat on share,

the tide being up, with the things promised to the menI '

to which the captain, at m intercession, caused their
chests and clothes to he a ded, which they took, and
were very thankful for; I also encouraged them, by
telling them, that if it lay in my way to se'nd a vessel
to. take them in, 1 would not forget them.

When 1 took leave of this island. 1 carried on board
for relics the great goat-skin cap l had made, my um-
brella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot not to
take the money I formerly mentioned, which hau lain
by me so long useless that it was grown rusty or tar-
nished, and could hardly pass for silver, till it had
been a little rubbed and handled; and also the money
I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.

And thus i left the island the nineteenth of Decem-
ber, as i found by the ship's account, in the year 1686,
after] had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two
month, and nineteen days: being delivered from the
second captivity the same day of the month thatl first

Moors of Sallee. .

In this vessel, after a long voyage,'l arrived in Eng
land the eleventh of June, in the year l687 ; having
been' thirt and five 'ears absent.

\Vhen came to ngland, I was a perfect stranger
to all the word, as if I had never been known there :
my benefactor and faithful steward, whom I had left
in trust with my money, 'was alive, but had had great
misfortunes .in the world, was become a widow the
second time, and very low in the world : I made her
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but on the contrary. in gratitude
to bar former core and faithfulness to me, I relieved
her as my little stock would afford, which at that
time would indeed allow me to do but little for hen
but I' assured her I would never forget her former
kindness to me; nor did I forget her, when I had suf-
ficient to help her; as shall he observed in its place.

I went down afterwwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead. and my mother and all the family

extinct ; except that I found two sisters, and two of .

the children of one of m brothers: and as 1 had
been long ago given over or dead, there had been no
provision made for me. so that. in a word, l found
nothing to relieve or assist me ; and that little money
I haldd would not do much for me as to settling in the
wor .

I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I
did not expect ; and this was that the master of the
ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by the
some means saved the s up and cargo, havinggivena
very handsome account to the owners,- of the manner
howl had saved the lives of the men, and the ship,
they invited me to meet them and some other mer-
chants concerned, and all together made me a very
handsome compliment tlpon that subject, and a pre-
sent of almost two hundred pounds sterling.

But after making several reflections upon the cir-
umstances of my'life. and how little way this would

go towards settling me in the world, I resolved to so
to Lisbon, and see if l might not come h some inv
formation of the state of my plantation in t e Brasils,
and what was become of my partner who, i had
reason to suppose, had some years now given me over
lbr dead.

With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where]
arrived in April following; my man Friday-accom-
panying me very honestly in all these ramblings, and
proving a most faithful servant upon all occasxons.

When i came to Lisbon l found out, by enquiry,
and to my particular satisfaction, my old friend the
captain of the ship, who first took me up at sea, off
the shore of Africa; he was now grown old and had
left 011' the sea, having put his son who was far from
ayoung man, into his ship; and who still used the
Brasil trade. The old man did not know me, and,
indeed, i hardly knew him; but I soon brought my.
self to his remembrance, when [told him who 1 was.

After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, ] inquired. you may be sure, after my
donation and my partner; the old man told me, he
had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but
that he could assure me, that when he came away,
my partner was living; but the trustees, whom I had
'oined with him, to take cognizance of my part, were
hath dead ; that. howev'er, he believed that I would
have a very good account of the improvement of the
plantation; for that. upon the general belief of my
being cast away and drowned. my trustees had given
in the account of the produce of my part of the plan-
tation, to the procurator fiscal; who had a propriated
it in case I never came to claim it, one tnrd to the
king, and two thirds to the monastry of St. Augus-
tine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and
for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic
faith; but that if i a peared, or any one for me, to
claim the inheritance. it would be restored; only that
the improvement, or annual production, being distri
butcrl to charitable uses. could not he restored: but

no assured me. that the steward of the king's revenue
(from lands) and the provedore or steward of the
monastery, had taken great care all along, that the in-
cumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year
a faithful account of the produce, of which they re-
ceived duly my moiety.

laksed him, if he knew to what height of im rove-
ment he had brought the plantation; and whet er he
thought it might be worth looking after; or whether,
on my going thither, I should meet with no obstrtw
tion to my possessing my just right in the moiety.

He told me, he could n0I tell exactly to what de-
gree the plantation was improved ; but this he knew,
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon
the enjoying but one halfof it ; and that, to the best
of his remembrance, he had heard, that the king's
third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away
to some other monastry, or religious house, amounted
to above two hundred moidores a year: that, as to
my being restored to my quiet possessien of it, there
was no question to be made of that, my partner being
ulive to witness my title, and my name being also
enrolled in the. register of the country. Also he told
me, that the survivors of my two trustees were very
fair, honest people, and very wealthy, and he believed
I would not only have their assistance for putting me
in possession. but would find a very considerable sum
of money in their hands for m account, being the
produce of the farm, while their athers held the trust,
and before it was given up, as above, which, as he
remembered, was about twelve years.

i shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy a:
this account, and inquired of the old captain, how it
came to pass that the trustees should thus disp0se of
my eifects, when he knew that l had made my will,
and had made him the Portuguese captain, my uni-
versal heir, &o.

He told me that wastrue; bnt that, as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exe-
cutor. until some certain account should come of m)

death; and that, besides, he was not willing to inter
meddle with a thing so remote: that it was true, he
had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or
alive, he would have acted by procuration,and taken
possession of the ingenio, (so they called the sugar-

ouse) and had given his son, who was now at the
Brnsils, order to do it. ,

" But," says the old man, "I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so accept-
able to you as the rest; and that is, that believing you
were lost, and all the world believingso also, your
partner and trustees did ofl'er to account to me in
your name, for six or eight of the first years of profit.
which l received; but there being at that time," says

~ he, " great disbursements for increasing the works,

building an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not
amount to near so much as afterwards it produced :
however," says the old man, " I shall give you a true
account of what I have received in all, and how 1
have disposed of it."

After a few days farther conference with this an-
clent friend, he brought me an account of the six first
years income of my plantation. signed by my partner,
and the merchants' trustees, being always delivered
in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests,
besides rum, molasses, &c. which is the consequence
of a sugar-work ; and I found by this account, that
every year the income considerably increased ; but, as
above, the disbursement being large, the sum at first
.was small: however, the old man let me see, that he
was debtor to me four hundred and seven moidores
of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and [teen dou-
ble rolls of tobacco, which were lost in his ship, be
having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon.
about eleven years after leaving the place.

The good man then hegan to complain of his mis-
fortunes, and how he had been obliged to make use
of my_money to recover hiS'losses, and buy him a

share to a new ship; "however, my old friend." says

he. " you shall not want a supply in your necessity;
and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully sa-
tisfied." '

U on this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives rne
two undred Portugal moidores in gold ; and gtvmg
me the writings ofhis title to the ship which hts son
was gone to theBrasils in, of which he was a quarter

art owner, and his son another, he puts them both
In my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much' moved with the honest and kind-
ness of the poor man, to be able to bear 1 is; and re-
membering what he had done for me, how he had
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used
we on all occasions, and par'icularly how sincere a
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain (veep.
iug at what he said to me: therefore, firstl asked him
if his circumstances admitted him to spare so much
money at that time. and if it would not straiten him?
He told me he could not say but it might straiten him
a little ; but, however, it was my money, and! might
want it more than he. '

Every thing the good man said was full of afl'eo

' lion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he

spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the moidores,
and called t'orapen and ink to give him a receipt
forthem ; then I returned him the rest, and told him,
If ever I had, possession of the plantation, I t'vould
return the other to him also. as indeed I afterwards
did: and that, as to the bill ofsale of his part in his

if I wanted the money, 1' foundhe was honest enough
to pay me; and ifl did not, but came to receive what
he gave me reason to expect, I would .never have ll
penny more from him.

When ,this was past the old man began to ask me

my right, and immediately to appropriate the profia
to my use; and as there were ships in the river oi
Lisbon, just ready to go away to Brasil, he made me
enter my name in a public register, with his affidavit
affirming upon oath that I was alive, and that l we
the same person who took up the land for the plant

This being regularly attested by a notary, and .
procurstion affixed, he directed me to send it with I
etler of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaint:
once at the place; and then roposetl my staying with
him till an account came 0 the return.

Never any thing was more honourable that the pro-
ceedings upon this procumtion; for in less than seven

"months l received alarge acket from the survivors

of my trustees, the mercmnts, on whose account!
went to sea, in which were the following particular
letters and papers enclosed.

First, There was theaccount current of the produce
of iny farm, or plantation, from lhe year when their
fathers had balanced with my old Portugal captain,
being for six years ; the balance appeared to be 1174
moidores m my favour.

Secondly, There was the account offouryears mom
while they kept the efl'ects in their hands, before the
government claimed the administration, as being the
effects of a person not to be found, which they call
civil death ,- and the balance ofthis, the value of the
plantation increasing, amounted to crusadoes, which
made 324" Inoidores.

Thirdly, There was the prior of the A ugustincs at
count, who had received the profits forabove fourtee
years; but not being able to account for what was din

osed to the haspital, very honestly declfied he he.

and what it produced a year, with a particular of the
number of squares, or acres, that it contained ; how
planted, how many slaves there were u on it; and,
making two-and-twenty crosses for blessmgs, told me
he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the Blessed
Virgin that l was alive ; inviting me very passionately
to come over and take possession of my own, and in
the mean time to give him orders to whom he should
t'cliver my effects, ifl did not come myself: conclud-
ng with a heart tender of his friendship, and that 0!
his family ; an sent me as a present. seven fine leo-
pards' skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa by some other ship which he had sent thither;
and who, it seems, had made a better voyage than 1.
He sent me also live chests of excellent sweetmcats,
and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so
lar e as moidores.

fly the same fleet my merchant-trustees shi gped me
1200 chests ct'sugar. 800 rolls of tobacco, and the rest
of the whole account in'gold.

i might well say now, indeed, that the latter end
of Job was better than the beginning. It is impossi-
ble to express the flutterings of my very heart, when
I looked over these letters. and especially when l
found all my wealth about me; for as the Brasil ships
come all,in fleets, the same ships which brought m
letters brought my goods; and the efl'ects were so
in the Tagus before the letters came to my hand. In
a word I turned pale, and raw sick; and had not
the old man run and fetche me a cordial, I believe

had died upon the spot.

thousand pound:c sterling in money, and had an estate.

as i might well call it, in the Brasils, of above a thon- _

sand pounds a can as sure as an estate of lands in

England ; and, III a word, I was in a condition which

I scarce knew. how to understand, or how to com-

pose myself for the en'oyment of. '

The first thing I di was to recompense my origi-

nal benefactor, my good old captain, who had been
' first charitable to me m my distress, kind to me in the-'
beginning. and honest to me at the end. Ishewed
him all that was sent me; I told him, that, next to
the providence of Heaven. which disposes all things,

it was owing to him ; and that it now lay on me to

reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold. So I

first r'etumed to him the.hundred moidorcs I had re-

ceived of him ; then 1 sent for a notary, and caused
him to draw up a general release or discharge for the
four hundred and seventy moidores, which he had
acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmesl
manner possible; after which I caused a procuration

to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver ol

the annual profits of my Iantation, and appointing

my partner to account to him, and make the returns

by the usual'fleets to him in my name; nnda clause
~ in the end heinga grant of one hundred moidores a
year to him during his'lil'e, out of the effects; and
fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life.
And thusl required my old man.

I was now to consider which way to steer my
muree next and what to do with the estate that Pro-
vidence had thus put into my hands ; and, indeed, I
had more care u on my head now than I had in my
silent state of li ezin the island, where i waited no-
thing but what l had, and had nothing but what'l
wanted ; whereas I had now a great charge upon me '
and 'my business was how to secure it: I had never: '
cave to hide my money in, or a place where it might
lie without lock or key. till it grew mouldy and tar-
nislied before any body would meddle thh .it. On
the contrary, I knew not where to put it or whom

then she was in years, and but poor, andrfor aught I
knew, might be in debt; so that, in a word, [had
no way but to go back to England myself, and take
my effects with me.

i was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as i had rewarded the old
Captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been my
former benefactor, so i began to think of my poor
widow,' whose husband had been my first henefactor,
and she, while it was in her power, my faithful
sleward'nnd instructor. So the first thingl did, Igot
a merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent
in London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her
out, and carry her in money a hundred pounds from

i
i
- me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her po-
verty, by telling her she should, if i lived, have a
. farther supply. At the same time I sent my two sis-
- ters in the country. each of them a hundred pounds,
they being. though not in want, yet not in very good
mrcumstances; one having been married, and left a
widow ; and the other. having, a husband not so kind
i to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances. l
g could not yet pitch upon one to whom i durst com-
mit the grass of my stock. that I might go away to
the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils and
have settled myself there. for l was. as it were. natu-'
ralizcd to the place; but i hadrsotne little scruple in
my mind about religion, which insensibly drew. me
back, of which i shall say more presently. However,

it was not religion that kept me from goin thither
for the present; and as I had made no scrup e of be-
ing openly of the religion of the country, all the while
I was among them, so neither did Iyet; only that
now and then having of late thought more of it than
formerly, when l began to think of living and dyin
among them, i began to regret my having professe
myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best
religion to die in.

But, as l have said, this was not the main thin
that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that really
I did not know with whom to leave my effect: he-
hind me; so I resolved at last to go to England with
them, where if I arrived, I concluded I should make
some acquaintance, or find some relations that would
be faithful to me; and accordingly I prepared to go
for England with all my wealth.

in order to prepare things for my going home, I
first (the Brasil fleet being just going away) resolved
to give answers suitable to the just und faithful ac-
count of things [had from thence; and first to the
prior of St. Augustine l wrote a letter full of thanks
for hisjust dealings, and the ofl'er of the eight hundrt-d

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 295

only to come to him, but to settle myself there for the
remainder of my life. To this I added a very hands
some present of some Italian silks for his wrfe and
two daughters, for such the captain's son informed me
he had; with two pieces of fine English broad-cloth,

, the best I could get in Lisbon, five ieces of black

bays, and some Flanders lace of a goo value.

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange, my
next difiiculty was, which way to go to England. 1
had been accustOmed enough to the sea, and yet I had
a strange aversion to go to England by sea at that
time; and though I could give no reason for it, yet
the diliiculty increased upon me so much, that though
I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I
altered my mind, and that not once, but two or three
times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and
this might be one of the reasons. But let no man
slight the strong in) niece of his own thoughts in cases
of such moment. wo of the ships which lhad sin-
gled out to go in, I mean more particularly singled
out than any other, that is to say, so as in one of them
to put my things on board, and in the other to have
agreed with the captain; Isay, two of these ships
miscarried, viz. one was taken by the Algerines, and
the other was cast away on the start, near Torbay,
and all the people drowned except three; so that in
either of those vessels I had been made miserable,
and in which most, it was hard to say.

Having been thus harrassed in my thoughts, my old
pilot, to whom I communicated every thing. pressed
me earnest! ' not to go to sea; but either to go by
land to the royne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay
to Rochelle. from whence it was but an easy and safe
journey by land to Paris, and so to Cailis and Dover;
or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
through France.

In a word, I was so repossessed against my goi
by sea at all, except rom Cailis to Dover, that

resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as.'
was not in haste, and did not value the charge, wal
by much the pleasanter way; and to make it more so,
my old captain brought an English gentleman, the
son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel
with me; after which, we picked up two who were
English, and merchants also, and two young Portu<
guese gentlemen, the last goin to Paris only: so that
we were in all six of us, . an five servants, the two
merchants and the two Portuguese contenting them
selves with one servant between two, to save the
charge; and as for me, I got an English sailor'to tra-
vel with me as a servant. besides my man Friday,
who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup-
plying the place of a servant upon the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted and armed, we
made a little troop whereof they did me the honour
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest
man, as because I had two servants, and indeed was
the original of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea jours
nals, so shall 1 trouble you with none of m land
journals. But some adventures that happene to us
in this tedious and diflicult journey, I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some time to
see the court ofSpaiu, and to see what was worth ob.
serving; but it being the latter part of the summer,
we hastened away, and set out from Madrid aboutthe
middle of October. But when we came to the edge
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the
way, with an account that so much snow was fallen
on the French side of the mountains, that several tra-
vellers were obliged to come back to Pam eluna, after
having attempted, at an extreme hazar , to pass or.

When we came to Pam eluna itself, we found itso
indeed; and to me that red been always used toa
hot climate, and indeed to countries where we could
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufi'erable,
.%"~MNN~\MNW\NV\\"\\VMNN\V'W~W
nor indeed was it more painful than it was surpris-
ing : to come but ten days before out ofthc Old Cas-
tile where the weather was not only warm, but very
hot, and Immediately to feel a wind from the Pyro-
nean mountains, so very keen, so severely cold, as to

be intolerable, and to endanger benumhiug and per~
Rolling of our fingers and toes, was very strange.

Poor Friday was really frightcd when he saw the
mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold wea-
ther, which he had never seen or felt before in his life;

To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna,
it continued snowing with so much violence. and so
long, that the,people said, wmter was come before its
time; and the roads, which were difficult before, were
now quite impasqible: in a word, the snow lay in
some places too thick for us to travel ; and being not
hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries, there
was no going without being in danger of being buried
alive every step. We staid no less than twenty days
at Pam eluna; when (seeing the winter coming on.
and noiiiltelihood of its being better, for it was the

. severest winter all over Europe that had been known
in many years) I proposed that we should all go away
to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux,
which was a very little voya e.

But while we were considgering this there came in
four French entlernen, who, having been stopped on
the French side of the passes as we were on the Spa-
nish,had found out a uide, who traversing the coun-
try near the head ofgLanguedoc, had brought them
over the mountains, by such ways, that they were not
much incommoded with the snow; and where they
met with snow in any quantity, they said it was fro-
aen hard enough to hear them and their horses.

We sent for this guide, who told us. he would un-
dertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard
from the snow, provided we were armed sufficiently
to protect us from wild beasts: for he said, upon these

3 great snows it was frequent for some wolves tn, shew

themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made
ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered
with snow. \Ve told him we were well enough pre-
pared for such creatures as they were, if he would
ensure us from a kind of two legged wolves, which we
were told we were in most danger from, especially on
the French side oi the mountains.

Ho satisfied us there was no danger of that kind
in the way that we were to go : so we readily agreed
to follow him ; as did also. twelve other gentlemen,
with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who,
as I said, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.

Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and indeed
I was surprised. when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us, on the same road that
we came from Madrid, above twenty miles; when
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain
country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again,
where the country was pleasant, and no snow to be
seen; but on a sudden, turning, to the left, he ap-
proached the mountain another-way: and thou h it is
true, the hills and the ptecipices looked dreadfu y, yet
he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us
by such \vindingways, we insensibly passed the height
of the mountains without bein much encumbered
with the snow; and all on asud en he showed us the
pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and Gas-
coigne, all green and flourishing; though indeed the
were at a great distance, an we had some roug
way to pass yet.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
it snowed one whole day and a night, so fast, that we
could not travel; but be bid us be easy, we should
soon be past it all : we found, indeed, that we began
to descend every day, and to come more north than
before; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.

It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and notjust in sight.

out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after them u
bear out of the hollow way adjoining to a thick wood.
Two of the wolves flew upon the guide, and had he
been half a mile before us, he had been devoured in-
deed, before we could have helped him ; one of them
fastened upon his horse and the other attacked the
man with that violence, that he had not time, or not
presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but hal-
ooed and cried out to us most lustily. My man Fri-
day being next to me, I bid him ride up, and see
what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in
sight of the man, he hallooed, as loud as the other,
" 0 master! 0 master !" But, like a bold fellow,
rode directly up to the man, and with his pistol shot
the wolf that attacked him in the head.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he having been used to that kind ofcrea-
ture in his country, had no fear upon him but went
close up to him, and shot him as above; whereas any
of us would have fired at a fat lher distance, and have
perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered shoot-
mg the man.

But it was enou h to have terrified a holder man
than I, and indeed It alarmed all our company, when,
with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard on both
sides the dismallest howlings of wolves, and the noise
redoubled by the echo of the mountains, um ll. was
to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of
them : and perhaps indeed there was not such a few,
as that we had no cause of apprehensions.

However, as Friday had killed this wolf. the other,
that had fastened upon the horse, left him immediate-
ly. and fled, having, happily fastened u on his head,
where the hoses of the hndle had stuc in his teeth,
so that he had not done him much hurt: the man. in-
deed, was most hurt : for the raging creature had hit
him twice. once on the arm, and the other time a hula
above his knee ; and he was just as it were tumbling
down by the disorder of the horse, when Friday came
up and shot the wolf.It |'\A\'\'\\'\'vV\M\V\'\.'\-\\'\'\ V\vm~x~\s\s\vvv\'\-\ xxxx--ss-swvsws" MW"

300 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

It is easy to sup se, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all men ed our ace, and rid up as fast as
the way(which was very difficult) would give usluave,
tosee what was the matter. As soon as we came
clear of the trees, which blinded him before, we saw

- ' plainly what had been the case, and how Friday had

disengaged the poor guide; though we did not present.
ly discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.
But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in

El ch a surprising manner, as that which followed be
tween Friday and the bear, which gave us all (thoufih
at first we were surprised and afraid for him) t e
greatest diversion imaginable. As the bear is a heavy,
clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does.
which is swift and light: so he has two particular
ualities, which generally are the rule of his actions:
rst, as to men, who are not his pro er prey, I say
not his proper prey, because though can't say what
excessive hunger might do, which was now their case,
the ground being all covered with snow ; yet as to
men, he does not-usually attempt them, unless they

first attack him ; on the contrary, ifyou meet him In .

the woods. if you don't meddle with him. he won't
meddle with you : yet then you must take care to be
very civil to him. and give him the road: for he is a

very nice gentleman, he won't go a step out of the '

way {or a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your
best way is to look another way, and keep going on ;
for sometimes if you sto .and stand still, and look

steadfastly at him, he ta es it for an ati'ront t and ii _

you throw or toss anv thing at him, audit hits him,
though it were but a hit of stick as big as your finger,
he takes it for an atl'ront. and sets all other business
aside to pursue his revenge ; for he will have satisfac-
tion in point of honour, and this is his first quality ;
the next is, that if he be once afl'ronted, he will never
leave you, night or day. till he has his revenge, but
follow at a good round rate till he overtakes you.
My man Fridayhztd delivered our guide, and when
we came up to him, he was helping him oil' from his

horse; for the man was both hurt and frighted, and
indeed the last more than the first; when on a sud-
den, we espied the bear come out of the wood, and a
very monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever
I saw: we were all a little surprised when we saw
him; but when Friday saw him, it was easy to see
joy and courage in the fellow's countenance: O! O!
0 !" says Friday three times, pointing to him, "0
master! you give me to leave, me shakee te hand
with him, me makes you good laugh."

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased: " You
fool you," said I, he will eat you up."--" Eatee
me up ! eatce me up l'-' says Eriday twice over again;
" me eatee him up ; me make you good lau h; you
all stay here, me shew you act] laug ." '0 down
he sits, and ets his boots 0 in a moment, and ut
on a pair 0 pumps, (as we call the flat shoes trey
wear) and which he had in his pocket, and gives my

' other-servant his horse, and with his gun away he

flew, swift like the wind. .
The hear was walkin softly on, and altered to
meddle with nobody, till riday coming prctt near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understan him
" Hark ye, hark ye," says Friday, " me speakee wit

you." We followed at a distance; for now being .

come down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains,
we were entered a vast great forest, where the coun-
try was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in
it scattered here and there.

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly. and takes up a great stone,
and throws at him, and hit him just on the head;
but did him no more harm than if he had thrown it
against a wall; but it answered Friday's end; {or the
rogue was so void of fear, that he did it purely to
make the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh,
As he called it.

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he

turns about, and comes after him, taking devilish long _

strides. and shuffling along at a strange rate, so as he

would put a horse to a middling gallop. Away runs
Friday, and takes his course, as if he ran towards us
for help; so we all resolved to fire at once upon the
bear, and deliver my man; though I was an at
him heartily for bringing the hear back upon us, w en
he was going about his own business another way;
and especially I was angry that he had turned the bear
upon us, and then run away; and I called out " You
dog," said I, " is this your making us laugh? Come
away, and take your horse, that we may shoot the
creature." He hears me, and cries out, " No shoot,
no shoot, stand still, you get much laugh :" and as the
nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one he
turned on a. sudden, on one side of us, and seeing a

rest oak tree, fit for his purptse, he beckoned us to
%ollow, and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the
tree, laying his gun down upon the mind, at about
five or six yards from the bottom of t e tree.

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed
at a distance. The first thing he did, he stopped at
the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he scrambles
Into the tree, climbing like a cat, though so monstrous
heavy. I was amazed at the folly as I thought it,
of my man, and could not for my life see any thing
to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we
all rode nearer to him.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday <<or
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and fire
bear got about half way to him. As soon as the bear
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, " Ha," says he to us, " now you see me.
teachee the bear dance ;" so he falls a-jumping, and
shaking the bough, at which the bear began to totter,
but stood still. and began to look behind him, to see
how he should et back; then indeed we did laugh
heartily. But riday had not done with him by a
great deal: when he sees him stand still, he calls out
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could
speak English, "What you come no farther? Pray
you come farther." So he left jumping and shaking

the bough ; and the bear, just as if he understood what
he said, did come a little farther; then he fell a-jump-

- mg again, and the bear stopped again.

We thought now was a good time to knock him on
the head and called-to Friday to stand still, and we
would shoot the bear; but e cried out earnestly,
" O pray ! 0 pray! no shoot, me shoot by and then ;"
he would have said by and by. However, to shorten
the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood
so ticklish, that we had laughin enough indeed, but
still could not-imagine what the ellow would do; for
first we thought he depended upon shaking the bear
DE; and we found the bear was too cunning for that
too; for he would not get out far enough to be thrown
down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and
feet. so that we could not imagine what would be the
end of it, and where the jest would be at last.

But Friday puts us out of doubt quickly ; for seein
the bear clinrr fast to the hon h, and that he woulg
not be persuaded to come any arther; " Well, well,"
said Friday, " you no come farther. me go; me go;

on no come to me, me come to you ;" and upon thin
re goes out to the smallest end of the bough, where
it would bend with his weight, and gently lets himself
down by it, sliding down the bough, till he came
near enough to jump doivn on his feet; and away he
ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.

" Well." said I to him, "Friday, what will you
do now? Why don't you shoot him?--" No shoot,"
says Friday, " no yet; me shoot now me no kill;
me stay, give you one more laugh ;" and indeed so
he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear
saw his enemy gone, he come back from tho bough
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking
behind him every ste , and coming backward till he
got into the body 0 the tree; then with the same
hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping
it with his claws, and moving one font at a time,
very leisurely. At this juncture, and 'ust befcre he
could set his 'nind feetupon the ground, riday st; oped

ear, and shot him as dead as a stone.

Then the rogue turned about to see if we did'not
laugh; and when he saw we were pleased ' our
looks. he falls a-laughing himself very loud ; " .0 we
kill bear in my country," says Friday. " So you kill
them ?" said I g " why, you have no guns."----" No."
says he, " no guns, but shoot great much long arrow."

This was. indeed, a good diversion to us; but we
were still in a wild place. and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew: the howling'
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed except
g the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of which
I have said somethingI already, I never heard any
thing that filled mc wit so much horror. .

These things, and the aptproach of night, called m
off, or else, as Friday woul have had us, we should
certainly have taken the skin of this monstrous crea-
ture oil", which was worth saving; but we had three
leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we left
him, and went forward on our journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and
the ravenous creatures,'as we heard afterwards, were
come down into the forest and plain country, pressed
by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a great
deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised
the country--people, killed a great many of their sheep

' and horses, and some people too. '-

We had one dangerous place to pass, of which our
guide told us, if there were any more wolves in the
country, we should find them there; and this was a
small plain, surrounded with woods on every side,
and a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to
pass to get through the wood; and then we should
come to the village where we were to lodge.

It was within halfan hour of sunset, when we en-
tered the first wood; and alittle after sunset, when

, we came into the plain. We met with nothin in the

wood. which was not above two furlon s over, we
saw five great wolves cross the road, In] speed one
after another, as if they had been in chase of some
pre , and had it in view ; they took no notice of us,
an were one and out of sight in a few moments"

Upon t is our guide, who, b the, way, was a
wretched {aim-hearted fellow, be e us keep in a ready
posture ; for he believed there were more wolves
a-commg. .

_ We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through that
a wood which was near half a league, and entered the
plain: as soon as we came into the lain, we had oo-
casion enough to look about us. T we first object we
met with was a dead horse, that is to say a poor horse
' which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of
them at work ; we could'not say eating of him, but
picking of his bones rather; for they had eaten up all
the flesh before.

We did not think [it to disturb them at their feast,
neither did they take much notice of us; Friday Would
have let fly at them, but I would not suffer him by
any means; forI found we were like to have more
business u on ourhands than we were aware of. We '
were not alf gone over the plain, but we began to
hear the wolves howl in the woods, on our left, in a
frightful manner; and presently after we saw about a
hundred coming on directly towards us, all in a body,
and most ofthsm in a line, as regularly as an army
drawn up by experienced officers. 1 scarce knew in l
what manner to receive them ; but found to draw our- ,
selves in a close line' was the only way; so we formed
in a moment ; but, that we might not have too much
interval, I ordered, that only every other man should
fire ; and that the others, who had not fired, should
stand ready to give them a second volley immediate-
ly if they continued to advance u on us ; and that
their those who had fired at first, s ould not prete 'td -
to load their fusils again, but stand ready, with every 5

pair of pistols each man; so we were, by this method,
able to fire six vollies, half of us at a time; however,
It present we had no necessity ; for, upon firing the
first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terri- 5
fied, as well with the noise as with the fire ; four of 5
them being shot in the head, dropped; several others I
were wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could see
by the snow. I found they stopped, but did not im
mediately retreat; whereupon. remembering that
had been told that the fiercest creatures were terrified
3 at the voice of a man, Icaused all our company to
halloo as loud as we could, and I found the notion
not altogether mistaken; for upon our shout, they be-
n to retire, and turn about; then I ordered a second
volley to be tired in their rear, which put them to the
g gallop, and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and
E that we might lose no time, we kept doing; but we
had but little more than loaded our fusils, and put our-
selves into a readiness, when we heard a terrible
noise in the same wood on our left ; only that it~ was
farther onward the same way we were to go. 5
The night was coming-on, and the night began to
no dusky, which made it the worse on our side; but,
the noise increasin , we could easil erceive that it 2
$ wasthe howling an yelling of those he lish creatures ; i
and, on a sudden, we perceived two or three Iron 5 of $
wolves on our left. one behind us.and one on our root, ,- -

g ever, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way
forward, as fast as we could make our horses go,
g which, the way being very rough, was only a good
large trot; and in this manner we only came in view

,' to pass at the farther side of the plain ; but we were
5 greatly surprised, when, coming nearthe lane, or pass,

0F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 80"

rushed a horse, with a saddle and a bridle on him,
flying like the wind, and sixteen or seventeen wolves
after him full speed : indeed the horse had the heels
of them ; but as we supposed that he could not hold
it at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up
with him at last; and no question but they did.

Here we had a most horrible sight ; for, riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found
the carcass of another horse, and of two men devour-
ed by these ravenous creatures, and of one the man
was no doubt the same whom we heard fire a gun,
tor there lay a gun 'ust by him fired ofi'; but as to the
man, his head, an the upper part of his body, were
eaten up.

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what
course to take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for
they gathered about us presently, in hopes of prey ;
and I verily believe there were three hundred of them.
It happened very much to our advantage, that at the
entrance into the wood. but a little way from it, there
lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down
the summer before, and I suppose lay there for car-
riave: I drew my little troop in among these trees,
an placing ourselves in a>> line behind one long tree, I-
advised them all toalighl, and keeping that tree before
us for a breastwork, to stand in a triangle, or three
fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre.

We did so, and it was well we did ; for never was
a more furious charge than the creatutes made upon
us in this place; they came on us with a growling kind
of a noise, and mounted the piece of timber (which, as
I said, was our breastwork, asif they were only rush-
tng upon their prey; and t is fury of theirs, it seems,
was principally occasioned by their seeing our horse!
behind us, which was the prey they aimed at. I or-
dered our men to fire as before. every man; and they
took their aim so sure, that indeed they killed several
of the wolves at the first volley; but there was a ne-
cessity to keep a continual tiring, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those before.

8% LIFE AND ADVENTURES

When we had fired our second volley of fttsils, we
thought they stopped a little, and l hoped they would
have gone oil", but it was but a moment, for others
came forward again; so we fired our vollies of pie-
tols; and I believe in these four firings we killed se-
venteen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as me-
ny; yet they came on again

i was loath to spend our last shot too hastily ; sol
called my servant, not my man Friday, for he was
better employed ; for, with the greatest dexterity ima-
ginable, he charged my fusil and his own, while we
were engaged; but, as I said, I called my other man;
and gviving him a horn of powder, 1 bade him lay a
train all along the piece'cf timber, and let it be a large
train ; he did so, and had but time to get away, when
the wolves came up to it, and some were got up upon
it ; when l, snapping an uncharged pistol close to the
powder, set it on fire ; and those that were upon the
timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of them
fell, or ratherjumped in among us, with the force and
fright of the fire : we dispatched these in an instant,
and the rest were so frighted with the light, which the
night, for now it was very near dark made more tel-
rible, that they drew back a little.

Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a' shout:
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we sallied imme-
diately upon near twenty lame ones, which we found
struggling on the ground, and fell a cuttin them with
our swords which answered our expectation ; for the
crying and howling they made were better understood
by their fellows ; so that they tied and left us.

We had, first and last, killed about three score 0!
them ; and had it been daylight, we had killed many
more. The field of battle bein thus cleared, we made
forward again ; for we had still near a league to go.
We heard the ravenous creatures howl and yell in the
woods as we went, several times; and sometimes we
funeied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eves, we were not certain ; so in about an hour

more we came to the town, where we were to lodge,
which we found in a terrible fright, and all in arms;
for. it seems, that, the night before, the wolves and
some bears had broken into that village, and ut them
in a terrible fri ht; and they were obliget to keep
guard night antlday, but especially in the night, to
preserve their cattle, and indeed their people. .
The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling ofhis two wo rods,
that he could go no farther; so we were obliged to
take a new guide there, and go to Tholouse, where we
found a warm climate,a fruitful leasant country, and
no snow, no wolves, or any thing like them; but
when we told our story at Tholuose, they told us it
was nothing but what was ordinary in the great forest
at the foot of the mountains, especially when the' snow
lay on the ground ; but they inquired much what kind
ofa'guide we had otten, that would venture to bring
us that way in suc I a severe season; and told us, it

told them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in
the middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us
it was fifty to one but we had been all destroyed; for
it was the sight ofthe horsesthat made the wolvesso
furious, seeing their prey: and that at other times they
are really afraid of a gun ; but they being excessive
hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to
come at the horses had made them senseless of dam
ger; and that if we had not by the continued fire, and
at last by the stratagem of the train of power, may
tered them, it had been great odds but that we had
been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen,
they would not have taken the horses somuch fortheir
own, when men were on their backs, as otherwise;
and withal-they told us. that at last, if we had stood
all together, and left our horses, they would have been
so eager to have devoured them, that we might have
come off safe. especially having our fire-arms in our
hands, and being so many in number.

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in
my life; for seeing above three hundred devils come
roaring and o en-mouthed to devour us, and having
nothing to she ter us, or retreat to, I gave myself over
forlost; and as it was,l believe, I shall never care to
cross those mountains again; I think I would much
rather go a thousand leagues by sea, though I were
sure to meet with a storm oncea week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my
passage through France; nothing but what other tra-
vellers have given an account of, with much more ad-
vantage than I can. I travelled from Tholouse to
Paris, and without any considerable stay came to
Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the 14th of Janu-
ary, after having had a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had in a little time all my new--discovered estate safe
about me, the bills of exchange, which I brough'
with me, having been very currently paid.

My principal guide and privy-counsellor was my
good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money
i had sent her, thought no painstoo much, or care too
great, to employ for me; and I trusted her so entirely
with every thing, that l was perfectly easy as to the
security of my effects; and indeed I was very happy
from my beginning, and now to the end, in the un-
spoiled integrity of this good gentlewoman.

And now i began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to
the Brasils, But now another scru 1e came in the
way, and that was religliion; for asl ad entertained
some doubts about the oman religion. oven while i
was abroad, especially in my state or solitude; so I
knew there was no going to the Brasils for me, much

my principles, be a martyr for religion, and die in the
Inquisition: so i resolved to stay at home. and, if I
could find means for it, to dispose on"; plantation
LIFE AND ADVENTURES 3"

To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,
who in return gave me notice, that he could easily
dispose of it there: but that if I thought fit to give
'him leave to offer it in my name to the two mer--
chants, the survivors of my trustees. who lived in the
Brasils, who must fully understand the value of it,
who lived just upon the spot, and who I knew to be
very rich, so that he believed the would be fond of
buying it; he did not doubt, but should make 4 or
6000 pieces of eight the more of it.

Accordingly I avreed, gave him orders to offer it

more, the shi being then returned, he sent me an ac-
count, thntt ey had accepted the offer, and had re-
mitted 83,000 pieces of eight to acorrespondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.

In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to "6%

pieces of eight for the estate; reservinf the ayment
of100 moidores a year, to him (the oh mats during
his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to his son for his
life, which I had remised them; and which the lan-

I have given the first part of a life of fortune and ad-

My true friend the widow eantestly dissuaded me
from it, and so far prevailed with me, that almost for
seven years she prevented my running abroad; dun.
ing which time I took my two nephews, the children
of one ofmy brothers, into my care : the eldest hav-
ing something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman,

and gave him a settlement of some addition to his'

estate, after my decease; the other I put out to a cap-
tain ofa ship; and afler five years, finding him a sen-
sible, hold, enterprising young fellow, I put him into
a good ship, and sent him to see: and this young fel-
low afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to far-
ther adventures myself.

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here : for,
first of all, I married, and that not either to my dis-
advantage or dissatisfaction; and had three children,
two sons and one daughter: but my wife dyinv, at d
my nephew coming home with good success rent a
voyage to Spain, my )nclinatton to go abroad, and his
hnportunity, prevailed, and engaged me to o in his
ship as a private trader to the East Indies. his was
in the year 1694.

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the
island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the whole
story of their lives, and of the villians I left there;
how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards, how they
afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, separated, and
how at last the Spaniards were obliged to use violence
with them; how they were subjected tothe S aniartls;
how honestly the Spaniards used them; an history, If.

accidents as my own part : particularly also as to their
battles with the Carrihbeans, who landed several times
upon the island, and as to the improvement they made
upon the island itself; and how five of them made an
attempt u on the mainland, and brought away eleven
men and ve women prisoners; by which, at my com-
tng, I found about twentv voung children on the island.

file-o I stayed about twenty days ; left them sup-

plies of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,

owder, shot, clothes, tools, and two workmen, which
fbrought from England with me; viz. a carpenter
and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the lands into parts with them,
reserved to myself the preperty of the _whole, but
gave them such parts respectively, as they agreed on;
and, having settled all things with them, and engaged
them not to leave the place, I left them there.

From thence I touched at the Brasils, from whence
I sent a bark, which I bought them, with more peo-
ple. to the island; and in it, besides other supplies,l
sent seven women, being such as I found proper for
service, or for wives to such as would take them. As

to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them.

some women from England, with a good carve ol
necessaries, if they would apply themselves to p ant~
ing; which I afterwards couid norperform : the fel-
lows proved very honest and diligent, after they were
mastered, and had their properties set apart for them.
I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogr,
which, whenl came again, were considerably in~
creased.

But all these things, with an account how three
hundred Carribees came and invaded them, and ruin-
ed their plantations, and how they fought with that
whole number twice, and were at first defeated and
one of them killed ; but at last a storm destroying their
enemies'canoes, they famished or destroyed almost all
the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of
their plantation, and still lived upon the.island :--

ROBINSON oaoson;

__._

THAT homely proverb used on so many occaswns in
England, viz_ " That what is bred in the bone will
not go out of the flesh," was never more verified than
in the story of my Life. Any one would think, that
after thirty-five years affliction, and a variety of un.
happy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever,
went through before, and after near seven years of
peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things ;
grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed me
to have had experience of ever state of middle life,
and to know which was mosta apted to make a man
completely happy ; I say, after all this, any one would
have thought that the native propensity to rambling,
which I gave an account ofin my first setting out into
the world to have been so predominant in my thought,
should be worn out, the volatile art be fully evacu--
ated, or at least condensed, andg might at sixty-one
years of age have been a little inclined to stay at home,
and have done venturing life and fortune any more.

Nay farther, the common motive of forei n adven-
tures was taken away In um; xor I had no ortune to
make, I had nothing to seek : if I had gained ten
thousand pounds, I had been no richer; for I had
already sulficient for me, and for those I had to leave
it to, and lha't I had was visibly increasing; for hav-
ing no great family. I could not spend the income of
what I had. unless I would set up for an expensive
way of living, such as a. great family, servants, equi-
page, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no
notion of, or inclination to; so IhatI had nothing in-
deed to do, but to sit still, and fullyenjoy what! had
got, and see it increase dailv uoon my hands.

4 OF_ ROBINSON CRUSOE.

Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong inclination i had
to go abroad again, which hung abom me like a chro-
nical distemper; particularly the desire of seeing my
new plantation in the island. and the colony I let!
there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it
all night, and my imagination run upon it all day; i
was up ermost in all my thoughts, and m fancy
Worke so steadily and strongly upon it, that talked
of it in my sleep : in short, nOthing could remove i
out of my mind ; it even broke so violently into all
my discourses, that it made my conversation tiresome
for I could talk of nothing else, all my discourse run
into it, oven to impertinence, and l saw it myself.

l have often heard persons of good 'judgment say,
that all the stir people make in the war d about ghosts
and apparitions, is owing to the strength of imagina-
tion, and the powerful operation of fancy in their
minds; that there is no such thing as a s irit appear-
ing, or a ghost walking, and the like ; t at people's
poring affectionately upon the past conversation oi
their deceased friends so realizing it to them, that they
are capable of fanc'ying upon some extraordinary cir--
cumstances that they see them, talk to them, and are
answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing
but shadow and vapour in the thing; and they really
know nothing of the matter.

For my part. I know not to this hour whether there
are any such things as real apparitions. spectres, or
walking of people after they are dead, or whether
there is any thing of the stories they tell us of that
kind, more than the product of vapours, sick minds,
and wandering fancies. But this I know, that my
magination worked up to such a height, and brough
me into such excess of vapours, or what else I may
"all it, that i actually supposed myself oftentimes
upon the spot. at my old castle behind the trees, saw
my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the reprobate
sailor's w tom 1 left upon the island ; "3.), l fancied I
talked with them, and looked at them so steadily,

though I was broad awake, as at persons just before
me; and this I did till I often frightened myself with
the images my fancy represented to me: one time in
my sleep Ihad the villany ol the thtce pirate sailors so
lively related to me, by the firstSpamard and Friday's
father. that it was surprising; they told me how they
barbarousi attempted to murder all the Spaniard
and that 't ey set fire to the provisions they had lai
up, on purpose to distress and starve them ; thin s the
I had never heard of, and that were yet all 0 them
true in fact ; but it was so warm in my imagination,
and so realized to me, that to the hour I_saw them, I
could not be persuaded but that it was or would be
true; also how I resented it when the Spaniard corn-
plained to me, and how I brought them to justice,
tried them before me, and ordered them all three to be
hanged. What there was really in this, shall be seen
in its place; for however I came to form such things
in my dream, and what secret converse of s irits in-
ted it. yet there was, I say. very much 0 it true.
own that this dream had nothing literally and speci-
fically true; but the general part was so true. the base
and villanous behaviour of these three 'hardened
rogues wassuch,and had been so much worse than all
I can describe, that the dream had too much simili--
tude of the fact; and as I would afterwards have
punished them severely, so if I had hanged them all,
had been much in the right, and should have been
justifiable both by the laws of God and man.
But to return to my sto .--In this kind of temper
I had lived some years, I rad no enjoyment of my
life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diverston, but
what had something or other of this in it; so that my

'wrfe, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it, told

me very seriously one night, that she believed there

upon me, which had determined me to go thither
again; and that she found nothing hindered mygoing,

ing with me; but as she was assured, that if she was
dead it would be the first thing I would do; so, as it
seemed to her that the thing was determined above,
she would not be the only obstruction; for if I thought
{it and resolved to go--Herc she found me very in
tent upon her words, and thatl looked very earnestly
at her; so that it a little disordered her, and she stop-
ped. I asked her why she did not go on, and say out
what she was going to say? But I perceived her heart
was too full, and some tears stood in hereyes; " Speak
out, my dear." said I: " are you willingl should 0?"
" No," says she, very affectionately, " I am far rum
willing: hut if you are resolved to 2,0,"_ says she,

" and rather than i will lie the only hindrance, I will .

go with you; for though I think it a preposterous thing
for one of youi years, and in your condition, yet ifit
must he," said she again. weeping, "I won't leave
you; for ifit be of Heaven, you must do it; there is
no resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your duty to
go, he will also make it mine to go with you, or
otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it."
This affectionate behaviour of my wife brought me
a little out of the vapours, and i began to consider
what I was doing; 1 corrpnted my wandering fancy,
and began to argue with myself sedalely, what busi--
ness 1 had, after threescore years, and after such a life
of tetlious'sufl'eriug and disasters, and closed in so
happy and easy a. manner, l say, what business had I
to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adven'
lures, fit only for youth and poverty to run into?
With those thoughts, l considered my new engage-
ment; that I had a wife, one child horn, and my wife
then great with child of another; that 1 had all the
world could give me, and had no need to seek hazards
for in; that l was declining in years, and ought to
thin rather of leaving what i had gained, than of
seeking to increase it; that as to what my wife had
said, of its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it
should be my duty to go, 1 had no notion of that; so
after many of these cogitations, I struggled with the

power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of tt,
as I believe people may always do in like cases,
if they will; and, in a word, 1 conquered it: com-
posed myself with such arguments as occurred to my
thoughts, and which my present condition fumishe\
me plentit'ully with; anti particularly, as the mos'
effectual method, I resolved to divert myself with
other things, and to engage in some business that might
elfectually tie the up from any more excursions of this
kind; for I found the thing return upon me chiefly
when l was idle, had nothing to do, or any thing 0:
moment immediately before me.

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the count}
of'Bedford. and resolved to remove myself thither. l
had a little convenient house upon it, and the lane
about it I found was capable of great improvement,
and that it was many ways suited to my inclination,
which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting,
and improving of land; and particularly, being an
inland country, I was removed from conversing
among ships, sailors, and things relating to the remote
part of the world. .

in a word, I went down to my farm, settled my
family, bought me ploughs, barrows. a cart, waggon,
horses, cows, sheep; and setting seriously to work,
became in one half year a mere country gentleman;
my thoughts were entirely taken up itt managing my
servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, plantiu ,
&c.; and l lived,asl thought, the most agreeable li%e
that nature was capable of directing, or that a man
always bred to misfortunes was capable of being to
treated to.

l farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to pay,
was limited by no articles; I could pull up or cut
down as I pleased; what I planted was for myself,
and what 1 improved. was fortny family; and having
thus left off the thoughts ofwande'ring. I had not the
least discomfort in any part of my life. as to this

8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

commended to me, a kind of heavenly life, somethi
like what is described by the poet upon the subjectg
a country life:

Free from vices, free from care,

Age has no pains, and youth no snare.

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from
unforeseen Providence unhiuged me at once; and no
only made a breach upon me, inevitably and incurable
but drove me. by its consequence, upon a deep relaps
into the wandering disposition , which, as I may say
being born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold
of me. and, like the returns of a violent distemper,
mine on with an irresistible force upon me; so that
nothing could make any more impression upon me.
This blow was the loss of my wife.

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon
my wife. to give a character of her particular virtues,
and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a
funeral sermon. She was, in a few words, the stay of
all my affairs, the centre of all my enterprises, the en-
gine that by her prudence reduced me to that happy
compass i was in, from the most extravagant and
ruinous project that fluttered in my head as above;
and did more to guide my rambling geuuis, than a
mother's tears, a father's instructions, a friend's coun.
rel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. lwas
happy in listening to her tears, and in being moved
by her entreatios, and to the last degree desolate and
dislocated in the world by the loss of her

When she was gone the world looked awkwardly
round me, l was as much a stranger in it in my
thoughts as I was in the Brasils when I went first on
shore there; and as much alone, except as to the assist
ance of servants, as l was in my island. I knew neiv
ther what to do, or what not to do; 1 saw the world
busy round me, one part labouring for bread, and the
other'part squandering in vile excess or empty plea-

their strength in daily strugglings for bread to main

a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only

This put me in mind of the life Ilived in my king>>

goats, because I had no more use for them ; where the

But my sage counsellor was gone, I was like a ship

was the most my aversion. who had been all my days
used to an active life; and I would often say tomyself,
" A state of idleness is the very drags of life ;" and
indeed I thoughtl was much more suitably employed
when l was twenty-six days making a deal board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when
my nephew, whom, as l have observed before, I had
brought up to the sea. and had made him commander
of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to
Bilboa, being the first he had made; he came to me,
and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance
had been pro osing to him to go a voyage for them to
the East In ies and to China, as private traders ;
" And now, uncle," says he, " if you will go to sea
with me, I'll engage to land you upon your old habi-
tation in the island, for we are to touch at theBrasils."

Nothin can be a greater demonstration of a future
state, an of the existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second causes with the ideas of
things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserv-
ed. and not communicated to any in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper o!
wandering was returned upon me, and Iknew nothing
of what herhad in his thoughts to say, when that very
morning, before he came to me, I had, in a great deal
of confusion of thought, and revolving every part 0!
my circumstances in my mind,come to this resolution,
viz. that i would go to Lisbon and consult with in
old sea-captain ; and so, if it was rational and practi-
cable, I would go and see the island again, and see
what was become of my people there. I had pleased
myself also with the tho'uohts of peopling the place,
and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a patent
forthe possession, and I know not what; when in the
middle of all this. in comes my nephew, as I have
said, with his project of carrying me thither, in his
way to the East Indies.

l aused awhile at his words. and looking steadily
at him, " What devil," said 1. " sent you of this un.
lucky errand ?'_' My nephew startled, as if he had bneo

lrighted at first ; but perceiving I was not much dis-
)leased with the proposal, he recovered himself. " I
ope it may not he an unlucky proposal, Sir," says he ;
-' [dare say you would be pleased to see your new co-
lony there, where you once reigned with more felicity
than most of your brother-monarchs in the world."

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my tem-
per, that is to say, with the prepossession I was under.
and of which I have said somuch, that] told him, in
a few words, if he agreed with the merchantsl would
go with him : but I told him I would not promise to
go an , farther than my own island. " Why, sir,"
says e, "an don't want to be left there again,l
hope ?"----" by," said I, " can you not take me up
again in your return ?" He told me, it could not be
possible that the merchants would allow him to come
that way with a loaden ship of such value, it being
a month's sail out ofhis way, and might be three or
four: " Besides, Sir, if I should miscarry," said he,
" and not return atall, then you would bejust reduced
to the condition you were in before."

This was very rational ; but we both found out a
remedy for it, which was to carry a framed sloop on
board the ship, which being taken in pieces and ship-
ped on hoard the ship, might, by the help of some
carpenters,whom we agreed to carry with us, be set
up again in the island, and finished fit to go to sea in
a few days.

I was not long resolving; for indeed the importu
nities of my nephew joined in so effectually with my
inclination, that nothing could o pose me: on the
other hand, my wife being dead. had nobody com
corned themselves so much for me, as to persuade-me
one way or other, except my ancient good friend the
widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider
my years, my easy circumstances, and the needlesn
hazard of a long voyage; and, above all, my young
children : but it was to no purpose ; I had an irre-

sistible desire to the voyage; and I told her i thought

- In order to thisl made my will, and settled the

" estateI had in such a manner for my children, and
placed in such hands, that I was perfectly easy and
satisfied they would have justice done them, whatever
might befal me; and for their education, I left it
wholly to my widow, with a suflicient maintenance tn
herself for her care : all which she richly deserved ;
for no mother could have taken more care in their
education, or understood it better; and as she lived
till i came home, I also lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning
of January 1694-5, and l with my man Friday went
on board in the Downs the 8th, having, besides that
sloop which i mentioned above, a very considerable

cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony,
which if I did not find in good condition, I resolved
to leave so.
First, I carried with me some servants, whom I
purposed to place there as inhabitants. or at least to
set on work there u on my own account while I
stayed, and either to cave them there, or carry them
forward as they should appear willing; particularly,
1 carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy,
ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, but was
also a general mechanic; for he was dexterous at
making wheels, and hand-mills to grind corn, was a
good turner, and a good potmaker; he also made any
thing that was proper to make of earth, or of wood ;
in a word, we called him our Jack of all Trades.
With these 1 carried a tailor, who had ofi'ered him-

self to go passenger to the East Indies with my no:
phnw, but afterwards consented to stay on our new
plantation, and proved a most necessary handy fellow

as could be desired, in many other busmesses besides
that of this trade ; for as I observed formerly, necei
8in arms us for allemployments.

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not
kept an account of the particulars, consisted of a suffr-
eient quantity of linen, and some thin English stutl's
for clothin the Spaniards that I expected to find there,
and enoug of them as by my calculation might com-
fortably supply them for seven years : if I remember
right, the materials which I carried for clothing them,
With gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things
as they could want for wearing, amounted to above
two hundred ounds, including some beds, beddin
and househol -stufi', particularly kitchen utensils,wit
pots. kettles, pewter, brass, doc. besides near a hun-
dred pounds more in iorn-work, nails, tools of every
kind, staples. hooks, hinges, and every necessary
things I could think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and
fuzees, besides some pistols, a considerable quantity
of shot of all sizes, three or four tons of lead, and two
pieces of brass cannon ; and because I knew not what
time and what extremities l was providing for, I car-
ried an hundred barrels of owder, hesides swords,
cutlasses,and the iron part 0 some pikes and halberts;
so that, in short, we had alargc magazine of all sorts
of stores; and I made my nephew carry uvo small
quartendeek guns more 1 an he wanted for his ship
to leave behind if there was occasion: that when they
name there we might build a fort, and man it against

ll sorts of enemies: and indeed I at first thought
fliers would he need enough of it all, and much more,
if we ho ed to maintain our possession of the island.
as shall seen in the course of the story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had
been used to meet with: and therefore shall have the
less occasion to interrupt the reader, who perhaps may
be impatient to hear how matters went with my oo-
lony ; yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and bad
weather happened on this first setting out.which made

the voyage longer than I expected it at first; and L
who had never made but one voyage, viz. my first
voyage ro Guinea, in which I might be said to come
back again as the voyage was at first designed. began
to think the same ill fate still attended me; and that]
was born to he never contented with being on shore,
and yet to be always unfortunate at sea. '

Contrary winds first put us to the northward. and
we were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland,
where we lay wind bound two-and-thirty days; but
we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that provi-
sions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost
plenty; so that while we lay here we never touched
the ship's stores, but rather added to them: here also
I took several hogs, and two cows with their calves,
which I resolved, if I had agood passage, to ut on
shore in my island; but we found occasion to ispose
otherwise of them. ,

We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and
had a very fair gale of wind for some days; as I re-
member. it might be about the 20th of February, in
the eveni late, when the mate having the watch,
came into t e round-house, and told us he saw a flask
of fire and heard a gun fired; and while he was tell-
mg us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain
heard another. This made us all run out upon the
quafter-deck, where for a while we heard nothing, but
in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and found
that there was some very terrible fire at a distance.
Immediately we had recourse to our reckonin s. in
which we all agreed that there could be no lan that
way' in which the fire shewed itself, no, not for five
hundred leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W. Upon
this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea;
and as by our hearing the noise of guns just before,
we concluded it. could not be far off, we stood directly
towards it, and were presently satisfied we should die-
cover it, because the farther we sailed the greaterthe
light appeared, though the weather being hazy we
could not perceive any thing but the light for a while.

0F ROBINSON (JRUSUE. la

In about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair
for us, though not nmch or it, and weather clearing
up a little, we could plainly discern that it was a
great ship on fire in the middle of the sea. _ ,

l was most sensibly touched with this disaster,
though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged
in it ; l presently recollected my former circum-
stances, in what condition I was in when taken up
by the Portugal captain ; and how much more deplo-
table the circumstances of the poor creatures belong-
ing to this ship must be ifthey had no other ship in
company with them : upon this I immediately ordered
that live guns should be fired, one soon after another,
that, if possible, we might give notice to them that
there was help for them at hand, and that they might
endeavour to save themselves in their boat; for though
we could see the flame in the ship, yet they, it being
night, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving."
the burning ship drove, waiting for daylight; w en
on a sudden. to our great terror, though we had rea-
son to expect it. the ship blew up in the air, and im-
mediately sunk. This was terrible, and indeed an
afiiicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who. I
concluded, must be either all destroyed in the shi
or be in the utmost distress in their boats in the mi -
die of the ocean, which, at present, by reason it was
dark, I could not see; however, to direct them as
well as I could, l caused lights to be hung out in all
the parts of the ship where we could, and which we,
had lanterns for. and kept firing guns all the night
long; letting them know by this, that there wasa
ehi not far off.

bout eight o'clock inthe morning we discovered
file ship's boat, by the help of our perspective-glass;
and found there were two of them, both thronged
with people, and deep in the water; we perceived
they rowed, the wind being against them; that they
saw our ship, and did the utmost to make us see them.

know we saw them; and hung a waft out, as a signal
[or them to come on hoard; and then made more
sail, standing directly to them. In a little more than
haifmi hour we came up with them, and in a word
took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men,
women and children; for there were a great many
pa'ssengers.

Upon the whole, we found it was a French mo,
chant-ship of three hundred tons, honieward-hountl
from Quebec. in the river of Canada. The masts
gave us along account oi the distress of his ship, how
the tire began in the steer-age by the negligence of the
steersrnan; but, on his crying out for help, was, as
every body thought, entirely at out: but they soon
found that some sparks of t e fire had gotten into
some part of the ship, so difiicult tocome at, that
they could not effectually quench it: and afterwards
getting in between the timbers, and within the ceili
of the ship, it proceeded into the hold, and masters:
all the skill and all the application they were able to
exert.

They had no more to do then but to get into their
boats, which, to their great comfort, were pretty
large; being their long-boat, and a great shallop, be-
sides a small skiff, which was of no great eemce to
them, other than to get some fresh water and provi-
sions into her, after they new secured themselves from
the fire.. They had indeed small hope of their live:
by etting into these boats at that distance from any
lang; only, as they said well, that they were esca ed
from the fire, and had a possibility, that some ip
might happen to be at sea, and might take them in
They had sails, oars, and a compass ; and were pro

aring to make the best of their way to Newfound-
fitnd, the wind .blowing pretty fair; for it blew an
easy gale at S. E. by E. They had as much provisions
and water, as, with sparing it so as to be next door
to starving. might support them about twelve days;
in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary
winds, the captain saith: hoped he might get to the
banks nf Newfoundland, and might perhaps take Some
fish to sustain them till they might go on shore. But
there were so many chances against them in all these
cases; such as stems to overset and founder them;
rains and cold to benumb and perish their limbs; con-
trary winds to keep them out and starve them; that
it must have been next to miraculous if they had
escaped.

In the mids of their conSultations, every one being
hopeless, and ready to despair. the captain with tears
in is eyes told me, they were on a sudden surprised
with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four
more; these were the five guns which I caused to be
fired at first seeing the light: this revived their hearts,
and gave them the notice which, as above, ldesigned
it should, viz. that there was a ship at hand for their

e .

1': was upon the hearing these guns, that they took
down their masts and sails; and the sound coming
from the windward they resolved to lie by till morn-
ing. Some time after this, hearing no more guns,

they fired three muskets, one a considerable while

after another; but these, the wind being contrary, we
never heard.

Some time after that again. they were still more
agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and heat-
ing the guns. which, as l have said, Icaused to be
fired all the rest of the night: this set them to work
with their oars to keep their boats ahead, at least that
we might the sooner come up with them ; and at last1
to their inexpressiblc joy, they found we saw them.

it is impossible for me to express the several ges-
tures, the strange ccstacios, the variety of postures,
which these poor delivered people run into. to express
the joy oflheir souls at so unexpected a deliverance;
grief and fear are easily described ; sighs, tears. groans,
and a very few motions of head and hands, make up
the sum of its variety . but an excess ofjoy. a surprise

as if they had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow,
some stark raving and downright lunatic; some ran
about the ship stamping with their feet, others wring-
ing their hands; some were dancing, several singing,
some laughing. more crying ; many quite dumb, not
able to speak a word; others sick and vomiting, se-
veral swooning and ready to faint; and a few were
crossing them and giving God thanks.

l would not wrong them neither; there might be
many that were thankful aftemard; [ml the passion
was too strong for them at first and they were uot able
to master it ; they were thrown into ecslasies and a
kind of frenzy. and so there was but avery few who
were composed and serious in their joy.

Perhaps also the case may have some addition to
it, from the particular circumstance of the nation they
helonfed to ; I mean the French, whose temper is al-
lnwe to he more volatile, more passionate, and more
sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than of other
nations. 1 am not philosopher to determine the cause,
but nothing i had ever seen before came up to it: the
eestasies poor Friday, my trusty savage, was in, when
he found his father in the boat. came the nearest to
it -, and the surprise of the master, and his two com-
panions, whom I delivered from the two villains that
set them on shore in the island, came a little way to-
wards it ; but nothing was to compare to this, either
that I saw in Friday. or any where else in mylife.

it is farther observable. that these extravagance:
did not shew themselves in that different manner I
have mentioned. in difl'crentpersons only; but all the
variety would appear in a. short succession of mo.
merits, in one and the same person. A man that-we
saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and
confounded. should the next minute be dancing and
hallooing like an antic ; and the nextmoment a-tearing
his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamp-
ing them under his feel like a madman; a few minutes
after that, we should have him all in tears, then sick,
then swooning; and had no. immediate help been

and thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twen-

ty, but with the greatest part of them ; and, if I remem- .

her right, our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty
of them blood.

There were two priests among them, one an old
man and the other a young man ; and that which
was strangest was, that the oldest man was the worst.

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and
saw himself safe, he dropped dowu stone dead, to all
appearance; not the least sign of life could be per-
ceived in him ; our surgeon immediately applied pro-
per remedies to recoverhim ; and was the only man in
the ship that believed he was not dead; and at length
he opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and
rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possi-
ble: upon this the blood which only dropped at first.
flowed something freely; in three minutes after the
man opened his eyes; and about aquarter of an hour
after that he s kc, grew better, and, in a little time.
quite well; a ter the blood was stopped he walked
about, told us he was perfectly well, took a dram oi
cordial which the surgeon ave him, and was, what
we called, come to himsel ; about a quarter of an
hour after this they came runninfirinto the cabin to
the surgeon, who was bleeding a ranch woman that
had fainted, and told him the priest was one stark
mad. It seems he had begun to revolve tie change
of his circumstances in his mind, and this put him into
an ecstasy of joy: his spirits whirled about faster
than the vessels could convey them ; the blood rew
hot and feverish rand the man was as fit for Be lam
as any creature that ever was in it ; the surgeon would
not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him
something, to doze and put him to sleep, which, after
some time, operated upon him, and he walked next
morning perfectly composed and well.

gatices among our new gueSts for the first day ; but
when they had been retired, lodgings provided for
them as well as our ship would allow, and they had
slept heartily, as most of them did, being fatigued and
frightened, they were quize another sort of peopln
the next day.

Nothing of good manners, er civil acknowledg-
ments for the kindness shewn them, was wanting; the
French, it is known are naturally, apt enough to e>>
ceed that Way. The captain and one of the riests
came to me the next day , and desiring to spea with
me and my nephew, the commander began to consult
with us what should he done with them ; and first
they told us, that as we had saved their lives, so all
they had was little enough for 'a return to us for the
kindness received. The captain said, they had saved
some money, and some things of value in their boat
catched hastily out of the flames; and if we woul
accept it, they were ordered to make an offer of it
all to us; they only desired to he set on shore some-
where in our way, where, if possible, they might get
a fissage to France.

y nephew was for accepting their money at first
word, and to consider what to do with them aftert-
wards ; but I overruled him in that part; for I knew
what it was to be Set on shore in a strange ccuntry 3
and ifthe Portugal captain that took me up'at sea. had
served me so, and took all I had for my deliverance.
I must have starved, or have been as much a slave at
the Brasils asl had been at Barbary. the being sold
to a Mahnmetan only excepted ; and perhaps a Por-
tuguese is not a much better master than a 'I'urk, i!
not, in some cases, a much worse.

Itherel'ore told the French captain that we had
taken them up in their distress, it was true ; but that
it was our duty to do so, as we were fellow creatures,
Ind as we would desire to he so delivered. it we were

In ours; but that we took them up to serve them, not
to plunder them; and that it would be a most barba-
rous things. to take that little from them which they

had saved out of the tire, and then set them on shore,

and leave them ; that this would be first to save them
from death and then kill them ourselves; save them
from drowning and then abandon them to starving ;
and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken
fratn them : as to setting them on shore, I told them
Indeed that was an exceeding difficulty to us, for that
the ship was bound to the East Indies; and though
we were driven out of our course to the westward a
very great way, which perhaps was directed by Heaven
on purpose for their deliverance, yet it was impossible
for us willingly to change our voyage on this parti-
cular account; not coul my nephew, the captain,
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under
charter-patty to pursue his voyage by the way of Bra-
oil; and all l knew he could do for them was, to put
ourselves in the way of meeting with other ship:
hotneward-bound from the West-Indies, and get them
passage, if possible, to England or France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and
kind, they could not but be very thankful for it; but
they were in a great consternation, especially the as-
sengers, at the notion of being carried away tothe ast
Indies; they then entreated me, that seeing I was
driven so far to the westward before I met with them,
I would at least keep on the same course to the banks
of Newfoundland, where it was possiblel might meet
with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry
them back to Canada, from whence they came. '

I thou ht this but a reasonable request on their
part. an therefore I inclined to agree to it ; for in-
deed ] considered, that to carry this whole company
to the East Indies would not only be an intolerable
severity to the poor peeple, but would be ruining our
whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I
thought it no breach ofcharter-party, but what an un-
foreseen accident made absolutely necessary to us;

and in which not one could say we were to blame?
for the laws of God and nature would have forbidb
that we should refuse to take up two boats full of peo-
ple in such a distressed condition; and the nature of
the thing. as well respecting ourselves as the poor
people, obliged us to see them on shore some where or
other, for their deliverance; so Iconsented that we
would carry them to Newfoundland, ifwind and weap
ther would permit; and, if not, that I would carry
them to Martinico in the West Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather
pretty good; and as it had blowed continually in the
points between N. E. and S. E. a long time, we missed
several opportunites of sending them to France; for
we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two

_were French, from St. Christopher's; but they had

been so long beating up against the wind, that they
durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting prow--
sions for the voyage. as well for themselves as for
those they should take in; so we were obliged to go
on. It was about a week after this, that we made
the banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my
story, we put all our French people on board a bark,
which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore,
and afterwards to carry them to France, if they could
get provisions to victual themselves with: when, I
say, all the French went on shore, I should remember
that the young priest [spoke of, hearing we were
bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage
with us, and to be set on share on the coast of Coro-
mandel: I readily agreed to that; for l wonderfully
liked the man, and had ve good reason, as will ap
pear afterwards; also fouro the seamen entered them-
wlves in our ship, and proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West
Indies, steering away S. and S, by E. for about twent
days together, sometimes little or no wind at al ,
when we met with another subject for our humanity
to work upon, almost as de lorable as that before.

sail. our course S. E. and by S. We 'soon perceived
it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us; but
eduld not at first know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she. had lost her
main-topmast, foremast, and bowsprit; and presently
she fires a gun as a sifnal of distress. The weather
was pretty good, win at N. N W. a fresh gate, and
we soon came to speak with her.

We found her a ship of Bristol bound home from
Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the road at Bar-
badoes, a few days before she was ready to sail by a
terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate
were both gone on shore; so that beside the terror of
the storm, they were but in an indifferent case for
. good artists to bring the ship home; they had been al
ready nine weeks at sea, and had met with another
terrible storm after the hurricane was over, which had
) blown them quite out of their knowledge to the west-

ward, and in which they had lost their mast., a:

thinking the ship was ready to sail, nnlmppily came
on board the evening before the hurricane hogan ; and,
having no )rovisions of their own left; they were in
a more deplorable, condition than the rest : for the sea-
men. being reduced to such anextreme necessity them-
selves, had no compassion, we may he sure, for the
poor passengers; and they were indeed in a condition
that t eir misery is very hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity
had not led me, the weather being fair, and the wind
abated, to go on board the ship; the second mate,
who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had
been on board our ship; and he told me indeed,,that
they had three passengers in the great cabin, that they
were in a deplorable condition; " Nay," says he,
" I believe they are dead, for l have heard nothing of
them for above two days; and l was afraid to inquire
after them," said he, " for Ihad nothing to relievp
them with."

We immediately applied ourselves to give them
what relief we could spare; and indeed I had so far
overruled things with my nephew, that I would have
victualled them, though we had gone away to Virginia,
.trany part of the coast of America, to have supplied
.mrselves; but there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger, for they were
afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave
them. The mate or commander brought six men
with him in his boat, but these poor wretches looked
like skeletons, and were so weak they could hardl

jit to their oars; the mate himself was very ill, an

half-starved, for he declared he had reserved nothin
from the men. and went share and share alike w'
them in every bit they ate.

1 cautioned hint to eat sparingly, but set meat bo-
thre him immediately, and he had not eaten three
mouthfuls before he be an to be sick, and out 0!

him up something with some broth, which he said

n

gI'he sight of these people's distress was very mov-
ing to me, and brought to mind what i had a terrible
prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island,
where I had not the least mouthful of food, or any
hopes of procuring it : besides the hourly apprehen-
sinn l had of being made the food of other creatures.
But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the
miserable condition of the ship's company, I could
not put out of my thought the story he had told me of
the three poor creatures in the great cabin ; viz. the
mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had
heard nothing of for two or three days; and whom
he seemed to confess they had wholly neglected, their
own extremities being so great ; by which I under.
stood, that they had really given them no food at all;
and that therefore they must he perished, and be all
lying (lead perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called
captain, on board with his men to refresh them, so I
also forgot not the stan'ing crew that were left on
board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the
ship. and with my mate and twelve men to carry them
a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to
boil. Our surgeon eharged the men to cause the meat
to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in
the cook--room, to prevent the men's taking it to eat
raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was well
boiled. and then to give every man but a little at a
lime ; and by this caution he preserved the men, who
would otherwise have killed themselves with that very

At the some tune I ordered the mate to go into the
greatcabin and see what condition the poor passen-
gers were in, and. if they were alive, to comfort them
and give them what refreshment was proper; and the
surgeon gave him alarge pitcher with some of the
prepared broth which he had given the male that was
on board, and which he did not question would re~
store them gradually.

I was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said above,

5 having a great mind to see the scene of misery, which
I knew the ship itself would present me'with, in a
more lively manner than I could have it by report, I
took the captain of the ship, as we now called him,
with me, and went myself a little after in their boat.

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult
to get the victuals out of the boiler before it was
ready ; but my mate observed his order, and kept a
good guard at the cookvroom door; and the man he
place Ithereafter usin'gfall possible persuasion to have
patience, kept them a by force: however, he caused
some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot, and soften-
ed them with the liquor of the meat, which they call
brewis, and gave every one nne,to stay their stomachs;
and told them it was for their own safety that he was
obliged to give them but little ata time. But it was

all in vain, and had I not come on board, and their g

own commander and officers with me, and with good
words and some threats also of giving them no more,
I believe they would have broke into the cook-room
by force, and tom the meat out of the furnace; for
words indeed are of a very small force to an hungry
belly: however, we pacified them, and fed them gra
dually and cautiously for the first time, and the next
time gave them more, and at last filled their bellies,
and the men did well enough.

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin
was of another nature, and far beyond the rest ; for

as, first, the ship's company had so little for them
selves, it was but too true, that they had at first kept
them very low, and at last totally neglected them; so
that for six or seven days, it might be said, they had
really had no food at all, and for several days before,
very little.

The poor mother, who, as the mate first reported,
was a woman of good sense and good breeding, had
spared all she could get so aflectiunately for her son,
that at last she entirely sunk under it : and when the
mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the floor or
deck, with her back up against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk in
between her shoulders, like a corpse, though no: uite
dead. My mate said all he could to revive an en-
courage her, and with a spoon put some broth into her
mouth ; she opened her lips, and lifted up one hand,
but could not speak; yet site understood what he said,
and made signs to him,intimating, that it was too late
for her ; and pointing to her child, as if she would
have said, they should take care of him.

However, the mate. who was exceedingly moved
with the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth
lnto her mouth ; and, as he said, got two or three
spoonfuls down, though I question whether he could
be sure ofit or not ; but it was too late, and she died
the same night.

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his
most affectionate mother's life, was not so far gone:
yet he lay in a cabin-bed as one stretched out, with

ardly any life left in him ; he had a piece of an old

love in his mouth, huvitw eaten up the rest of it;

owever, being young, and having more strength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat,
and he began sensibly to revive, though, by giving him
some time after but two or three 5 oont'uls extraordi-
nary, he was very sick, and broug it it up again.

But. the next care was the poor maid ; she lay all
along upon the deck hard by her mistress, and jus
like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy, and

mo led for life ; her limbs were distorted, one of
her rands was clasped round the frame of one chair,
and she griped it so hard, that we could not easil
make her let it go ; her other arm lay over her bee.
and her feet lay both together, set fast against the
frame of the cabin table ; in short, she lay just like
one .in the last agonies of death ; and yet she was
alive too.

The cor creature was not only starved with hun-
ger, ant terrilied with the thoughts of death, but, as
the men told us afterwards, was broken-hearted for
her mistress, whom she saw dying two or three days
oefore, and whom she loved most tenderly.

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for
when our surgeon, who was a man of very great
knowledge and ex perience,and with great application
recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hand as
to her senses. for she waslittle less than distracted for
a considerable time after; as shall appear presently.

Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be
desired to consider, that visits at sea are not like a
journey into the country, w here sometimes people stay
a week or a fortnight at a. place. Our business was
to relieve this distrssed ship's crew, but not lie by for
them ; and though they were willing to steer the same
course with us lbr some days, yet we could carry no
sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts; how-
ever, as their contain begged of us to help him to set
up a. main-topmast, and a kind of topmost to hisjury-

had lost his father but a few months before at Barba-
does He bear ed of the surgeon to speak to me, to
take him out o the ship; for he said, the cruel fellow:
had murdered his mother; and indeed so they had,
that is to say, passively; for they might have spared a
small sustenance to the poor helpless widow, that
might have preserved her life, though it had beenjust
to keep her alive. But hunger knows no friend, no
relation. nojustice, no right; and therefore is remorse>>
less, and capable of no compassion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and
how it would carry him away from all his friends, and
put him perhaps in as bad circumstances, almost, as
we found them in; that is to say. starving inthe
world. He said he mattered not whither he went, if
he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he
was among: that the captain (by which he meant me,
for he could know nothing of my nephew) had saved
his 'life, and he wassure would not hurt him; and as
for the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she
would be very thankful for it, let us carry them whi-
ther'we would. The surgeon represented the case so
affectionately to me. that 1 yielded, and we took them
both on board with all their goods, except eleven hogs-
heads of sugar, which could not be retrieved, or come
at; and as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I
made his commander sign a writing, ohliging him to
go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers,
a merchant there. to whom the youth said he was
related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him,
and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased
widow ; which I suppose was not done ; for I could
never learn that the ship came to Bristol ; but was. as
is most probable. lost at sea, being in so disabled a

might founder at sea ; for she was I 'aky, and had

' shortening my story for the sake of what is to follow,
shall, observe that I came to my old habitation, the
island, on the mm of April, 1695. it was with no
small difficulty that I found the place ; foras I came
to it, and went from it before, on the south and east
side of the island. as coming from the Brazils; so now

or no.

We heat about a great while, and went on shore on
several islands in the mouth of the great river Oroo-
loque, but none for my purpose : only this I learnt
b y my coasting the shore, that I was under one great
mistake before, viz. that the continent which I thought
I saw from the island I lived in, was really no conti-
Ient. but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands
reaching from one to the other side of the extended
mouth of that great river ; and that the savages who

" What is the matter. Friday? said I ; " are you

caused the English ancient to be spread, and fired

'hAngIng out a white flag, or a flag of truce, I went

direetly on shore, taking with me the young friar I
mentioned, to whom 1 had told the whole story of my
livmg there, and the manner of it, and every particu-
lar hoth of myself and those that l left there, and who
was on that account extremely desirous to go with me.
We had besides about sixteen men very well armed,
if we had found any new guest there which we did
not know of ; but we had no need of weapons.

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood near
high water, we rowed directly into the creek; and the
first man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard whoa
life I had saved, and whom I knew by his face per-
fcely well ; as to his habit, i shall describe it after--
wards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first but
myself; but theie was no keeping Frida in the boat;
for the affectionate creature tad spied is father ata
distance, a good way ofl' of the Spaniards, where in-
deed [saw nothing of him 3 and if the had not let
him go on shore he would have jum e into the sea.
He was no sooner on shore, but he ew away to his
father like an arrow out of a. bow. It would have
made any man shed tears in spite of the firmest reso-
lutionI to have seen the first trans arts of this poor
fellow's joy, when he came to his ather; how he em-
braced him, kissed him,stroked his face, took him up
in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and lay down
by him; then stood and looked at him as any one
would look at a strange picture for a. quarter of an
hour together ; then lay down upon the ground, and
stroked his legs, and kissed them, and then got up
again, and stared at him; one would have though the
fellow hewitehed : but it would have made a dog
laugh to see how the next day his passion run out an-
other way : in the morning he walked along the shore,
to and again, with his father, several hours, always
leading him by the hand, as if he had been a lady;
and every now and then would come to fetch some

thing or other for him from the boat either a lump 0!
Von. ll.-- '
sugar, or dram, a biscuit, or something or other that
was good. in the afternoon his frolics ran another
way, for then he would set the old man down upon
the ground, and dance about him, and made a thou-
san antic postures and gestures, and all the while he
did this he would be talking to him, and telling him
one story or another of his travels, and of what had
happened to him abroad, to divert him. in short, it
the same filial affection was to be found in Christians
to their parents in our parts of the world, one would
be tempted to say there hardly would have been any
need of the fifth commandment.

Bnt this is a digression; I return to my landing. It
would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies
and eivilities that the Spaniards received me with.
The first Spaniard whom, as I said, I knew very well,
was he whose life I saved: he came towards the boat
attended by one more, carrying a fla of truce also:
and he did not only know me at rst, but he had
no thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was coma

something in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear,

inexcusible not to know that face again that he had

his life: he said abundance of veiy handsome things,
as a well-bred Spaniard always knows how ; and then

made them could find.

I asked them, what put them upon all these fortifi-

some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard
thatl was gone in a good ship, and to my satisfaction;

36 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

While I wassayin this came the man whom he had
sent back, and wi 1 him eleven men more: in the
dress they were in, it was impossible to guess what
nation they were of ; but he made all clear both to
them and to me. Frst he turned to me, and pointing
to them, said, " These Sir, are some of the gentleh
men who owe their lives to you ;" and then turning
to them, and pointing to me, he let them know who
I was; upon which they all came up one b one, not
as if they had been sailors, and ordinary fe lows,- and
I the like, but really as if they had been ambassadors
or noblemen, and I a monarch or a great conqeror:
their behaviour was to the last degree obltging and
courteous, and yet mixed with a manly majestic gra--
vity, which very well became them; and, in short,
they had so much more manners than I, that I scarce
knew how to receive their civilities, much less how to
return them in kind. '

The history of their coming to, and conduct in the
island after my going away, is so remarkable, and bat
an many incidents, which the former part of my rela-
tion will help to understand, and which will, in most
of the particulars, refer to that account I have already
given, that I cannot but commit them with great de-
light to the reading of those that come after me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in
the first person, which will put me to the expense of
ten thousand Said 1's, and Said he's, and He told me}:

and I told him's, and the like; but I shall collect their

facts historically as near as I can gather them out of
my memory from what they related to me, and from
what I met with in my conversing with them, and
With the place.

In order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly a.
I can, I must go back to the circumstance in which I
left the island, and which the persons were in of whom

I had sent away Friday's father and the paniard,
the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages:

companions whom he had left behind him, in order'te
save them from the like calamity that he had been In,
and in order to succour them for the present, and that.
if possible, we might together find some way for our
'le iyerance afterward.

When I sent them away, l had no visible appeal-
":nce of, or the least room to hope for, my own deli-
rerance, any more than I had twenty years before;
much less had 1 any foreknowledge of what after hap-

great surprise to them when they came back, not 0111'

which would otherwise have been their own.

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this
they were obliged not to stick so much upon the ho-
nest part of it, but to trespass upon their friendly 58.
vagcs. and to borrow two large canoes or periguas,
on pretence of going out a-fishing. for pleasure.

In these they came away the next morning; it
seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready.
for they had no baggage, neither clothes, or provi-
sions, or any thing in the world, but what they had
or. them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that
time. unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered
for my escape, as I mentioned in my other part, and
to get of? from the island ; leaving three of the most
impndent, hardened, ungoverned, disagreeable vil-
lains behind me that any man could desire to meet
with, to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disap-
pointment you may be sure.
The only just thing the rogues did, was, that when
the Spaniards came on shore, they gave m'y letter to
them and gave them provisions and other relief, as 1
had ordered them to do ; also they gave them the
long paper of directions. which i had left with them,
containing the particular methods which I took for
managing everydpart of my life there ; the way how
I baked my brea , bred up my tame goats, and plant-
ed my corn ; how I cured my grapes, made my pots,
and. in a word, every thing I did ; all this bein
written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two a
whom understood English well enough ; nor did they
refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with any thing

for as for the Englishmen they did nothing but ram-
ble about the island. shoot parrots, and catch tor
totses, and when they came home at night, the Spa-
niards provided their suppers for them.

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this,
would the other but have left them alone; which,
however, they could not find in their hearts to do
long ; 'but,like the dog in the manger, they would not
eat themselves, and would not let others eat neither:
but difl'ercnces, nevertheless, were at first but trivial,
and such as are not worth relating: but at last it
broke out into open war. and it began with all the
rudeness and insolence that can be imagined. without

indeed to common sense: and though. it is true. tlte

examine the fellows they could not deny a word ofit.

was that I forgot to set down among the rest, that

had been active in the former disorders, and let fall
some ugly dangerous words the second time, he threat-
ened to carry them in irons to England, and ham
them han ed there for mutiny, and running away
with the ship:

do it. frighted some other men in the ship; and some

they should come to some English port, and that then
they should be all put mto a goal, and tried for their
lives

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us
with it ; upon which it was desired that 1, who still
passed for a great man among them, should go down
with the mate, and satisfy the men,and tell them, that
they might be assured if they behaved well the rest
of the voyage, all they had done for the time past
should be pardoned. So l went, and after passing my
honour's word to them they appeared easy, and the
more so, when l caused the two men who were in
irons to be released and forgiven.

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for
that night, the wind also falling calm. Next morning -
we found that our two men who had been laid in
irons, had stole each of them a musket and some other
weapons: wnat powder or shot they had we knew
not; and had taken the ship's pinnacc, which was not
yet halcd up, and run away with her to their compa-
niOns in roguery on shore.

As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat
on shore, with twelve men and the mate, and away
. they went to seek the rogues ; but they could neither
find them nor any of the rest; for they all tied into
the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore.
The mate was once resolved, in justice to their ro ue-
ry, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt all t eir
household stuff and furniture_ and left them to shift
without it; but having no order, he let all alone, left
every thing as they found it, and bringing the pinnaoo
away, came on board without them.

These two men made their number five: but the
other three villains were so much wickcder than these,
that after they had been two or three days together,
they turned their two new-comers out of doors to shift
for themselves. and would have nothing to do with
them ; nor could they, for a good while, be persuaded
to give them any food: as for the Spaniards, they
were not yet come.

persuaetfed the three English brutes to have taken in
their two countrymen again, that as the said, they
'. might be all one family ; but they woul not hear ol .
' it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves, and

finding nothing but industry and application would

make them live comfortable, they pitched their tent.

on the north shore of the island, but a little more to

the west, to be out of the danger of the savages, who

always landedon the east part of the island.

Here they built two huts, one to lodge in, and the

other to lay up their magazines and'stores in; and

the Spaniards having iven them some corn for seed,

and especially some 0 the peas which I had left them,
they dug and lanted, and enclosed, after the pattern
I had set for t em all, and began to live pretty well; .

their first crop of com was on the ground, and though
it was but a little bit of land which they had dug u
at first, having had but a little time, yet it was enoug
to relieve them, and find them with bread, or other
eatahles; and one of the fellows being the cook's mate
of the ship, was very ready at making soup, pud-

landlords, grant them a long lease; and bid them go
fetch a scrivener to draw the writings. One of the
' three, damning and raging, told them they should see
they were not in jest; and going to a. little place at
a distance, where the honest men had made a fire to
dress their vietuals, he takes a fire brand and claps it
to the outside of their hut. and very fairly set it on
' fire; and it would have been all burnt down in a few
5 minutes, if one of the two had not run to the fellow,
thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his feet,
and that not without some difficulty too.

The fellow was in such a. rage at the honest man's
thrusting him away, that he turned u on him with a
pole he had in his hand; and had nott e man avoided
' the blow vet-y nimhly; and run into the hut, he had
ended his daysat once. His comrade, seein the dan-
ger they were both in, ran in after him, an immedi-
ately they came both out with their muskets; and the
man that was first struck at with the pole knocked
the fellow down who began the quarrel with the stock
of his musket, and that before the athertwo could
come to help him; and then seeing the res: come at
them, they stood together. and presenting the other

ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand off.
The others had lire arms with thetn too; but one
ofthe two honest men, bolder than his comrade, and

' feted to move hand or foot they were all dead men,
and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.

died nothing but revenge and every day gave them
some intimation that they did so.

But not to crowd this part with an account of the
loswr part of their rogueries, such as treading down
their corn, shooting three young kids and a she goat,
which the poor men had got to breed up tame for
their store; and in a word, plaguing them night and
day in this manner. it forced the two men to such a
desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three
the first time they had a fair opportunity. In order
to this they resolved to go to the castle, as they called
it, that was my old dwelling, where the three rogues
and the Spaniards all lived to ether at that time, irv
tending to have a fair battle. an the Spaniards should
stand by to see fair play. So they got up in the morn-
ing before day, and came to the place, and called the
Englishmen by their names, tellin a Spaniard-that
answered, that they wanted to span with them.

It happened that the day before two of the Spa-
niards. having been in the woods. had seen one of the
two Englishmen. whom for distinction, I call the
honest men; and he had made a sad complain to the
.'ipuniards, of the barbarous usage they had met with
from their three countrymen, and how they had ruin-
ed their plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they
had laboured so hard to bring forward, and killed
the milch- oat, and theirthreekids, which was all they
had provi ed for their sustenance; and-that if he and
his friends meaning the Spaniards did not assist them
again, they should be starved. When the Spaniards
came home at night, and they were all at supper, he
took the freedom to reprove the three Englishmen.
though in gentle and mannerly terms, and asked them,
how they could be so cruel, they being harmless in-
offensive fellows, and that they were putting them-
selves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it
had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to
such perfection as they had ?

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly "what
had they to do there ' That they came on shore with

out leave, and that they should not plant or build upon
the island; it was none of their ground."--" Why,"
says the Spaniard, very calmly, Seignior, lnglese,
they must not starve." The Englishman replied, like
P. true rough-hewn tar aulin. " they might starve and
be d----_ed, they shouljd not plant nor build in that
, lace."--" But what must they do then, Seignoir ?"
says the Spaniard. Another of the brutes returned,
" Do! d---n them, they should be servants, and work
for them."---" But how can you expect that ofthem?
they are not bought with your money; you have no
right to make them servants." . The Englighman an-
swered, " The island was theirs, the governor had
given it to them, and no man had any thing to do there
but themselves;" and with that swore by his Maker,
that he would go and burn all their new huts; they
should build none upon their land.

" Why, Seignoir" says the Spaniard, " by the same
rule, we must be your servants too."----" Ay," says
the bold dog, and so you shall too, before we have
done with you ;" mixing two or three G--d d--mme's
in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. How-
ever, this little discourse had heated them ; and start-
ing up, one says to the other, i think it was be they
called Will Atkins, " Come, Jack, let us go and have
the other brush with them; we will demolish their
pastle, I will warrant you; they shall plant no colony
in our dominions." '

Upon this they were all trooping away, with every
man a gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some
lnsolcnt things among themselves, of what they would
do to the Spaniards too, when opportunity ofl'cred
but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so perfectly on
derstnnd them as to know all the particulars; only
that. in general, they threatened them hard for taking
the two Englishman's part.

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time
that evening, the Spaniards .<<aitl they did not know;
but it seems they wandered about the country part of

the night; and then lying down in the place which I
used to call my hotver, they were weary, and overslept
themselves. The case was this: they had resolved to
stay till midnight, and so take the poor men when
they were asleep]; and they acknowledged it after-
wards, intending to set fireto their huts while they
were in them, and either burn them in them, or mur-
der them as they came out; and, as malice seldom
sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should
not have been kept waking.

However, as the two men had also a design u or
them, as l have said, though a much fairer one t la:
that of burning and murdering, it happened, and very
luckily forthem all,that they were up,and gone abroad
before the bloody-minded rogues came to their hut's.

When they came thither, and found the men gone,
Atkins who it seems was the fortvardest man, called
out to his comrades. " Ha! Jack, here's the nest; but
tl--n them, the birds are flown." They mused awhile
to think what should be the occasion of their being
gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently that the
Spaniards had given them notice of it; and with that
they shook hands, and swore to one another, that they
would be revenged of the Spaniards. As soon as

. they had made this bloody bargain, they fell to work
with the poor men's habitation ; they did not set fire
indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both their
houses, and pulled them so limb from limb, that they
left not the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on
the ground where they stood; they tore all their little
collected household-stud" in pieces, and threw every

' hing about in such a manner, that the poor men
ound, afterwards, some of their things a mile ofl

ram their habitation.

When they had done this, they pulled up all the

oung trees which the poor men had planted ; pulled
up the enclosure they had made to secure their cattle
and their ctn'u ; and, in a. word, sacked and lundep
ed every thine, as completely as a herd o Tartar:
would have done.

46 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

The two men were at this juncture gone to find
them out, and had resolved to fight them wherever
they had been, though they were but two to three; so
that, had they met, there certainly would have been
bloodshed among them : for they were all very stout,
resolute fellows, to give them their due.

But Providence took more care to keep them asun-
der, than they themselves could do to meet 2 for as
they had dogged one another, when the three were
gone thithemhe two were here ; and afterwards, when
the two went back to find them, the three were come
to the old habitation again : we shall see their differ-
ing conduct presently. When the three came back,
like furious creatures, flushed with the rage which the
work they had been about put them into, they came
up to the Spaniards, and told them what they had
done by way of scofl" aud bravado ; and one of them
stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had
been a. couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat,
as it was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about,
fleering in his face, says he to him, " And you, Seig-
nior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, if you
do not mend your manners." The Spaniard, who,
though quite a civil man, was as brave as a man could
desire to he, and withal a strong well-made man, look-
ed steadily at him for a good while :and then, having
no weapon in his hand, ste ped gravely up to him,
and with one blow of his st knocked him down, as
an ox is felled with a pole-axe ; at which one of the
rogues insolent as the first, fixed his pistol at the Spa-
niard immediately; he missed his body indeed, {o
the bullets went through his hair, but one ofthem
touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much,
The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more
hurt than he really was. and that put him into some
heat, for before he acted all in a perfectealm ; but now
resolving to go through with his work, he steeped
and took the fellow's musket wh m he had knocked
down and was just going to shoot the man who had
lired at him ; when the rest of the Spaniards, being in

the cave, came out. and calling to him not to shoot,
they stepped in, secured the other two, and took their
arms from them.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had
made all the Spaniards their enemies, as we]! as their
own countrymen. they began to cool; and giving the
Spaniards better words, would have had their arm-
ogain : but the Spaniards, considering the feud 'that
was between them And the other two Englishmen, and
-hat it would be the best method they could take to
keep them from one another, told them they would
do them no harm ; and if they would live peaceably
they would be very willing toassist and associate with
them, as they did before; but that they could not
think of giving them their arms a ain, while they up-
pearcd so resolved to do misehie with them to their
own countrymen, and had even threatened them all
to make them their servants.

The rongues were now more capable to hear reason
than to act reason; but being refused their arms, they
went raving away, and raging like madman, threaten.
mg what they would do,though they had no fire-arms:
but the Spaniards, despising their threatening, told
them they should take care how they ofi'ered any in-
jury to their plantation or cattle; for if they did, they
would shoot them, as they would do ravenous beasts,
wherever they found them; and if they fell into their
hands alive, they would certainly be hanged. How-
ever, this was far from cooling them ; hut away they
went, swearing and raging like furies of hell. As
soon as they were gone, came back the two men in

assion and rage enough also, though of another kind;

r having been at their plantation, and finding it all
demolished and destroyed, as above, it will easily be
oupposed they had provocation enough ; they could
scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were
l0 eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange enough
to find, that three men should thus bully nineteen, and
recieve no punishment at all. '

The Spaniards indeed despised them, and aspect

'ally having thus disarmed them, made light of their
threatenings; but the two Englishmen resolved to
have their remedy against them, what pains soever it
cost to find them out.
But the Spaniards interposed here too, and told
them, that they were already disarmcd : they could
not consent that they (the two) should pursue them
with firearms, and perhaps kill them : " But," said
' the grave Spaniard, who was theirgovernor, " we will
endeavour to make them do y0u justice, if you will _
leave it to us; for, as there is no doubt but they will

not able to subsist without our assistance, we promise
you to make no eace with them, without having a
full satisfaction or you; and upon this condition we
hope you will promise to use no violence with them,
other than in your defence."

The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkard
ly, and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards ro
tested, they did it only to keep them from bloods ed,
and to make all easy at last; " For," said they, " wa
are not so many of us; here is room enough for us all,
and it is great pity we. should not be all good friends."

5 At length they did consent, and waited for the inst"
of the thing, living for some da 5 with the Spaniards;
for their own habitation was estroyed.

in about five days time the three va nts, tired
with wandering, and almost starved with unger. hav-
ing chiefly lived on turtles' eggs all that while, came
back to the grove ; and finding my Spaniard, who, as

E I have said, was the overnor, and two more with
him, walking by the si e of the creek; they came up
in a very submissive humble manner, and begged to
be received again into the family. The Spaniards
used them civilly, but told them, they had acted so
unnaturally by their countrymen, and so very grossly
by them, (the Spaniards) that they could not come to
any conclusion without consulting the two English,

men, and the rest; but however they 'would go to

them, and discourse about it, and they should know
in half an hour. It may be guessed that they were
very hard put to it; forit seems, as they were to wait
this half-hour for an answer,'they begged'he would
-seud them out some bread in the meantime; which
he did, and sent them at the same time a large piece
of goat's flesh, and a broiled parrot, which they an
very heartily, for they were hungry enough.

After half an hour's consultation they were called
in, and a long debate had about them, their two coun-
trymen charging them with the ruin of all their la-
hour. and a design to murder them ; all which they
owned before, and therefore could not deny now ;
upon the whole, the Spaniards acted the moderators
between them ; and as they had obliged the two Eng-
lishmen not to hurt the three, while they were naked
and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and
rebuild their fellows two huts, one to be of the same
dimensions, and the other larger than they were be
fore ; also to fence their ground again, where they had
pulled up the fences. plant trees in the room of those.
pulled up, dig up the land again for planting com,
where they had spoiled it ; and in a word, to restore
every thing in the same state as they found it, as near
as they could ; for entirely it could not be, the season
for the corn, and the growth of the trees and hedges,
not being possible to be recovered.

Well, they all submitted to this: and as they had
plenty of provisions given them all the while, they
grew very orderly, and the whole society began to live
pleasantly and agreeably together again ; only that
these three fellows could never he persuaded to work;

ther for a month or two. the Spaniards gave them their
arms again, and gave them liberty to go abroad with
them as before.

It was not above a week after they had these arms;
and went abroad, but the ungrateful creatures began
to be as insolent and troublesome as before; but how-
ever, an accident happened presently upon this,which
endangered the safety of them all ; they were obliged
to lay by all private resentments, and look to the pro
servation of their lives.

It happened one night, that the Spaniard governor,
as i call him, that is to say. the Spaniard whose life
I had saved, who was now the captain, or leader or
governor of the rest, found himself very uneasy in the
night and could by no means get any sleep : he was
perfectly well in body, as he told me the story, only
found his thouahts tumultuous; his mind ran upon
men fighting and killing one another. but was broad
awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in
short, he lay a great while; but growing more and
more uneasy, he resolved to rise: as they lay, being

'so many of them, upon goat-skins laid thick upon

such couches and pads as they made for themselves,
and not in hamm'scks and ship-beds, asl did, who
was but one, so they had little to do, when they were
willing to rise, but to get up up0n their feet, and per-
haps nt on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps,
and t ey were ready for going any way that their
thoughts guided them.

Being thus otlen up, he looked out ; but, being
dark, he can] see little or nothing; and besides, the
trees which I had planted, as in my fomer account
is described. and which were now grown tall, inter-
cepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see
that it was a clear star-light night ; and hearing no
noise, he returned and laid him down again: but it
was all one. he could not sleep, nor could he compose
himselfto any thing like rest, but his thoughts were to
the last degree uneasy, and yet he knew not for what

Having made some noise with rising and walking
about going out and coming in, another of them wak-
ed, and, calling. asked who it was that was up ?. The
governor told him how it had been with him. " Say
you so ?" says the other Spaniard; " such things are
not to be slighted, I assure you ; there is certainly
some mischief working," sa 3 be, "near us ;" and
presently he asked him, " here are the English

men ?"--" They are all in their huts," says he, " safe ' '

enugh." It seems, the Spaniards had ke t posses--
sion of the main apartment, and had ma e a place,
where the three Englishmen. since their last mutiny,
always quartered by themselves, and could not come
at the rest. " Well," says the Spaniard, " there is
something in it, I am persuaded from my own expe-
rience; 1 am satisfied our spirits embodied have con-
verse with, and receive intelligence from, the spirits
unembodied, and inhabiting the invisible world ; and
this friendly notice is given for our advantage, if we
know how to make use of it. Come," says he, " let
us go out and look abroad ; and if we find nothing at

' all in it to justify our trouble, ['1] tell you a story to

the purpose that shall convince you of the justice of
my proposing it."

In a. word, they went out to go to the top of the
hill, where I used to go; but they being-strong, and
in good company, nor alone, as l was, used none .of
my cautions to go up by the ladder, and then pulling

' it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top,

but were going round through the grove unconcerned
nnd unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a
light as ofa fire, a very little way off from them, and
hearing the voices of men, not of one or two but of a
great number.

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages
landing on the island, it was my constant care to pre-
vent them making the least discovery of there being
any inhabitant upon the place ; and when by an no-
cessity they came to know it, they felt it so e ectu-
ally, that they that got away, were scarce able to give

any account of it, for we disappeared as soon as pose _

sible, nor did ever any that had seen me, escape to
tell any one else, except it were the three savages in
our last encounter, whojumped into theboat, of whom
I mentioned that l was afraid they should go home.
and bring more help.

Whether it was the consequence of the escape 0!
those men that so eat a number came now toge-
ther; or whether tfiley came ignorantly, and by acci--
dent, on their usual bloody errand,the Spaniards could
not, it seems, understand : but whatever it was, it had
been their business, either to have concealed them-
selves, and not have seen them at all ; much less to
have let the savages have seen, that there were any
inhabitants in the place 3 but to have fallen upon them
so effectually, as that not a man of them sh0uld have
escaped, which could only have been by getting in
between them and their boats : but this presence 01
mind was wanting to them : which was the ruin of
their tranquility for a great while.

We need not doubt but that the governor, and the
man with him, surprised with this sight, ran back im-
mediately, and raised their fellows, giving them an
account of the imminent danger, they were all in ; and
they again as readily took the alarm, but it was im-
possible to persuade them to stay close within where
they were, but that they must al run out to see how
things stood. .

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough,
and they had opportunity enough, for some hours, to
view them by the light of three fires they had made
at some distance from one another ; what they were
doing they knew not, and what to do fliemselves the
[new not; for, first, the enemy were too many; an ,
secondly, they did not keep together, but were divid-
edinto several parties, and were on shore in several
places.

The Spaniards were in no small consternation a:
this sight; and as they found that the fellows ran strag-
gling allover the shore, they made no doubt, but,

first or last, some of them would chop in upon their
habitationpr upon some other place,where the would
see the tokens of inhabitants; and they were in great
perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which
would have been little less than starving them, if they
should have beendestroyed ; so the first thing they re
solved upon, was to dispatch three men away befott
it was light, vix. two Spaniards and one Englishman,
to drive all the goats away to the great valley when

the cave was, and. if need were, to drive tnem into'

the very cave itself.

Could they have seen the savages all together in one
body and at a distance from their canoes, they re
solved, ifthere had been an hundred ofthem, to have
attacked them ; but that could not be obtained, for
there were some of them two miles off from the other,
and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two different
nations.

After having mused a great while on the course
they should take, and beaten their brainsin consider-
ing their present circumstances, they resolved at last,
while it was dark, to send the old savage (Friday's
father) out as a spy, to learn if possible something
concerningthem,aswhat they came for, and what they
intended to do, and the like. The old man readily
undertook it, and stripping himself quite naked, as
most of the savages were, away he went. After he
had been gone an hour or two, he brings word that
he had been among them undiscovered, that he found
they were two parties and of two several nations,
who had war with one another, and had had a great
battle in their own country, and that both sides having
had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were by
mere chance landed in the same island for the devour-
ing their prisoners, and making, merry ; but their
coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all
their mirth; that they were in a great ra e at one an.
other, and were so near, that he believe they would
fight again as soon as daylight began to appear : but
he did not perceive that they had any notion of any

body's being on the island but themselves. He had
hardly made an end of tellin the story, when they
could perceive, by the unusua noise they made, that
the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
Friday's father used all the arguments he could to
ersuade our people to lie close, and not be seen;
e told them t eir safety consisted in it. and that they
had nothing to do but to lie still, and the savage:
would kill one another to their hands, and the rest
would go away; and it was so to a tittle. But it was
impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen,
their curiosity was so importunate upon their pruden-
tials. that they must run out and see the battle; how-
ever, they used some caution, viz. they did not go
Openly just by their own dwelling, but went farther
into the woods, and placed themselves to advantage,
where they might securely see them manage the fight,
and, as they thought, not to be seen by them; but It
seems the savages did see them, as we shall find here-
a ter.
The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe
the Englishmen, one of them said he could perceive
' that some of them were men of great bravery, of in-
vincible spirits, and of great policy in guiding the
tight. The battle, they said, eld two hours before
they could guess which party would be beaten; but
then that party which was nearestour people's habita-
tion began to appear weakest, and, after some time
more, some of them began to fly; and this put our
men again into a great consternation, lest any of those
that fled should run into the grove before their dwell-
ing for shelter, and thereby involuntarily discover the
place, and that by consequence the pursuers should
do the like in search of them. Upon this they re-
solved, that they would stand armed within the wall,
and whoever came into the grove they should sally
out over the wall, and kill them, so that if possible
not one should return to give an account of it; they
ordered also, that it should be done with their swords,
- or by knocking them down with the stock of the

musket, not by shooting them, for fear of raising an
alarm by the noise.

As they,expected it fell out: three of the muted
army fletl for life, and crossing the creek rtm directly
into the place. not in the least knowing whither they
went, but running as into a thick wood for shelter.
The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice ofthis
within, with this addition to our men's great satisfac-
tion, viz. that the conquerors had not pursued them,
or seen which way they were gone. Upon this the
Spaniard governor. a man of humanity, would not
suffer them to kill the three fugitives; hut sending
three men out by the top of the hill, ordered them to
go round and come in behind them, surprise and take
them prisoners; which was done: the residue of the
conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to
sea; the victors retired. and made no pursuit, or very
little, but drawing themselves into a body together.
gave two great screaming shouts, which they supposed
were by way of triumph, and so the fight ended; and
the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon,
they also marched to their canoes. And thus the
Spaniards had their island again free to themselves,
their fright was over, and they saw no savages in w
veral years after.

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of
their den, and viewing the field of battle, they found
about {\VO-Blld'lltltly dead men upon the spot ; some
were killed with great long arrows, several of which
were found sticking in their bodies. but most of them
were killed with their great wooden swords. sixteen
or seventeen of which they found in the field ofbattle,
and as many bows, with a great many arrows. These
swords were great unwieldy things. and they must be
very stron men that used them; most of those men
that were illed with them had theirheads mashed to
pieces, as we may say, or, as we call it in English,
their brains knocked out. and several oftheir arms
and legs broken; so that it is evident they fight with
inexpressible rage and fury. They found not one

This deliverance tamed our Englishmen for a. great
while; the stght had filled them -with horror, and the
consequence appeared terrible to the last degree, espe-
cially upon supposing that some time or other they
should fall into the hands of those creatures, who
would not only kill them as enemies. but kill them for

were dead, had something in it so horrible that it new,

day, who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my
bones.

But to come to the family part: Being all now good
friends (for common danger, as I said above, had
effectually reconciled them) they began to consider
their general circumstances; and the first thing that

came under their consideration was, whether, seeing

he savagesparticularly haunted that side of the island,
and that there were more remote and retired arts 0!
t equally adapted to their way of living, an mani-
festly to thei' advantage, they should not rather re-
move their hnbitation, and plant in some more proper
place for their safety, and especially for the security
'of their cattle and corn.

Upon this, after long debate, it was conceived that
they should not remove their habitation, because that
some time or other they thought they might hear from
their governor again, meaning me; and if I should
send any one to seek them, I would he sure to direct
them on that side, where if they should find the place
demolished they would conclude the savages had
killed us all, and we were gone, and so our supply
would go away too.

But as to their corn and cattle they agreed to re-
move them into the valley where my cave was, where
the land was as proper to both, and where indeed
there was land enough; however,upon second thoughts
they altered one part of that resolution too. and re-
solved only to remove part of their cattle thither, and
plant part of their corn there ; and so, if one part was
destroyed, the other might be saved ; and one piece of
prudence they used, which it was very well they did ;
viz. that they never trusted these three savages, which
they had taken prisoners, with knowin" any thing of
the lantation they had made in that vailey, or of any
catt e they had there; much less of the cave there|
which they kept in case of necessity asa safe retreat;
and thither they carried also the two barrels of pow-
der which I had left them at my coming away.\w WW swssnammwmmmwsl>>

But however they resolved not to change their he
bitation; yet they agreed, that as I had carefully co-
vered it first with a wall and fortification, and then
with a grove of trees; so seeing their safety consisted
entirely in therr being concealed, of which they were
now fully convinced, they set to work to cover and
conceal the place yet more effectually than before: tr:
this purpose, as I had planted trees or rather thrust in
stakes which in time all grew to he trees) for some
good distance before the entrance into my apartment,
they went on in the same manner, and filled up the
rest of that whole space of ground, from the trees I
had set quite down to the side of the creek, where, as
I said, I landed my floats, and even into the very out!
where the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any

lace to land ; or any sign that there had been any
ending thereabout. These stakes also being of a
wood very forward to grow, as I had noted formerly.
they took care to have generally very much larger and
taller than those which I had planted, and laced them
so very thick and close, that when they ha been three
or four years grown, there was no piercing with the
eye any considerable way into the plantation. As for
that part which I had. lanted, the trees were grown
as thick as a man's t igh; and among them they
placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that,
in a word, it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile
thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it but
with a little army to cut it all down ; for a little dog
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close

But this was not all ; for they did the same by all
the ground to the right hand, and to the left, and
round even to the top of the hill, leavmg no way, not
I0 much as for themselves to come out, but by the

This was excellently well contrived, nor was it less
than what they afterwards found occasion for: which
served to convince me that as human prudence has
authority of Providence to justify it, so it has, doubt
less. the direction of Providence to set it to work, and,
would we listen carefully to the voice of it, I am fully
persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters
which our lives are now-by our own negligence sub-
jected to : but this by the way.

I return to the story: They lived two years after
thisin perfect retirement, and had no more visits from
the savages; they had indeed an alarm given them
one morning. which put them in great consternation:
for some of the Spaniards being out early one morn-
mg on the west side, or rather end of the island,
which, by the way, was that end where I never went,
for fear of being discovered, they were surprised with
sfieing above twenty canoes of Indians juntcoming on
s ore.

They made the best of their way home in hurry
enough, and, giving the alarm to their comrades, they
kept close all that day and the next, going out only at
night to make observation; but they had the good
luck to be mistaken, for wherever the savages went,'
they did not land at that time on the island, but put>>

And now they ha another broil with the three
Englishmen. one of which, a most turbulent fellow,
being in a rage at one of the three slaves which I men-

something right which he bid him do, and seemed a

murder the poor man, clapt in between him and the
savage to prevent the mischief.

The felluw being enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet. and swore he'would
serve him as he intended to serve the savage; which
the Spaniard perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a
shovel which he had in his hand (for they were werk
ing in the field about the corn-laud) knocked the brute
down ; another ol'the Englishmen running at the same
time to help his comrade knocked the Spaniard down,
and then two Spnniards more came to help their man
and a third Englishman fell upon them. They be
none of them any fire-arms, or any other weapons but
hatchets and other tools, except the third Englishman ;

he had one of my old rusty Cutlasses, with which he '

made atthe last S aniards and wounded them both.
This fray set the w role family in an u roar, and more
help coming in they took the three nglishmen pri-
soners. The next question was, what should be done
with them ? they had been so often mutinous, and
were so furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, that
they kuewnot what course to take with them, for they
were mischievous to the highest degree, and valued
not what hurt they did any man ; so that, in short, it
was not safe to live with them.

The Spaniard who was governor, told them in so
many words. that if they had been his own country-
men he would have hanged them all ; for all lawsand
all governors were to preserve society. and those who
were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out
o' it ; but as they were En lishmen, and that it was
to the generous kindness 0 an Englishman that they
all owed their preservation and deliverance, he would
use them with all possible leuity, and would leave
them to the judgment of the other two Englishmen,
who were their countrymen.

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and
said they desired it might not be left to them ; " For,"
says he. " l am sure we ought to sentence them tothe

Aligns, one of the three, had proposed to have 211' the
five Englishmen 'oin together and murder all the
Spaniards when t ey were in their sleep.

When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to
Will Atkins : " How, Seiginor Atkins," says he,
" will you murder us all ? what have you to say to
that ?" That hardened villain was so far from denying
it, that he said it was true. and G-d d-mn him they
would do it still before they had done with them
" Welll but Sciginor Atkins," said the Spaniard,
" what have we done to you that you will kill us? .
And what would you get by killling us? And what
must we do to prevent your killin us ? Must we kill
you, or will you kill us? Why wi l you put us to the
necessity of this Scigmor Atkins?" says the Spaniard
very calmly and Smiling.

Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the S<paniard's
making a jest of it, thathad he not been he] by three
men, and withal had no weapons with him. it was
thought he would have attempted to have killed the
Spaniard in the middle of all the company.

This harebrained carriage obli ed them to'considet
seriously what was to be done' he two Englishmen
and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage, were of
Opinion that they should hang one of the three for
an example to the rest; and that particularl'yitshordd
he he that had twice attempted to commit murder with
his hatchet ; and indeed there was some reason to be
lieve he had done it, for the poor savage was in such
a miserable condition with the wound he had receiv-
ed, that it was thought he could not live.

But the governor S aniard still said, no, it was an
Englishman that he saved all their lives, and he
would never consent to put an Englishman to death
though he had murdered half of them; nay, he sai
if he had been killed himselfhy an Englishman. and
had time left to speak, it sliould'be that they should

This was so positively insisted on by the governor

it was agreed that, first, they should be disarmed, and
not permitted to have either gun, orpowder, or shot,
or sword. or any weapon, and should be turned out
of the society, and left to live where they would, and
how they could by themselves ; but that none of the
rest, either Spaniards, or English should converse with
them, speak with them, or have any thing to do with
them; that they should be forbid to come within a
certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and
that if they offered to commit any disorder, so as to
spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of the corn, plantings,
buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the society,
thatthe should die without mercy, and would shoot
them w erever they could find them.

The governor, a man of great humanity, musin
upon the sentence, considered a little upon it, an
turning to the two honest Englishman, said, " Hold,
you must reflect, that it will be long ere they can miss
corn and cattle of their own, and they must not sta we;
we must therefore allow them provisions." So be
caused to he addetl,that they should have a roportion
of corn given them to last them eight mont is, and for
seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed to
raise some of their own ; that they should have six
Inilch-goats, four hevgoats, and six kids given them, as
well for present subsistence as for a store ; and that
they should have tools given them for their work in

he field; such as six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the
ike: but they should have none of these tools or pro-
visions unless they would swear solemnly that the
would not hurt or injure any of the Spaniards wi
them or their fellovt Englishmen.

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned
them out to- shift for themselves. They went away

sullen and refractory, as neither contented to go away
or to stay ; but as there was no remedy they went, 1
pretending to go andchoose a place where they should g
settle themselves, to plant and live by themselves; and

some prov-asions were given, but no weapons. '

About fiiur or live days after they came again for
some victuals, and gave the governor an account
where they had pitched their tents, and marked them-
selves out an habitation or plantation : it was a very
convenient place imlee i, on the remotest art of the
'sland, N. E. much about the place where providen-
tially landed in my first voyage when Iwas driven
out to sea, the Lord alone knows whither, in my
foolish attempt to surround the island. g

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and _
contrived them in a manner like my first habitation,
being close under the side of a hill. having some trees
growing already to the three sides of it 3' so that by
planting others it would be very easily covered from
the sight unless narrowly searched for. They desired
some- dry goat-skins for beds and covering. which
were given them : and upon their giving their words
that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any 01
their plantations they gave them hatchets, and what
other tools they c0uld spare; some peas, barley, and
rice. for sowing, and, in a word, any thing they want.-
ed hut arms and amunition.

They lived in this separate condition about six
months, and had gotin their first harvest, though the
quantity was but small, the areal of land they had ,
planted being but little; for indeed having all their
plantation to form, they had a great deal ofworlt upon.
their hands and when they came to make boards,
and pots, and such things, they were quite out of their
element and could make nothing ofit; and when the
rainy season came on, for want ofa cave in the earth,
they could not keep their'grain dry. and it was in
great danger of spoiling : and this humbled them
much -, so they came and begged the Spaniards to help
them, which they very readily did ; and in four day:

big enough to secure their corn and other things from
the rain : but it was buta poor place at best compar-
ed to mine; and especially as mine was then; for the
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made several
new apartments in it.

About three quarters of a year after this separation
is. new frolic took these rogues. which, together with
the former villany they had counuitted, brought mis-
5 chief enough upon them, and had very near been the
' ruin of the whole colony. The three new associates
g be an, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they
le , and that without hope of bettering their circum-
stances; and a whim took them that they could make
a voyage to the continent from whence the savages
( came, and would try ifthey could not seize upon some
f risoners among the natives there. and bring them

. tome, so as to make them do the laborious part of
the work for them.

The project was not so preposterous if they had
gone no farther ; but they did nothing and proposed
nothing but had either mischiefin the design or mis-
chief in the event : and ifl may give my opinion,

- they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven ; for if
we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible
crimes. how shall we reconcile the events of things

- with divinejnstice? It was certainly an apparent ven-
geance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that

brought them to the state they were in; and as they

shew ed not the least remorse for the crime, but added

new villanies to it, such as particularly that piece of

monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave because

he did not. orpcrhaps could not understand to do what

he was directed, and to wound him in such amanner

as, no question. made him a cripple all his lite, and in

a place where no surgeon or medicine could be had

for his cure ; and what was still worse, the murderous

. intent, or, to do justice to the crime, the intentional
murder. for such to be sure it was. as was afterwards

the formed design they all laid to m' rder the Spur)-
nu'ds in cold blood, and in their sleep

But I leave observing, and return to the story:
The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one
morning, and in very humble terms desired to be ad-
mitted to speak with them; the Spaniards very readily
heard what they had to say, which was this,-that they
were tired of living in the manner they did, that they
were not handy enough to make the necessaries they
wanted ; and that, hating no help, they fouud they
should be starved : but ifthe Spaniards would give
them leave to take one of the canoes which they came
over in. and give them arms and ammunition propor-
tioned for their defence. they would go over to the
main, and seek their fortune, and so deliver them
from the trouble of supplying them with any other
provisions. .

The Spaniards we re glad enough to be rid of them;
but yet very honestly represented to them the certain
destruction they were running into; told them they
had suffered such hardships upon that very spot that
they could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell them
that they would he starved or murdered, and bade
them consider of it.

The men replied andaciously,thcy should be starved
if they stayed here, for they could not work, and
would not work ; and they could but be starved
abroad ; and they were murdered, there was an end
of them, they had no wives or children to cry after
them ; and, in short, insisted importnnately upon their
demand, declaring that they would go, whether they
would ive them any arms or no.

The paniards told them with great kindness, that
if they were resolved to go, they should not go like
naked men, and be in no condition to defend them.
selves. and that though they could ill spare their fire-
arms, having not enough for themselves, yet they
would let them have two muskets, a pistolmnd a cut-
lass, and each man a hatchet, which they thought sul-
fieient for them

In a word, they accepted the offer, and havin
baked them bread enough to serve them a month, an
given them as much goat's flesh asthey could eatwhile
it was sweet, and a great basket full of dried grapes,
a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid alive to
kill, they boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage over
the sea, where it was at least forty miles broad.

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have
very well carried fifteen or twenty. men, and therefore
was rather too big for them to manage; but as they
had a fair breeze and the flood-tide with them, they
did well enough; they had made a mast of a long
pole, and a'sail of four large goat-skins dried, which
they had sewed or laced together ; and away they
went merrily enough ; the Spaniardscalledaftt'r them,
" Bon' veajo;" and no man ever thought of seeing
them any more.

The Spaniards would often say to one another, and
the two honest Englishmen who remained behind,
how quietly and comfortably they lived now those
three turbulent fellows were gone; as for their ever
coming again. that was the remotest thing from their
thoughts could be imagined ; when. behold, after
twenty-two days absence, one of the Englishmen be-
ing abroad upon his planting work, sees three strange
men coming towards him at a distance, two of them

with guns upon their shoulders. .

Away runs the Englishman, as if he was bewitchcd,
and became frighted and amazed, to the governor
Spaniard, and tells him they were all undone, for
there were strangers landed upon the island, he could
not tell who. The Spaniard pausing awhile, sa sto
him, " How doyou mean,you cannot tell who? hey
are savages to be sure."--" No, no," says the Eng-
lishman, " they are men in clothes. with arms."--
" Nay then." says the Spaniard, " why are you con.
cerned? If they are not savages, they must he friends;
for there is no Christian nation upon earth but will
do usgood rather than harm."

While they were debating thus, came the three Eng.

"new-planted, hallooed to them; they presently knew
their voices, and so all the wonder of that kind ceas-
ed. But now the admiration was turned upon ano-
ther question, viz. What could be the matter, and
what made them come back again? '

It was not long before they brought the men in;
and inquiring where they had been, and what they had
been doing? they gave them a full account of their
voyage in a few words, viz. that they reached the land
in two days, or something less, but finding the people
alarmed at theircoming, and preparingwith bows and
arrows to fight them, they durst not go on shore, but
sailed on to the northward six or seven hours, till
they came to a great opening, by which they perceived
that the land they saw from our island was not the
main, but an island : that entering that. opening oi the
sea. they saw another island on the right hand north,
and several more west; and being resolved to land
somewhere, they put over to one of the islands which
lay west, and went boldly on shore; that they found
the people were courteous and friendly to them, and
they gave them several roots, and some dried fish,
and appeared very sociable: and the women, as well
as the men, were very forward to supply them with
any thing they could get for them to eat, and brought
it to them a great way upon their heads.

They continued here four days, and inquired, as
well as they could of them by signs, what nations
were this war , and that way; and were told of seve-
ral fierce an terrible people, that lived almost every
way: who, as they made known by signs to them,
used to eat men; but as for themselves, they said, that
they never ate men or women, except only such as
they took in the wars; and then they owned that they
made a great feast, and ate their prisoners.

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of
that kind, and they told them two moons ago, point-
lng to the moon, and then to two fingers; and that
Iheir great king had two hundred prisoners now.

which he had taken in his war, and they were feed.
ing them to make them fat for the next feast. The
Englishmen seemed mighty desirous to see those pri
soners, but the others mistaking them, thought they
were desirous to have some of them to carry away for
their own eating. So they beckoned to them, poinh
ing to the setting of the sun, and then to the using;
which was to signify, that the next morning at sun
rising they would bring some for them; and accord
ingly the next morning they brought down five women
and eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen
to carry with them on their voyage,just as we would
bring so many cows and oxen down toa sea-port
town to victual a ship.

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at
home, their stomachs turned at this sight, and they did
not know what to do; to refuse the prisoners would
have been the highest afiront to the savage gentry that
offered them; and what to do with them they knew
not; however, upon some debate, they resolved to
accept of them; and in retu'rn they gave the savages
that brought them, one of their hatchets. an old key,
a knife, and six or seven of their bullets, which, though
they did not understand, they seemed extremely
pleased with; and then tying the poor creatures' hands

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE '69

In their voyage they endeavoured to have some
ammunication with their prisoners, but it was im-
possible to make them understand any thing ; nothing
they could say to them, or give them, or do for them,
but was looked upon as going about to murder them:
they first of all nnbo'nnd them, but the poor creature:
screamed at that, especially the women, as if they had
iust felt the knife at their throats; for they immedi.
:tfilyleoncluded they were unbound on purpose to be

If they gave them any thing to eat, it was the same
thing; then they concluded it was for fear they should
sink in flesh. and so _not he fat enough to kill; if they
looked at one of them more particularly, the party
presently concluded it was to see whether he or she
was fattest and fittest to kill firs' : nay, after they had
brought them quite over. and began to use them kindly
and treat them well, still they expected every day to
make'a dinner or supper for their new masters.

When the three wanderers had given thisunaccount-
uhle history or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard
asked them where their new family was? And being
told that they had brought them on shore, and put
them into one of their huts, and were come to beg
some victuals for them ; they (the Spaniards) and the
other two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole co-
lony, resolved to go all down to the place and see
them, and did so, and Friday's father with them.

When they came into the hut, there. they sat all
bound; for when they had brought them on short!
they bound their hands, that they might not take the
boat and make their esca e; there, Isay, they sat,
all of them stark naked. irst, there were three men,
lusty, comely fellows, well shaped, straight and fair
limhs, about thirty or thirty-five years of age, and five
women: whereof two might be from thirty to forty,
two more not above twenty-four or twenty-five, and

raving very pleasant, agreeable countenances, and o!
a very modest behaviour, especially when they came
afterwards to be clothed, and dressed, as they called
it, though that dress was very indifl'erent it must be
confessed, of which hereafter.

The sight, you may be sure was something uncouth
to our Spaniards, who were (to give them a just cha-
racter) men ofthe best behaviour, of the most calm,
sedate tempers, and perfect good humour that ever I
met with ; and, in particular. of the most modesty, as

will presently appear ; l say the sight was very un-'

couth, to see three naked men and five naked women,
all together, bound and in the most miserable circum-
stances that human nature could be supposed to be,
viz. to be expecting every moment to be dragged out,
and have their brains knocked out, and then to be
eaten up like a calfthat is killed fora dainty.

The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian,
Friday's father, to go in and see first ifhe knew any
dthem,and then if he understood any of their speech.
As soon as the old man came in, he looked seriously
at them, but knew none of them; neither could any 0!
them understand a word he said, or a sign he could
make, except one of the women.

However, this was enough to answer-the end, which
was to satisfy them, that the men into whose hands
they were fallen were Christians; that they abhorred
eating of men or women; and that they might be sure
they would not be killed. As soon as they were as.
sured of this they discovered such a joy, and by such
awkward and several ways as is hard to describe, for

tseems they were of several nations.

The woman who was their interpriter was bid, in
the next place, to ask them ifthey were willing to be
servants, and to work for the men who had brought
them away to save their lives? At which they all fell
a-dancing; and presently one tell to taking up this,

war .

The governor who found that the having women
among them would presently be attended with some
mconvemency. and might occasion some strife, and
perhaps blood, asked the three men what they intend
ed to do with these women, and how they intended
to use them, whether as servants or as women? One
of the Englishmen answered very boldly and readily,
that they would use them as both. To which the go
vernor said, " I am not going to restrain you from
it; you are'your own masters as to that ; but this I
think is butjust, for avoiding disorders and quam-ls
among you, and I desire it of you for that reason only,
viz. that you will all engage. that if any of you take
any of these women as a wouzan, or wife, he shall
take but one ; and that, having taken one, none else
should touch her; for though we cannot marry any 01
you, yet it is but reasonable that while you stay here,
the woman any of you takes should be maintained
by the man that takes her, and should be his wife; I
mean," says he. '4 while he continues here; and that
none else should have any thing to do with her." All
this appeared so just, that every one agreed to it with-
out any'tlitiiculty. '

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniard if they
designed to take any of them? But every one answer-
ed, " No :" some of them said they had wives in
Spain 3 and the others did not like women that were
not Christians; and all together declared, that they
would not touch one of them : which was an instance
of such virtue as l have not met with in all my tro-
vcls. 0n the other hand, to be short, the live Eng
lishmen took them every one a wife; that is to say, a
temporary wife ; and so they'set up a new form of
living for the Spaniards and 'riday's {other lived in

ut the wonder of this story was how five such re- 5

the same woman, especially seeing two or three 0!
them were, without comparison, more agreeable than
the others; but they took a good way enough to pre-
~ent quarreling among themselves; for they set the
five women by themselves in one of their huts, and
they went all into the other hut, and drew lots among
them who should choose first.
He that drew to choose first, went away by him-

koned the homeliest and the oldest of the five, which

and the Spaniards came and helped them , and in a
few hours they had built them every one a new hut
or tent for their lodging apart; for those they had a!
ready were crowded with their tools, household-stun",
and provisions. The three wicked ones had pitched
farthest off, and the two honest ones nearer, but both
on the north shore of the island, so that they conti-
nued separateas before; andthus my island was peo-
pled in three places, and, as I might say, three towns
were begun to be planted.

And here it is very well worth observing, that as
it often happens in the world. (what the wise ends of
God's providences are in such a disposition of things
Icannot say) the two honest fellows had the two
worst wives; and the three reprohates,that were scarce
worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither
seemed born to do themselves good. or any one else,
had three elevendiligent. carcful,and ingenious wives;
not that the two first were ill wives as to their temper
or humour; for all the five were most willing, uiet,
passive, and subjected creatures, rather like saves
than wives ; but my meaning is, they were not alike
tapable, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly
and neat.

Another observation I must make, to the honour
ofa diligent application on the one hand, and to the
disgrace of a slothful. negligent, idle temper on the
other, that when [came to the place, and viewed the
several improvements. planting, and management of
the several little colonies, the two men had so far out-
gone the three, that there was no comparison ; they
had indeed both of them as much ground laid out for
corn as they wanted ; and the reason was. because,

according to my rule, nature dictated, that it was to '

no purpose to sow more corn than they wanted ; but
thedifference of the cultivation, of the planting, of the
fences, and indeed every thing else, was easy to be
seen at first view. -

thing was to be seen but a wood ; and though tney
had their plantation twice demolished, once by their
own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be
shewn in its place; yet they ad restored all again,
and every thing was flourishing and thriving about
them . they had grapes planted in order, and managed
like a vineyard, though they had themselves never
seen any thing of that kind; and by their good order-
ing their vines, their grapes were as SSood again as any
of the others. They had also former themselves a re<<
treat in the thickest part of the woods, where, though
there was not a natural cave. as I had found, yet they
tnade one with incessant labour oftheir hands, and
where. when the mischief which followed happened,
they secured their wives and children so as they could
never be found ; they having, by sticking innumera-
ble stakes and poles of the wood, which, as I said,
grew so easily , madea grove impassible except in one
place. where they climed up to, et over the outside
part, and then went in by ways 0 their own leaving.

As to the three reprohates. as I justly call them,
though they were much civilized by their new settle.
ment compared to what they were before. and were
not so qnarrelsome, having not the same opportunity,
yet one ofthe certain companions ofa profligate mind
never left them, and that was their idleness. it was
true, they planted corn and made fences; and Solo-
n.on's words were never better verified than in them t
"1 went by the vineyard of the slothful, and it was
overgrown with thorns;" for when the Spaniards came
to view their crop, they could not see it in some places
for weeds ; the hedge had several gaps in it, where
the wild goats had gotten in and eaten up the corn ;
perhaps here and there a dead hush was crammed in
to stop them out for the present, but it was only shtw
ting the stable door after the steed was stolen: where-

that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and
to our men too, that they did not concern themselves
about it as I did ; but having been made sensible by
their experience. that their only business was to lie
concealed, and that, if they were not seen by any of
the savages, they would go off again quietly when their
business was done, having as yet not the least notion

placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice when
the boats went all to sea again.

This was without doubt, very right,- but a disaster
spoiled all these measures, and made it known among
the savages that there were inhabitants there, which
was, in the end, the desolation of almost the whole
colony. After the canoes with the savages were gone
off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again, and some of
them had the curiosity to go to the place where they
had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to
their great surprise, they found three savages left he-
hind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground ; it was
an posed they had either been so gorged with their
in uman feast, that, like beasts, they wereasleep, and
would not stir when the others went, or they were
wandered into the woods, and did not come back in
time to be taken in. . .

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight
and perfectly at a loss, what to do ; the S aniard go-

. vernor, as it happened, was with them, an his advice

was asked; but he rofessed he knew not what to do;
as for slaves they iad enough already ; and as tn
killina them,they were none ofthem inclined to that.
The . paniard governor told me they could not think
of shedding innocent blood ; for as to them, the poor
creatures had done no wrong, invaded none of their
property ; and they thought they had no just quarrel
against them to take away their lives.

And here Imust, in justice to these Spaniards, ob

Mexico and Peru be what they will, [never met with
seventeen men, of any nation whatsoever, in any PS0
reign country, who were so universally modest, tem-
perate, virtuous, so very good humoured, and so cour-
teous as these Spaniards; and, as to cruelty, they had
nothing of it in their very nature; no inhumanity, no
barbarity, no outrageous passions, and yet all of them
men of great courage and spirit. '

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their

men, and theirjustice and humanity appeared now
in the case of the savages as above. After some con-
sultation they resolved upon this. that they would lie
still a. while longer, till if possible, these three men
might be gone- but then the governor Spaniard recolu
lected that the three savages had no boat, and that if
they were left to rave about the island, they would
certainly discover that there were inhabitants' In it.
and so they should be undone that way.

Upon this they went back again, and there lay the
fellows fast asleep still; so they Iesolved to awaken
them,and take them prisoners; and they did so. The
poor fellows were strangely frighted when they were
seized upon and bound, and afraid, like the women.
that they should be murdered and eaten; for' It seems
those people think all the world do as they do, eating
men 's flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that:
and away they carried them.

It was very happy for them that they did not carry
them home to their castle; I mean to my palace under
the hill but they carried them first to the bower,
where was the chief of their conntry work; such as
the keeping the goats, the planting the corn, &c.; and
afterward: they carried them to the habitation of the
two Englishmen.

Here they were set to work, though it was not much
they had for them to do; and whether It was by neg-
ligence In guarding them, or that they thought the
fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but
one of them ran away. and taking Into the woods,
the could never hear of him more

who came on shore three or four weeks afterwards,
and who. carrying on their revels as usual, went 03?
again in two days time. This thought terrified them
exceedingly; for thev concluded and that not wnhout
good cause indeed, that If thIs fellow got safe home
among his comrades, he would ceItainly give them an
amount that there were people' In the island. as also

how weak and few they were; for this savage, as I
observed before, had never been told, as ll was very
happy he had not, how many they were, or where
they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the tire of
any of theirguns, much less had they shewn them any
other of their retired places. such as the cave in the
valley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen
'had made, and the like.

The first testimony they had that this fellow had
given intelligence of them was, that about two months
after this, six canoes of savages, with about seven or
eight, or ten men in a canoe, came rowing along the
north side of the island, where they never used to
come before, and landed about an hour after sunrise,
at a convenient lace, about a mile from the habita-
tion of the two nglishmen, where this escaped man
had been kept. As the Spaniard governor said, had
they been all there the damage would not have been
so much, for not a man of them would have escaped.
but the case differed now very much; for two men to
fifty were two much odds. The two men had the
happiness to discover them about a league 03, so that
it was above an hour before they landed, and as they
landed about a mile from their huts, it was sometime
before they could come at them. Now having great
reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first
thing they did was to bind the slaves which were left,
and cause two of the three men whom they brought
with the women, who, it seems, proved very faithful
to them, to lead them with their two wives, and whatp
ever they could carry away with then), to their re-
tired place in the woods, which I have spoken of
above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and
foot till they heard farther.

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come
on shore. and that they bent their course direcly that
way, they opened the fences where their milch-goat:
were kept, and drove them all out, leaving their goats
to struggle into the wood. whither they pleased, that
Ihc savages might think they were all bred wild; but

the rogue who name witl. them was too cunning for
that, and gave them an acct: .tnt ofit all, for they went
directly to the place.

When the poor frighted men had secured their wives
and goods, they sent the other slave they had of the
three, who came with the women, and who was at
their place by accident, away to the Spaniards with
all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy
help; and in the mean time they took theirarms,attd
what ammunition they had, and retreated towards
the place in the wood where their wives were sent,
keeping at a distance; yet so that they might see, if
possible. which way the savages took.

They had not ne farbut that, frame rising ground,
they could see t te little army ot'their enemies come
on directly to their habitation, and in a moment more
could see all their huts and household-stuff flaming up
together, to their great grief and ntortification; for
they had a very great loss, and to them irretrievahle

at least for some time.' They kept their station for a

while, till they found the Savages, like wild beasts,
spread themselves all over the place, rummaging
every way. and every place they could think of. it:
search for prey, and in particular for the people, of
whom it plainly appeared they had intelligence.

The two Englishmen, seeing this. thinking them>>
selves not secure where they stood, as it was likely
some of the wild people miglttcome that way, so they
might come too many together, thought it proper to
make another retreat about half a mile farther, be-
lieving, as it afterwards happened, that the farther
they strolled, the fewer would be together.
I'he next halt was at the entrance into a very thick
grown part of the woods, and where an old trunk of
I tree stood, which was hollow, and vastly largeg
and in this tree they both took thetr standing, resolv-
in to see what might offer.

hey had not stood there long, but two of the sap

wages appeared running directly that way. as if they
had already notice where they stood, and were com.l

ing up to attack them; and a little way farther they
espierl three more coming tiller them, and five more
lmyomlthcm, allcoming thesamewag; besideswhich,
they saw seven or eight more at a Istance, running
another way; for in a tvord, they ran every way,
like sportsmen beating for their game.

The poor men were now in gIeat perplexity, who.
ther they should stand and keep their posture, or fly- ,
hut after a very short debate with themselves, they
considered that if the savages ranged the country thus
before help came, they nIi-rht, perhaps, find out their
retreat in the woods, andb then all would be lost; so
they resolved to stand them there; and If there were
too many to deal with, then they would get to the top
of the tree, from whence they doubted not to defend
themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammuni-
tion lasted, though all the savages that were landed,
which were near titty, were to attack them.

Having resolved upon this, they next considered
whether they should fire at the two first, or wait for
the three,a and so take the middle party, by which the
two and the live that followed would be separated:
at length they resolved to let the two first pass by,
unless they should spy them In the tree, and come to
attack them. The two first savages also confirmed
them In this resolution, by turning a little from them
towards another part of the wood; but the three, and
the five after them, came forwards dIrectlyto the tree.
as if they had known the Englishmen were there.

Seeing them come so straight towards them, they
resolved to take them In a line as they came- and a:
they resolved to fire but one at a time, perhaps the
first shot might hit them all three; to which purpose,
the man who was to lire ut three or four bullets into
his piece, and having a fan loop hole, as it were, from
a broken hole In the tree, he took a sure aim, without
being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty
yards of the tree, so that he could not miss.

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came
on, they plainly saw, that one of the three was the

runaway savage that had escaped from them, and they

'both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, it'possi

ble, he should not escape, though they should both
fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that if
he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to
have a second.

But the first was too good a marksman to miss his
aim ; for as the savages kept near one another, a little
behind in a line, in a word he fired, and hit two of
them directly; the foremost waskilled outright, being
shot in the head ; the second, which was the runaway
Indian, was shot through the body and fell, but was
not quite dead; and the third had a little scratch in
the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that went
through the body of the second; and being dreadfully
frighted, though not much hurt, sat down upon the
ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.

The live that were behind, more frighted with the
noise than sensible of their danger, stood still at first;
for the woods made the sound a thousand times bigger
than it really was: the echoes rattlin from one side
to another, and the fowls rising from al arts, scream-
ing and making, every sort, a several ind of noise,
according to their kind; just as it was when l fired

However, all being silent again, and they not know

they came to that place where their companions lay,
in a condition miserable enough; and here the poor'
Ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were wrthin
reach of the same mischief, stood all of a huddle over
the wounded man, talking, and, as may be sup osed,
inquiring of him how he came to be hurt; an who
it is very rational to believe, told them that a flash of
fire fir'st, and immediately after that thunder from
their gods, had killed those two, and wounded him.

than that. as they saw no man near them, so they hat)

never heard a gun in all their lives, or so much as
heard of a gun ; neither knew they any thing of kill

ing or wounding at a distance with fire and bullets;
if they had, one might reasonably believe that they
would not have stood so unconcerned in viewing the
fate of their fellows without some apprehension at
their own.

. Ourtwo men, though as they confessed to me, it
grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor- crea

turcs, who at the same time had no notion of their
danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and
the first having loaded his piece again. resolved to let
fly both together among them, and singling out by
agreement which to aim at, they shot together, and
killed. or very much wounded four of them ; the fifth,
frighted even to death, though not hurt, fell with the
rest; so that our men, seeing them all fall together,
thought they had killed them all.

The beliefthat the savages were all killed made our
two men come boldly out from the tree before they
had charged their gunsagain, which was awrong step,
and they were under some surprise when they came
to the place and found no less than four of the men
alive, and of them two very little hurt. and one not
at all ; this obliged them to fall upon them with the
stocks of their muskets ; and first they made sure of
the runaway savage that had been the cause of all the
mischief, and of another that was hurt in his knee,
and put them out of their pain. Then the man that
was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them
with his two hands held up, and made piteous moan
to them by gestures and signs for his life, but could
not say one, word to them that they could understand.

However, they signified to hnn to sit down at the
fimtofa tree thereby; and one of the Englishmen,
with a piece of rope-twine which he had by great
chance in his. pocket, tied his feet fast together, and
his hands behind him, and there they left him ; and
with whatspeed they could, made after the other two
which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of

them, should find the way to their covered place in
the woods, where their wives and the few goods they

. had left, lay. They came once in sight of the two

men, but it was at a great distance; however they had
the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley to-
wards the sea, the quite contrary way from that which
led to their retreat. which they were afraid of; and
being satisfied with that. they went back to the tree
where they left their prisoner, who as they supposed
was delivered by his comrades; for he was gone, and
the two piecesofrope-yarn with which they had bound
him, lay just at the foot of the tree.

They were now in as great a concern as before, not
knowing what course to take, or how near the enemy"
might be, or in what numbers; so they resolved to go
away to the place where their wives were, to see if
all was well there, and to make them easy who were
in fright enough to he sure; for though the savages
Were their own country-folks, yet they were most ter-
ribly afraid of them, and perhaps the more, for the
knowledge they had of them.

When they came thither, they found the savage:
had been in the wood, and very near the place, but
had not'found it; for indeed it was inaccessible, by
the trees standing so thick, as before, unless the per-
sons seeking it had been directed by those that knew
it, which these were not; they found, therefore, every
thing very safe, only the-women in a terrible fright.
While they were here they had the comfort of seven
of the Spaniards coming to their assistance -. the other
ten with their servants. and old Friday, 1 mean FrL
day's lather, were gone in a body to defend their
bower, and the com and cattle that were kept there,
in case the savages should have roved over to that
side of the country; but they did not spread so far.
With the seven Spaniards came one of the savages,
who, asl said, were their prisoners formerly, and with
them also came the sav whom the Englishmen had
left bound' hand and act at the tree ; for it seems
they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven

men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along
with them, where, however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had done the two others, who were
left when the third run away. '

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them ;
and they were so afraid of their escaping, that they
thought they were under an absolute necessity to kill
them for their own reservation : however, the Spa-
niard governor wou d not consent to it; but ordered,
that they should be sent out ofthe way to my old cave
in the valley, and be kept there with two Spaniards
to guard them and give them food ; which was done;
and they were bound there hand and foot for that
night.

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen
were so encouraged, that they could not satisfy them-
selves, to stay any longer there; but taking five of the
Spaniatds, and themse ves, with four muskets and a
pistol among them, and two stout quarter staves, away
they went in quest of the ravages. And first, they
came to the tree where the men lay that had been
killed 3 but it was easy to see that some more of the
savages had been there; for the attempted to carry
their dead men away, and had ragged two of them
a good way, but had given it over; from thence they
advanced to the first rising ground where they had
stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where they
had the mortification still to see some of the smoke;
but neither could they here see any of the savages a
they then resolved, though with all possible caution,
to go forward towards their mined lantation; but a
little before they came thither, coming in sight of the
sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarking
again in their canoes, in order to be gone.

Theyseemed sorry at first that there was no way to
come at them to give them a parting blow ; but-upon
the whole were very well satisfied to be rid of them.

The poor Englishmen being new twice ruined, and
all their im rovements destroyed, the rest all agreed
to come aw help them to rebuild, and to assist them

were not yet noted for having the least inclination to
do any thing good, yet, as soon as they heard of it
(for they,living remote,ltnew nothing tillall was over),
came and offered their help and assistance, and did
very friendly work for several days to restore theil
habitations and make necessaries for them ; and thus
in a little time they were set upon their levs again.

About two days after this they had the farther sat-
Isfaction of seeing three of the savages' canoes some
driving on shore, and at some distance from them.

believe that they had met with a storm at sea, which
had overset some ofthem, for it blew very hard tho

owever, as some might miscarry, so on the other
hand enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as
well of what they had done, as of what happened to
them ; and to whet them on to another enterprise 0!
the same nature, which they. it seems, resolved to at
tempt, with sufficient force to carry all before them ,
for except what the first man told them of inhabitants,
they could say little to it of their own knowledge ;- for
they never saw one man, and the fellow being killed
that had affirmed it, they had no other witness to con-
firm it to them. ,

It was five or six monthsafter this before they heard
any more of the savages, in which time our men were
in hopes they had not forgot their former bad luck,
or had given over the hopes of better; when on a sud.
den'they were invaded with a most formidable fleet
of no less than twenty-eight canoes, full of savages,
armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, wooden
eu-ords.and such-like engines of war; and they brougll
such numbers with them. that in short it put all our
people into the utmost consternation. .

As they came on shore in the evening. and at the
easternmost side of the island, our men had that night
to consult and consider what to do ; and in the fim
place, knowing that their being entirely concealed was

now, while the number of their enemies was so great; '

they therefore resolved, first of all to take down the
huts which were built for the two Englishmen, and
drive away their goats to the old cave : because they
supposed the savages would go directly thither as soon
as it was day, to play the old game over again, though
they did not now land within two leagues of it.

In the next place, they drove away all the flock of
goats they had at the old bower, asl called it, which
belonged to the Spaniards ; and, in short, left as little
appearance of inhabitants any where as possible; and
the next morningearly they posted themselves with all
their force at the plantation of the two men, waiting
for their coming As they guessed so it happened:
these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east
end of the island, came ranging along the shore, di--

To their slaves they did not give either musket m

come into the fight, and they had hows entlrarrows
which the Spaniards had taken from the savages when
the first action happened, which i have spoken or
where the lndians fought with one another; and the

The Spaniard governor, whom I have described so
often, commanded the whole ; and William Atkins;
who, though a dreadful follow for wickedness, was a
most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him.

- The savages came forward like lions. and our men,
which was the worst oftheir fate, had no advantage

proved a most usefull flellow, with six men, was plank

Had William Atkins angahis men retired immedi .
ately, as soon as they had fired, as they were ordereo
to do ; or had the rest of the body been at hand to
have poured in their shot continually, the savages had
been effectually routed ; for the terror that was among
them came principally from this; viz. that they were
killed bythe ads with thunder and lightning, and
could see nobo y that hurt them : but William Atkins
staying to load again, discovered the cheat; some of
the savages who were at a distance, spyingthem,came
upon them behind; and though Atkins and his men
fired at them also, two or three times, and killed above
twenty retiring as fast as they could, yet they wound-
ed Atkins himself, and killed one of his fellow Eng-
lishmen with their arrows, as they did afterwards one
Spaniard, with one of the Indian slaves who came
with the women. This slave was a most gallant fel--
low, and fought most desperately, killing five of them
with his own hand, having no weapon but one of the
armed staves and a hatchet.

Our men being thus hard laid at,- Atkins wounded,

by their wounds, and fought like madmen.

When our men retreated, theyleft the Spaniard and
the Englishmen that were killed behind them ; and
the savages, when they came up to them, killed them
Overagain in a wretched manner, breaking their arms,
legs. and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords,
like true savages. But finding our men were gone,
they did not seem inclined to pursue them, but drew

themselves up in a kind of ring, which is. it seems,
their custom, and shouted twice in token of their vica
tory : after which, they had the modification to see
several of their wounded 'men fall, dying with the
mere loss of blood.

The Spaniard governor havingdrawn his little body
up together upon a. rising ground, Atkins though he
was wounded, would have had him march. and charge
them again all together at- once : but the Spaniard re-
plied, " Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded
men fight ; let them alone till mornin : all these
wounded men will be slit? and sore with t eirwounds,
and faint with the loss of blood, and so we shall hava
the fewer to engage."

The advice was good ; butWill Atkins replied mer-
rily, " That's true, Seignior, and so shall I too ; and
that's the reason I would go on while I am warm."--
"Well, Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, " you
have behaved gallantly, and done your nart; we will
fight for you, if you cannot come on ; but I think it
best to stay till morning :" so they waited.

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they
found the savages in great disorder about their dead
and wounded men, and a great hurry and noise amon
them where they lay, they afterwards resolved to fa
upon them in the night, especially if they could come
to give them but one volley before the were disco-
\ered. This th had a fair opportunity to do ; for
one of the two nglishmen,-in whose quarter it was

. where the fight began, led them round between the

woods and the see side, westward, and turning short

'south, they came so near where the thickest of them

lay, that before they were seen or heard, eight of them
fired in among them, and did dreadful execution upon
them ; in half a minute more eight others fired after
them, pouring in their small shot. in such a quantity,
that abundance were killed and wounded : and all this
while they were not able to see' who hurt them, or
which way to fly. ;

The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expo.-

dition, and then divided themselves into three bodies,
and resolved to fall in among them all together. They
had in each body eight persons; that is to say, twenty.
four, whereof were twentydwo men, and the two
women, who, by the way, fought desperately.

They divided the fire-arms equally in each (ferry,
and so of the halberts and staves. They woul have
had the women keep back; but they said they were
resolved to die with their husbands. Having thus
formed their little army, they marchedoutfrom among
the trees and came up to the teeth of the enemy,
shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. The
savages stood all together, butwere in the utmost con-
fusion, hearing the noise of our men shoutin from
three quarters to ether; they would have fought If they
had seen us ; arts as soon as they came near enough to
be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday
Wes wounded, though not dangerously. But our men
gave them no time, but running up to them, fired
among them three ways, and then fell in with the butt
ends of their muskets, theirswords, armed slaves, and
hatchets; and laid about them so well, that. in a word
they set up a dismal screaming and howling, fiyingtn
save their lives which way soever they could.

Our men were tired with the execution ; and killed,
or mortally wounded, in the two fights, about one
hundred and eighty of them : the rest, being frighted
out of their wits. scoured through the woods and over
the hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble feet
could help them to do ; and as we did not trouble our-
selves much to pursue them, they got all together to
the sea-side, where they landed, and where their
canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an end yet,
[or it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from
the sea-ward, so that it was im ossible for them to

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 9!

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet got little
rest that night; but havin refreshed themselves as
well as they could, they reso ved tomarch to that part
of the island where the savages were fled, and see
what posture they were in. This necessarily led them
over the place where the fight had been, and where
they found several of the poor creatures not quite
dead, and yet past recoveri ng life ; a sight disagreeable
enough to generous minds; for a truly great man,
though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his
enemy, takes no delight in his misery.

However, there was no need to give any order in
this case; for their own savages, who were their
servants, dispatched those poor creatures with their
hatchcts. .

At length they came in view of the place where the
more miserable remains of the savages' army lay,
where there appeared about one hundred still: their
posture was generall sitting upon the ground, with
their knees up towar s their mouth, and the head put
between the hands, leaning down upon the knees.

When our men came within two musket-shot at
them, the Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to
be fired without bail, to alarm them; this he did, that
by their countenance he might know what to expect,
viz. whether they were still in heart to fight, or were
so heartily beaten, as to bedispirited and discouraged,
and so he might manage accordingly.

This stratagem took; for as soon as the savages
heard the first gun, and saw the flash of the second,
they started up upon their feet in the greatest conster-
nation imaginable; and as our men advanced swiftly
towards them, they all ran screaming and yawling
away, with a kind of an howling noise, which our
men did not understand, and had never heard before;
and thus they ran up the hills into the country.

At first. our men had much rather the weather had

oeen calm, and they had all gone away to seat, but
they did not then consider. that this might probabl
have been the occasion of their coming again in suc
multitudes as not to be resisted; or, at least, to come
so many and so often, as would quite desolate the
island and starve them. Will Atkins therefore. who,
notwithstanding his wound, kept always with them,
proved the best counsellor in this case. His advice
was, to take the advantage that offered, and cla in
between them and their boats, and so deprive t rem
of the capacity of ever returning any more to plague
the island.

They consulted long about this, and some were
against it, for fear ofmaking the wretches fly into the
woods, and live there desperate; and so they should
have them to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir
about their business. and have their plantation eon-

tinuelly rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, in _

short, he reduced to a life of contiual distress.

Will Atkins told them they had better have to do
with one hundred men than with one hundred nations;
that as they must destroy their boats, so they must
destroy the men. or be all of them destroyed them-
selves. In a word. he shewed them the necessity 01
it so plainly, that they all came into it: so they went
to work immediately with the boats, and getting some
dry wood together from a dead tree, they tried to set
some of them on fire; but they were so wet that they
would scarce burn. However, the fire so burned the
upper part, that it soon made them unfit for swim-
ming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw
what they were about, some of them came runnin
out of the woods, and coming as near as they eoul
to our men, kneeled down and cried, 0a, 0a, Whi-
ramokoa, and some other words of their language,
which none of the others understood any thing of ;
but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises,
it was easy to understand they begged to have their
boats spared, and that they would be gone. and never

buns
But our men were now satisfied, that they had no
way to preserve themselves or to save their colony,
but effectually to prevent any of these people from
ever going home again ; depending upon this, that it
ever so much as one of them got back into their coun-
try to tell the story, the colony was undone; so that
letting them know that they should not have any
mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and de-
stroyed them, every one that the storm had not de-
stroyed before; at the sight of which the save es rais-
ed ahideous cry in the woods, which our peo e heard

lain enough; after which they ran about t 1e island
ike distracted men ; so that, in a word, our men did
not really know at first what to do with them.

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, corp
sider that while they made those people thus despe-
rate, they ought to have kept good guard at the same
time upon their plantations; for though his true they
had driven away their cattle, and the Indians did not
find their main retreat, I mean my old castle at the
hill, nor the cave in the valley; yet they found out
my plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to
pieces, and all the fences and planting about it; trod
all the corn under foot; tore up the vines and grapes,
being 'ust then almost ripe, and did our men an inesv
timab e damage, though to themselves not one fan-
things worth of service.

Though our men were able to fight them upon all
occasions, yet they were in no condition to pursue
them, or hunt them up and down; for as they were
too nimble of foot for our men when they found them
sinle, so our men durst not go about single for fear of
being surrounded with their numbers: the best was,
the had no weapons; for though they had bows they
ha no arrows left, nor any materials to make any,
nor had they any edged tool or weapon among them.

The extremity and distress they were reduced to
was great, and indeed deplorable, but at the same
time our men were also brought to very hard circum-
stances by them ; for though their reti'eats were pro-

served, yet their provision was destroyed, and then
harvest spoiled : and what to do or which way to turn
themselves. they knew not; the only refuge they had
now was the stock of cattle they had in the valley by
the cave, and some little corn which grew there. The
three Englishmen, William Atkins and his comrades,
were now reduced to two, one of them being ltilled
by an arrow, which struck him on the side of his
head, just under the temple, so that he never spoke
more ; and it was very remarkable, that this was the
same barbarous fellow who cutthe poor savage slave
with his hatchet,and'who afterwardsiutended to have
murdered the S raniards.

l look upon t eir case to have been worse at lhli
time than mine was atany time after I firstdiscovered
the grains of barley and rice and got into the method
of planting and raising my corn, and my tame cattle;
for now they had, as -I may say, an hundred wolves
upon the island, which would devour every thing they

could come at, yet could be very har'dly come at
themselves. '
The first thing they concluded when they saw what
their circumstances were, was, that they would, it
osstble, drive them up to the farther part of the
Island, south-east, that if any more savages came on
shore. they might not find one another; then that they
would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as manyof
them as they could come at, till they had reduced the
number; and if they could at last tame them, and
bring them to any thing, they would give them corn,

and teach them how to plant, and live upon their dai-
ly labour.

In order to this they followed them, and soterrified
them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of
them fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him,
yet he would fall down for fear; and so dreadfully
frighted they were, that they kept out of sight farther
and farther, till at last our men following them, and
every day almost. killing and wounding some ofthem.
they kep up in the woods and hollow places so much.

' that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of
' food; and many were afterwards found dead' in the 5
- woods, without any hurt, but merely starved to death.
; When our men found this it made their hearts re
_ - lent, and pity moved them ; especially the Spaniard
governor, who was the most gentleman-like,generous-
minded man that ever I met with in my life; and he
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and
ring him to understand what they meant, so far as to
_ be able to act as interpreter, and to go among them,
and see if they might be brought to some conditions
that might be depended upon to save their lives, and
do us no spoil.

It was some time before any of them could be
taken ; but being weak. and half starved, one ofthem
was at last surprised, and made a prisoner : he was
sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink ', but

finding himself kindly used, and victuals given him.
and no violence ofi'ered him, he at last grew tractable,
and came to himself. '

' They brought old Friday to him, who talked often
with him. and told him how kind the others would be
to them all : that they would net only save their lives,
but would give them a part of the island to live in,
provided they would give satisfaction ; that they
should keep in their owu bounds, and not come be-
yond them, to injure or prejudice others; and that
they should have corn given them, to plant and make
it grow for their bread. and some bread given them
for their present subsistence; and old Friday bade the

g fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen,
and hear what they said to it, assuring them that if
they did not agree immediately they should all be doc

Tlte poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and re-

were; the three Indian slaves carried them a large
quantity of bread, and some rice boiled up to cakes,
and dried in-thc sun, and three live goats; and they
were ordered to go to the side of an hill, where they
sat down,ate the provisions very thankfully. and were
the most faithful fellows to their words that could be
thou ht of ; for except when they came to beg victuals

nd irections, they never came out of their bounds ;
and there they lived when I came to the island, and I

went to see them.
They had taught them both to plant corn, make

bread, breed tame goats, and milk them ; they wanted
nothing but wives. and they soon'would have been a
nation: they were confined to a neck of land sur-

rounded with high rocks behind them, and lying plain -

towards the sea before them. on the south-east corner
ofthe island: they had land enough. and itwas very
good and fruitful : for they had a picce'ofland about
a mile and a half broad, and three or four miles in
ength.

Our men taught them to make wooden spades such
as I made for myself; and gave among them twelve
hatchets, and three or four knives; and there they
lived, the most subjected innocent creatures that were
ever heard of.

After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity
Willi respect to the savages. till I came to revisit them,
which was in about two years. Not but that now and
then some canoes of savages came on shore for their
triumphal, unnatural feasts ; but as they were of sev-
eral nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those
that came before, or the reason of it, they did not
make any search or inquiry after their countrymen;
and if they had. it would have been very hard for
them to have found them out.

Tints, I think. l havegiven a full account ofall that
happened to them to my return, at least that was worth
notice. The Indians, or savages, were wonderfully
civilized by them, and they frequently went among
them ; _ but forbid, on uain of death, any of the Indians

 

icoming to them, because they would not have their
settlement betrayed again.

One thing was very remarkable,viz.that they taught
the savages to make wickerswork, or baskets; but they
soon outdid their masters; for they made abundance
of most in enius things in wickemvork ; particularly
all sorts o baskets, sieves, bird-cages, cupboards, 6w.
as also chairs to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and
abundance of other things, being very ingenious a
such work when they were once put in the way of it.

My coming was a particular relief to these people,
because we furnished them with knives. seissars,
spades, shovels, pickaxes, and all things of that kind
1 which they could want.

1 With the help of these tools they were so very
I handy, that they came at last to build up their huts, or
g houses, very handsomely; raddling,-or working it up
like basket-work all the way round, which was a very
extraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked very
odd; but was an exceedin good fence, as well against
heat, as against all sorts o vermin ; and'our men were
so taken with it, that they got the wild savages to
come and do the like for them; so that when I came
to see the two Englishmen's's colonies, they looked,ata
distance. as if they lived all like bees in a hive : and
as for Will Atkins, who was now become a very in-
dustrions, necessary, and sober fellow, he had made
himself such a tent of basket-work as I believe was
never seen. It was one hundred and twenty paces
round on the outside, as i measured by my steps; the
walls were as close worked as a basket. in pannels or
squares, thirty-two in number, and very strong, stand-
ing about seven feet high : in the middle was another
not above twenty-two paces ronnd, but built stronger,
lreing eight-square in its form, and in the eight corners
stood eight very strong posts, round the top of which
he laid slrmtg pieces, joined together with wooden
pins. from which he raised a pyramid before the roof
of eight rafters, very handsome I assure you, and

joined together very wellI though he had no nails, and
only a few iron spikes, which he had made himself
too, out of the old iron that I had left there; and in-
deed this fellow shewed abundance of ingenuity in
.several things which he had no knowledge of ; he
made himself a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows
to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for his
work, and he formed out of' one of the iron crows a
middling good anvil to hammer upon ; in this manner
he made many things, but eSpectally hooks, staples
and spikes, bolts and hinges. But to return to the
house: after he pitched the roofol'his innermost tent,
he worked it up between the rafters with basket-work.
so firm. and thatched that over again so ingeniously
with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree,
which covered the top. that his house was as dry as
I'fit had been tiled or slated. Indeed he owned that
the savages made the basket work for him-

The outer circuit wascovcred, as alean-to,all round
this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the
thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house,
being about twenty feet distant; so that there was a
space like a walk within the outer wicker wall, and
without the inner, near twenty feet wide. .

The "inner place he partitoned ol'f witn the same
wicker-work, but much fairer, and divided into six
apartments, for that he had six rooms on a floor, and
out of every one of these there was a door: first, into
the entry, orcoming into the main tent; and another
door into the space or walk that was round it; so that
this walk was also divided into six equal parts, which
served not only {or a retreat, but to store up any nea
.ccssaries which the family had occasion for. These
six spaces not taking up the whole circumferencemhat
other apartments the outer circle had, were thus or-
dered : as soon as you were in at the door pt" the outer
circle, you had a shon passage straight before you to
the door of the inner house; but on either side was a

and about thirty feet long, and through that into an
other not quite so long : so that in the outercircle were
ten handsome rooms,. six of which were only to be
come at through the apartments of the inner tent, and
served as closets or retired rooms to the respective
chambers of the inner circle; and four large ware-
houses or barns, or what you please to call them, which
went in through one another. two on either hand or
the passage that led through the outer door to the in-
ner tent.

Such a piece ofbasket-work, I believe, was never
seen in the world; nor an house or tent so neatly can
trivcd, much less so built. In this great beehive lived
three families; that is to say, Will Atkins and his
companions; the third was killed, but his wife re-
mained with three children; for she was, it seems,
big with child when he died, and the othertwo were
not at all backward to give the widow her full share
of every thing, I mean as to theircorn, milk,grapes, (to.
and when they killed a kid, or found a turtle on the
shoreyso that they all lived well enough, though it
was true, they were not so industrious as the other
two, as has been observed already.

One thing, how'ever, cannot be omitted, viz. that,
as for religion, I don't know that there was any thin

of that kind among them; hey pretty often indee '

put one another in mind that there was a God, by the

_ very common method of seamen, viz. swearing by his

name; nor were their poor, ignorant, savage wives
much the better for having been married to Christian
as we must call them ; for as they knew very little 0
"God themselves, so they were utterly incapable ofen-
eriug into any discourse with their wives about a
God, or to talk any thing to them concerning religion.
The utmost of all the improvement which I can say
the wives had made from them, was, that they had
taught them to speak English pretty well ; and all the
children they had, which were near twenty in all
were taughtto speak English too, from tlteirfirst learn
mg to speak, though they at first spoke it in a very

broken manner, like their mothers. There were none
of those children above six years old when I came
thither; for it was not much above seven years that
they had fetched these five savage ladies over, but they
had all been pretty fruitful, for they had all children,
more or less: I think the cook's mate's wife was bi
of her sixth child ; and the mothers were all a goo
sort of well-governed, quiet, laborious women, modest
and decent, hel ful to one another, mighty observant
and subject to t eir meters, I cannot call them hus-
bands; andwanted nothing but to be well instructed
in the Christian religion, and to be legally married;
both which were happily brought about afterwards
by my means, or at least by the consequence of my
coming among them

Having thus given an account of the colony in ge-
neral, and pretty much of my five runagate English-
men, I must say something ofthe Spaniards, who were
the main body of the family, and in whose story there
are some incidents also remarkable enough.

I had a great many discourses with them about their
circumstances when they were among the savages;
they told me readily, that they had no instances to
give of their application or ingenuity in that country -
that they were a poor, miserable, dejected handful oi
people ; that if means had been put into their hands,
they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair, and
so sunk under the weight of their misfortunes, that
they thought of nothing but starving. One of them, a
grave and very sensible man, told me he was convinc-
ed they were in the wrong; that it was not the part
of wise men. to give up themselves to their misery,
but always to take hold of the helps which reason of-
fered, as well for present support, as for future deli;
verance; he told me that grief was the most senseless
insignificant passion in the world, for that it regarded
only things past, which were generally impossible to
be recalled or to be remedied, but had no view to
things to come, and had no share In any thing that
looLed like deliverance, but rather added to the afllic-

tion than proposed a remedy; and upon this he re
peated a Spanish proverb, which though I cannot re-
peat in just the same words that he spoke it, yet]
remember Imade it into an English proverb of my
own, thus:

In trouble to be troubled,
Is to have your trouble doubled.

He then ran on in remarks upon all the little im-
provements I had made in my solitude; my unwea-
ried application, as he called it, and how I had made
a. condition, which in its circumstances was at first
much worse than theirs, a thousand times more hap.
py than theirs was, even now when they were all to-
gether. He told me it was remarkable that Englislt~

than any people that ever he met with; that their unhap

Erovisions though no people; that is say, that the

paniards of Trinidad had frequently been there, and
filled the island with goats and hogs at several times,
where they have bred in such multitudes, and where
turtle and sea-{owls were in such lenty that they
could have been in no want of flesh t tough they had
found no bread ; whereas herethey were only sustain-
ed with a fetv roots and herbs, which they understood
not, and which had no substance in them, and which
the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough, and who
could treat them no better unless they would turn
cannibals, and eat men's flesh, which was the great
dainty of the country. .

They gave me an account how many ways they
strove to civilize the savages they were with, and to
teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of
living, but in vain; and how they retorted it upon
them as unjust, that they, who came thither for assist-
ance and support, should attempt to set up for instruc-
hrs of those that gave them bread; intimating, it
seems, that none should set up for the instructors or
others but those who could live without them.

.They gave' me dismal accounts of the extremities
mey were driven to; how sometimes they were many
days without any food at all, the island they were
upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived
more indolent, and for that reason were less supplied
with the necessaries of life than they had reason to be-
lieve others were in the same part ofthe world ; and
yet they found that these savages were less ravenous
and voracious than those who had better supplies 01
food. - '

Also they added. that they could not but see with
what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the go-

verning providence of God directs the event of things j
in the world, which they said apreared in their cir- ~
e t

cumstances; for if, pressed by th ardships they were
under, and the barrenness of the country where they
were. they had searched after a better place to live in.
they had then, been out of the way of the relief that
ha ened to them by my means.

hen they gave me an account how _the. savages
whom they lived among expected them to go out
with them into their wars ; and it was trtte, that as
they had fire-arms with them, had they not had the
disaster to lose theirammunition, they should not have
been servieahle only to their friends. but have made
themselves terrible both to friends and enemies; but

'bein without owder and shot, and in a condition
g d) r

that they coul not in reason deny to go out with their
landlords to their wars ; when they came in the field
of battle they were in a worse condition than the sa-
vages themselves. for they neither had bows nor ar-
rows. nor could they use those the savages gave them,
so that they could do nothing but stand Sllll and be
wounded with arrows, till they came up to the teeth
of heir enemy ; and then indeed the three halberts
they had were of use to them, and they would often
drive a whole little army before them with those hal-
herts and sharpened sticks put into the muzzle: of

their muskets : but that for'all this. the were some-
Y

times surrounded with multitudes. and in great danger
from their arrows; till at last they found the way to
make themselves large targets of wood, which they
covered with skins of wild heasts, whose names they
knew not, and these covered them from the arrow":
of the savages: that notwithstanding these, they were
sometimes in great danger, and were once five of
them knocked down together with the clubs of the sa-
vages, which was the time when one of them was
taken prisoner. that is to say, the Spaniard whom l
had relieved; that at first they thought he had been

killed. but when afterwards they heard he was taken
prisoner they were under the greatest grief imagina-

le, and would willingly have all ventured their live:
to have rescued him.

They told me, that when they were so knocked
down, the rest of their company rescued them, and
stood over them fighting till they were come to them-
selves, all but he who they thought had been dead
and then they made their way with their halberts an
pieces standing close together in a line, through a

ody of above a thousand savages, beating down all
that came in their way, got the victory over their eno-
mies, but to their great sorrow, because it was with
the loss oftheir friend; whom the other part , finding
him alive, carried off with some others, as gave an
account in my former.

They described, most affectionately, how they were
surprised with joy at the return of their friend and
companion in misery, who they thought had been de-
voured by wild beasts of the worst kind, viz. by wild
men; and yet how more and more they were sur-
prised with the acconnt he gave them of his errand,
and that there was a Christian in a place near. much
more one that was able, and had humanity enough to
contribute to their deliverance.

They described how they were astonisbned at the
Si ht. of the relief i sent them. and at the appearance
of5 loaves of bread, things they had not seen since their
coming tothat miserable place; how often theycrossed
it, and blessed it as bread sent from heaven; and
what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste
it, as also of the other things I had sent for their sup.
ply. And, after all, they would have told me some-
thing of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat
and pilots to carrythem away to the person and place
from whence all these new comforts came ; but they
told me it was impossible to express it by words, for
their excessive joy driving them to unbecoming ex-
travagances, they had no way to describe them but
by telling me that they bordered upon lunacy, having

no way to give vent to their passion suitable to the
sense that was upon them ; that in some it worked on.
way, and in some another ; and that some of them,
through a. surprise of joy, would burst out into tears;
others .be half mad, and others immediately faint.
This discourse extremely afi'ected me, and called to
my mind Frida 's ecstaey when he met his father, and
the poor peop e's ecstasy when I took them up at
sea. after their ship was on fire ; the mate of the ship's
joy, when he found himself delivered in the place
where he expected to perish; and my .own joy, when
after twenty-eight years captivity I found a good ship
ready to carry me to .my own country. All these
thing made me more sensible of the relation of these
poor men, and more eITeoted with it.
Having thus given a view of the state of thin s as
I found them, I must relate the heads of what did
for these people, and the condition in which I left
them. It was their opinion, and mine too that they
would be troubled no more with the savages; or that,
if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if
they were twice as many as before; so that they had
no concern about that. Then I entered into a serious
discourse with the Spaniard whom [called governor,
about their stay in the island ; for as l was notcome
to carry any of them off, so it would not he just to
carry off some and leave others, who perhaps would
De unwillin to stay if their strength was diminished.
0n the otter hand I told them, I came to establish
them there, not to remove them; and then I let them
know that I had brought with me relief of sundry
kinds for them ; that I had been at a great charge to
upply them with all things necessary, as well fortheir
onvenience-as their defence; and that I had such
articular persons with me, as well to increase and
recruit their number, as by the particular necessary
employments which they were bred to, being artifi-
ficcrs, to assist them in those things in which at pro-
Icn hey were to seek.

They were all together when I talked thus to them
and before] delivered to them the stores I had brought,
I asked them, one by one, .if they had entirely forgot

. and buried the first animosities that had been amon '
them, and could shake hands with one another, an
engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, so
that there might be no more misunderstandings or
jealousies.

, William Atkins, with abundance of frankness and
good humour, said, they had met with afllictiom
enough to make them all sober, and enemies enon h
to make them all friends; that for his part he wou d-
live and die with them ; and was so far from design-
ing any thing against the S aniards, that he owned
they had done nothing to him but what his own bed
humour made necessary, and what he would have
done, and perhaps much worse, in their case: and
that he would ask them pardon, if I desired it, for ths
foolish and brutish thing he had done to them ; and
was very willing and desirous of living on termstl
entire friendship and union with them ; and would do
any thing that lay in his power, to convince them 01
it: and as forgoing to England, he cared not if he did
not go thither these twenty years.

The Spaniards said, they had indeed at first disarm
ed and excluded William Atkins and his two coun
trymen, for their ill conduct, as they had let me know;
and they appealed to me for the necessity they were
under to do so; but that William Atkins had behaved
himself so bravely in the great fight they had with the
savages, and on several occasions since, and had
shewed himself so faithful to, and concerned for the
general interest of them all, that they had forgotten all
that waspast, and thought he merited as much to be
trusted with arms. and Supplied with necessaries, as ,
any of them ; and that they had testified their satisfao
tion in him, by committing the command to him,
next'to the governor himself : and as they had an en-
tire confidence in, him and all his countrymen. so they

all the methods thathonest men could merit to be va-
lued and trusted; and they most heartily embraced c
the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they
would never have any interest separate from one
another; .
Upon these frank and open declarations of friend~
ship, we a pointed the next day to dine all together
and indee we made a splendid feast. I caused the
5 ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and dress
our dinner. and the old cook's mate we had on shore 5
assisted. We brought on shore six pieces of good 5
beef, and four pieces of pork, out of-the ship's fEJrovi- g
sion, with our punch-bowl, and materialsto ll itg r
5 and, in particular, I gave them ten bottles of French g
$ claret. and ten bottles of Engish beer, things that '
5 neither the Spaniards nor the nglishmen had lasted g
5- for many years; and which it may be supposed they '
5 were exceeding glad of.

which the cooks roasted; and three of them were 5
sent, covcrsd up close, on board our ship to the sea-
men, that they might feast on fresh meat from on g
i shore, as we did with their salt meat from on board.
- After this feast, at which we were very innocently
g merry, l.brought out my cargo of goods, wherein,.
i that there might be no dispute about dividing, I shew-

g desired that they might all take an equal quantity of

to make every one of them four shirts; and, at the

they should make more, at they thought fit. The like
lbr pumps, shoes, stockings, and hats. &c.

I cannot express what pleasure, what satisfaction,
sat upon the countenances ofall these poor men when
they saw the care I had taken of them, and how well
I had furnished them ; they told me l was a father to
them; and that having such a correspondent asI was,
in so remote a part of the world, it would make them
forget that they were left in a desolate place : and they

all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place .

without my consent;

Then I presented to them the people I had brought
with me, particularly the tailor. the smith, and the
two carpenters, all of them most necessary people;
but above all, my general artificer, than whom they
could not name any thing that was more needful to
them ; and the tailor, to shew his concern for them,
went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made
them every one a shirt the first thing he did; and,
which was still more, he taught the women not only
how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made
them assist to make the shirts for their husbands and
for all the rest.

As for the carpenters, I scarce need mention how
useful they were, for they took in pieces all my clumsy
unhandy things, and made them clever convenient
tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, shelves,
and every thing they wanted of that kind. .

But to, let them see how nature made artificers at
first, I carried the carpenters to see William Atkin's
basket-house, as I called it, and they both owned they
never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity be-
fore, nor any thing so regular and so handily built.
It least of its kind; and one of them, when he saw it
after musing a good while, turning about to me, "I
am 'sure," says he, "that man has no need of us;
you need do nothing but give him tools.

Then I brought them out all my store oftools, and

un'wrought iron fora supply.

My magazine of powder and arms which lbrought
them, was such, even to rofusion, that they could
not but rejoice at them; or now they could march,
as I used to do. with a musket u on each shoulder, if
there was ocnasion . and were ah e to fight a thousand
savages, if they had but some little advantage of sit-
tuation, Which also they could not miss of if they had
occasion. '

I carried on shore with me the young man whose
mother was starved to death, and the maid also: she
was a sober, well-educated, religious young woman,
and behaved so inofi'ensively, that every one gave her
a good word. She had, indeed, an unhappy life with
us, there being no women in the shi but herself; but
she bore it with patience. Afters. while, seeing things
so well ordered. and inso fine a way of thriving upon
my island, and considering that they had neither but

for taking so long a voyage; I say, considering all
this, both of them came to me, and desired 1 would
give them leave to remain on the island, and be en.-
tet'ed among my family, as they called it.

I agreed to it readily, and they had a little plot of
ground allotted to them, where they had three tents or

saded like Atkins's, and adjoining to his plantat'oxl
Their tents were contrived so, that they had each 0!

\0 eat and drinkin. And now the other two Eng
lishmen moved their habitation to the same place, and
so the island was divided into three colonies, and no
more; viz. the Spaniards with old Friday, and the
first servants, at my old habitation under the hill,
which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they
had so enlarged and extended their works, as well
under as on the outside of the hill. that they lived,
though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. Never
was there such a little city in a wood,. and so hid, I
believe, in any part of the world; for I verily believe
a thousand men might have ranged the island a month,
and if they had not known there was such a thing,
and looked on purpose for it, they would not have
found it; for the trees stood so thick and so close, and
grew so fast matted intoone another, that nothing but
cutting them down first, could discover the place, ex-
cept the two narrow entrances where they went in
and out, could he found, which was not very easy.
One of them was just down at the water's edge, on the
side of the creek ; and it was afterwards above two
hundred yards to the place ; and the other was up the
ladder at twice, as I have already formerly described
it 3 and they had alarge wood, thick planted, also on
the top of the hill, which contained above an acre,
which grew apace,'and covered the place from all dis-
covery there, with only one narrow place between
twlo trees, not easy to be discovery, to enter on that
en e. v

The other colony was that of \Vill Atkins, where
there were four families ofEnglishmen, I mean them
l had .eft there, with their wives and children ; thre'
savages that were slaves : the widow and children 0
the Englishman that was killed; the young man and
the maid ; and by the way, we made a wife of he)
also before we went away. There were also the two
carpenters and the tailor, whom I brought with me
for them ; also the smith, who was a very necessary
man to them, especially as the uunsmith, to take care
of their arms; and my other man, whom I called

Jack of all Trades, who was himself as good almost
as twenty men, for he was not only a very in enious
fe low but a very merry fellow; and before went
Iway we married him to the honest maid that came
with the youth in the ship, whom I mentioned before.
.And now I speak of marrying, it brings me natu-
rally to saw something of the French ecclesiastic that
I had brought with me out of the-ship's crew whom
I took at sea. It is true, this mun wasa Roman, and
perhaps it may give offence to some nereafter, if!
eave any thing extraordinary upon record of a man,
whom, before I begin,[ must (to set him out in just
colours) represent interms very much to his disadvan-
tage in the account of Protestants ; as, first, that he
wasa Papist; secondly a 1'0pish priest; and thirdly,
a French l'opish priest.

But justice demands of me, to give him a due cha-
racter ; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious,
and most religious person ; exact in his life, extensive
in his charity, and exemplary in almost every thing

, he did. What then can any one say against my being

very sensible oftho value of such a man, notwith-
standing his profession ? though it may be my Opin-
ion, perhaps as well as the opinion of others who
shall read this, that he was mistaken.

The first hour thatl began to converse with him,
after he had agreed to go with me to the East Indies,
I found reason to delight exceedingly in his conver-
sation ; and he first began with me about religion, in
the most obliging manner imaginable.

" Sir." says he, " you have not only, under God"
(and at that he crossed his breast), " saved my life,

ut you have admitted me to go this voyage in your
hip, and by your obligingcivility have taken me into
your family, giving me an opportunity of free con-V
versarion. Now, Sir," says he, " you see by my
habit what my profession is, and I guess by your na-
tion what yours is. I may think it is my duty, and
doubtless it is so. to use my utmost endeavours on I"
occasions to bring all the souls that I can to the know-

triue; but as lam here under your permission, and in
your family, 1 am bound in justice to your kindness,
as well as in decency and good manners, to be under
your government ; and therefore I shall not, without
your leave, enter into any debates on the points of re-
ligion. in which we may not agree, farther than you

_. shall give me leave." g

I told him his carriage was so modest that] could

not but acknowledge it; that it was true, we were

such peo ile as they call heretics, but that he was not

the first atholic that I had conversed with without

falling into any inconveniences, or car ing the ques

tions to any height in debate; that he s ould not find

himself the worse used for being of a difi'erent opinion

from us; and if we did not converse without any are

like on either side, upon that score, it would be his

fault, not ours. ' ,

He replied, that he thought our conversation mi ht

be easily separated from disputes; that it was not is

business to cap principles with every man he dis-

coursed with ; and that he rather desired me to con-

verse withhim as a gentleman than as a religima: ,

thatifl would give him leave at any time to dis-

course upon religious subjects, he would readily com- ,

ply with it; and that then he did not doubt but I would

allow him also to defend his own opinions as well as

he could; but that without my leave he would not

break in upon me with any such thing.

He told me farther, that he would not cease to do

all that became him in his office as a priest as well

as a private Christian, to procure the good of the Shir.

and the safety of all that was in her; and though per

haps we would not join with him, and he could not

ray with us, he hoped he might pray forus, which

he would do upon all occasions. In this manner we

conversed ; and as he was of a most obliging gentle-

man-like behaviour, so he was if I ma be allowed

to say so, a man of good sense, and, as believe. 0!
great learning.

He ave me a most diverting account of his life,
and o the many extraordinary events of it; of many
ldventures which had befnllen him in the few yea-rs
that he had been abroad in the world,and particularly
this was very remarkable ; viz. that during the voy~
age he was now engaged in he had the misfortune to
be five times shipped and unshipped, and nevertogo
to the place whither any of the ships he was in were
at firstdesigned : that his first intent was to have gone
to Martinico, and that he went on board a shi bound
thither at St. Maloes; but being forced into Lisbon in
bad weather, the ship received some damage by run-
ring aground in the mouth of the river Ta us, and
was obliged to unload her cargo there: that ndinga
Portuguese ship there, bound to the. Madeiras. and
ready to sail, and supposing he should easily meet wrth
I vessel there bound to Martinico, he went on board
in order to sail to the Madeiras; butthe master ofthe
Portuguese ship being but an indifferent mariner, had
been out of his reckoning, and they drove to Fyal j
where, however, he happened to find a very good
market for his cargo, which was com. and therefore
resolved not to go to the Madeiras. but to load salt at
the isle ofMay, to go away to Newfoundland. He
had no remedy in the exigence but to go with the ship,
and had a pretty good voyave as far as the Banks. (so
they call the place where t tey catch the fish) where
meeting with a French ship bound from France to
Quebec, in the river of Canada, and from thence to
Martinico to carry provisions, he thought he should
have an opportunity to complete his first design. But
when he came to Quebec the master of the ship died,
and the ship proceeded no farther. So the next voy-
age he shipped himself for France, in the ship that
was burnt, when we took them up at sea. and then
shipped them with us {or the East Indies, as I have
already said. Thus he had been disappointed in five
voyages. all. as I may call it, in one voyage. besides
what I shall have occasion to mention farther of the
lame person.

stories which have no relation to my own. I return

me one morning, for he lodged among us all the while
we were upon the island, and it he pened to he just
when I was going to visitthe Englishmen's colony at
the farthest part of the island; I say he came to me,
and told me with a very grave countenance, that he
had for two or three days desired an op ortunity of
some discourse with me. which he hoped1 would not
be displeasing to me, because he thought it might in
some measure correspond with my general design,
which was the prosperity of my new colony, and per-
haps might put it at least more than he yet thought it
was in the way of God's blessing.

[looked a little surprised at the last part ofhis dia-

I, "can it he said, that we are not in the way of

" Ifyou ll'ld pleased, Sir," said he, with a "world
of modesty and yet with great readiness, " to have

seemed so sincere, and was really so religious in its
own nature, thatl was very sorry I had interrupted
him, and begged him to go on; and in the meantime.
because it seemed that what we had both to say might
take up some time, I told him I was going to the Eng-
!Eshmens' plantation, and asked him to go with me,
and we might discoure of it by the way. He told
me he would more willingly wait on me thither be-
cause there, partly, the thing was acted which he de-
sired to speak to me about. So we walked on, and l
ressed him to be free and plain with me in what he
ad to say.

" Why then, Sir," says he, " be pleased to give me
eave to lay down a few pr0pnsitions as the foundation
of what I have to say, that we may not differ in the
general Principles, though we may be of some differ~
ing opimons'in the practice ofparticulars. First, Sir,
though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of
religion. and it is very unhappy that it is so, especially
in the case before us, as I shall shew afterwards, yet
there are some general principles in which we both
agree ; viz. first, that there is a God, and that this
God, having given us some stated general rules for our
service and obedience, we ought not willingly and
knowingly to offend him, either by neglecting to do
what he has commanded, or by doing what he has ex-

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told
him I granted all he had said; andthanked him that
he would so far concern himself for us; and be ed
he would explain the particulars of what he ha ob-
served, that, like Joshua, (to take his own parable) I
might ut away the accursed thing from us.

" y then, Sir," says he, "I will take the liberty
you give me; and there are three things which, if I am
right, must stand in the way of God's blessing upon
your endeavours here, and which 1 should rejoice, for
your sake, and their own to see removed. And, Sir,"
says he, " I promise myself that you will fully agree
with me in them all as soon asI name them; especi-
ally because I shall convince you that every one of
them may with great ease, and very much to your
satisfaction, h 2 remedied."

He gave me no leave to put in any more civilities,
but went on : " First, Sir," says he, "you have here
four Englishmen, who have fetched women from
among the savages, and have taken them as their
wives, and have had many children by them all, and
yetare not married to them afterany stated legal man-
ner, as the laws of God and inan require; and there-
S'ore are yet, in the sense of both, no less than adulte-
rers, and living in adultery, To this, Sir," says he,
" lknow you will object, that there was no clergyman
or priest of any kind, or of any profession, to perform
the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to wit>>
down a contract of marria e, and have it si ned bo-
tween them. And I know also, Sir, what the panir rd
governor has told you; I mean of the agreement that

e obliged them to make when they took these "'0-
men, viz. that they should choose them out by con.
sent, and keep separately to them; which, by the way.
is nothing of a marriage, no agreement with the wo.
men as wives, but only an agreement among theme
selves, to keep them from uarreling.

" But, Sir, the essence ogthe sacrament of matrl.'

obligation that there is in the contract to compel the
man and woman at all times to own and acknowledge
each other ', obliging the man to abstain from all othel.
women, to enga e in no other contract while these
subsist ; and on aft occasions, usability allows, to ro-
vide honestly for them and their children ; an to
oblige the women to the same, on like conditions, mi>>
tatis mutandz's on their side.

" Now, Sir," says he, " these men may, when they
please, or when occasion presents, abandon these wo-
men, disown their children, leave them to perish, and
take other women and marry them whilst these are
living." And here he added, with some warmth,
" How, Sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty?
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in
this place, however good in themselves, and howevel
sincere in ycur design, while these men, who at pro.
sent are (your subjects under your absolute govern-
ment an dominion, are allowed by you to live in
open adultery ?" -

I confess I' was struck at the thing itself, but much
more with the convincing arguments he su ported it
with. For it was certainly true, that thoughJ they had
no clergyman on the spot, yet a formal contract on
both sides, made before witnesses, and confirmed by
any token which they had all agreed to be bound by,
though it had been but the breaking a stick between
them, engaging the men to own these women for their
wives upon all occasions. and never to abandon them
or their children, and the women to the same with
their husbands, had been an effectual lawful marriage.

was not done. '

But i thought to have gotten off with my young
priest by telling him. that all that part was done when

was not- here ; and they had lived so many years
with them now, that if it was adultery it was past re
medy. they could do nothing in it now.

" Sir," says he, " asking your pardon for such t'ree

dom, you are right in this; that it being done In your

absence, you could not be charged with that part of-

the crime. But I beseech you, flattter not yourself
that you are not therefore under an obligation to do
your uttermost now to put an end to it. How can
you think, but that, let the time past lie on whom it
will, all the guilt for the future will lie entirely upon
you? Because it is certainly in your power now to put
an end to it, and in nobody's power but yours."

I was so dull still, thatl did not take him right, but
I imagined that by putting an end to it he meant that
I should part them, and not suffer them to live toge-
ther any longer; andl said to him I could not do that
by any means, for that it would put the whole island
in confusion. He seemed surprised that I should so
far. mistake him. "No, Sir,' says he, "I do not
mean that you should separate them, but legally and
effectually marry them now. And, Sll', as my way
of marrying may not be so easy to reconcile them to,
though it will be as effectual even by your own laws;
so your way may be as well before God, and as valid
among men; I mean by a. written contract signed by
both man and woman, and by all the witnesses pre-
sent; which all the laws of Europe would decree to

be valid." -

l was amazed to see so much true piety, and so
much sincerity of zeal, besides the unusual impartial-
ity in his discourse, as to his own party or church,
and such a true warmth for the preserving people
that he had no knowledge of or relation to; I say, for
preservingthem from transgressing the laws of. God;
the like ofwhich I had indeed not metwith any where.
But recollecting what he had said of marrying them
by a written contract, which [knew would stand too,
I returned it back upon him and told him I granted
all that he had said to be just. and on his part very
kind; that I would discourse with the men upon the
point now when I came to them. And I knew no
reason why they should sample to let him marry them

all ; which I knew well enough would be granted to
be as authentic and vallid in England as if they were
married by one of our own clergyman. What was
afterwards done in this matter I shall speak of by
itself. '
I then pressed him to tell me what was the secona
complaint which he had to make, acknowledgingl
was very much his debtor for the first, and thanked
h.m heartily for it. He told me he would use the
same freedom and plainness in the second, and hoped
I would take it as well; and this was, that notwith-
standing these English subjects of mine, as he called
them, had lived with these women for almost seven
years, and had taught them to speak English, and even
to read it, and that they were, as he perceived, wo-
men of tolerable understanding and capable of in-
struction; yet they had not to this hour taught them ,
anything of the Christian religion; no not so much
as to know that. there was a God. or a worship, or in
what manner God was to be served ; or that their own
Idolatry, and worshiping they knew not who, was
false and absurd. .
This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and
what .God would certainly call them to an account
for; and perhaps at last take the work out of their
hands. He spoke this very affectionately and warmly.
. " Lam persuaded," says he, " had those men lived in
the savage country whence their wives came, the sa-
vages would have taken more pains to have brought -
them to be idolaters. and to worship the devil, than i
any ofthese men, so far as I can see, has taken with
them to teach them the knowledge of the true God. .'
Now, Sir," said he, " though! do not acknowledge
your religion. or you mine, yet we should be all glad ' _
to see the devil's servants, and the subjects of his king-
dom, taught to know the general principles of the
Christian reli ion; that the might at least hearo _

of a future state, things which we all believe; the) E

had at least been so much nearer coming into the bos-
som of the true church, than they are now in the pub-
lic profession of idolatry and devil-worship."

I could hold. no longer; I took him in my arms,
and embraced him with an excess of passion. " How
far," said I to_ hint, " have I been from understand-
ing the most essential art of a Christian, viz. to love
the interest of the Christian church, and the good of
other men's souls ! I scarce have known what belongs
to being a Christian."--" 0, Sir, do not say so." re li-
ed he; " this thing is not your-fault."---"No,"sai I-,
" but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you?"
--" It is not too late yet," said he; " he not too for-
ward to condemn yourself."--" But what can he done
now ?" said I; " you see-I am going away."----" Will
you give me leave," said-he, " to talk with these poor-
men about it."--" Yes, with all my heart," said I,
" and I will oblige them to give heed to what you say
too.'.'--" As to that," said he. " we must leave them
to the mercy ofChrist; but it is our business to assist
them, encourage them, and instruct them; and if you
will give me leave, and God his blessing, I do not
doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought
home into the great circle of Christianity, if not into
the articular faith that we all embrace; and that even
whi c you stay here." Upon this I said, " I shall not

only give you leave, but give you a. thousand thanks-

for it." What followed on this account [shall men
tion also again in its place.

I now pressed him for the third article in which we
were to blame. " Why really," says he, " it is 0!
the same nature, and I will proceed (askingyour leave)
with the same plainness as before: it is about yout
poor savages yonder, who are, as I may say, your
conquered subjects. It is a maxim, Sir, that is. or

of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most
hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence
among murderers and barbarians, to teach them the
knowledge of the true God, and to bring them over to

- l was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one
word to say; I had here a spirit of true christian
zeal for God and religion before me, let his particular
principles be of what kind soever. As for me, I had
not so much as entertained a thought of this in my
heart before, and I believe I should nothave thought of
it; for I looked upon these savaees as slaves. and
people whom, had we any work or them to do, we
would have used as such, or would have been glad to
have transported them many other part of the world:
for our business was to get rid of them, and we would
all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any
country, so they had never seen their own. But to
the case : I say [was confounded at his discourse. and
knew not what answer to make him. He looked ear-
nestly at me, seeing me in some disorder; "Sir,"
said he, " I shall be very sorry, if what I have said
gives you any oli'ence."--" No, no," said I, "I am
offended with nobody but myself; but I am perfectly
confounded, not only to think that I should never take
any notice of this before, but with reflecting what no
tice I am able to take of it now. You know, Sir,"
said I, " what circumstances I am in: I am bound to
the East indies. in a ship freighted by merchants, and

to detain their ship here, the men lying all this while

true, -I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and il
1 stay more i must pay 31. sterling per diem demur-
ra'ge; nor can 1 stay upon demurrage above eight days
more, and l have been here thirteen days already; so
that I am perfectl ' unable to engage in this work, un-
less I would su er myself to be left behind here
again ; in which case, if this single ship should misg
carry in any part of her voyage, I should be just in
the same condition that I was left in here at first, and
from which 1 have been so wonderfully delivered."

He owned the case was very hard upon me as to
my voyage, but laid it home upon my Conscience,
whether the-blessing of saving seven-and-thirty souls
was not worth {my venturing all I had in the world.
for? I was not so sensible of that as he was, and I
returned upon him tbus : '5 Why, Sir, it isa valuable
thing indeed to be an instrument inGod's hand to con- -
vert seven-and-thirty heathens to the knowledge of
Christ ; but as you are an coolesinstic, and are given
over to that work, so that it seems naturally to {all
into the way of your profession, how is it then that
you do not rather ofl'er yourself to undertake it, than
press me to it P"

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as he .
walked along and putting me to a full stop, made me
a very low bow: " I most heartily thank God, and
you, Sir," says he, " for giving me so evident a call
to so blessed a work ; and if you think yourself dio-
charged 'from it and deisre me to undertake it, I will
most readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all
the hazards and difficulties of such a broken disapv
pointed voyage as I have met with, thatl have drop-
ped at last into so glorious a work." -

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he
spoke this to me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face

lowed, and his colour came and went as if he had
een falling into his; in a word, he was fired with the
joy of being embarked in such a work. I paused a
considerable while before I could tell what to sav to
him, for] was really surprised to find a man of such{WWMWWM\WM\\N\ "v". smww--m

sinuerity and zeal, and carried out in his zeal beyond
the ortlinany rate of men, not of his profession only,
but even of any protession whatsoever. But after I
had considered it awhile, I asked him seriously if he
was in earnest, and that he would venture on the single
consideration of an attempt on those poor people, to
he looked u in an unplanled island for perhaps his
life, and at Iast might not know whether he should be
able to do them any good or not?

He turned short u on me, and asked me what]
called a venture? " ray, Sir," said he, " what do
you think Iconsented to go in your ship to the East
Indies for ?"---" Nay'" said I, "that! know, not, un-
less it was to preach to the Indians."---u Doubtless it
was," said he; " and do you think if I can convert
these seven-and-thirty men to the faith ofChrist, it is
not worth'my time, though I should never be fetched
oil" the island again? Nay, is it not infinitely of more
worth to save so many souls titan my life is, or the life
of twenty more of the same profession? Yes, Sir,"
says he, " [would give Christ and the Blessed Virgin
thanks all my (lays, if I could be made the least hap-
py instrument of saving the souls of these poor men,
though I was never to set my foot off this island. or
see my native country any more. But since you will
honour me," says he, "with putting me into this
work. (for which I will pray for you all the days of my
life) I have one humble petition to yon," said he,
" besides."-----"What is that ?" said I. " Why," says
he " it is, that you will leave your man Friday with
me, to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me;
for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they
to me."

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, be.
cause I could not think of parting with him, and that
for many reasons. He had been the companion of
my travels; he was'not only faithful to me, but sm-
terely afl'ectiOnate to the last degree; and I had re-
solved to do something considerable {or him it he out-

l
i
lived me as it was probable he would. Then I knew
that as I had bred Friday up to he a Protestant, it
would quite confound hint to britttr him to embrace
another profession; and he would never, while his
eyes were open, believe that his old master was a he-
retic, and would be damned ; and this might in the

end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so turn him'

back again to his first idolatry.

However. a sudden thought relieved me in this
strait, and it was this: I told him [could not say that
I was willing to part with Friday on any accounl
whatever; though a work that to him was of more
value than his lite, ought to me to be of much more
value than the kee ing or parting with a. servant. But
on the other hand,Il was persuaded, that Friday would
by no means consent to part with me; and then to
force hint to it without his consent would be manifest
injustice. because I had promised I would never put
him away. and he had promised and engavcd to me
that he would never leave me unless I put him away.

He seemed very much concerned at it ; for he had
no rational access to these poor people, seeing he did
not understand one word of thetr language, nor they
one word of his. To remove this difficulty, I told
him Friday's father had learnt Spanish, which I found
he also understood, and he should serve him for an
interpreter; so he was much hotter satisfied, and no.
thing could persuade him but he would stay to endea-
vour to convert them ; but Providence gave another
and very happy turn to all this.

Icome back now to the first part of his objections.
When we came to the Englishmen I sent for them all
together ; and after some accounts given them of what
I had done for them, viz. what necessary things I had
provided for them, and how they were distributed.
which they were sensible of, and very thankful for; I
began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led,
and gave them a full account of the notice the clergy-
man had already taken of it ; and arguing how un-
christian and itreligious a life it was,l first askcd them
Oll' ROBINSON CRUSOE. 125

if they were married men or bachelors? They soon
explained their condition to me, and chewed me that
two of them were widowers, and the other three were
single men or bachelors. I asked them with what
conscience they could take these women, and lie with
them as they had done, call them their wives, and '

i
have so many children by them, and not be married
lawfully to them ?

They all gave me the answer that I expected, viz.
that there was nobody to marry them; that they
agreed before the governor to keep them as tieir
i wives; and to keep them and own them as their
3 wives; and they thought as things stood with them,
g they were as legally married as if they had been mar-
ried by a parson, and with all the formalities in the
work .

i i told them that no doubt they were married in the
; sight of God, and were hound in conscience to keep
them as their wives ; but that the laws of men being
i otherwise, they might pretend they were not married,
and so desert the poor women and children hereafter ;
and that their wives. being poor, desolate women,
l'nendless and moneyless, would have no way to help
themselves: I therefore told them, that unless I was
assured of their honest intent, I could do nothing for
them ; but would take care that what! did should be
for the women and chidren without them ; and that
unless they would give some assurances that they
would marry the women, I could not think it was
convenient they could continue together as man and
wife; for that it was both scandalous to men and of.
{cusive to God, who they could not think-would bless
the-n ifthey went on thus. '

All this assed :15 1 expected ; and they told me,
especially 'Vill Atkins. who seemed now to speak for
the rest, that they loved their wives as well as if they
had been born in their own native county, and would
not leave them upon any account whatever; and they
did verily believe their wives were as virtuous and as
modest, and did to the utmost of their skill as much

{or them and for their children as any women could
possibly do, and they would not part with them on
any account: and Will Atkins for his own particular
added, if any man would take him away, and offer to
carry him home to England, and to make him cap-
tain of the best man of war in the navy, he would not
go with him if he might not carry his wife and chil-
dren with him ; and if there was a clergyman in the
ship, he would he married to her now with all his
heart. '

This was just as I would have it. The priest was
not with me at that moment, but was not far olf. So
to try him farther, I told him I had a clergyman with
me, and if he was sincere I would have him married
the next morning, and bade him consider of it, and
talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he need
not consider of it at all, [or he was very ready to do
it, and was glad I had a minister with me; and he be-
Iieved they would be all willing also. I then told
him that my friend the minister was a Frenchman,
and could not speak English, but that I would act the
clerk between them. He never so much as asked
me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, which was
intleed~what I was afraid of. But I say they never
inquired aboutit. So we parted ; I went back to my
clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his
companions. I desired the French gentlemen not to
say any thing to them till the business was thorough
ripe, and I told him what answer the men had given
me.

Before I went from their quarter they all came to
me, and told me, they had been considering what I
had said; that they were very glad to hear I had a
clergyman in my company ; and they were very wil-
ling to give me the satisfaction I desired, and to 'be
formally married as soon as l pleased ; for they were
far from desiring to part from their wives; and that
they meant nothing but what was very honest wnen
they chose them. Sol appointed them to meet me

should let their wives know the meaning of the mar
riage law ; and that it was not only to prevent any
scandal, but a'so to oblige them that they should not
forsake them, whatever might happen.

The women were easily made sensible of the mean-
ing of the thing, and were very well satisfied with it,
as indeed they had reason to be; so they failed not to
attend all together at my apartment next morning,
where I brought out my clergyman : and though he
had not on a minister's gown, after the manner of
England, or the habit ot'a priest, after the manner of
France; yet having a black vest, something like a
cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look very
unlike a minister; and as for his language I was in-
ter reter.

ut the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and
the, scruple he made marrying the wom'e'n because
they were not be tised. and professed Christians, gave
them an exceet ing reverence for his person; and
there was no need after that to inquire whether he
was a clergyman or no. '

Indeed [was afraid his scruple would have been
carried so far that he would not have married them
at all : nay, notwithstanding all I was able to say It)
him, he resisted me. though modestly, yet very stea-
dily; and at last refused absolutely to marry them,
unless he had first talked with the men and the wo-
men too ; and though at first '1' was a little backward
to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will, pep
ceiving the sincerity of his design.

When he came to them, he let them know that!
had acquainted him with their circumstances, and with
the presentdesigu; that he was very willing to per-
form that part of his function. and marry them as .1
had desired ; but that before he could'do it, he must
takethe liberty to talk with them. He told them that

in the sight of all different men, and in the sense of

the laws of society, they had lived all this while in an
' open adultery ; and that it was true that nothing but

the consentingtu marry,or efl'ectually separating them

from one another now, could put an end to it; but
there was a difficulty in it too, with respett to the
laws of Christian matrimony, which he was not fully
satified about, viz. that of marrying one that is a pro-
fessed Christian to a savage, an idolator, and a hea-
then, one that is not baptised; and yet that he did
not see that there was time left for it to endeavour to
persuade the women to be babtised, or to profess the
name of Christ, whom they had, be doubted, heard
notleing of, and without which they could not be bap.
tlze . '

He told me be doubted they were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had but little know-
ledge of God or his ways, and therefore he could not
expect that they had said much to their wit-cs on that
head yet; butthat unless they would promise him to
use their endeavourswitn theirwives to persuade them
to become Christians, and would as well as they could
instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that
made them, and to worshipJesus Christ that redeem-
ed them, he could not marry them; for he would have
no hand in joining Christians with savages ; nor was
it consistent with the principles of the Christian reli-
gion, and wasindecd expressly forbidden in God's law.

They heard all this very attcntivcly, and l delivered
it very faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his
own words as I could, only sometimes adding some-

.thing of mv own. to convince them how just it was,

and how I was of his mind: and [always very faith-
fully distinguished between what I said from myself
and what were the clergyman's words. They told me
it was very true what the gentleman had said, that
they were but veryindtfl'erent Christians themselves,
and that they had never talked to their wwes about re-
ligion.--" Lord, Sir," says Will Atkins " how should
we teach them religion ? Why, we know nothing our-
selves; and besides, Sir," said he, " should we go to

tended to go ourselves who believe all this, and yet
are such wicked fellows, as we indeed are : why, Sir,"
said Will, " 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of reli-
gion, at firstlhearing: folks must have some religion
themselves before they pretend to teach other penple.'

--" Will Atkins," said I to him, " thoughI am afraid
what you say has too much truth in it, yet can you
not tell your wife that she is in the wrong; that there
is a God, and. a religion better than her own ; that her
gods are idols; that they can neither hear nor speak;
that there is a great Being that made all things, and
thatcan destro allthat he has made; that he rewards
the good, on punishes the bad; that we are to be
judged by him, at last, for all we do here ? You are
not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach you
that all this is true; and lam satisfied you know it all
to be true, and believe it yourself."

" That's true, Sir," said Atkins ; " but with what
face can I say any thing to my wife of all this, when
she will tell me immediately it cannot be true ?"

" Not true .'" said i ; " what do you mean by that ?"
---" Why. Sir." said he, " she will tell me it cannot
be true: that this God (I shall tell her of) can hejust ,
or can punish or reward, since I am not punished and
sent to the devil, that have been such a wicked crea-
ture as she knows I have been, even to her. and to
every hotly else; and thatl should be sutl'ured to live,
that have been always acting so contrary to what I
must tell her is good, and to what I ought to have
done."

" Why truly, Atkins," said I, "I am afraid thou
speakest too much truth ; and with that I let the cler-
gyman know what Atkins had said, for he was im-
patient lo know. " O !' said the priest. " tell him

mto another world ; and this will lead him to teach
his wife the doctrine ofthe resurrection, and of thelast

an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife."

refrain tears also : hut recovering himsell he said to
me, "Ask him but one question : Is he easy that it
is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it were not
so ?" I put the question fairly to Atkins; and he an-
swered with a great deal of passion, " How could any
man be easy in a condition that certainly must end
In eternal destruction ? That he was far from bein
easy; but that on the contrary, he believed it woul
one time or the other ruin him."

" What do you mean by that ?" said l.--" Why,"
he said " he believed he should, one time or another,
cut his own throat to put an end to the terror of it."

The clergy-man shook his head, with a great con--
com in his face, when I told him-all this; but turning
quick to me upon it, said, " If that be his case, you
may assure him it is not toohlate; Christ will give
him repentance. But pray," says he, " explain this
to him, that as no man Is saved but by Christ,and the
merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for him,
how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy P
Does he think he is able to sin beyond, the power or
reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a
time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, and
when God may refuse to hear ; but that 'tis never too
ate for men to ask me'rcy ; and we that are Christ's
servants are commanded to preach mercy at all times,
In the name of J esus Christ, to all those that sincerely
repent: so that 'tis never too late to repent."

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great
earnestness; but it seemed as if hetnrned othhe dis-
course to the rest; for he said to me he would go and
have some talk with his wife: so he went out awhile,
and we talked to the rest. I perceived they were all
stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion ; much as
I was when I went'rambliog away from my father;
and yet that there were noneof them backward to hear
what had been said ; and all of them seriously pro-
mised that they would talk with their wives about it,
and do their endeavour to persuade them to turn
Christians.

l8? LIFE AND ADVENTURES

The ciergymau smiled upon me when I reported
what answer they gave, but said nothinga good while ,
but at last shaking his head, " We that are Christ's
servants," says he, " can go no farther than to exhort
and instruct; and when men comply, submit to the
reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do ;
we are bound to accept their good words; but be-

ieve me, Sir," said he, " whatever you may have
known ofthe life of that man you call William Atkins,
I believe he is the only sincere convert among them ,
I take that man to be a true penitent; I won't den
spair of the rest ; but that man is perfectly struck with
the sense of his past life ; and I doubt not but when
he comes to talk of religion to his wife, he will talk
himself effectually into it; for attempting to teach
others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves.
I knew a man," added he, " who having nothing but
a summary notion of religion himself, and being
wicked and profiigate to the last degree in his life,
made a thorough reformation in himself by labour-
ing to convert a Jew : and ifthat poor Atkins begins
but once to talk seriously of Jesus Christ to his wife,
my life for it he talks himself into a thorough convert,
makes himself a penitent; and who knows whatmay
follow ?"

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising
as above to endeavour to persuade their wives to em-
brace Christianity, he married the other three couple;
but Will Atkins and his wife were not yet come in.
After this, my clergyman waiting awhile, was curious
to know where Atkins was gone ; and turning to me,
says he, " I entreat you, Sir, let us walk, out ofyout
labyrinth here and look ; I dare say we shall find
this poor man someu here or other, talking seriously
with his wife, and teaching her already something of
religion." I began to he of the same mind ; so we
went out together, and I carried him a way which
none knew but myself, and where the trees were st.
thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the
thicket of leaves, and far harder to see it; than to see

out; when coming to the edge of the wood! saw
Atkins, and his tawny savage wife, sitting under the
shade of a bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped
short till my clergymen came up to me, and then
having shewed him where they were, we stood and
looked very steadily at them a good while.

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing
up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens;
tnen down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to
himself, then to her, to the woods, to the trees
"Now," says my clergyman, " you see my words
are made good; the man preaches to her; mark him ;
now he is telling her that our God has made him, and
her and the heavens and the earth, the sea. the woods,
the trees, &c."--" I believe he is," said I. Imr'ne
diately we perceived Will Atkins start up up upon his
feet fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his
hands; we supposed he said something, but we could
not hear him ; it was too far off for that ; he did not_
continue kneeling half a minute, but comes and sits
down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We
perceived then the woman very attentive, but whether
she said any thing or no we could not tell. While
the poor fellow was u on his knees, I could see the
tears run plentifully town my clergyman's cheeks;
and I could hardly forbear myself; but it wasagreat
aflliction to us both, that we were not near enough
to hear any thing that passed between them.

Well, however, we could come no nearer for fear
of disturbing them ; so we resolved to see an end of
this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud
enough to us without the help of voice. He sat down
again, as I have said, close by her. and talked again
earnestly to her, and two or three times we could see
him embrace her passionately; another time we saw
him take out his handkerchiel and wipe her eyes,
and then kiss her again, with a kind of transport very
unusual ; and after several of these things, we sawhim
on a suden jump up again and lend her his hand to
nelp her up, when immediately leading her by the.-_M-~\M

and continued so about two minutes.
My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out

was afraid Atkins would hear him : therefore 1 en-
treated him to withhold himself awhile, that we might
see an end of the scene, which to me, 1 must confess,
was the most afl'ecting, and yet the most agreeable,
that ever I saw in my life. Well, he strove with
himself, and contained himself for awile, but was in
such raptures of joy to 'think that the poor heathen
woman was become a Christian, that he was not able
tocontain himself; he wept several times; then throw-
ing up his hands, and crossing his breast, said over
several things ejaculatory, and by way of giving God
thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of
our endeavours; some he spoke softly, and I could
not well hear : others audihly ; some in Latin, some
in French ; then two or three times the tears ofj

her hand to her breast, and sue other postures as"
usually express the greatest seriousness and attention.
This continued about halfa quarter of an hour, and
then they walked away too ; so that we could see no
more of them in that situation."

I took this interval to talk with my clergyman
and first I told him, I was glad to see the particulars
we had both been witnesses to; that though I was
hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began
to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man
and his wife, however ignorant they both might be .

happy end: "And who knows," said 1, " but these
two may in time, by instruction and example, work
"upon some of the others ?" "some of them I" said he,
turning quick u on me, " ay, upon all of them ; de-
end upon it, i those two savages (for he has been
ut little better as you-relate it) should embrace Jesus
Christ, they will never leave till they work upon all
the rest; for true religion is naturally communicative,
and he that is once made a Christian will never leave
a Pagan behind him if he, can help it." I owned it
was a most Christian principle l0 think so, and a tcs.
timony of a true zeal. as well as a generous heart in
him. " But, my friend," said lI " will you give me
liberty to start one difficulty here ? I cannot tell how
to object the least thing against that affectionate con-
cern which you shew for the turning the poor people
from their Paganism to the Christian religion; but
how does this comfort you, while these people are, in
your account, out of the pale ol' the Catholic church,
without which, you believe, there is no salvation; so
that you esteem these but heretics still ; and, for other
reasons, as effectually lost as the Pagans themselves ?"
To this he answered with abundance of candour'
and Christian charity, thus : " Sir, i am a Catholic
of the Roman church, and a. riest of the order of St.
Benedict, and I embrace all tie principles of the R0-
man faith. But yet, if you will believe me, and this
[do not speak in compliment to you, or in respect

say, that you cannot be saved; 1 will by no means
limit the mercy of Christ, so far as to think that he
cannot receive you into the bosom ofhis church, in a
manner to us imperceivable, and which it is impossi.

charity for us. I pray daily for your being all restored

sure you will allow it to consist with me, as a Roman,
to distinguish far between a Protestant and a Pagan ,
between him that calls on Jesus Christ, though in a
way which I do not think is according to'the true
faith ; and a savage, a barbarian, that knows no God.
no Christ, no Redeemer at all; and if yet! are not
within the ale of the Catholic church, we hope you
are nearer ein restored to it than those that know
nothing at all 1) God or his church. I rejoice, there-
fore, when I see this poor man, who, you say, has
been a profli ate, and almost a murderer, kneel down
and ray to esus Christ, as we suppose he did, though
not fiilly enlightened; believing that God, from whom
every such work proceeds, will sensibly touch his
heart and bring hint to the further knowedge of the
truth in his own time; and if God shall influence thin

oor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage
his wife, I can never believe that he shall be cast
away himself; and have I not reason then to rejoice,
the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of Christ,
though they may not be brought quite home into the
bosom of the Catholic church, just at the time when
I may desire it; leaving it to the goodness of Christ
to perfect his work in his own time, and his own way?
Certainly i would rejoice if all the savages inAmerica
were brought, like this poor woman, to pray to God,
though they were to be all Protestants at first, rather
than they should continue pagans and heathens; firm-
ly believing, that He who had bestowed that first light
upon them, would farther illuminate them with a beam
of his heavenly grace and bring them into the pale of
his church, when he should see good."

I was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this
truly pious Papist, as much as l was oppressed by the
power of his reasoning; and it presently occured to
my thoughts, that if such a temper was universal we
might be all Catholic Christians, whatever church or
particular pmfesston we were joined to, or joined in , '
that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into
right principles; and in a word as he thought that

the like charity would make us all Catholics, as] told
nhn, l believed had all the members of his church the
like moderation they would soon be all Protestants;

anld there we left that part, for we never disputed at

nl .

' However, I talked to him another way ; and tab
in": him by the hand, " My friend," said I, "I wish
all the clergy of the Roman church were blessed with
such moderation, and an,equal share of your charity.
I am entirely of your opinion; but! must tell you,
that ifyou should preach such doctrine in Spain or
ltaly, they would put you into the Inquisition."

" It may be 50," said he ; "I know not what they
might do in Spain and Italy; but I will not say they
would be the better Christians for that severity; for I
am sure there is no heresy in too much charity."

Well. as Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our
business there was over; so we went back our own
way and when we came back we found them wait-
ing to be called in. Observing this, I asked my cler-
gyman if we should discover to him that we had seen
him under the bush, or no; and it "as his opinion
we should not; but that we should talk to him first,
and hear what he would say to us : so we called him
in alone, nobody being in the place but ourselves ,and
I began with' him thus :

" Will Atkins," said I, " r'ythee what education
had you ? What was your ather ?"

Vt. A. A better man than cverlshall be. Sir, my
father was a clergyman. ' '

What education did he give you ?

W. A. lie would have taught me well, Sir; but I
despised all education, instruction, or correction, like
a beast as l was.

R. C. it is true, Solomon says, " He that despiseth

W. A. Ay, Sir, I was brutish indeed ; I murdered
my father; for God's sake, Sir, talk no more about
that, Sir; l murdered my poor father.

R. C. No, no, Sir, I do not understand himso.
Will Atkins. explain yourself: you did not kill your
father, did you, with your own hands?

W. A. No, Sir; I did not cut his throat; but I cut
the thread of all his comfhrts, and shortened his days:
I broke his heart by the most ungrateful, unnatural
return for the most tender, affectionate treatment that
ever father gave, or child could receive.

R. C. Well. [did not ask you about your father
to extort this confession : I may God give yotl repent-
ance for it, and forgive you that and all your other

have not much learning, yet you are not so ignorant as
someare in things that are good ; that you have known
more of religion 21 gmatdcal than you have practised.

W. A. Though you, Sir, did not extort the confes:
sion that I make about my father, conscience does;
and whenever we come to look back upon our lives,
the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly
the first that touch us; the wounds they make lie
deepest; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest
upon the mind of all the sins we can commit.

R. C. You talk too feelingly and sensible for me,
Atkins; I cannot hear it.

W. A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know
nothing of it.

R. C. Yes, Atkins. every shore. every hill, nay, I
may say every tree in this island, is witness to the
anguish of my soul for my ingratitude and base usage
ofa good tender father; a father much like yours by

that l was goutg to leave ofi'lhe discourse and
retire, for l was surprised witlt what he said,
and thought. that, instead of my going about to
teach and instruct him, the man was made:
teacher and instructor to me, in a most sur-

I laid nll tltis before the young clergyman who was
greatly affected with it, and said to me, Did [not

preach to us all? I tell you, Sir, if this one man be
made a true penitent, here will he no need of me, he
will make Christians of all in the island." But haw
ing a little composed myself I renewed my discourse
with Will Atkins. '

" But, Will," said I, " how comes the sense ofthis
matter to touch you just now ?"

W. A. Sir, you have set me about a work that has
struck a dart through my very soul; I have been talk-
ing about God and religion to my wife, in order, as
you directed me, to make a Christian of her; and she
has preached such a sermon to me as I shall never
forget while I live.

R. C. No, no; it is not your wife has preached to
you; but when you were moving religious arguments
to her, conscience has flttn them back upon you.

W. A. Ay, Sir, with suc t a force as is not to be re-
sisted.

R. C. Pray Will. let us know what passed between

will, and though l cannot give you an account of it,
this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and
reform in ' life.

\V. A. Why, lfirst told her the nature of our laws
about marriage, and what the reasons were that men
and women were obliged to enter into such compacts
as it was neither in the power of one or other to break;
that otherwise, order and justice could not be main-
tained, and men would run from their wives and
abandon their children, mix confusedly with one an-
other, and neither families be kept entire, or inherit-
ances be settled by a legal descent.

R. C. You talk like acivilian, Will. Could you
make her understand what you meant by inheritance
and families? They know no such thing among the
savages, but marry any how, without any regard to
relation, consanguinity, or family; brother and sister,
nay. asl have been told, even the farther and daugh-
ter, and the son and the mother.

W. A. I believe, Sir, you are misinformed ;--my
wife assures me of the contrary, and that they abhor
it. Perhaps for any further relations they may not be
so exact as we are; but she tells me they never touch
one another in the near relations you speak of.

R. C. Well, what did she say to what you told her?

W. A. She said she liked it very well; and it was
much better than in her country.

R. C. But did you tell her what marriage was'

W. A. Ay, ay, there began all our dialogue. I ask-
ed her, ifshe would be married to me our way? She
asked me, what way that was ? I told her marriage was
appointed of God ; and here we had a strange talk to-
gether indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe.

[N. B. This dialogue detwcen W. Atkins and his

wife, as 1 took it down in writing just after he
told itme, was as follows :]

God in your country?

Wife. No makee dc earth; no you God makee dc
earth ; no make my country.

LW. A. laughed a little at her expression of God

not making her country.]

Wife. No laugh: why laugh me? This no ting tc

[He was justly reproved by his wife, for she was

more serious than he at first]

W. A. That'strue, indeed; I wil not laugh any
more my dear.

W ire. Why you say, you God make all?

W. A. Yes,_child, our God made the whole world,
and you, and me, and all things; for he is the only
true God; there is no God but he ; he lives for ever in
heaven.

Wife. Why you no tell me long ago,

W. A. That's true, indeed ; hutl have been a wick-

ed wreteh, and have not only forgotten to acquaint
thee with any thing before, but have lived without
God in the world myself.

Wife. What have you de great God in yourcoun-
try, you no know him. No say 0 to him? No do good

W. A. It is too true though, for all that: we live as ,

if there was no God in heaven, or that he had no
power on earth.

W. A. It is all our own fault.

much great power; can make kill when he will : wh

W. A. What! will my wicked life hinder you from

And what a sad truth is it, that the horrid lives of '

Christians hinder the conversion of heathens !'

Wife. How me tink you have great much God it

Wife. Where be then the muchee great powel

W. A. He is merciful; that is all we can say for it-g

to hear a poor, untaught creature desire to be
taught to know God, and he such a wicked
wretch that he could not say one word to her
about God, but what the reproach of his own
carriage would make most irrational to her to
believe; nay, that already she could not believe
in God because he that was so wicked was not
destroyed]

They had several other discourses, it seems, afie-
this, too long to set down here; and particularly she
made him promise, that, since he confessed his own
life had been a wicked, abominable course of provo-
cation against God, he would reform it, and not make
God angry any more, lest he should make him dead,
as she called it, and then she should be left alone, and
never be taught to know this God better; and lest he
should be miserable, as he told her wicked men should
be'after death. "

This was a strange 'account, and very affecting to us
both, but.particularly the young clergymen ; he was
indeed wonderfully surprised with it ; but under .the
greatest affliction imaginable that he could not talk to
her'; that he could not speak_English .to make her un-
derstand him; and as she spoke butvery broken Eng-
lish he could not understand her. However, he turned
himself to me, and told me, that he believed there

.must be more to do with this woman than to marry
her.' I did'not understand him at first, but at length
he egplained himself, viz. that she ought to be bap-
tize . -

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for
going about it presently: " No, no, hold, Sir," said
he; " though I would have her baptized by all means,
yet i must observe. that Will Atkins. her husband, has
indeed brought her, in a wonderful manner, to be
willing to embrace a religious life ; and has given her

, just ideas of the being of a God, of his power, 'us
tice, and mercy; yet I desire to kriow of him, i he
has said any thing to her of Jesus Christ, and of the
salvation of sinners; of the nature of faith in him,

and the redemption by him ; of the Holy Spirit, the
resurrection. the last judgment, and a future state." '_

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him: but the
poor fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us be
ad said something to her of all those things, but that
he was himself so wicked a creature, and his own
conscience so reproached him with his horrid, ungodly
life. that he trembled at the apprehensions, that her

knowledge of him should lessen the attention she '

should give to those things, and make her rather con-
temn religion that receive it: but he was assured, he
said, that her mind was so disposed to receive due im-
pressions of all those things, that, if I would but dis-
course with her, she would make it appear to my 8&1
tisfaction that my labour would not be lost upon her.

Accordingly I called her in, and placing'myself as
interpreter between my religious priest and the woman.
Ientreated him s: begin with her. But sure such a
termon was never preached by a popish priest in these
latter ages of the world'; and, as I told him, lthought
he had all the zeal. all the knowledge, allthe sincerity
of a Christian, without the error: of a Roman Catho-
lic; and that I took him to be such a clergyman as the
Roman bishops werebefore the church of Rome as-

men.

In a word, he brought the oor woman to embrace
the knowledge of Christ, an of redemption byhim,
not with wonder and astohishment only, as she did
the first notions of a God, but with joyand faith, with
an affection and a surprising degree of understanding.
scarce to be imagined. much less to he expressed; and

. at her own request she was baptised.

When he was preparing to baptise her, I entrested
rim, that he would perform that office with some cau-
tion, that the man might not perceive he was of the
Roman church, if ossible ; 'because of other ill con-
sequences which might attend a differenceamong usin
that very religion which we were instructing the other
in. He told me, that as he had no consecrated chapel,
nor proper things for the office. [should see he would
do it in a manner thatl should not know by it that he

before and so he did; for saying only some words
over to himself in Latin, which I could not under-
stand, 'he poured a whole dishful of water upon the
woman's ead, pronouncing in French very,loud,

to give her, for I was her godfather, I baptise 0m
in the name of the Father, and of the 'on, and of the
Holy Ghost; so that none could know any thing by
it what religion he was of: he gave the benediction
afterwards in Latin ; but either Will Atkins did not
know but it was in French, or else did not take notice
ofit at that time.

As soon as this was over, he married them; and
after the marriage was over, he turned himself to Will
Atkins. and in a very affectionate manner exhorted
him not only to persevere in that good disposition he
was in, but to support the convictions that were upon
him by a resolution to reform his life; told him it was
in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his
crimes; represented to him. how God had honoured
him with being the instrument of bringing his wife to
the knowledge of the Christian religion ; and that he
should be careful he did not dishonour the grace of
God; and that if he did, he would see the heathen a

better christian than himself; the savage converted,

and the instrument cast away !

He said a great many good things to them both, and
then recommended them, in a few words, to God's
goodness; gave them the benediction again, I repeat-
ing every thing to them in English: and thus ended
the ceremony. I think it was the most pleasant. agree-
able day to me that ever I passed in my whole life.

But my clergyman had not done yet ; his thoughts
hungcontinually upon the conversion of the thirty-
seven savages, and fain he would have staid upon tne
island to have undertaken it; hutl convinced him,
first, that his undertaking was impracticable in itself;
and secondly, that, perhaps I could put it into a way
of being done in his absence, to his satisfaction ; of
which by and by.

Having thus brought the affair of the island to a
narrow compass, I was preparing to go on board the
ship, when the young man, whom I had taken out of
the famishcd ship's company, came to me, and told
me, he understood I had a clergyman with me, andmxxxmwx\\wwv ~A~M~Nx-mww~ws~wwxxxw~wmwmm

that I had caused the Englishmen to be married to the
savages whom they called wives; that he had a match
too, which he desired might be finished beforel went,
between two Christians, which he hoped would not
be disagreeable to me.

I knew this must be the young woman who was his
mother's servant, for there was no other Christian
woman on the island. So I began to persuade him
not to do any thing of that kind rashly, or because he
found himself in this solitary circumstance. I repre.
sented that he had some considerable substance in the
world, and good friends, as] understood by himself,
and by his maid also; that the maid was not only
Poor, and a servant, but was unequal to him, she be-
ing twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, and he not
above seventeen or eighteen ,- that he might very pro-
bably, with my assistance, make a remove from this
wilderness, and come into his own country again, and
that then it would be a thousand to one but he would
.epent his choice, and the dislike of that circumstance
might be disadvantageous to both. I was going to
say more, but be interrupted me smiling; and told
me, with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in
my guesses ; that he had nothing of that kind in his
thoughts, his presentcircumstances being me'ancboly
and disconsolate enough ; and he was very glad to
hear that I had some thoughts of putting them in a
way to see their own country again ; and that nothing
should have set him upon staying there, but that the
voyageI was oing was so exceedinglong and hazard
Otis, and wou d carry him quite out oftlte reach of all
his friends that he had nothing to desire of me, but
that I would settle him in some little property of the
island where he was; give him a servant or two. and
some few necessaries,and he would settle himself here
like a planter, waiting the good time when. if ever i
returned to England, I would redeem him, and hoped
lwould not be tininindful of him when I came to
England ; that he would give me some letters to his

I was most agreeably surprised when he named the

character ofthat man I have given already : and as
'nr the maid, she was a very honest, modest, sober,
and religious young woman 2 had a very good sharo
of sense; was agreeable enough in her person; spoke
very handsomely, and to the purpose; always with
decency and good manners, and not backward to
speak when any thing required it, or imperlinently
forward to speak when it was not her business; very
handy and 'housewifely in any thing that was before
her : an excllent manager. and fit indeed to have been
governess to the whole island; she knew very well
how to behave herself to all kind of folks she had
about her. and to better if she had found any there.

vided it--he to speak to the Spaniards, who were all
Pepists, and l to the English, who were all i'rotes-
tants; and we recommended itearnestly to them, and
made them promise that they would never make any
distinction of l'apist or'i'rrtestant in their exhorling
the savages to turn Christians, hut teach them the ge-
eral knowledge of the true God, and of their Saviour
Jesus Christ; and they likewise promised us that they
would never have any differences or disputes one
with another about religion.
When I came to Will Atkins's house, (I may call

- it so. for such a house, or such a piece of basket-work,

I believe was not standing in the world again!) I
say, when I came thither I found the young woman
I have mentioned above, and William Atkins's wife,
were become intimates; and this prudent and religi-
one young woman had perfected the work Will At;
kins had begun; and though it was not above four
days after what I have related, yet the new-ha tised
savage woman was made such a Christian as have
seldom heard of any like her, in all my observation
or conversation in the world.

It came next into my mind in the morning, before
I went to them, that among all the needful things I

had to leave with them,I had not left a Bible; in'

which I shewed myself less considering for them than
my good friend the widow was for me, when she sent
me the cargo of 1001. from Lisbon. where she packed
up three Bibles and a Prayer-book. However, the
good woman's charity had a greater extentthan ever
she imagined, for they were reserved for the comfort

and instruction of those that made much better use
at them than I had done.

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket; and when
I came to William Atkins's tent, or house. I found
the young woman and Atkins's baptised wife had
been discoursing of religion together (for William
Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy.) I asked

if they were together now? And he said yes; :0]
went into the house, and he with me, and We found
them together, very earnest in discourse : " 0 Sir,"
says William Atkins, " when God has sinners to re-
eoneile to himself, and aliens to hring home he never
wants a messenger: my wife has got a new instruc-
tor--I knew I was unworthy, as I was incapable of
that work--that young woman has been sent hither
from Heaven--sheisenough to convert a whole island
of savages." The young woman blushed, and rose
up to go away, but [desired her to sit still; ltold
her she had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped
God would bless her in it.

We talked a little, and I did not erceive they had
any book among them, though I did7 not ask, but I
put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my Bible.
' Here," said I to Atkins, "l have brought you an
assistant, that perhaps you had not before." The man
was so confounded, that he was nnt able to speak for
some time ; but recovering himself, he takes it with
both hands. and turning to his wife, " Here my dear,"

' says lie, did not I tell you our God, though he lives

above, could hear what we said ? here is the hook I
raved for when you and I kneeled down under the
ush; now God has heard us and sent it." When he

had said thus. the man fell in such transports ofa pae-

sionate joy, that between the joy of having it, and
giving Go'd thanks for it, the tears run down his face
like a child that was crying.

The woman was surprised,_and was like to have
run into a mistake that none of us were aware of ; for
she firmly believed God, had sent the book upon her
husband's petition : it is true that providentially it
was so. and might be taken so in aconsequent sense;
but I believed it would have been no difficult matter
at that time to have persuaded the poor woman to
have believed that an express messenger came from
Heaven on purpose to bringthat individual book; but
it was too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to
take place: sol turned to the young woman, and

told her we did not desire to impose upon the new
convert in her first and more ignorant understanding
ofthin s, and begged her to explain to her that God
may be very properly said to answer our petitions,
when in the course at nis providence such t ings are
" a particular manner brought to pass as we petition-
cd for; but we do not expect returns from Heaven in
o miraculous and particular manner; and that it in
our mercy it is not so. ,

This the young woman did afterwards efi'ectually;
so that there was I assure you, no priestcraft used
here; and I should have thought it one of the most
unjustifiable fraudsin the world to have had it so ; but
the surprise of joy u on Will Atkins is really not tD
ae expressed ; and t tere we may he sure was no do-
lnsion. Sure no man was ever more thankful in the
world for any thing of its kind than he was for this
Xihle; and I believe never any man was glad of a
'Sible from a better principle; and though he had been
I most profiigate creature, desperate, headstrong, out-
egcous, furious, and wicked to a preat degree. .yet
his man is a standing rule to us all or the well in-
wtructing children, viz. that parents should never give
wer to teach and instruct, or ever dispair ofthe suo-
<<ass of their endeavours, let the children be ever so
obstinate, refractory, or to appearance insensible of
Instruction ; for ifevcr God in his providence touches
the consciences of such, the force of their education
returnsupon them, and the early instruction ofparents
is not lost, though it may have been many years laid
asleep, but some time or other they may find the
benefit of it.

Thus it was with this poor man. However igno-

nations, families, and persons; but he never entertain-
ed the least notion of the worth of it till now, when
being to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he
wanted the helpnf the written oracle for hisassistanca.

The young woman was very glad of it also for the
present occasion, though she had one, and so had the
youth, on board our ship among the goods which
were not yet brought on shore. And now, having said
so many things of this young woman, I cannot onti
telling one story more of her and myself, which has
sonieting in it very informing and remarkable.

I have related to what extremity the poor youn
woman was reduced; how her mistress was starve
to death, and did die on board that unhappy ship we
met at sea: and how the whole ship's company bein
reduced to the last extremity, the gentlewoman an
her son, and this maid, were first hardly used as to
provisions, and at last totally neglected and starved 5
that is to say brought tothe last extremity of hunger.

One day being discoursing with her upon the ex.
tremeties they suffered. I asked her if she could deo
scribe by what she felt what it was to starve, and how
it appeared ? She told me she believed she could, and
she told her tale ve distincly thus :

" First, Sir," sai she, " we had for some days
fared exceeding hard, and suffered very great hunger,
but now at last we were wholly without food of any
kind except sugar, and a little wine, and alittle water.
The first day afierl had received no food at all, I
found myself towards evening, first empty and sieltish
at my stomach, and nearer night mightily inclined to
yawning, and sleepy ; I lay down on a couch in the
great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and
awaked a little refreshed, having taken a glassof wine
when I lay down. After being about three hours
awake, it being about five o'clock in the morning, I
found myself empty, and my stomach sickish again,
and lay down again, but could not sleep at all, bein
sery faint and ill : and thus I'continued all the secon

day with a strange variety--first hungry, then sick
again, with retohings to vomit. The Second ni ht,
being obliged to go to bed again without any ood
more than a draught of fair water, and being asleep,
I dreamed I was at Barbadoes, and that the market
was mightily stocked with provisions, that I bought
some for my mistress, and went and dined very hear-
ti y. Y '

" I thought my stomach was full after this, as it

. would have been after or at a good dinner; but when

I waited, 1 was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find
myself in the extremity of famine; the last glass of
wine we had I drank, and put sugar into it, because
of its having some spirit to supply nourishment ; but
there being no substance in the stomach for the di--
gesting office to work upon, i found the only efi'eet of
the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the
stomach into the head: and I lay as they told me,
stupid and senseless as one drunk for some time.

" The third day in the morning, after a night of
strange and confused inconsistent dreams, and rather
dozing than sleeping, I awaked ravenous and furious
with hunger ; and l question, had not my understand--
ing returned and conquered it, I say, I question who-
ther, it I had been a mother, and had had a little
child with me, its life would have been safe or no.

" This lasted about three hours, during which time
I was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam
as my young master told me, and as he can now in
form you.

" In one of these fits oflunacy or distraction, whe-
ther by the motion of the ship or some slip of my foot
I know not, I fell down, and struck my face against
the corner of a pallet-bed in which my mistress lay,
and with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose,
and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I sat
down and bled into it a great deal, and as the blood
ran from me I came to myself, and the violence of
the flame or the fever l was in abated. and so did the
ravenous nnrl of the hunger

" Then I grew sick, and retcned to vomit, but
could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to bring
up. After I had bled some time I swooned, and they
all believed I was dead ; but I came to myself soon
after, and then had a most dreadful pain in my, sto-
mach, not to be described, not like the cholic, but a
gualvin eager pain for food, and towards night it
wento with a kind of earnest craving or longin
for food, something like, as I suppose the longing o
awoman with child. Itook anotherdrau ht ofwater
with sugar in it, but my stomach loathe the sugar,
and brought it all up again ; then I took a draught of
water without sugar, and that stayed with me, and I
laid me down upon the bed, praying most heartily
that it would please God to take me away; and com-
posing my mind in hopes of it. l slumberedawile;
and then waking. thought myself dying, heing light
with vapours from an empty stomach: recommend-
ed my soul to God. and earneslly wished that some-
body would throw me. into the sea.

"All this while my mistress lay by me just, as I
thought, expiring, but bore it with much more pati.
euce than I, and gave the last bit of bread she had to
herchild. my young master, who would not have taken
it, but she obliged him to eat it and I believe it saved
his life.

" Towards the morning I slept again, and first
when I awaked l fell into a violent passion of'cry~
ing. and after that had a second fit of violent hunger|
so that I got up ravenous, and in a most dreadful
condition. Had my mistress been dead, so much as I
loved her, I am certain I should have eaten a piece
ofher flesh with as much relish and as unconcerned
as ever I did the flesh of any creature appointed for
food and once or twice I was going to bite my own
arm. At last I saw the basin in which was the blood
I had bled at my nose the day before; I ran to it,
and swallowed it with such haste. and such a reedy
appetite, as ifl had wondered nobody had to en it
before, and afraid it should be taken front me now.

" Though after it was down the thoughts of it filled
me with horror, yet it checked the fit of hunger, and 3
I drank a draught of fair water, and was composed
and refreshed for some hours after it. This was the
fourth day ; and thus I heldit till towards night. when,
within the compass of three hours, I had all these se-
veral circumstances over again, one after anorher,
viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain in the stomach,
then ravenous again, then sick again, then lunatic, ,
then crying. then ravenous again, and so every quarter .
of an hour; and my strength wasted exceedingly. At
night I laid me down, having no comfort but in the
hope thatI should die before morning.

All this night I had no sleep, but the hunger was
now turned into a disease, and I had a terrible colic
and griping, wind instead of food having found its
way into my bowels; and in this condition I lay till
morning. when I was surprised a little with the cries
and lmnentations of my young master who called out
to me that his mother was dead. I lifted myself up
a little for I had not strength to rise, but found she (
was not dead, though she was able to give very little g
signs of life.

" I had then such convulsions in my stomach for SS
want of some sustenance, that Ieannot describe them,
with such frequent throes and pangs of appetite that
nothing but the tortutes of death can imitate; and this
condition I was in when I heard the sermon abet-n
cry out ' A sail! a sail !' and hulloo and jump about
as if they were distracted.

"l was not able to get off from the bed, and my
mistress much less. and my master was so sick that I
thought he had been expiring ; so we could not open
the cabin-door, or get any account what it was that
occasioned such a combustion ; nor had we any can-
vesration with the ship's company for two days, they
having told us they-had not a mouthful of any thing
to eat in the ship; and they told us afterwards they
thou ht we had been dead.

you were sent to save our lives ; and how you found
us, Sir, you know as well as I, and better too."
This was her own relation, and is such a distinct
account of starving to death as I confess I never met
with, and was exceeding entertaining to me; Iam
the rather apt to believe it to he a true account, be-
cause the youth gave me an account ofa good part of
it, though I must own not so distinct and so feelingly
as his maid, and the rather because it seems his Ino-
ther fed him at the price of her own life: but the poor
maid, though her constitution being stronger than that
of her mistress, who was in years, and a weakly wo-
man too, she might struggle harder with it; Isay,
the poor maid might be supposed to feel the extre-
mity something sooner than her mistress, who might
be allowed to keep the last bits something longer than
she parted with any to relieve the maid. No ques-
tion, as the case is here related, if our ship, or some
other, had not so providentially met them, a few days
more would have ended all their lives, unless they had
prevented it by eating one another; and even that, as
their case stood, would have served them but a little
while, they being five hundred leagues from any land,
or any possibility of relief, other than in the miracu-
lous manner it happened--But this is by the way ; 1
return to my disposition of things among the people.
And first, it is to be observed here, that for many
reasons I did not think fit to let them know any thing
of the sloop I had framed, and which I thought 0!
setting up among them ; for I found, at least at my
first connng, such seeds of division among them. that
I saw it plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it
among them they would upon very slightdisgust, have
separated, and gone away from one another; or per-
haps have turned pirates, and so made the island a
den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober and
religious people, as I intended it to be; nor did I leave
the two pieces of brass cannon, that I had or. board,
or the two quarter-deck guns, that my nephew took
extraordinary, for the same reason : I thought they

 

I

.v W"W\"\MWV\WMMN\AIW\WM- -
01" ROBINSON CRUSOE. 16]

had enough to qualify them for a defensive war, against
any that should invade them; but I was not to set
them up for an offensive war, or to encoura 6 them
to go abroad to attack others, which, in the en , would
only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and
all their undertakings: I reserved the sloop, there-
fore, and the guns, for their service another way, as I
shall observe in its place.

I have now done with the island; Ileft them all in
good circumstances, and in a flourishing condition,
and went on board my ship again the fifth day of
May, having been five-and-twenty days among them;
an , as they were all resolved to stay upon the island
till I came to remove them, I promised to send some
further relief from the Brasils, if I could possibly find
an opportunity ; and particularly I promised to send
them some catttle ; such as sheep, hogs, and cows ; for
as to the two cows and calves which I brought from
England, we had been obliged, by the length of our
voyage, to kill them at sea, for want of hay to feed
them.

The next day giving them a salute of five guns at

arting, we set sail, and arrived at the bay of All
aims, in the Brasils, in abouttwenty-two days; meet-
ing nothing remarkable in our passage but this, that
about three days after we sailed, being becalmed, and
the current setting strong to the N. N. E. running,
as it were, into a hay or gulf on the land side, we
were driven something out of our course ; and once
or twice our men cried Land, to the westward; but
whether it was the continent, or islands, we could
not tell by any means.

But the third day, towards evening. the sea smooth
and the weather calm, we saw the sea asit were, co-
vered towards the land, with something very black,
not being able to discover what it was; but, after
some time, our chief mate going up the main shrouds
a little way and looking at them with a perspective,
cried out it was an army. I cou' d not imagine what
he meant bv an army, and sooke : little hastily, call-l

ing the fellow a fool, or some such word: " Nay,
Sir," says he, " don't be angry, for it is an army,
and a fleet too; for I believe there are a thousand
canoes, and you may see them paddle along, and
they are coming towards us two apace, and full
of men."

I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so
was my nephew the captain; for he had heard
such terrible stories of them in the island, and
having never been in those seas before, that he
could not tell what to think of it, but said two or
three times, we should all be devoured. I must
confess, considering we were becalmed, and the
current set strong toward the shore, I liked it the
worse; however, I bade him not be afraid, but
bring the ship to an anchor, as soon as we came
so near as to know that we must engage them.

The weather continued calm. and they came on
space towards us; so I gave orders to come to an
anchor and furl all our sails. As for the savages,
Itold them they had nothinF to fear from them
but fire : and therefore they s tould get their boats
out, and fasten them, one close by the head, and
the other by the stern, and man them both well
and wait the issue in that posture; this I did, that
the men in the boats might be ready, with sheet
and buckets. to put out an fire these savages

might endeavour to fix upon t to outside of the ship.
In this posture we lay by for thorn, and in a little while

they came up with us; but never was such a horrid sight '

seen by Christians: my mate was much mistaken in his
calculation of their number, I mean of a thousand ca,
noes: the most we could make of them when they came
up, being about 126; and a great mauy of them too; for
some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them,
some more, and the least six or seven.

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to he
struck with wonder and astonishment, as at a sight
which they had doubtless never seen before; nor
could they, at first, as we afterwards understood, know
that to make of us. They came boldly up, however,

very near to us, and seemed to go about to row round
us ; but we called to our men ill the boats, not to let
them come too near tehm.

This very order brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for five or six cftheit
large canoes came so near our long-boat. that out
men beckoned with their hands to them to keep back ;
which they understood very well, and went back; but
at their retreat about 500 arrows came on board us
from these boats; and one of our men in the long.
boat was very much wounded.

However, I called to them not to fire by any means;
but we handed down some deal hoards into the boat,
and the carpenter presently set up a kind of a fence,
like waist board to cover them from the straws ol
the savages, if they should shoot again,

About half an hour afterwards they came all up in
a- body astern of us, and pretty near. so near that we
could easily discern what they were. though we could
not tell their design. l easily found they were some
of my old friends, the same sort of savages that I
had been used to engage with ; and in a little time
more they rowed somewhat farther out to sea. till they
came directly broadside with us. and then rowed
down straight upon us. till they came so near, that
they could hear us speak. Upon this l ordered all
my men to keep close. lest they should shoot any more
arrows, and make all our guns ready : but being so
near as tube within hearing. i made Friday go out
upon the deck, and call aloud to them in his lan-
gua e, to know what they meant: which accordingly
he id : whether they understood him or not, that I
know not ; but as soon as he had called to them. six
of them, who were in the foremost. or nighesthoat
to us. turned their canoes from us : and. stooping
down shewed us their naked hacksidcs; just as if,
in English (saving your presence), the had hid tll

lenge, we knew not: or whether it was done in mere
oortempt, or :1 Signal in 'he rest but immediately

Pride cried out, they were going to shoot; and un
happi y for him (poor fellow .) they let fly about three
hundred of their arrows ; and, to my mexpressiblo
grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in their
sight. The poor fellow was shot with no less than
three arrows, and about three more fell very nigh
him; such unlucky marksman they were !

I was so enraged with the loss of my old servant,
the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes, that
I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with
small shot, and four with great; and gave them such a
broadside as they had never had in theirlives before,
to be sure.

They were not above half a cable's length of when
we fired and our gunners took their aim so well, that
three or four of their canoes were overset, as we had
reason to believe, by one shot only.

The ill manners of turning up their bare bucksides
to us, gave us no great offence ; neither did I know
for certain whether that, which would pass for the
greatest contempt among us, might be understood so
by them or not; therefore in return, I had only re.
solved to have fired four or five guns with powder
only, which I knew would fright them sufliciently ;
but when they shot at us directly with all the fury they
were capable of, and especially-as they had lulled in
poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and value
and who, indeed, so well deserved it; Inot only had

been justified before God and man, but would nave'

been very glad, if I could to have overset every canoe
there and drowned every one of them.

above an hour after they were all gone.

Our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and
wound agreat many; but. in short, we never knew
any thing how it went with them ; for they fled so fast,
that, in three hours, or thereabouts, we could not see
above three or four straggling canoes: nor did we ever
see the rest any more; for a breeze of wind 5 ringing
up the same evening, we weighed and set sai for the
Brasils.

We had a prisoner indeed, but the creature was so
sullen, that he would neither eat nor speak ; and we
all fancied he would starve himself to death; but I
took a way to cure him ; for I made them take him,
and turn him into the long-boat, and make him believe
they would toss him into the sea again, and so leave
him where they found him, if he would not speak ;
nor would that do, but they really did throw him into
the sea, and came away from him ; and then .he fol>>
lowed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to
them in histongue, though they knew not one word of
what he said. However, at last, they took him in
again and then he began to be more tractable; nor
tlid I ever design they should drown him.

We were now under sail again ; butl was the most
disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man Fri~
day, and would have been very glad to have one
back to the island, to have taken one the rest rom
thence for my occasion, but it could not be; so we
went on. We had one prisoner, as I have said ; and
it was alon while before I could make him under-
stand any t ing ; but in time, our men taught him
some En lish, and he bevan to be a little tractable:
afterwar s we inquired what country he came from,
but could make nothing of what he said; tor his
speech was so odd, all gutterals, and spoken in the

iroat, in such a hollow and odd manner, that we
could never form a word from him; and we were all
of opinion that they might speak that language as well

ceive that they had any occasion either for teeth,
tongue, lips, or palate ; but formed their wordsjust as
a hunting horn forms a tune, with an open throat ; he
told us, however, some time after, when we had taught
him to speak alittle English. that they were going,
with their kings, to fight agrcat battle. When he said
kings, we asked him, how many kings? He said
there were five nation (we could not make him under
stand the plural 3,) and that they all joined to go
against two nation. We asked him, W but made them

tivcs. as also those of Africa. when they learn English,
they always add two e's at the end ofthe words where
we use one, and place the accent upon the last of
them -. as makes, takee, and the like; and we could
not break them of it; nay, I could hardly make Fri.
day leave it ofi'. though at last he did.

And now I name the poor fellow. once more, i must
take my last leave of him; poor honest Friday! We
buried hint with all decency and solemnity possible
by putting him into a colfin, and throwing him into
the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns for him :
and so ended the life of the most grateful faithful,
20mm, and most affectionate servant that ever man

ad.

We now went away with a fair wind for Brasil,
and, in about twelve days time, we made land in the
latitude of five degrees south of the line, being the
north-easternmost land of all that part of America.
We kept on S. by E. in si ht of the shore four days,
when we'made the cape .'t. Augustine, and in three
days came to an anchor off the bay of All Saints, the
old place of my deliverance, from whence came both
my good and evil fate.

Never did a ship come to this part that had less bu-
siness than I had : and yet it was with great dificulty
that we were adtnitte l to hold the least correspond-
ence on shore. Not my partner himself. who was
alive and made a great figure among them, not my

two merchant trustees, nor the fame of my wonderful

reservation in the island, could obtain me that favour:

ut my partner remembering thatI had given five
hundred moidores to the prior of the monastery of the
Augustincs, and three hundred and seventy-two to the
poor, went to the monastery. and obliged the prior
that then was, to go to the governor, and beg leat e for
me presently, with the caplnin, and one more, besides
eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more; and
this upon condition absolutely capitulaled for, that we
should not afl'er to land any goods out of the ship, or
to carry any person away without license.

They were so strict with us as to landing any goods,
that it was with extreme difficulty that i got on shore
three bales of English goods, such as fine broad-cloths,
studs and some linen, which I had brought for a pre
sent to my parlner.

He was a very generous,hroad~hearted man, though
(like me) he came from little at first; and though he
knew not that i had the least design ofgiving him any
thing, he sent me on board a present of h-esh provi-
sions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moi-
times, including some tobacco, and three or four fine
medals in gold. But I was even with him in my pm
sent. which as I have said. consisled of fine broad-
cloth, English stufi's. lace, and fine hollands. Also,l
delivered him about the value of 1001. sterling, in the
same goods, for other uses : and l obliged him to set
up the sloop which I had brought with me from Eng-
land, as I have said, for the use of my colony, in
order to send the relreshmentsl intended to my plan--
union.

Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sleep in
a. very few days, for she was already framed ; and I
have the master of her such instruction as he could
not miss the place ; nor did he miss it, as I had on

letter to the g0vernor Spaniard, to allot him a sufiicio
ent quantity of land for a plantation ; and giving him
some clothes, and tools for his planting work, which
he said he understood, having been an old planter in
Maryland, and a buccanneer into the bargain.

I encouarged the fellow by granting all he desired t
and, as an addition, I gave him the savage which we
had taken prisoner of war. to be his slave, and order-
ed the governor Spaniard to give him his share 01
every thing he wanted, with the rest.

When we came to fit this man out, my old partner
told me, there was a certain very honest fellow, a
Brasil planter of his acquaintance, who had fallen into
the displeasure of the church : " I know not what the
matter is with him," says he, " but on my consci;

tunity to make his escape, with his wife and two
daughters; and if I would let them go to the'lsland,
and allot them a plantation, he would give them a
small stock to begin with; for the officers of the In_

had nothing left but a little household stuff, and two
slaves ; " And," adds. he "thowh I hate his mind>>

[granted this presently, and joined my Englishman

Among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in

and five calves, about twenty-two hogs, among them,
three sows bigwith pig, two mares, and a stone-horse.

that the poor persecuted man had two daughters, and
there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted ; the
rest had wives of their own, though in another country;

All this cargo arrived safe, and, as you may easily

as he observed, bound never to finish any voyage he
began. How happy had it been for me if I had gone
with him?

But it was too late now ; all things Heaven appoints
are best. Had I gone With him, I had never had so
many things to be thankful for, and you had never
heard of the Second Part of the Travels and Adven-

ures of Robinson Crusoe; so I must leave here the
fruitless exclaiming at myself, and go on with my
voyage.

From the Brasils we made directly away over the
Atlantic sea to the Ca e do Bonne Esperance. or, as
we call it, the Cape 0 Good Hope; and had a toler-
able good voyage, our coast generally south-east;
now and then a storm, and some contrary winds. But
my disasters at sea were at an end 3 my future rubs
and cross events were to befal me on shore; that it
might appear the land was as well prepared to be our
scourge as the sea, when Heaven who directs the cir-
cumstances ofthings, pleases to appoint it to be so.

Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a su er-
cargo on board, who was to direct all her motions
after she arrived at the Cape; only being limited to a
certain number of days for stay, by charter-party, at
the several ports he was to go to. This was none of
my business, neither did 1 med'dle with it at all; my
nephew the captain, and the supercargo, adjusting all
those things between them as they thought fit.

We made no stay at the Cape longer than was need-
ful to take in fresh water, but made the best of out
way for the coast of Coromandel; we were indeed
informed that a French man of war of fifty guns and
two large merchant-ships were gone for the Indies;
and as I knew we were at war with France, I had
some apprehensions of them ; but they went their own
way, and we heard no more of them. -

I shall not pester my account, or the reader, with
descriptions of places. journals of our voyages, varia-
uons of the compass, latitudes, meridian distances,
tradeowinds, situation of ports. and the like; such as

I

almost all'the histories of long navigation are full of
and which make the reading tiresome enough, and are
perfectly unprofitable to all that read, except only to
those who are to go to those places themselves.

It is enough to name the ports and places which we
tauched at, and what occurred to us upon our pass-
ing from one to another. We touched first at the
island of Madagascar, where, though the people are
fierce and treacherous, and, in particular, very well
armed with lances and bows, which they use with
inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with
them awhile; they treated us very civilly ; and for
some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, scis-
sars, doc. they brought us eleven good {at bullocks,
middling in size, but very good in flesh, which we
took in, partly for fresh prowsions for our present
spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.

We were obliged to stay here for some time after
we had furnished ourselves with revisions; and I
that was always too curious to loo into every nook
of the world wherever I came, was for going on shore
as often as I could. It was on the east side of the
island that we went on share one evening, and the
people, who by the way are very numerous, came
thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a die-
tance; as we had traded freely with them, and had
been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no danger,-
but when we saw the people we out three boughs out

which, it seems. is a mark in the country not only 0
.ruce and friendship, but when it is accepted, the other
side set u three poles or boughs also, which is a sig-
nal that t ey accept the truce too; but then this is a

nown condition of the truce, that you are not to pass
beyond their three poles towards them, nor they come
past your three poles or bonghs towards you ; so that
you are perfectly secure within the three poles, and
all the space between your poles and theirs is allowed
like a market for free converse, traffic, and commercet
When you go thither you must not carry your weapons

with you; and if they come into that space they stick
up their javelifls ard lances all at the first poles, and
come on unarmed ; but if any violence is offered
them and the truce thereby broken, away they run
to the poles and lay hold of their weapons, and then
the truce is at an end.

It happened one evening when we went on shore.
that a greater number of their people came down than
usual, but all was very friendly and civil. They
brought with them several kinds of provisions, for
which we satisfied them with such toys as we had 3
their women also brought us milk and roots, and sec
veral things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet;
and we made us a little tent or but, of some troughs
of trees, which lay on shore all that night.

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not
so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest; and the
boat lying at an anchor about a stone's cast from the
land, with two men in her to take care of her I made
one of them come on shore, and getting some boughs
of trees to cover us also in the boat, Ispread the sail
on the bottom of the boat and lay on board, undo!
the cover of the branches of the trees, all night.

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one 01
our men make a terrible noise on the shore, callin
out for God's sake to bring the boat in, and come an
help them, for they were all like to be murdered 3
at the same time I heard the firing of five muskets,
which' was the number of the guns they had and that
three times over; for, it seems, the natives here were
not so easily frighted with guns as the savages wen
in America, where i had to do with them.

All this while I knew not what was the matter.
but rousing immediately from sleep with the noise, I
caused the boat to be thrust in, and resolved, with
three fusils we had on board, to land and assist on!
men.

We got the boat soon to the shore ; but our men
were in too much haste; for being come to the shore,
they plunged into the -valcr to get to the boat with all

0F ROBINSON CRUSOE. 175

the expedition they could, being pursued by between
three and four hundred men. Our men were but nine
mall, and only five of them had {usils with them;
the rest, indeed, had pistols and swords, but they
were of small use to them.

We took'up seven of our men, and with difficulty
enough too, three of hem being very ill wounded ;
and that which was still worse was, that while we
stood in the boat to take'our men in, we were in as
much danger-as they were in on shore; for they poured
their arrows in upon us so thick, that we were fail:
to barricade the side of the bout u with the benches
and two or three loose boards, which to our great sa-
tisfaction we had by mere accident, or providence
rather, in the boat.

And yet had it been daylight, they are. it seems,
such exact marksmen, that if they could have seen
but the least art of any of us, they would have been

. sure of us. e had, bv the lightnf the moon, a little

sight of them as they stood elting us from the shore
wtth darts and arrows, and avinggot ready our fire-
arms we gave them a volley, and we could hear by
the cries of some of them, that we had wounded se-
veral; however, they stood thus in battle array on the
shore till break of day, which we suppose was that
they might see the better to take their aim at us.

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how
to weigh our anchor, or set up our sail, because we
must needs stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with
email shot. Vl'e made si nals ofdistress to the ship,
which though she rode aleague off, yet my nephew,
the captain, hearin our firing. and by glasses perceiv-
ing the posture we ay in, and that we fired towards
the shore, pretty well understood us ; and weighing
anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as
hedurst with the ship. and then sent another boat with
ten hands in her to assist us ; but we called to them
not to come too near. telling them what condition we
were in ; however, they stood in nearer to us; and

one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in his
hand, and keeping our boat between him and the
enemy, so that they could not perfectly see him, swam
on board us, and made the line fast to the boat, upon
which we slipt our little cable. and leavin 'our anchor
behind, they towed us out of the reach 0 the arrows,
we all the while lying close behind the barricade we
had made.

As soon as we were got from between the ship and
the shore, that she could lay her side to the shore,
we ran along just by them, and we poured in a broad
side among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead,
small bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot,
which made a terrible havoc among them.

When we were got on board and out of danger, we
had time to examine into the occasion of this fray ;
and indeed our super-cargo who had been often in
those parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure
the inhabitants would not have touched us after we
had made a truce, if we had not done something to
provoke them to it. At length it came out, viz. that
an old woman, who had come to sell us some milk.
had brought it within our poles, with ayoung woman
with her, who also brou ht some roots and herbs; and
while the old woman whether she was mother to
the young woman or no they could not tell) was sell-
ing us the milk, one of our men ofi'ered some rude-
ness to the wench that was with her, at which the old
woman made a great noise. However, the seamen
would not quit his prize, but carried her out of the
old woman's sight among the trees, it being almost
dark. The old woman went away without her, and,
as we suppose, made an outcry among the peeple she
came from ; who, upon notice, raised this great army
upon us in three or four hours; and it was great odd!
but we had been all destroyed.

One of our men was killed with a lance that was
thrown at him, 'ust at the beginning of the attack, as
he sallied out o the tent we had made; the rest came
of free, all but the fellow who was the occasion at

WWWxW'NWWW'WWMMx'wWM\V\m~M\W MW
all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his black
mistress, for we could not hear what became of him
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after,
though the wind presented, and made signals for him;
made our boat sail up shore and down shore several
leagues, hut in vain ; so we were obliged to give him
over ; and if he alone had suffered for it, the loss had
been the less.

I could not satisfy myself, nowever, without ven-
turing on shore once more, to try if I could learn
any thing of him or them. It was the third night
after the action that I had a great mind to learn, ifl
could by any means, what mischief he had done, and
how the game stood on the Indian side. I was care-
ful to do it in the dark, lest we should he attacked
again ; but 1 ought indeed to have been sure that the
men 1 went with had been under my command be-
fore l engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischiev-
ous, as I was brought into it without any knowledge
or desire.

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in
the ship besides the supercargo and myself,- and we
landed two hours before midnight, at the same place
where the lndians stood drawn up the evening before.
Handed here. because my design. as l have said,
was chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, and it
they had left any marks belt-nd them, or of the min.
chief we had done them ; and I thought if we could
surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might get
our men again by way of exchange:

We landed Without any noise, and divided our men
into two com anies, whereof the boatswain command-
ed one, and the other. We neither could hear nor

ee any body stir, when we landed ; so we matched

up, one body at a distance from the other, to the

field of battle. At first u e could see nothing. it being

very dark; but by and by our boatswain. thatled the

first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body. This

cumstances that they were at the place where the In

dians had stood, they waited for my coming up

Here we concluded to halt till the moon began to rise,
which we knew would he in less than an hour, and
then we could easily discern the havock we had made
among them. We told two-and-thirty bodies upon
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some
had an arm, and some a leg, shot 03', and one his
head; those that were wounded we supposed they
had carried away.

When we had made, as l thought, a full discovery
ofall we could come at the knowledge of, I was for
going on board again; but the boatswam and his party
often sent me word, that they were resolved to make
a visit to the Indian town, where these dogs, as they
called them, dwelt, and desired me to go along with
them, and if they could find them, as they still fan-
cied they should, they did not doubt, they said, get-
ting a good booty, and it might be they might find
Thomas Jefl'rys there, that was the man's name we
had lost.

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I know well
enough what answer to have given them; for] would
have commanded them instantly on board, knowing
it was not a hazard fit for us to run who had a ship
and a ship's loading in our charge, and a voyage to
make, which depeuded very much upon the lives 01
the men; but as they sent me word they were resolv-
ed to go, and only asked me and my company to go
alonu with them, I positively refused it, and rose up
(for T was sitting on the ground) in order to go to the
boat. One or two of the men began to importune
me to go, and when i still refused positively, began
to grumble, and say they were not under my com-
mand, and they would go. "Como, Jack," says one
of the men, " will you go with me? I will go for
one." Jack said he would; and another followed,
and then another; and, in a word. they all left me
but am, whom, with mt'rch difficulty too,I persuaded
to slay . so the supercargo and l, with one man, went

back to the boat, where, I told them, we would stay
for thetn, and take care to take in as many of them
as should be left; for I told them it wasa mad thing
they were going about, and su posed most of them
would run the fate of Thomas efirys.

They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it
they would come ofl' again, and they would take care,
860. So away they went. I entreated them to con--
sider the ship and the voyage; that their lives were
not their own; and that they were entrusted with the
voyage in some measure; thatif they miscarried, the
snip might be last for want of their help; and that
they could not answer it to God and man. I said a
great deal more to them on that head, but I might as
well have talked to the main-mast of the ship; they
were mad upon their 'oumey; only they gave me
good words and begge I would not be angry; said
they would be very cautious; and they did not doubt
but they would ~be back again in about an hour at
farthest; for the Indian town, they said, was not
above half a mile 06'; though they found it above
two miles before the got to it.

Well, they all went. away as above: and though
the attempt was desperate, and such as none but mad>>
men would have gone about, yet to give them their
due, they went about it warily as well its boldly. They
were gallantly armed that is true; for they had every
man a fusil or musket, a bayonet, and every man a
pistol; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of
them hangers, and the boatswain and two more had
pole-axes; besides all which they had among them
thirteeen hnnd grenadoes. Bolder fellows, and bet.
ter provided, never went about any wicked work in
the world.'

When they went out their chief desi was plun-
der,' and they were in mighty hopes o finding gold
there; but a circumstance, which none of them were
aware of, set them on {fire with revenge, and made
devils of them all. When they came to the few In
dian houses, which they thought had been the town,
which were not above half a mile off, they were un
der a great disappointment; for there were not above
twelve or thirteen houses; and where the town was,
or how big, they knew not. They consulted there-
fore what to do, and were some time before they could
resolve; for if they fell upon these they must cut all
their throats, and it was ten to one but some of them
might escape, it being in the hight, though the moon
was up; and if one escaped he would run away, and
raise all the town, so they should have a whole army
upon them. Again, on the other hand, if they went
away, and left those untouched (for the people were
all asleep), they could not tell which way to look for
the town.

However the last was the best advice; so they re-
solved to leave those houses, and look for the town
as well as they could. They went on a little way, and
found a cow tied to a tree : this they presently con-
cluded would be a good guide to them ; for they said
the cow certainly belonged to the town before them
or the town behind them, and if they untied her tliev
should see which way she went; if she went baclt
they had nothing to say to her, but if she went for-
ward they had nothing to do but to follow her; so
they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags.
and the cow went on before them. In a word, the
cow led them directly to the town, which, as they re

rted. consisted of above two hundred houses or

uts; and in some of these they found several fami-
lies living together.

Here t ey found all silent; as profoundly secure as
deep and a country that had never seen an enemy

f that kind could make them. Upon thisthey called
another council to consider what they had to do, and
in a word, they resolved to divide themselves into
three bodies, and to set three houses on fire in three
parts of the town; and as the men came out, to seize
them and bind them; if any resisted, they need not
be asked what to do then, and so to search the resto!Wn'm-- --- ..-_._._e.e_e'n.r

the houses for plunder; but resolved to march silently
first through the town, and see what dimensions it was
of, and consider if they might venture upon it or no.

They did so, and desperately resolved that they
would venture upon them ; but while they were am.
mating one another to the work, three of them that
were a. little above the rest called out aloud, and told
them they had found Thomas Jefirys: they all ran
up to the place; and so it was indeed, for there they
found the poor fellow, hanged up naked by onearm,
and his throat out. There was an Indian housejust
by the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of
the principal lndians who had been concerned in the
fray with us before, and two or three of them wounded
with our shot; and our men found they were awake,
and talking one to another in that house, but knew
not their number.

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so en-

. raged them. as before, that they swore to one another

they would he revenged, and that not an Indian who
came into their hands should have quarter; and to
work they went immediately, and yet not so madly as
l'iy the rage and fury they were in might be ex ected.

heir first care was to get something that would soon
take fire; but after a little search they found that
would be to no purpow, for most of the houses were
low, and thatched with flags or rushes, of which the
country is full: so they presently made some wild-
fire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in the
palms of their hands; and in a quarter of an hourthey
set the town on fire in firm or five places, and part'y
cularly that house where the Indians were not gone

at the door, where theydrove them back. the boat,

WIn short, most of the Indians who were in the open
pa rt of the house were killed or hurt with the grenade,
except two or three more, who pressed to the door,
which the boatswain and two more kept with the
hayonets in the muzzlesoftheirpieces, and dispatched
all who came thatway. Butthere was another apart
ment in the house, where the prince, or king, or
whatsoever he was, and several others, were; and
they kept in till the house, which was by this time all
of a light flame, fell in upon them, and they were
smothered or burnt together.

All this while they fired not a gun because they
would not woken the people faster than they could
master them ; but the tire began to waken them fast
enough. and our fellows were glad to keep a littleto--
gether in bodies ; for the fire grew so raging, all the
houses being made of light combustible stuff, that they
could hardly bear the street between them, and their
business was to follow the fire for the surcr execu-
tion. As fast as the fire either forced the people out
of those houses which were burning, or frighted them
out of others, our people were readym their doors to
knock them on the head, still' calling and hallooing
to one another to remember Thomas J efi'rys. '

While this was doing I must confess I was very
uneasy and especially when'I saw the flames of the
town, which, it being night, seemed to be just by me.

My nephew the captain, who was roused by his
men too, seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not .
knowing what the matter was, or what danger I was
in ; especially hearin the guns too, for by this time
-they beganto usetheir re-arms. Athousandthoughts
oppressed his mind concerning me and the super
cargo what should become of us; and at last, though .
he could ill-spare any' more men, yet, not knowing
what exigence we might be in, he takes another boat,
and with thirteen men and himself 'comes on shore E

He was surprised to see me and the supercttrgo in
due boat with no more, than two men, for one had
oeen left to keep the boat ; and though he was glad
that we were well. yet he was in the same impatience
with us to know what was doing, for the noise con-
tinued and the flame increased. [confess it was next
to an impossibility for any men in the world to re-
strain their curiosity of knowing what had happened,
or their concern for the safety of the men. In a
word, the captain told me he would go and help his
men, let what would come. I argued with him, as I
did before with the men, the safety of the ship, and
the danger of the voyage, the interest of the owners
and merchants, doc. and told him I would go, and the
two men, and only see if we could at a distance. learn
what was like the be the event, and come back and
tell him. -

It was all one to talk to my nephew, as it was to
talk to the rest before; he would go, he said, and he
only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for
he could not think of having his men lost for want of
help ; he had rather. he said, lose the ship; the voy-
age, and his life, and all: and so away went he. .

Nor was I any more able to stay behind now than
lwas to persuade them not to before; so, in short, A
the captain ordered two men to row back the pin-
nace, and fetch twelve men more from the ship, leav- ~
log the long-beat at an anchor ; and that when they
came back six men should keep the two boats, and
six more come after us, so that he left only sixteen i
men in the ship; for the whole ship's com any con-
sisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were est in the
first quarrel which brought this mischief on.

Being now on the march, you may be sure we fell
little or the round we trod on, andbeing guided by
the fire we ept no path, but went directly to the
place of the flame. If the noise of the guns were sur- l
prising to us before, the cries of the poor people were .
now quite of another nature, and filled us with hor-
ror. I must confess I never was at the sacking of a

heard of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda in Ire
land and killin I man, woman and child ; and 1 had
read of Count illy sacking the city of Magdebourg
and cutting the throats of22,000 of both sexes ; but;
never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is it
possible toldescribe it, or the horror which was upon
our minds at hearing it. '
However, we went on, and at length came to the
town, though there was no entering the streets of it
for the fire. The first object we met with was the
ruins ofa hut or house, or rather the ashes of it, 1hr
the house was consumed ; and just before it plain
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men
and three women killed ; and as we thought, one or
5 two more lay in the heap among the fire. In short,
I these were such instances of a rage altogether barba-
rous, and of a fury something beyond what was hu-
man, that we thought it impossible our men could be
guilty of it; or if they were the authors of it, we
thought that every one of them ought to be put to the
worst of deaths: but this was not all; we saw the fire
increased forward, and the cry went on just as the
fire went on, so that we were in the utmost confusion.
We advanced a little way farther, and beheld to our
astonishment three women naked, crying in a most
dreadful manner, and flying as it they had indeed had
wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen men, na-
tives, in the same terror and consternation, with three

I had made onr men kill them all. However. we
took some ways to let the poor {lying creatures know
:hat we would not hurt them, and immediately they
came up to us. and kneeling down, with their hands
lifted up, made piteous lamentations to us to save
them, which we let them know we would do; where-
upon they kept up t ether in a huddle close behind
us for protection. I eh my men drawn up together
and charged them to hurt nobody, but if possible to
get at some of our people, and see what devil it was

In a word to command them otf, assuring them that if
they staid till daylight they would have a hundred
thousand men about their ears: I say, I left them
and went among those flying people, taking only two
of our men with me ; and there was indeed a piteous
spectacle among them ; some of them had their feet
terribly burnt with trampling and running through the
fire, others their hands burnt; one of the women had
fallen down in the fire, and was almost burnt to death
before she could get out again; two or three at
the men had cuts in their backs and thighs, form our
men pursuing. and another was shot through the bo-
dy, and died while I was there. _

I would fain have learnt what the occasion of all
this was, but I could not understand one word they
said, though by signs I perceived that some of them
knew not what was the occasion themselves. I was
so terrified in my thou hts at this outrageous attempt,
that I could not stay t ere, but went back to my own
men : I told them my resolution, and commanded
them to follow me, when in the very moment came
four of our men, with the boatswain at theirhead.run-
ning over the heaps of bodies they had killed. all ct)
vered with blood and dust, as if they wanted more
people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them
as loud as they could halloo, and with much ado one
of them made them hear, so that they knew who we

are, and came up to us.

Ks soon as the hoatswain saw us he set up a halloo,
like a shout of trium h, for having its he thought,
more help come; an without bearing to hear me,
"Captain," says he, " noble captain, 1 am glad you
are come; we have not halfdone yet: villains! hell-
hounds dogs! I will kill as many of them as poor Tom
has hairs upon his head. 'We have sworn to spare
none of them , we will root out the very name ofthem
from the earth." And thus he ran on, out of breath
too with action, and would not give us leave to speak
a word. .

At last, raising my voice, that I might silence him
a little, "Barbarous dog '." said I, " what are you
doing? I won't have one creature touched more upon
pain of death. I charge you upon your life to stop

.your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead

man this minute."

" Why Sir," says he, " do you know what you do,
or what they have done? If you want a reason for
what we have done, come hither ;" and with that ho
shewed me the poor fellow hanging upon a tree witl.
his throat cut.

I confess I was urged then myself, and at anothe:

time should have been forward enough ; but l thought

they had carried their rage too far, and thought of
Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi, " Cursed
be their anger for it was fierce; and their wrath, {or
it was crue ." But I had now a new task upon my
hands; for when the men [carried with me saw the
sight as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain
them, as I should have. had with the others; nay, my
nephew himself fell in with them, and told me in
their hearing, that he was only concerned for her of
the men being overpowed; for, as to the people, he
thou ht not one of them ought to live; {or they had
all gutted themselves with the murder of the poor
man, and that they ought to be used like murderers.

not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise ,and
cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the su er.

' cargo and two men, and with these l walked bat: to
the boats. It was a very great peace of folly in me,

' lconfess, to venture back as it were alone; for as
It began now to be almost do , and the alarm had run
over the country, there stoo about forty men armed
with lances and bows at the little place where the
twelve or thirteen houses stood mentioned before,
but by accident I missed the place, and came di-
rectly to the sea-side: and by that time I got to the
sea-side it was broad day: immediately I took the
pinnace and went aboard. and sent her back to assist
the men in what might happen.

I observed that about the time I came to the boat>>-
side the fire was retty well out, and the noise abat-
ed; but in about all' an hour after I got on board I
heard a volley of our men's fire-arms. and saw a great
smoke; this, as I understood afterwards, was our men
falling upon the forty men, who, as I said, stood at
the few houses on the way; of whom they killed six-
teen or seventeen, and set all those houses on fire,
but did not meddle with the women or children.

By the time the men got to the shore again with the
pinnacc our men began to appear; they came dro
ping in some and some, not in two bodies, and m
form, as they went out, but all in heaps, stragglin
here and there in such a manner thata small force 0
resolute men might have cut them till 06".

But the dread of them-was upon the whole coun-

ry. The people were amazed and surprised, and so
fri hted that I believe a hundred of them would have
lie at the sight of but five of our men. Nor in all
this terrible action was there a man who made any
considerable defence; they were so surprised between
the terror of the fire, and the sudden attack of our
men in the dark, that they knew not which way to
turn themselves; for If they fled one way they were

met by one party, if back again by another; so that
they were every where knocked down. Nor did any
of our men receive the least hurt, except one who
strained his foot, and another had one of his hands
very much burnt.

I was very angry with my nephew the captain, and
indeed with all the men, in my mind, but with- him
on particular. as well for his acting so out of his duty,
as commander of the ship, and having the charge of
the voyage upon him,asin his promptin rather than
coolingtie rage of his men in so bloo y and cruel
an enterprise : my nephew answered me very respect-
fully, hut told me that when he saw the body of the
poor seamen whom they had murdered in such a cruel
and barbarous manner. he was not master of himself,
neither could he govern his passion; he owned he
should not have done so, as he was commander ofthe
ship, but as he wasa man and nature moved him,
he could not bear it. As for the rest of the men they
were not subject to me at all, and they knew it well
enough. so they took no notice of my dislike.

The next day we set sail, so we never heard any
more of it. Our men differed in the account of the
number they killed ; SOme said one thing, some ano-
ther,- but according to the best of their accounts, put
all together, theykilled and destroyed about a hundred
and fifty people, men, women, and children, and let!
not a house standing in the town.

As for the or fellow, Thomas J elfrys, as he was
quite dead, or his throat was so cut that his head
was half off, it would do him no service to bring him
away; so they left him where they found him, only
took him down from the tree where he was hanged
by one hand.

However just our men thought this action to be, 1
was against them in it, and I always after that time
told them God would blast the voyage; for I looked
upon the blood they shed that night to be murder in
them: for though it is true that they killed Thomas
Jet'frys, yet it was true that J ell'rys was the aggressor,

had broken the truce, and had violated or debauched
a young woman oftheirs, who came to our camp in-
nocently, and on the faith of their ca itulation.

The boatswain defended this quarre when we were
afterwards on board. He said, it was true that we
seemed to break the truce, but really had not, and that
the war was begun the night before by the natives
themselves, who had shot at us. and killed one of our
men withoutjust provocation; so that as we \\ ere in a
capacity to fight them, we might also be in acapacity
to do ourselves justice upon them in an extraordinary
manner; that though the poor man had taken liberty
with a wench, he ought not to have been murdered,
and that in such a villanous manner; and that they
did nothing but what was just. and that the laws of
God allowed to he done to murderers.

One woult. think this should have been enough to
have warned usagainstgoingon shoreamong heathen:
and. barbarians; but it is impossible to make man-
kind wise but at their own ex erience; and their ex<<

orience seems to be alwayso most use to them when

- It is dearest bought.

_ We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and
from thence to the coast of Coromandel, only to
touch at Surat; but the chief of the supercargo's de-
sign lay at the Bay of Bengal, where if he missed at
the business outward-bound he was to go up to China,
and return to the coast as he came home.

The first. disaster that befe] us was in the Gulf of
Persia, where five of our men venturing on shore on
the Arabian side of the Gulf were surrounded by the
Arabs, and either all killed or carried away into sla-

escue them, and had but just time to get off their
boat. I began to uphraid them tvitn the just retribu-
tion of Heaven in this case; but the hoatswain very
warmly told me. he thought I went farther in mycen-
sures than I could shew any warrant for in Scripture,
and referred to the thirtt'eulh of St. Luke. ver. 4,

the tower of Siloam fell, were not sinners above ah
the Galileans; but that which indeed put me to silence
in this case was, that none of these five men who
were now lost were of the number of those who went
on shore to the massacre of Madagascar (so I always
called it, though our men could not bear the word mas

more with any patience :) and indeed this last circum

stance, asI have said, put me to silence for. the present.

But my frequent preaching to them on this subjec
had worse consequences than I expected ; and the
boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt,
came up boldly to me one time, and told me he found
that I continually brought that affair upon the stage,
that I made unjust reflections upon it, and had used
the men very ill on that account. and himself in a>>.
ticular; that as I was but a passenger, and ha no
command in the ship or concern in the voyage, they
were not obliged to bear it ; that they did not know
hut I might have some ill design in my head, and pen-
hapscall them to an account for it when they came to
England; and that therefore, unless I would resolve to
have done with it, and also not to concern myself fan-
ther with him, or any of his affairs. he would leave
the ship ; for he did not think it was safe to sail with
me among them.

i heard him patiently enough till he had done, and
then told him that I did confess I had all along oppos-
ed the massacre of Madagascar, for such I would al
ways call it ; and that I had on all occasions spoken
my mind freely about it, though not more upon him
than any of the rest : that as to my having no com.
mand of the ship. that was true, nor did i exercise
any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my
mind in things which publicly concerned us all; asto
what concern I had in the voyage, that was none of
his business; I was a considerable owner ofthe ship,
and in that claim I conceived I had a right to speak,
even farther than I had yet done, and would not be
accountable to him or ary one else ; and began to be

a little warm with him; he made but little reply to
me at the time, and I thought that affair had been
over. We were at this time in the road to Bengal ;
and being willing to see the place, I went on shore
with the supereargo, in the ship's boat to divert my-
self; and towards evening was preparing to go on
board, when one of the men came to me, and told me
he would not have me trouble myself to come down u:
the boat, for they had orders not to carry me on
board. Any one may guess what a surprise I was in
at so insolent a meSsage ; and I asked the mar; who
bade him deliver that errand to me? He told me, the
coxswain. I said no more to the fellow, but bid him
let them know he had delivered his message, and that
I had given him no answer to it.

I immediately went and found out the supercargo,
and told him the story, adding. what I presently fore-
saw, viz. that there would certainly be a mutiny in
the ship; and entreated him to go immediately on
board the ship in an Indian boat, and acquaint the
captain of it but I might have spared this intelli-
gence, for before 1 had spoken to him on shore the
matter was effected on board : the boatswain, the gun-
ner the carpenter, and, in a word, all the inferior
oflicers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came
up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak with the
captain; and there the boatswain making a long ha-
raugue, (for the fellow talked very well) and rep~ating
all he had said to me, told the captain in a few words,
that ael was now gone peaceably on shore, they were
loath to use any violence with me; which if i had not
gone on shore, they would otherwise have (lone, to
oblige me to have gone. They therefore thought fit to
tell him, that as they shipped themselves to servein the
ship under hiscommand they would perform it faith-
fully; but ifl would not quit the ship, or the captain
oblige me to quit it. they would all leave the ship. and
sail no farther with him; and at that word All. he

was, it- seems, the signal agreed on between them, at
which all the seamen being got together, they cried
out, "One and All, One and All 3"

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and
of great presence of mind ; and though he was sur-
prised, you may be sure. at the thing. yet he told them
calmly he would consider on the matter, but that he
could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about
it : he used some arguments with them to shew them
the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing, but it
was all in vain ; they swore and shook hands round,

, before his face, that they would go all on shore unless
' he would engage to them not to sufl'er me to come on

board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his
obligation to me, and did not know how I might take
it ; so he began to talk cavalierly to them ; told them
that I was a very considerable owner in the ship. and
that in justice he could not put me out of my own
house ; that this was next door to serving me as the
famous pirate Kid had done, who made the mutiny in
the ship, set the captain on shore in an uninhabited
island, and ran away with the ship; that let them go
mto what ship they would, if ever they came to Eng.
land again it would cost them deer; that the ship was
mine, and that he would not put me. out of it : and
that he would rather lose the ship, and the voyage too,
than disohlige me so much; so they might do as they
pleased. However, he would go on shore, and talk
with me there, and invited the boatswain to go with
him, and perhaps they might accommodate the matter
with me.

But they all rejected the preposal ; and said, they
would have nothing to do with me any more, neither
on board nor on shore ; and if l came on board, they
would go on shore. " Well," said the captain, " it
you are all of this mind, let me go on shore, and talk
with him :" so away he come to me with this account,

ever met with, except from pirates running away with
a ship, and setting those that would not agree with

their villany on shore: indeed this was the next door
to it both ways. However. my nephew left me two
servants, or rather, one companion and one sarvant :
the first was clerk to the porser, whom he engaged to
go with me; and the other was his own servant. I
took me also it good lodging in the house of an Eng-
lish woman, where several merchants lodged, some

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. l95

" I have a. project to communicate to you, which, at
It suits with my thoughts, may, for ought! know, suit
with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly con-
sidered it. .

" Here we are posted," says he, " you by accl-
dent, and I by my own choice, in a part of the world
very remote from our own country; but it is in a
country where. bytts who understand trade and busi-
ness, a great deal of money is to be got: if you wil
|tut a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we
will hire a ship here, the first we can get to our minds ;
you shall be captain. I'll be merchant, and we will go
a trading voyage to China; {hr what should we stand
still for? The whole world is in motion. rolling round
and round; all the creatures of God, heavenly bodies
and earthly, are busy and diligent: why should we he
ldle? There are no drones," says he." living in the
world but men: why should we he a! that number ?"

I liked this proposal very well; and the more be-
cause it seemed to he expressed with so much good
will. and in so friendly a manner. I will not say, but
that I might' by my loose and unhinged circumstances,
be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade. and in-
deed for any thing else ; or otherwise trade was none
of my element; however, I might, perhaps, say with
some truth. that if trade was not my element, ram-
bling was; and no proposal for seeing any art of the
world, which I had never seen before, cou d possibly
come amiss to me.

It was, however, some time before we could get a
ship to our mind ; and when we got a vessel, it was
not easy to get English sailors; that is to say, so many
as were necessary to govern the voyage. and manage
the sailors which we should pick up them. After
some time we got a. mate, a hoatswnin. and gunner,
English; a Dutch carpenter, and three Portugese
foremast-men: with these we found we could do well
enough, having Indian seamen. such as they are. to
make up.

history or their voy es and travels this way, that it
would be but very ittle 'diverson to any body, to
give a long account of the places we went to, and the
people who inhabit there: those things I leave to
others, and .sfer the reader to those journals and tm
vols of Englishmen, many of which, I find are pub-
lisherlnand more 'promised every day. It is enough
forme to tell you that we made the voyage to Achin,
in the island of Sumatra, first; and from thence to

'Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares for

opium, and for some arrack; the first, a commodit
which bears a great price among the Chinese, a
which, at that time, was very much wanted there: in
a ward, we went up to Susham; made a very real
voyage: were eight months out; and returned to en
gal: and Iwas very well satisfied with my adventure.

1 observe, that our )eople in England often admire
how the officers, which the Company send into India,
and the merchants which generally stay there, get such
very good estates as they do, and sometimes come
home worth sixty, seventy, and a hundred thousand
pounds al a time. But it is no wonder, or, at least,
we shall see so much farther into it, when we consider
the innumerable ports and places where they have a
free commerce, that it will then be no wonder; and
much less will it be so, when we consider, that at all
those places and ports where the English shi 5 come,
there is so much, and such conslam deman for the
growth of all other countries, that there is a certain
vent for the return, as well as a market abroad for the
goods carried out.

In short, we made a very good voyage, and 1 got
so much money by the first adventure, and such an
Insight into the method of tting more, that, had I
been twenty years younger, should have been tempt
ed to have staid there, and sought no farther for make
.ng my fortune. But whatwas all this to a man on the
wrong side of three-score, that was rich enough, and
came abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of
seeing the world, than a covetous desire of getting in

I? Anti indeed I think it is with great jusuce 'that I
now call it a restless desire. for it was so: when I was
at home, I was restless to go abroad; and now I was
abroad, I was restless to be at home I say, what was
this gain to me ?' I was rich enough already; nor had
I any uneasy desires ab0ut getting more money; and
therefore the profits of the voyage to me were things
of no great force to me, for the rompting me forward
to farther undertakings, hence I thought, that b this
voyage I had made no progress at all; because was
come back, as I might call it, to the place from whence
I came, as to a home; whereas my eye, which like
that which Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied
with seeing, was still more destrous of wandering a'nd
seeing. I was-come into a part of the world which I
never yras in before; and that part in particular which
I had heard much of; and was resolved to see as
much of it as I could ; and then I thou ht I might say
I had seen all the world that was wort seeing.

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions:
I do not name this to. insist upon my own, for I ao-
knowledge his was mo'st just, and the most suited to
the end of a. merchant's life; who, when he is abroad
upon adventures, it is his wisdom to stick to that, as
the best thin for him, which he is like to get the most
money by. ynew friend kept himself to the nature
of the thing, and would have been content to have

ne, like a carrier's horse, always to the same inn,

ckward and forward, provided he could, as he called
it, find his account in it: on the other hand. mine, as
old as I was, was the notion of a mad rambling box.
that never cares to see a thing twice over.

But this was not all: I had a kind of impatience
upon me to be nearer home. and yet the most unsettled
resolution imaginable, which way to go. In the inter-
val of these consultations. my friend, who was always
upon the search for business, proposed another voyage
to me, viz., among the Spice Islands; and to bring
home a load of cloves from the Manillas, or there-
shouts; places where, indeed, the Dutch do trade, but

the islands belong partly to the Spaniards ; though w
went not. so far. but to some otlter, where they have

not the whole power as they have at Batavia, Ceylon,
&c. We were not long in preparing for this voyage ;
the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come into

it ; however, at last, nothing else ofi'ering.and finding -

that really stirrin about and trading, the profit being
so great, and. asgI may say. certain, had more plea-
sure in it, and more satisfaction to the mind, than sit-
ting still : which. to me especially, was the unhappiest
part of life, I resolved on this voyage too: which we
made very successfully, touching at Borneo,and seve~
ral islands, whose names 1 do not remember, and
came home in about five months. We sold our spice.
which was chiefly cloves, and some nutmegs, to the
Persian merchants, who carried them away for the
Gulf; and, making near five of one, we really got. a
great deal of money.

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled
at me: " Well now," said he.with a sort of an agree-
able insult u n my indolent tetnper, " is not this bet-
ter than wal ing about here, like a man of nothing to
do, and spendinfg our time in starin at the nonsense
and ignorance o the Pagans?"--" hy truly," said l,
" my friend, I think it is; and I begin to be a convert
to the principles of merchandising. But 1 must tell
you," said I, " by the way, you do not know what I
am doing; for if once I conquer my backwardness,
and embark heartily, as old as lam, I shall harass
you up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall

ursne it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie still."

But to be short with my 5 eculations: a little while
after this there came in a utch ship from Batavia
she was a coaster. not an European trader. and of
about two hundred tons burden: the men, as they pro-
tended, having been so sickly. that the captain had not
man enough to go to sea With. he lay by at Bengal:
and, as if having got money enough, or being willing,
for other reasons, to go for Europe. he'gm'e public no-
fice.that he would sell his ship: this came to my ear.

mind to buy it. So I wenthome to him. and told him
of it: he considered awhile. for he was no rash man
neither; but musing some time. he re lied. " She is a
little too big; but' however, we will ave her." Ac-
cordingly we bought the ship; and. agreeing with the
master, we 'paid or her, and took possession ; when
we had dotte so, we resolved to entertain the men. if

were told. that they were all one. together. by land,
to Agra. the great city of the i Iognl's residence: and
from thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to
the Gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while.

called captain was the gunner only, not the comman-

they wereattacked on shore by some of the Malaccans,
who had killed the captain and three of his tnen : and
that after the captain was killed, these men. eleven in
ntnnber. had resolved to rttn away with the ship,
which they did . and had brou ht her in at the Bay of

to come, you'll get near two hours of them by the
difference of the tide,-not reckoning the length of the
way: besides, as they are only boats, and not ships.
they will not venture to follow you far out to sea,
especially if it blows."

" Well." said I, " you have been very kind in this:
what shall I do for you to make you amends .7"--
" Sir," says he. " you may not be so willing to make
me amends. because you may not be convinced oi
the truth of it: I will make an otl'er to you: I have
nineteen months pay due to me on board the ship

Dutchman that is with me, has seven months pay due

our quarter; upon which, seeing they were resolute
for mischief, and depended upon the strength that fol
lowed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so that
they lay upon our 'broadside, when immediately we

While this was doing, one of the three boats that
was behind, being forwarder than the other two, made
up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve her,
and we could afterwards see her take out the men:
we called again to the foremost boat, and offered a
truce to parley again, and to know what was her bu-

close under our stern. Upon this, our gunner, who
was a very dexterous fellow, run out his two chase.

In the boat shouted, waved their caps, and came on ;

it missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men,

chief among them; but we, taking no notice of that
weared the ship again. and brought our quarter to bear
upon them; and, firing three guns more, we found
the boat was split almost to pieces; in particular, her
rudder. and a piece of her stern, were shot quite away,

pick u some of the men, if they could, and save them
from rowning, and immediately to come on board
with them; because we saw the rest of the boats be-
gan to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed
their orders, and took up three men; one of which
was just drowning, and it was a good while before we
could recover him. As soon as they were on board,
we crowded all .the sail we could make, and stood
farther out to sea; and we found, that when the other
three boats came up to the first two, they gave over
their chase.

Being thus delivered front a danger, which though

- I knew not the reason of it. yet seemed to be much

greater than I apprehended,l took care that we should
change our course, and not let any one imagine whi-
ther we were going; so we stood out to sea eastward,
quite out or the course of all European ships, whether
they were bound to China, or any where else within
the commerce of the European nations.

When we were now at sea, we began to consult
with the two seamen, and inquite first, what the meat>>
ing of all this should be? The Dutchman let us intr
the secret of it at once; telling us, that the fellow that
sold us the ship, as we said, was no more than a
thief that had run away with her. Then he told us
how the captain, whose name too he mentioned, though
I do not remember it now, was treacherously murs
dered b the natives on the coast of Malacca, with
threeo his men; and that he, this Dutchman, and
four more, got into the woods, where they wandered
aboutagreat while; till at lensih he, in particular,
in a miraculous manner, made his escape, and swam
off toa Dutch ship, which sailing near the shore in
its way from China, had sent their boat on shore for
fresh water; that he durst not come to the part of
the shore where the boat was, but made shift in the
night to take in the water farther off, and swimming
a great while, at last the ship's boat took him up.

He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where
'wo of the seamen belonging to the ship had arrived.

having deserted the rest in their travels; and gave an
account. that the fellow who had run away with the
ship, sold her at Bengal to a ml of pirates, which wete
gone acruising in her; and that they had already
taken an English ship. and two Dutch ships, very
richly laden.

This latter part we found to concern us directly;
and though we knew it to be false, yet, as my partner
said very well. if we had fallen into their hands. and
they had such a prepossession against tts hefm'ehand,
it had been in vatn tor us to have defended ourselves,
or to hope for any good quarters at their hands; es-
pecially considering that our accusers had been our
judges and that we could have expected nothing from
them but what rage would have dictated, and ungo.
verned passion have executed; and therefore it was
his opinion,we should go directly hack to Bengal,
from whence we came. without utting in at any port
whatever; because there we con d give an account of
ourselves, and could prove where we were when the
ship put in, whom we bought her of, and the like;
and, which was more than all the rest, if we were put
to the necessity of brin 'ng it before the proper 'udges,
we should be sure tohlave some 'ustice; an not be
hanged first and judged afterwar s.

l was some time of my partner's opinion; butafter
a little more serious tltinlring,l told him, 1 thought
it was a very great hazard for usto attempt retumtng
to Bengal, for that: we were on the wrong side of the
Strait of Malacca :end that if the alarm was given.
we should be sure to be waylaid on every side, as
well by the Dutch of Batavia, as the English elsewhere;
that if we should be taken. as it were, running away,
we should even condemn ourselves, and there would
want no more evidence to destroy us. I also asked
the English sailor's opinion, who said, he was of my
mind. and that we should certainly he taken.

This danger a little started my partner. and all the
Ship's company: and we immediately resolved to {49

and from thence pursuing the first desi n. as tc trade
find some way or other to dis ose o the ship. and
come back in some of the vesse s of the country, such
as we could get. This was'approved of as the best
method for our security ; and accordingly we steered

away N. N. E. keeping above fifty leagues off from
the usual course to the eastward.

This, however, ut us to some inconveniences; for,
first the winds, w on we came to that distance from
the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us,
blowing almost trade as we call it, from the E. and

E. N. E., so that we were a long while upon our .

voyage, and we were but ill provided with vietuals
for so long a run ; and, which was still worse, then:
was some danger that those English and Dutch ships,
whose-boats pursued us, whereof some were bound
that way, mig t be got in before us; and if not, some
other shi hound to China might have information of
us from t em, and pursue us with the same vigour.

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought
myself, including the late escape from the long-boats,
to have been in the most dangerous condition that
ever I was in through all my past life; for whatever
ill circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued
for a thief before; nor had I ever done any thin
that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent, mucg
less, thievish. I had chiefly been mine own enemy;

.or, as I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy

but my own. But now I was embarrassed in the
worst condition imaginable; for, though I was perfect
ly innocent. I was in no condition to make that inno-
eence appear: and if I had been taken, it had been
under a supposed guilt of the worst kind; at least,a
rime esteemed so among the people I had to do with.

This made me very anxious to make an escape,
though which way to do it I knew not; or what port
or place we should go to. My partner, seeing me

' thus dejected. though he was the most concerned at

first, began to encourage me : and describing to me the
several ports of that coast1 told me. he would put in

on the coast of Cochinchina, or the bay of Tonquiu;
intending to go afterwards to Macao, a town once in
the possession of the Portuguese, and where still a

rent many European families resided, and particu-
farly the missionary priests usually went thither, in or-
der to their going forward to China.

Hither we then resolved to go; and accordingly,
though afler a tedious and irregular course, and very
much straitened for rovisions, we came within sight
of the coast very ear y in the morning; and upon re-
flection upon the ast circumstances we were in, and
the danger, if we ad not escaped, we resolved to put
into a small river, which, however, had depth enough
of water for us, and to see if we could, either over
land or by the ship's pinnace, come to know what
ships where in any port thereabouts. This happy step
was, indeed, our deliverance, fonthough we did not
immediately see any European ships in the bay of
Tonquin, yet, the next morning, there came into the
bnytwo Dutch ships; and a third without any colours
spread out, but which we believed. to be a Dutchman,
passed by at about two 12 ues distance, steering for
the coast of China: and, in t eat'temoon, went by two
English ships, steering the same course; and thus we
thought we saw ourselves beset with enemies, both
one way and the other. The place we were in was
wild and barbarous, the people thieves, even by oc-
cupation or profession; and though, it is true, we had
not much to seek of them, and except ettin a few
provisions, cared not how little we ha to o with
them; 'ct it was with much difficulty that we kept
ourselves frombeing insulted by them several ways.

We were in a small river of this country, within a

no cortes ondence with any other nation, and dealing
only in sh and oil, and such gross connnot! s:
and it may be particularly seen that they are. as I said,
the most barbarous of any of the inhabitants,viz. that
among other customs they have this one, that if any
vessel had the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon
their coast, they presently make the men all prisoners;
that is to say, slaves; and it was not long before we
found a spice of their kindness this way, on the occa
sion following:

I have observed above that our ship sprung a-lealt
at sea, and that we could not find it out: and however
it happened, that, as l have said, it was stopped un-
expectedly, in the happy minute of our bein to be
seized by the Dutch and English ships, near tie bay
of Siam: yet, as we did not find the ship so perfectly
tight and sound as we desired, we rcsolved,while we
were in this place, to lay her on shore, take out what
heavy things we had on board, which were not many,
and to wash and clean her bottom, and if possible to
find out where the leaks were.

Accordingly, having lighted the ship, and brought
all our guns, and other moveable things. to one side,
we trie to bring her down, that we might come at
her bottom; for, on second thoughts, we did not care
to lay her dry aground, neither could we find out a
proper place for it.

The inhabitants,-who had never been acquainted
with such a sight, came wondering down to the shore
to look at us; and seeing the ship lie down on one
side in such a Inaner, and heeling toward the shore,
and not seeing our men, who were at work on her
bottom with stages, and With their boats, on the off
side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast
away, and lay so very fast on the ground.

On this supposition they came all about us in two
or three hours time. with ten or twelve large boats,

 

. having some of them eight, some ten men but boat,

Intending. no doubt, to have come on board and lun-
der the ship; and if they had found us there, to ve

carried us away for slaves to their king, or whatever
they call him, for we knew not who was their go-
vernor.

When they came up to the shi , and began to row
round her, they discovered us al hard at work, on
the outside of the ship's bottom and-side, washing and

raving, and stopping, as every seafaring mun knows
now. '

They stood for awhile gazing at us, and we, who
were a little surprised, could not imagine what their
design was; but being willing to be sure, we took this
op'mrtunity to get some of us into the ship, and others
to mud don-n arms and ammunition to those that
were at work to defend themselves with if there should
be occasion; and it was no more than need; for, in
less than a. quarter of an hour's consultation, they
agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a wreck ; that
we were all at work endeavouring to save her, or to
save our lives by the help of our boats; .and when we
handed our arms into the boats, they concluded by that
motion that we were endeavourin to save some of
our goods. Upon this, they took it for granted they
all belonged to them, and away they came directly
upon our men, as if it had been a line of battle.

Our men seeing so many of them, began to be
frighted, for we lay but in an ill posture to min, and
cried out to us to know what they should do? imme-
diately called to the men who worked upon the stages.
to slip them down and get up the side into the ship,
and bade those in the boat to row round and come
on board; and those few of us that were on board
worked w ith all the strength and hands we had to bring
the ship to rights; but, however, neither the men u or.
the stage, nor those in the boats, could do as t ey
were ordered, betbre the Coehinchinose were upon
them,and, with two of their boats, boarded our long-
boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their pup
toners.

man, a stout, strong fellow, who having a musket in

nis hand, never offered to fire it, butlaid it down in
the boat, like a feel, as I thought. But-he understood
his business better than I could teach him; for he
grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by main force
out of their own boat into ours; where, taking him
by the two ears, he beat his head so against the boat's

gunnel, that the fellow died instantly in his hands; .

And, in the mean time. a Dutchman, who stood next,
ook up the musket, and with the but end of it so laid
about him, that he knocked down five of them who
attempted to enter the boat. But this was little to-
wards resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearles, be-
cause ignorant of their dan er, began to throw them-
selves into the long-boatgw ere we had but five men
to defend it. But one accident gave our men a com-
plete victory, which deserved our laughter rather than
any thing else, and that was this :--

Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside
of the ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had
caulked her to stop the leaks, had got two kettles just
let down into the boat; one filled with boiling pitch,
and the other with rosin. tallow, and oil, and such
stutf as the shipwrights used for that work; and the
man that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle
In his hand, with which he supplied the men that were
at work with that hot stud": two of the enemy's men
entered the boat justwhere this fellow stood,bein in
the fore-sheets; he immediately saluted them wit a
ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot, which so burnt and
sealded them, being half naked, that they roared out
like two bulls, and enraged with the fire, leaped both
into the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out
" Well done. J ack. give them some more of it ;" when
steppingforward himself, he takes one of their mops

men in three boats, there was not one that was not
scolded. and burnt with it in a mast frightful, pitiful

manner, and made such a howling and crying, that l '

never heard a worse noise, and, indeed, nothing like

It. for it is worth observing, that though pain natu-
ral :y makes all pea le cry out, yet every nation have
a particular way 0 exclamation, and make noises as
different from one another as their speech. i cannot
give the noise these creatures madea better name than

owling, nor a name more proper to the tone of it;
for i never heard any thing more like the noise of' the
wolves. which, as I have said, I heard howl in the
forest". on the frontiers of Languedoc.

Iwas never pleased with a victory better in my
life: not only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and
that our danger was imminent before; but as we got
this victory without any bloodshed, except of that man
the fellow killed with his naked hands, and which I
was very much concerned at; for I was sick of kilL
ing such poor savage wretches, even though it was in
my own defence, knowing they came on errands
which they thought just, and knew no better; and that
though it may be a just thing, because necessary,'for
there is no necessary wickedness in nature; yet I
thought it was a sad life. when we must be always

ourselves; and. infieedJ think so still; and I would,

.he ship swim. as it were, upright, began, as W9 sup-
posed, to see their mistake, and gave over the enter-
prise, finding it was not as they expected. Thus we
got clear of this merry fight; and having gotten some
rice, and some roots and bread. with about sixteen
good big hogs on board two days before, we resolved
to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever
came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be
surrounded the next day with r ues enough, perhaps
more than our pitch-kettle woul dispose of for us.
We therefore got all our things on board the same
evening, and the next morning were ready to sail. In
the meantime, lying at an anchor some distance from
the shore, we were not so much concerned, being now
In a fighting posture. as well as in a sailing posture. if
any enemy ad presented. The next day, having
finished our work within board. and finding our ship
was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set sail. we
would have one into the bay of Tonquin, for we
wanted to in arm ourselves of what was to be known
concerning the Dutch ships that had been there; but
we durst not stand in there, because we had seen so-
veral ships go in, as we sup osed, buta little before ;
so we kept on N. E. towar the isle of Formosa, as
much afraid of being seen by a Dutch or English
merchant-ship, as a. Dutch or English merchant-ship in
the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man of war.
When we were thus got to sea, we kept on N. E
as if we would go to the Manillas or the Philippine
islands, and this we did, that we might not fall into
the way of any of the European ships: and then we
steered 'north again, till we came to the latitude of 22
degrees 20 minutes, by which means we made the
island of Formosa directly, where we came to an
anchor. in order to get water and fresh provisions,
which the people there, who are very courteous and
civil in their manners, supplied us with willing] , and

agreements and bargains, which is what we aid no-
fmd among other eople, and may be owing to the re-
mains of Christianity, which was once planted here by
:1 Dutch mission of Protestants, and is a testimony of
what I have often observed, viz. that the Christian
religion always civilizes the people antl reforms their
manners, where it is received, whether it works sav-
ing effects upon them or not.

From hence we sailed still north,keeping the coast
of China at an equal distance, till we knew we were
beyond all the ports of China where our European
ships usually come; but being resolved, it' possible,
not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this
country, where, as our circumstances were, we could
not fall of being entirely ruined; nay. so great was
my fear in particular, as to my being taken by them,
that i believe finnlyl would much rather have chosen
to {all mto the hands of the S anish lnquisition.

Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we
resolved to put into the first trading part we should
come at, and standing in for the share, a boat came
all' two leagues to us, with an old Portuguese pilot on
hoard, who, knowing us to be an European ship,
came to otl'er his service, which indeed we were very
glad of, and took him on board; upon which, without
asking us whither we would go, he dismissed the boat
he came in, and sent it back.

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make
the old man carry us whither we would, that I began
to talk with hint about carrying us to the gulf of Nan-
quin,which is the most northern part of the coast of
Mine. The old man sald he knew the gulf of Natt-
guin very well; but smiling, asked us what we would

a there ?

I told him we would sell our cargo, and purchase
Chine wares. calicoes. raw silks, tea, wrought silks,
61,0. and so would return by the same course we came.
He told tts our best port had been to have put in at
Macao, where we could not fail of a market for our

opium to our satisfaction, and might, for our money,
have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as
we could at Nanquin. '

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk,
of which he was very opinionated, or conceited, I
told him we were gentlemen, as well as merchants,
and that we had afmind to go and see the great city
of Pekin, and the famous court or the monarchs of
China. " Why then," says the old man, " you should
go to Ningpo, where, by the river that runs into the

' sea there, you may go up within five leagues of the

great canal. This canal is a navigable made stream,
which goes through the heart of that vast em ire of
China, crosses all the rivers, passes some consi erable
hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to
the city of Pekin, being in length near two huntred
and seventy leagues." .

" Well," said I, " Seifinior Portuguese, but that is
not our business now; t e reat question is, if you can
carry us up to the city of anquiu, from whence we
can travel to Pekin afterwards ?" Yes, he said, he
could do so very well, and there was a great Dutch
ship gone that way just before. This gave me a
litt e shock: a Dutch ship was- now our terror, and we
had much rather have met the devil, at leastif he had
not come in too frightful a figure; we depended upon
it that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we
were in no condition to fight them; all the ships they
trade with in those parts. being of great burden, and of
much greater force than we were.

The old man found me a little confused, and under
some concern, when he named a Dutch ship ; and said
to me. " Sir, you need be under no apprehensions of
the Dutch; I suppose they are not now at war with

our' nation."--" No." said I. " that's true; but I

now not what liberties men may take when they are
out of the reach of the laws of their country."--
" Why," said he, " you are no pirates, what need
you fear; they will not meddle with peaceful met~
chants. sure." -

into my face at that word. it was hindered by some
stop in the vessels appointed by nature to circu ate it;

" What!" said I, seeming to know nothing of the
matter, " did they murder the captain ?"-----" No,"
said he. "I do not understand that they murdered

but he was, as I tell you, in the bay 0 Siam, in the

English and Dutch ships are a parcel o rash, proud
insolent fellows, that neither know what belongs to
justice, or how to behave themselves as the laws of
God and nature direct; but being proud of their
ofi'tces and not understanding their power, they would

them to insult men falsely accused. and determine

live to call some of them to an account of 'n, where
they may be taught how justice is in he executed; and
that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some
evidence may he had of the crime, and that he is the
man."

With this i told him. that this was the very ship they
had attacked; and gave him a full account of the skir-
mish we had with their boats, and how foolishly and
coward-like they had behaved. I told hint all the
story of our buyin the ship, and how the Dutchman
served us. I to) him tlte reasons 1 had to believe
that this story of killing the master by the Malaccans
was not true; as also the running away with the ship;
but that it was all a fiction of their own, to suggest
that the men were turned pirates; and they ought to
have been sure it was so, before they had ventured to
attack us by surprise. and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that they would have the blood of those men
rho were killed there, in our just defence, to answer
or.

The old man was amazed at this relation : and told
us. we were very much in the right to go away to the
north : and that if he might advise us, it should he to
$911 the ship in China, which we might very well (i
and buy or build another it the country; " And,'
said he. " though you will not get so good a shi'), yet
you may get one ahle enough to carry you and 31 your
goods back again to Bengal, or any where else."

I told him I would take his advice when I came to
any port where 1 could find a ship for my turn, or get
any customer to buy this. He re lied, i should meet
with custontersenongh for the ship at Nanquin. and

hat a Chinese junk would serve me very well to go
back again; and that he would procure me people
both to buy one and sell the other.

uWell, but, Seigninr," says I, " as you say they
know the ship so well. i may, perhaps, it" 1 follow
your measures, be instrumental to brin some honest,'
rnnocent men into a terrible broil. and. perhaps, be
murdered in cold blood; for wherever they find the
ship they will prove the uilt upon the men by prov-
ing this was the ship. an so innocent men may pro-
bably he overpowered and murdered."--" Why." said
the old man. " I'll find out a way to prevent that
also; for as I know all those commanders you 5 reel:

will be sure to set them to rights in the thing, and let
them know that they had been so much in the wrong:
that though the people who were on board at first
might run away With the ship, yet it was not true tha'
they had turned pirates; and that in articular those
were not the men that first went Off With the ship, but
innocently bought her for their trade ; and I am per
waded they will so far believe me, as, at least, to act

I, .. and will you deliver one message to them from
me P"-----' Yes, 1 will," says he. I' i!' you will give it
tinder your hand. in writing. that I maybe able to
rove it came from you. and not out of my own
end." I answered, that I would readily give it him
under my hand. So I took a pen and ink, and paper,
and wrote at large the story of assaulting me With the
long-boats, &c. the pretended reason of it, and the
unjust. cruel design 0 it; and concluded to the enm-
manders that they had done what they not only should
have been ashamed of, but also, that if ever they came
to England, and I lived to see them there, they should
all pay dearly for it, if the laws of my country were

south west point of the great gulf of Nanquin ; where
by the way.l came by accident to understand, that
the two Dutch shi s were vane that length before me,
and that l shoult certainfiy fall into their hands. I
consulted my partner again in this exigency, and he
was as much at a. loss as I was, and would very adly
have been safe on shore almost any where: ow-
ever, I was not in such perplexity neither. but! asked
the old pilot if there was no creek or harbour, which
I might put into, and pursue my business with the
Chinese privately, and he in no danger of the enemy.
He told me if I would sail to the southward about
two-and-forty leagues, there was a little, port called
Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission usually
landed from Macao, on their progresstoteach_theChris--
tion religion to the Chinese, and where no European
ships ever put in: and, if I thought proper to put in
there. I might consider what farther course to take
when l was on shore. He confessed, he said, it was
not a place for merchants. except that at some certain
times they had a kind of a fair there, when the men-
chants from Japan came over thither to buy theChine'se
merchandises.

We all agreed to go back to this place: the name
of the ort. as he called it, I may, perhaps, spell
wrong, orI do not particularly remember it, having
lost this, together with the names of many other laces
set down in a little pocket book, which was spoi ed by
the water, on an accident which l shall relate in its
order; but this I remember, that the Chinese or
Infpanese merchants we correspond with, call it by a
di 'erent name from that which our l'ortu uesc pilot
gave it, and pronounced it as above, Quiuc tang. .

Aswe'were unanimous in our,resolutions to go to
this place, we weighed the next day, having only gone
twice on shore, where we 'were to get fresh water; on
both which occasions the people of the country were
very civil to us, and brought us abundance of things
to sell to us; _I mean of provisions, plants, roots, tea,

222 LIFE AND ADVENTURES

We came to the other port (the wind being con-
trary') not till five days; but it was very much to out
satis action, and [ was joyful, and I may say thank-
ful, when lset my foot safe on shore, resolving, and
my partner too, that if it was possible to dispose of
ourselves and efiects any other way, though not every
way to our satisfaction. we would never set one foot
on board that unhawpy vessel again: and indeed I
must acknowled e, t at of all the circumstances of life
that ever I ha any experience of, nothing makes
mankind so com letely miserable as that of bein in
constant fear. 'ell does the Scripture say, " I'he
fear of man brings a snare ;" itis a life of death. and
the mind is so entirely suppressed by it, that it is ca-
pable of no relief ; the animal spirits sink, and all the
vigour of nature, which'usually supports men under
other afflictions. and is present to them in the greatest
exigencies, fails them here. .

Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the
fancy, by heiguening every danger; representin the
English and utch captains to be men incapab e of
hearing reason, or distinguishing between honest men
and rogues; or between a story calculated for our own
turn, made out of nothin , on purpose to decieve. and
a true genuine account 0 our whole voyage, progress,
and design; for we might many ways have convinced
any reasonable creature that we were not pirates: the
goods we had on board, the course we steered, our
frankly showing ourselves, and entering into such anti
such ports; even our very manner, the force we had,
the number of men, the few nrms, little ammunition,
and short provisions ; all these would have served -.c
convince any man that we were no pirates. The
opium, and 'other goods we had on board. would
make it appear that the ship had been at Bengal : the
Dutchman, who it is said, had the names of all the
men that were in the ship, might easily see that we
were a. mixture of English. Portuguese, and Indians,
and but two Dutchmen on board. These, and many
:thet particular circumstances. might have made it

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 22:,

evident to the understanding of any commander, whose
hands we might fall into, that we were no pirates
But fear, that blind useless passion, worked another
way, and threw us into the vapours; it bewildered
our understandinIIs, and set the imaginations to work,
to form a thousand terrible things, that, perhaps, might
never happen. We first supposed, as indeed every
body that related to us. that the seamen on board the
English and Dutch ships, but especially the Dutch,
were so enraged at the name of a pirate, and especi--
ally at our beating off their boats, and escaping, that
they would not give themselves leave to inquire
whether we were pirates or no ; but would execute us
ofilhand, as we call it, without giving us any mom for
a defence. We reflected that there was really so much
apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce
inquire after any more : as, first, that the ship was cer-
tainly the same, and that some of the seamen among
them knew her. and had been on board her; and,
secondly, that when we had intelligence at the river
Cambodia. that they were coming down to examine
us, we fought their boats, and fled: so that we made
no doubt hut they were as fully satisfied, of our being
pirates as we were satisfied of the contrary; and I
often said, I knew not but 1 should have been apt to
have taken the. like circumstances for evidence, if tho
tables were turned, and my case was theirs; and have
made no scruple of cutting all thP crew to pieces,
without bulievmg, or perhaps considering, what they
mi ht have to offer in their defence.
ut let that be how it will, those were our up re-
lrensions; and both my partner and 1 too scarce s ept
a night without dreamingof halters and yard-arms;
that is to say, gibbets; of fighting, and being taken ,
of killing, and being killed; and one night, 1 was -in
such a fury in my dream, l'ancying the Dutchmen had
boarded us, and i was knocking one of their seamen
down, that I struck my double fist against the side of
the cabin I lay tn, with such a force as wounded my
hand most grievonsly, broke my knuckles, and cut and

bruised the flesh. so that it not only waked me out of
my sleep, but 1 was once afraid I should have lost

two of my fingers. .
Another apprehension I had, was. of the cruel usage
we should meet with from them, if we fell into their
hands: then the story of Amhoyna came intomy head,
and how the Dutch might. perha s, torture us. as they
did our c0umrymen there; an .make some (it our
men, by extremity of torture, confess those crimes
they never were guilty of ; own themselves, and all of
us, to be pirates; and so they would put us to death,
with a. formal appearance of justice; and that they
might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship
and cargo, which was worth four or five thousand
pounds. put all together. _
These things tormented me, and my partner too,
night and day; nor did we consider that the captains
of ships have no authority to act thus; and if we had
surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer
the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be ac-
countable for it when they came into their own coun-
try. This, I say. gave me no satisfaction; for, if they
will act thus with us, what advantage would it be to
us that they would be called to an account for it? or,
if we were first to be murdered, what satisfaction
would it be to us to have them punished when they
came home ?
I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections
l now had upon the past variety of my particular cir-
cumstances; how hard I thought it was, that I, who
had spent forty years in a life of continued difliculties,
and was at last come, as it were, at the port or haven
which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and plenty,
should be a volunteer in new SO\YOWS, by my own un~
happy choice; and that I, who had escaped so many
dangers in my youth, should now come to be hanged
,In my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime I
was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of;
and in apluce and circumstance, where innocence was
not like to be any protection at all to me.
After these thoughts, somethin of reli 'on would
game in; and 1 would be considering that t is 'seemod
to me to be a disposition of immediate Providence;
and I ought to look upon it, and submit to it as such -
that although [was innocent as to men,I was far from
being innocent as to my Maker . and I ought to look
in, and examine what other crimes in my life were
most obvious to me, and for which Providence might
lustly inflict this punishment asa. retribution ; and that

ought to submit to this, 'ust as I would to a ship-
wreck, if it had pleased ad to have brought such a
disaster upon me. - '

In its turn. natural courage would sometimes take
its place; and then I would be talking myself up to
vigorous resolution, that I would not be taken to be
barbarously used by a' parcel of mercilesswretches in
cold blood; that it was much better to have fallen
into the hands of the savages, who were men-eaters,
Ind who. I was sure, would feast upon me, when they
had taken me, thanby those who would perhaps glut
their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbari-
ties: that, in the case of the savages, I always resolved
tn die fighting to the last gasp; and why should 1 not
do so now, seeing it was much more dreadful, to me-
at least, to think of falling into these men'shands, than
ever it was to think of being eaten by men? for the
savages, give them their due, would not eat a man till
he was dead ; and killed him first, as we do a bullock ;
but that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty .
of death. Whenever these thoughts prevailed I was
sure to 'put myself into a. kind of fever, with the agitaa
tions 0 a sup osed fight ; my blood would boil, and
my eyes spark e. as if i was engaged ; and. I always
resolved that l would take no quarter at their hands;
but even at last, if I could resist no longer,I would
blow up the ship, and all that was in her, and leave
them but little booty to boast of.

But by how much the greater weight the anxieties
and perplexities of those things were to our thoughts

artner told me he dreamed that he had a very heav
ad upon his back, which he was to carry up ahilf.
and found that he was not able to stand long nnderit;
but the Portu uese pilot-came, and took itofl' their back,
and the hill isappeared, the ground before him show-
ing all smooth and lain; and truly it was so; we
were all like men who had a load taken off their backs.
For my part. i had a weight taken ofi' from my
heart, that I was not able any longer to bear; and as
I said above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that
ship. When we came on shore, the old pilot. who
was now our friend. 0! use lodging. and a warehouse
for our goods, which, _v the way, was much the same:
it was a little house. or hut with a large house joining
to it, all built with canes. and palisarloed round with
large canes, to keep out pill'ering thieves, of which it
seems there were not a few in the country. However,
the magistrates allowed us all a little guard. and we had
a soldier with a kind of halbei-t, or half-pike, who
stood sentinel at our door. to whom we allowed a pint
of rice. and a. little piece of money. about the value oi
tlueepence, per day; so that our goods were kept
very safe
The fair or mart usually kept in this lace had been
over some time; however, we found I tat there were
three or four junks in the river and two Japanners, 1
mean ships from Japan. with goods which they had
bought in China, and were not gone away, having

he first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us
was to bring us acquainted with three missionary Ro-
mish priests, who were in the town. and who had
been there some time, converting the people to Chris

it, and made them but sorry Christians when they had
done. However that was not our business One of

free in his conversation, not seeming so serious and
grave as the other two did, one of whom was a Por-
tuguese. and the other a Genoese: but Father Simon
was courteous, easy in his manner. and very agreeable
com any; the other two were more reserved, seemed
rlgi and austere, and a tplied seriously to the work
they came about, viz. to k with, and insinuate them-
selves among the inhabitantswherever they had oppor-
tunity. We often ate and drank with those men ; and
though I must confess, the conversion,as they call it,
of the Chinese to Christianity, is so far from the true
conversion required to bring heathen people to the
faith of Christ, that it seems to amount to little more
than letting them know the name of Christ, say some
prayers to the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a tongue
which they understand not, and to cross themselves,
andthe like; yet it must he confessed that these reli-
gious, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief
that these people should be saved, and that they are
the instrument of it; and. on this account, they under-
go not only the fatigue of the voyage, and hamrds of
living in such places. but oftentimes death itself, with
the most violent tortures, for the sake of this work:
and it would be a great want of charity in us, what-
ever opinion we have of the work itself, and the man-
ner of their doing it, if we should not-have a good opi-
nion of their zeal, who undertake it with so many haz-
ards, and who have no prospect of the least temporal

advantage to themselves.
But to return to my story: This French priest,

Father Simon, was amaointed, it seems, by order of
the chief of the mission, to go up to Pekin, the royal
seat of the Chinese emperor; and waited only for
anothor priest. who was ordered tocome to him from
Macao, to go along with him: and we scarce _ever
met together but he was invtting me to go that Jour-
ney with him, telling me, how he would show me all
the glorious things of that mighty empire; and amon

the rest, the greatest city in the world ; _" A city," sat

cannot be equal to." This was the cit of Pekin
which, I confess, is very great, and infinitely full ol
people; but as I looked on those things with different
eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion of
them in few words, when I come, in the course of my
travels, to speak more particularly of them.

But first come to my friar or missionary: dini
with him one day, and being very merry together"
showed some little inclination to go with him: and he
pressed me and my partner very hard. and with a

rent many persuasions, to consent. " Why, Father

imon," says my partner, "why should you desin
our company so much? You know we are heretics,
and you do not love us, nor can keep us company
with any pleasure."--u O E" says he, " you may, per-
haps, be good Catholics in time; my business here is
to convert heatheus, and who knows but I ma con-
vert you too?"-" Very well, Father." said , " so
you .will preach to us all the way."--"l won't be
troublesome to you," said he, " our religion does not
divest us of good manners; besides," saidhe, "we
are all here like countrymen, and so we are, compared
to the lace we are in ; and if you are Hugonots, and
[ a Catholic, we may be all Christians at last; at least,"
said he. " we aie all gentlemen, and we may converse
so, without being uneasy to one another." I liked that
part of his discourse very well, and it began to put me
in mind of my riest that I had left in the Brasils;
but this Father . imou did not come up to his charao~
ter by a great deal; for thoughj'ather Simon had on
appearance of a criminal levity in him neither, yet he
had not that fund of Christian zeal, strict piety, and
sincere afiection to religion that my other good eccle-
siastie had, of whom I have said so much.

But to leave him a little, though he never left us,

nor soliciting us to go with him, but we had something
else before us at that time; for we had all this while
our ship and our merchandise to dispose of ; and we
began to be very doubtful what we shouid do; forwo

more visible, as I thought, than ever, to concern itself
in our affairs; and I was encouraged from this very
time to think I should, one way or other, at out of
this entangled circumstance. and be broug t homo to
my own country again, though I had not the least
view of the manner- . and when I began sometimes to
think of it, could not imagine by what method it was
to be done. Providence, I say. began here to clear
up our way a. little; and the first thing that offered
was, that our old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan
merchant to us, who began to inquire what goods we
had; and, in the first place, he bought all our opium,
and gave us every good price for it, paying us in gold
by weight some in small pieces of their own coin,
and some in small wedges, of about ten or eleven
ounces each. While we were dealing with him for
our opium, it came into my head, that he might.e
haps, deal with us for the ship too; and 1 ordere
.interpreter to propose it to him. He shrunk up his
shoulders at it, when it was first proposed to him: but
in a few days after, he came to me, with one of the
missionary priests for his interpreter, and told me be
had a proposal to make to me, and that was this: he
had _boufiou ta great quantity of goods of us when he
had' noto ughts( (or proposals made to him) of buyin

to pay for the ship , but if I would let the same men
who were in the ship navigate her, he would hire the
ship to go to Japan, and would send them from thence
to the Philippine islands with another loading, which
he would pay the freight of before they went from
Japan; and that, att eIr return, he would buy the

OF ROBINSON CRUSOL. 231

If my partner: who was no way concemed with
my young man, made him such an offer, 1 could do
no less than offer him the same; and all the ship's
company being willing to go with him, we made over
half the ship to him in property, and took" a writing
from him, obliging him to account for the other;
and away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant
proved a very punctual honest man to him. protected

which the Europeans in general have not lately ob-
tained. paid him his freight very punctually, sent him
to the Philippines. loaded him with Japan and China
wares. and a supercargo of theirown. who traffick-
ing with the Spaniards, brought back European good:
again. and a great quantity of cloves and other spice ;
and there he was not only paid his freight very well,
and at a very good price, but being not willing to
sell the ship then. the merchant furnished him with
goods on his own account ; that for some money and
some spices of his own. which he brought with him,
he went back to the Manillas, to the S aniurds, where
he sold his cargo very well. Here, aving gotten a.
good aquaintance at Manilla, he got his ship made
a free ship; 'and the governor of Manilla hire him to
go to Acapulco, in America. on the coast of Mexico -,
and gave him a licence to land there, and travel to
Mexico; and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe,
with all his men.

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily,
and there he sold his Ship: and havin there also ob-
tained allowance to travel by land to orto Bello, he
found means, some how or other, to go to meaico
with all his treasure ; and about eightyears after come
to England, exceeding rich; of which I shall take
notice in its place; in the mean time, I return to our
particular afl'airs.

Being now to part with the ship and ship's com-
pany, it came before us. of course, to consider what

river of Cambodia. The truth was, they had done
us a considerable service, and deserved well at our
hand; though, by the way, they were a couple of
rogues too; for, .as they believed the story of out be-
ing pirates, and that we had really run away with the
ship, they came down to us, not only to betray the
design that was formed against us, but to go to sea
with us as pirates; and one of them confessed after
wards, that nothing else but the hopes of going a-rogue-
iug brought him to do it. However, the service they
did us was not the less; and, therefore, asl had pro-
mised to be grateful to them, I first ordered the mo-
ney to he paid to them, which they said was due to
them on board their respective ships; that is to say,
the Englishman nineteen months pay, and to the
Dutchman seven; and. over and above that,'I gave
each of them a small sum of money in gold, which
contented them very well: then I made the English-
man gunner of the ship. the gunner being now made
second mate and purser; the Dutchman I made boob
swain: so they were both very well pleased, and
proved very serviceable, being both able seamen,
and very stout fellows.

We were now on shore in China. ' If I thought
myself banished, and remote from my own country
at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for
my money, what could I think of myself now, when
l was gotten about a thousand leagues farther off from
home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of pros-
pect of return!

All we had forit was this, that in about four-months
time there was to be another fair at that place where
we were, and then we might be able to purchase all
sorts of the manufactures of the country, and with!
might ]\'possibly find some Chinese junks or vessel-
from anquin, that would be to be sold, and would
carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This I
liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides," our
particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any En-

part these hopes we resolved to continue here;
but to divert ourselves, we took two or three jour-
neys into the country; first, we went ten days journey
to see the city of Nanquin, a city well worth seeing
indeed: they say it has a million of people in itt
which, however I do not believe: it is regularly built.
the streets all exactly straight, and cross one another
in direct lines, which gives the figure of it great ad-
vantage.

But when I came to comparc.the miserable people
of these countries with ours; their fabrics. their man-
ner of living, their government, their religion, theit
wealth, and their glory, (as some call it) I must con-
fess, I do not so much as think it worth naming, or
worth my while to write of, or any that shall come
after me to read. . .

It is very observable, that we wonder at the gran--
deur. the riches, the amp, the ceremonies," the go-
vernment. the manu actures, the commerce, and the
conduct of these people; not that they are to be won-
dered at, or indeed, in the least to be regarded: but
because, having first a notion of the barbarity of those
countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that prevail
there, we do not expect to find any such things so
far ofi'. . -

Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces
and royal buildings of Europe? What their trade to
the universal commerce of England, Holland, France
and Spain? What are their cities to cure, for wealth,
strength. gaycty of apparel. rich furniture, and an inli
nito variety? What are their .ports, supplied with a

of their armies are surprising to us, because. as I have
said, considering them as a barbarous nation of pa-
gans, little better than savages, we did not expect such
things amnngthem; and this. indeed, is the advan-
tage with which all their greatness and ower is re-
presented to us: otherwise, it is in itsel nothing at
all; for. as I have said of their ships, so it may b:
said of their armies and troops; all the forces of their
empire, though they were to bring two millions of
men into the field together, would be able to do no-
thing but ruin the country and starve themselves. If
they were to besiege a strong town in Flanders. or to
fight a disci lined army, one line of German euiras-
slers. or of rench cavalr , would overthrow all the
horse of China: a million of their foot could not stand
before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so
as not to be surrounded, though they were not to be
one to twenty in number: nay, I do not boast if I
say, that 30,000 German or English foot, and 10.000
French horse, would fairly beat all the forces of China.
And so of our fortified towns, and of the art of our
engineers, in assaulting and defending towns; there
is not a fortified town in China could hold out one
month against the batteries and attacks of a. European
army; and at the same'time, all the armies of China
could never take such a town as Dunkirk. provided
it was not starved: no, not in ten years siege. They
have firevarms, it is true, but they are awkward,
clumsy, and uncertain in going 03'; they have pow-
der. but it is of no strength ; they have neither disci-'
pline in the field, exercise in their arms. skill to attack,
nor temper to retreat. And therefore I must confess
it scented strange to me when 1 came home, and
heard our people say such fine things of the power,
riches, glory, magnificence. and trade of the Chinese,
because I saw and knew that they were a contempti-
hle herd or crowd of ivnorant, sordid slaves, subjected
to a government ualified only to rule such a people;

of their mam arins. a kind of Viceroy, or principal
magistrate, in the province where they reside, and
who take great state upon them, travelling with great
attendance, and with great homage from the people,
who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them,
because all the countries they pass through are obliged
to furnish provisions for them and all their attendants.
That which 1 particularly observed, as to our travel-
ling with his baggage, was this; that though we re-
ceived suflicient provisions, both for ourselves and our
horses, from the country, as belonging to the mandarin,
yet we were obliged to pay for every thing we had
after the market price of the country, and the manda>>
rln's steward, or commissary of the provisions, col-
lected it duly from us; so that our travellingjn the
retinue of the mandarin, though it was a very real
kindness to us, was not such a mighty favour in im,
but was, indeed, a great advantage to him, consider-
ing there were about thirty other people travelling in
the same manner besides us, under the protection of his
retinue, or, as we may call'it, under his convoy. This,
I say, was a great advantage to him ; for the count

ture, such as in England might sell for about thirty
or forty shillings; and he had two slaves followed him
on foot, to drive the poor creature along: he had a
whip in his hand, and he belaboured the beast as fast
about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and
thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve servants;

and we were told he was going from the city to his

country-seat, about half a league before us. We tra

veiled on gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode
away before us; and as we stopped atavillage about
an hour to refresh us, when we came by the country-
seat of this great man, we saw him in a little lace
before his door, eating his repast; it was a kin of a
garden; but he was easy to be seen; and we were
to understand, that the more we looked on him, the
better he would be pleased.

He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto
tree, which efi'ectually shaded him over the head, and
on the south side ; but under the tree also was laced
a larg'e umbrella, which made that part loo well
enoug : he sat lolling back in a great elbow chair,
being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being
brought him by two women slaves: he had two more

accept of their service in, viz. one fed the 'squire
with a. spoon, and the other held the dish with one
hand, and scraped off what he let fall on his wor-

great fat brute thought it below him to employ his
own hands in any of those familiar offices, which kings
and monarchs would rather do than be troubled with

' the clumsy fingers of their servants.

I took this time to think what pain men's pride

ts them to, and how troublesome a haughty tem-
per, thus ill managed, must be to a man of common
sense; and,leaving the poor wretch to please himself
with our looking at him, as if we admired his pomp,
whereas we really pitied and contemned him, we
pursued our journey: only Father Simon had the eu-

he said he had the honour to tttstc of,nnd which was,
I think, a dose that an English hound would scarce

for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see the

his charges {or his company; and to use him as an in-
terpreter, for he understood the lan uage of the cour-

indeed, "115 old man was a most useful implement to

he called money; being his broken Latin, of which he

land, to Mfiseovy, within four or five weeks, and he
was sure we would take the opportunity to go with

you call a rccian, who is among them; he came last
from Astracan, and was designing to go to Tonquin,
where I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind,
and is now resolved to o back with the caravan to
Moscow. and so down t e river of Wolga to Astra.-
ean."---' Well, Seignior," said I, " do not be uneasy
about being left to 0 back alone; if this be a method
for my return to ngland. it shall be your fault if
you go back to Macao at all." We then went to con
sult together what was to be done, and I asked my
partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and whe.
ther it would suit with his afi'airs: he told me he
would do pst as I would; for he had settled all his
atTairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in such
good hands, that as we made agood voyage here, if

e could vest in China silks, wrought and raw, such

' us might be worth the carriage, he would be content

to go to England, and then make his voyage back to
Bengal by the Company's ships,

Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that, if our
Portuguese pilot would go with us. we would bear his
charges to Moscow. or to England, if he pleased;
nor, indeed. were we to be esteemed over- enerous
in that part neither, if we had not rewarded iim' {ar-
thcr; for the service he had done us was really worth
all that, and more; for he had not only been a pilot
to us at sea, but he had been also like a broker for us
on shore; and his procuring for us the Japan mer-
chant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets.
So we consulted together about it; and; bein willing
to gratify him, which was, indeed, but doing iim jus~
tice, and very willing also to have him with us besides,
lhr he was a most neccessary man on all occasions, we
agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold. which,
as I compute it, came to about one hundred and
eeventyfive pounds sterling between us, and to bear
his charges. both for himself and horse, except only a
horse to carry his goods.

Having settled this among ourselves. we called him

to let mm know what we had resolved: I told him.
he had complained of our being like to let him go
back alone, and I was now to tell him we were ne-
solved he should not go back at all: that as we had
resolved to go to Europe with the caravan,.we resolv-
ed also he should go With us, and that we called him
to know his mind. He shook his head, and said it
was a long journey, and he had no pecune to carry
him thither, nor to subsist himself when he came thi-
ther. We told him we believed it was so, and there-
fore we had resolved to do something for him, that
should let him see how sensible we were of the service
he had done us; and also how agreeable he was to
us: and then I told him what we had resolved to give
him here, which he might lay out as we would do
our own ,- and that as for his charges, if he would go
with us, we would set him safe ashore (life and casual
ties excepted, either in Muscovy or in England,
which he wou d, at our own charge, except only the
carriage of his oods.

He receivedt e proposal like a man transported,
and told us, he would go with us over the whole
world: and so, in short. we all prepared ourselves
{or the 'ourney. However, as it was with us, so it
was wit the other merchants, they had many things
to do: and instead of being ready in five weeks, it
was four months and some odd days before all things
were got together.

It was the beginning of February, our style, when
we set out from Pekin. My partner, and the old pilot
had gone express back to the port where we had first
put in, to dispose of some goods which he hall len
there; and I. with a Chinese merchant, whom I had
some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to
Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I
bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two
hundred pieces of other very fine' silks, of several
sorts. some mixed with gold. and had all these brought
to Pekin against my partner's returnsbesides this.

cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels lbr our share,
besides those we rode upon; which, with two or three
spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions,
made us in short, twenty six camels and horses in on:
retinue.

The company was very great, and, as near as I can
remember, made between three and four hundred
horses and camels, and upwards of a hundred and
twenty men, very well armed, and provided for all
events. For as the eastern caravans are subject to be
attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars;
but they are not altogetherso dangerous as the Arabs.
nor so barbarous when the prevail.

The company consiste of people of several na-
tions, such as Muscovites chiefly: for there were
about sixty of them who were merchants or inhabi-
tants of Moscow, though of them some were Livo-
nians; and to our particular satistaction, five of them
were Scots, who appeared also to be men of great
ex rience in business, and very good substance.

83mm we had travelled one day's journey, the
guides, who were five in number, called all the gen-
tlemen and merchants, that is to say, all the passen-
gers, except the servants, to a reat council, as they
termed it. At this great counci every one deposited
a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for
the necessary expense of buying forage on the wav,
where it was not otherwise to be had, and for satisfy
ing the guides, getting horses, and the like. And
here they constituted the journey, as they called it, via.
they named captains and officers to draw us all up,
and give the command in case of an attack; and gave
every one their turn of command. Nor was this form-
ing us into order anv more than what we found need-

The road all on this side of the country is very
pulous, and is full of putters and earth makers; t at
is to say, people that tempered the earth for the
China ware: and,_as [was going along, our Portm
guese pilot, who had always something or other to say
to make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me,
he would shew the greatest rarity in all the country;
and that I should have this to say of China, after all
the ill-humoured things 1 had said of it, that I had
seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the
world beside. I was very importunate to know what
it was 1 at last he told me, it was a gentleman's house,
built all with China ware. " Well," said I, " are
not the materials of their building the product of their
own. country ; and so it is all China ware, is it not ?"
--" No, no," says he, " I mean it is a house all
made of China ware, such as you call so in England;
or, as it is called in our country, porcelean"'--" Well
said I, " such a thing may be: how big is it? can
we carry it in a box upon a camel? If we can, we
will buy it."--" Upon a camel !" said the old pilot,
holding up both his hands; " why there is a family
of thirty people lives in it."

I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I
came to see it, it was nothing but this: it was a tim-
her house, or a house built, as we call it in England,
with lath and plaster, but all the plastering was really
China ware, that is to say, it was plastered with the
earth that makes China ware.

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was
glazed, and looked .very well, rfectl white, and

with gold, many tiles making but one figure, but join>>

This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and lite-

journey, I could have staid some days to see and exa<<
mine the particulars of it. They told me there were
fountains and fish--ponds in the garden, all paved at
the bottom and sides with the same, and fine statues
setup in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the
porcelean earth, and burnt whole.

may be allowed to excel in it; butIam we sure
they excel in their accounts of it; for they to d me

l und afterwards the orders made or keeping a
together were absolutely necessary for our common
safety

In two days more we passed the great China wall,
made fora fortification against the 'l'artars: and every
great work it is, going over hills and mountains in an
endless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the

recipices such as no enemy could ossibly enter, or,
ntleed,climb u . or where, if they (lid, no wall could
hinder them. hey tell us its length is near a thou-
sand English miles, but that the country is five hun-
dred in a straight measured line, which the wall
bounds, without measuring the windings and turnings
it takes; 'tis about four fathoms high, and as many
thick in some places.

I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without tres-
passing on our orders, for so long the caravan was in
passing the gate; 1 say,l stood still an hour to look at
It, on every side, near and far off; Imean, what was
within my view; and the guide of our caravan, who
had been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was

mighty eager to hear my opinion of it I told him it-

was a most excellent thing to keep of the Tartars,
which he happened not to understand as I meant it,
and so took it for a compliment; but the old pilot
laughed: " 0, Seignior lnglese," said he, " you speak
in colours."--" ln colours I" said I; u what do you
mean by that ?"--" Why, you speak what looks white
this way, and black that way ; gay one way, and dull
another way: you tell him it is a good wall to keep
out Tartars; you tell me, by that, it is good ibr no-
thing but to keep out Tartars; or will keep out none
but Tat-tars. I understand you. Seignior lnglese, I
understand you," said he, joking; " but Seignior
Chinese understand-you his own way."

" Well, " said I, " Seignior, do you think it would
stand out an army of our country-people,with a good
train of artillery; or our engineers, with two compa-
nies of miners? Would they not batter it down in ten

days, that an army might enter in battalia, or blow it

up in the air, foundation and all, that there should be

no sign of it left ?" " Ay, ay," said he, " 1 know

that. " The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I

laid, and I gave him leave to tell him a few days after,

for we were then almost out of their country, and he
was to leave us in a little time afterwards; but when
he knew what I had said he was dumb all the rest of
the way,a and we heard no more of his fine story of
the Chinese power and greatness while he staid.

After we had passed this mighty nothing, called a
wall, somethIng like the Picts wall, so laInous in
Northumberland, and built by the Romans, we began
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people
rather confined to live In fortified towns and cities. as
being subject to the inroads and depredations of the
Tartars. who rob In great armies, and therefore are
not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open
country. '

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping
together in a caravan, as we travelled; for we saw
several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I
came to see them distinctly, I wondered how that
the Chinese empire could be conquered by such con-
temp tible fellows, for they are a mere herd or crowd
of wild fellows, keeping no order, and understanding
no discipline. or manner of fight.

Their horses are poor. lean, starved creatures,
tauwht nothing, and are {It for nothing; and this we
found the first day we saw them, which was after we i
entered the wilder part of the country. Our leader
for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a
hunting, as they call it; and what was this but hunt-
ing of sheep. ' However it may be called hunting too
for the creatures are the wildest, and swiftest of foot,
that ever I saw of their kind; only they will not run
a great way, and you are sure of sport when you be,

In pursuit of. this odd sort of game, it was our hap
to meet with about forty Tat-tars: whether they were
hunting mutton as we were, or whether they looked
for another kihd of prey, I know not; but as soon as
they saw us, one of them blew a kind of horn very
loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear
again. We all supposed this was to call their friends
about them: and so it was; for in less than half a
quarter of an hour, atroo of forty or fifty more ap-
peared at a about a mile distance; but our work was
over first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow hap ened to
be amongst us; and as soon as he heard the am, he
told us, in short, that we had nothing to do but to
charge them immediately,'without loss of time; and
drawing us u in a line, he asked, if we were resolv-
ed? We tol him, we were ready to follow him : so
he rode directly u to them. They stood gazing at us,
like a mere crow , drawn up in no order, nor show-
ing theface of any order at all; but as soon as they
saw us'advance, they let fly their arrows; which how.
erer, missed us very happily: it seems they mistook
not their aim, but their distance; for their arrows a1
fell a little short of us, but with so true an aim, that
had we been about twenty yards nearer, we must have
had several men wounded, if not killed.

Immediately we halted; and though it was at a

at distance, we fired. and sent them leaden bullets
or wooden arrows. following our shot full gallo , re-
solving to fall in among them sword in hand; or so
our hold Scot that led us, directed. He was, indeed,
but a merchant, but he beha'ved with that vigour and
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool
courage too, that! never saw a. man in action, fitter

for command. As soon as we came up to them, we '

fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew; but they
tied in the reatest confusion imaginable; the only
stand any at; them made was on our rightnvhcrethrce

and their'bows hangino at their backs. Onr brave
commander, without agking any body to follow him
galloped up close to them. and with his fusil. knocked
one of them off his horse. killed the second with his
istol. and the third run awayzand thus ended our
ght ; but we had this misfortune attending it. viz. that
all our mutton that we had in_chase got away. We
had not a man killed or hurt; but. as for the Tartare,
there were about five of them killed ; how many were
wounded, we knew not; but this we knew, that the
other party was so frighted with the noise of ourguns,
that they fled, and never made any attempt upon us.
We were all this while in the Chinese domininns,

and therefore the Tartars were not so bold as after-r

wards : but in about five days we entered a vast great
wild desert, which held us three days and nights
march ; and we were obliged to carry our water with
us in great leather bottles, and to encamp all night,

Just as I have heard they do in the deserts of Arabia..

I asked our guides, whose dominion this was in?
and they told me this was a kind of border that might
be called No Man's Land ; being part of the Great
Karakathy, or Grand Tartary; but that, however, it
was reckoned to China; that there was no care taken
here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves; and
therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole

march, though we were to go over some much larger. '

Infipassing this wilderness. which I confess, was at
the rst view very frightful to me, we saw two or
three times little parties of the Tat-tars, but they seem.
ed to be upon their own affairs. and to have no desi
upon us; and so like the man who met the devil, if
they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say
to them ; we let them go.

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to
stand and am at us, whether it was to consider what
they shoul do, viz. to attack us. or not attack us, we
knew not; but when we were passed at some distance
by them, we made a rear guard of lorty men, and
flood ready for them, letting the caravan pass half a
mile, or thereabouts, before us. After a while they
marched off, only we found they assaulted us with five
arrows at their rting: one of which wounded a
horse, so that it isahled him: and we left him the
next day, poor creature, in great need of a good far-
rier. We sup use they might shoot more arrows,
which mi ht all short of us; but we saw no more
arrows, or artars, at that time. .

We travelled near a month after this, the ways be.
ing not so good as at first, though still in the dominion:
of the emperor of China; but lay. for the most part,
in villages, some of which were fortified. because of
the incursions ot' the Tartars. When we came to one
of these towns, (it was about two days and a half '3
Journey, before we were to come to the city of Nauru.)

wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to
be sold all the way upon that road, and of horses also,
such as they are, because so many caravans coming
that way, they are very often wanted. The person
that I spoke to to get me a camel, would have gone
and {etched it for me :- but I, like a fool, must be offi-
cious, and go myself along with him. The place was
about two miles out of the village. where, it seems,
they ke t the camels and horses feeding under a guard.

l we ked it on foot, with my old pilot in company,
and a Chinese. being desirous, forsooth, of a little
variety. When we came to this place, it was a low
marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, piled
up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park,
with a little ard of Chinese soldiers at the doors.
Having bong t a camel, and agreed for the price,l
came away ; and the Chinese man, that went with me,
led the camel, when on a sudden came up five 'l'artars
on horseback: two of them seized the felllow. and
took the camel from him, while the other three stepped
up to me and my old pilot; seeing us. as it were, un-
armed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword,
which could but ill defend me against three horsemen" a:- ss.' eia'tw 143a"

ther; if they had. I suppOSe they would not have at-

is no dan er.

The 01 man, seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and lay~
ing hold of his arm with one" hand, and pullin him
down by main force a little towards him wit tho
other, he shot him into the head, and laid him dead on
the spot: he then immediately stepped up to him who
had stopped us. as I said. and before he could come

always wore, but, missing the man. out his horse into

out of the pilot's reach: and, at some distance, risin

lost the camel, but he had no weapon; however, see-
ing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon him,

weapon he had by his side. smnething like a pole-axe,
but not a pole-axe either, he wrenched it from him,
and made shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with
it. But my old man had the third Tartarto deal with

Its the Tartar saw the pistol. whether he supposed it

and left my pilot, my champion, Icalled himafterwards
a complete victory.

By thistime I was a little awake: for I thought,
when 1 first began to awake, that I had been in a
sweet sleep; but asl said above, lwondered where!
was. how came upon the ground, and what was the
matter: in a word, a few minutes after, as sense re-
turned, I felt pant, though I did not know where; l
clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody;
then i felt my head ache, and then, in another mo-
ment, memory returned, and every thing was present
to me again.

i jumped u upon my feet instantly, and got hold
of my sword, ut no enemies in view. I found a Tar-
tar lie dead, and his horse standing very quietly by
him: and lookinv farther I saw my champion and
deliverer, who ha( been to see what the Chinese had
done, coming back with his hanger in his hand. The
old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to me,
and embraced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid
before that I had been killed ; and seeing me bloody,
would see how I was hurt , but it was not much, on]
what we call a broken hoad ; neither did 1 aflerwardi
find any great inconvenience from the blow, other than
the place which was hurt, and which was well again
in two or three days.

We made no great gain, however, by this victory;
tbr we lost a camel, and gained a horse: but that
which was remarkable, when we came back to the
village. the man demanded to be paid for: the camel;
1 dis nted it, and it was brought to a hearing before
the (fhinesejndge of the place -. that is to say, in Eng

lions, could not batter down the walls with their bows
and arrows; but to call it. strong ' it were attacked

We wanted, as l have said, about two days journey
of this city, when messengers were sent express to
every part of the road, to tell all travellers and cara-
vans to halt, till they had a guard sent to them; for
that an unusual hody of Tartars, making ten thousand
in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty miles be-
yond the city.

This was verv bad news to travellers; however, it

was carefully done of the governor, and we were very.

glad to hear we should have a guard. Accordingly,
two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us
from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three
hundred more from the city ofNaum, and with those
we advanced boldly: the three hundred soldiers from
Naummarched in our front, the two hundred in our
rear, and our men on oach side of our camels, with
our haggage, and the whole caravan in the centre. In
this )rder. and well prepared for battle, we thought

ourselves a match for the whole ten thousand Mogm
Tartars, if they had appeared; but the next day, when
they did appear. it was quite another thing.

It was early in the morning, when marching from
a little well-situated town, called Changu, we had a
river to ass, where we were obliged to l'erry;aud
had the artars had any intelligence, then had been
the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan'being
over, the rear-guard was behind: but they did no: ap-
pear there.

About three hours after, when we were entered upon
a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, behold,
by a cloud of dust they raised, we saw an enemy was
at hand; they were at hand indeed, for they came
on upon the spur.

The Chinese, ourguard on the front, who had talked
so big the day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers
frequently looked behind them; which is a certain
sign in a soldier, that he is just ready to run away.
My old pilot was of my mind; and being near me, he
called out: "Seignior lnglese," said be, "those fel-
lows must be encouraged. or they will ruin us all; for
if the Tar-tars come on, they will never stand it."--
"I am of your mind," said I; " but what course
must be done !"--" Dane?" said he; " let fifty of our
men advance, and flank them on each wing, and er>>
courage them, and they will fight like brave fellows
in brave company; but without it the) will every
man turn his back." Immediately I rode up to our
leader, and told him, who was exactly of our mind;
and accordin ly fifty of us marched to the rightwing
and fifty to t cleft, and the rest made a line of re
serve; for so we marched, leaving the last two hun
dred men to make another body to themselves, and to
guard the camels ; only that, if need were, they should
send a hundred men to assist the last fifty.

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumera
ole company they were; how many, we could not tell,
but ten thousand we thought was the least. A party
of them came on first, and viewed our posture. tru-

vemng the ground it; the front of our line; and as
we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salon on each wing with their shot, which was done ;
but they went off, and I suppose went back to give an
account of the reception they were like to meet with ;
and, indeed, that salute clogged their stomachs; for
they immediately halted, stood awhile to consider 0!
it, and, wheeling off to the left, they gave over the de-
sign, and said no more to us for that time; which was
very agreeable to our circumstances, which were but
ver indilferent {or a battle with such a number.

'wo days after this we came to the city of Naum,
or Nahum. We thanked the governor for his care for
us, and collected tothe value of one hundred crowns,
or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to
guard us; and here we rested one day. This isa gar-
rison indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers
kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly the
Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they do
now, the Muscovites having abandoned that part of
the country (which lies from the city west, for about
two hundred miles) as desolate and unfit for use; and
more especially, being so very remote, and so difficult
to send troops hither for its defence; for we had yet
above' two thousand miles to Muscovy, properly so
cal e .

After this we passed several great rivers, and two
dreadful deserts, one of which we were sixteen days
assing over, and which, as I said, was to be called
0 Man's Land 3 and on the 13th of April we came
to the frontiers of the Muscovite domimons. I think

deserve the name of Christians (yet such they pretend
to he, and are very devout in their way;) it would cer~
tainly occur to any man who travels the world as l
- have done, and who had any power of reflection; 1
Say, it would occur to him, to reflect, what a blessin
it is' to he brought into the world where the name of
God, and of a Redeemer, is kno .vn, worshipped. and
dored--and not where the people,grven up by Heaven
to strong delusions, worship the devil, and prostrate
themselves to stacks and stones; worship monsters,
elements, horrible slta ed animals, and statues, or
images of monsters. - 'ot a town or cit we assed
through but 'had their pagods, their ido s, an their

, Now we came where, at least a face of the Christian
worshi appeared, where the knee was oowed to J esus
' and \v tether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian re-
ligion was owned, and the name of the true God was
called upon and adored ; and it made the very recesses
' of my soul rejoice to see it. 1 saluted the brave Scotch
merchant I mentioned above, with my first acknow-
ledgment of this; and, taking him by the hand, 1 said
to him, " Blessed be God, we are once again come
among Christians 1" He smiled, and answered, " Do
not reyoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites
are but an odd sort of Christians; and but for the
name of it', you may see a very little of the substance
for some months farther of our journey."
H Well," said I, h but still it is better than pagan-
ism, and worshipping of devils."--" Why, 1']! tell
' you said he; " except the Russian soldiers in garri-
sons, and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon
the road, all the rest of this country, for above 9. thou'
sand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most
ignorant of pagans." And so indeed we found it.
We were now launched into the greatest piece of
solid earth, if I understand anything of the surface of

eight oundred miles to the Frozen sea, north; nay, if

in the world; and who, as our geographers allege, an
the Gog and Magog mentioned in sacred story.

These rivers running all northward, as well as ali
the other rivers I am yet to speak of, made it evident
that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that
side; so that it does not seem rational in the least to
think that the land can extend itself to join with Ame-
Iica on that side, or that there is not a communication
between the northent and the eastern ocean; but of
this I shall say no more; it was my observation: 3
that time, and therefow I take notice of it in this
place. We now advanced from the river Arguna by
easy and moderate journeys, and were very visibly
obliged to the care the czar of Muscovy has taken to
have cities and towns built in as many places as art
pessihle to place them, where his soldiers keep garri-
son. something like the stationary soldiers placed by
the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire,
some of which I had read, were particular] placed in
Britain for the security of commerce, and fir the lodg-
ing of travellers; and thus it was here; though wherv
ever we came at these towns and stations the garrison:
and governor were Russians, and professed mere pa<<

gans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun,

moon. and stars, or all the host of heaven; and not
only so. but were, of all the heathens and pagans that
ever I met with, the most barbarous, except only that
they did not eat man's flesh, as our savages of Ame
rica did.

Some instances of this we met With in the country
between Arguna, where we entered the Muscovite do-
minions. and a city of Tartars and Russians together,
called Nertzinskay; in which space isacontinued de-
sert, or forest,which cast us twenty days to travel over
it. In a village near the last of those laces, 1 had
the curiosity to go and see their way of iving; which
is most brutish and nnsufl'erahle: they had, I suppose.
a rent sacrifice that day; for there stood out upon an
old sttnnp of a tree. an idol made of wood, frightful
u the devil; at least as any thing we can think of to

lepresent the devil that can be made. It had a head
certainly not so much as resembling an) creature that
the world oversaw ; ears as big as goats 'horns, and as
high ; e es as big as a crown-piece ; and a nose like a
crooks ram's horn, and a mouth extended four-cor-
nered, like that of a lion. with horrible teeth, hooked
like a parrot's under bill. It was dressed up in the
filthiest manner that you can suppose; its upper gar.
utent was of sheep-skins, with the wool outward ; a

rent Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns grow
mg through it : it was about eight feet high, yet had no
feet or legs, or any other proportior't of parts.

This scarecrow was set up at the outside of the vil-
lage; and when I came near to it, there were sixteen
orseventeen creaturesnvhether men or women 1 could
not tell, for they make no distinction by their habits,
either of body or head ; these lay all Halon the ground,
round this formidable block of shapeless wood. I
saw no motion amou them any more than if they had
been logs of wood, likerheir idol; at first 1 really
thought they had been so; but when I came a little
nearer. they started up upon their feet, and raised a
howling cry,as if it had been so many deep-mouthed
hounds, and walked away as if they were displeased
at our disturbing them. A little way off from this
monster, and at the door ofa tent or hut, made all 0!
sheep-skins and cow-skins,dried,stood three butchers:
I thought they were such ; for when i came nearer to
them, I found they had long knives in their hands,
and in the middle of the tent appeared three shee
killed, and one young bullock, or steer. These, it
seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol;
and these three men priests belonging to It; and the
seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who
brought the offering, and were making their prayers
0 that stock.

I confessl was more moved at their stupidity. and
this brutish worship of a hobgohlin, than ever I was
at any thing in my life: to see God's most glorious
and best creature,to whom he had granted so many ad-

But what signified all the astonishment and refleov
tion of thoughts? Thus it was, and [saw it before my
eyes; and there was no room to wonder at it. or think
it impossible. All my admiration turned to rage; and
I rode up to the image or monster, call it what you

Its head in two in the middle. so that it hung down by .

me, took hold of the sheep skin that covered it. and

solved. if I could get but four or five men well armed
to go with me. to go and destroy that vile abomi-
nable idoi: to let them see, that it had no power to
help itself. and consequently could not be an object of
worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that
offered sacrifices to it.

He laughed at me: said he. " Your zeal may be
good: but what do you propose to yourself by it."--
" Propose !" said 1: H to vindicate the honour of God

' which is insulted by this devil-worship."---~" But how
will it vindicate the honour of God," said he, " while
the people will not be able to know what you mean
byit, unless you could speak to them too, and tell them
so? and then they will fight you too. [will assure you,
for they are desperate fellows, and that especially in
defence of their idolatry."--" Can we not,"said I.
" do it in the night, and then leave them the reasons in
writing in their own language ?"--" Writing!" said
he: uwh there is not in five nations of. them one
month" nows any thing of a letter, or how to read
a word in any language. or theit own."--" Wretched
ignorance !" said I to him: " however, 1 have a
great mind to do it: perhaps nature may draw infers-
ences from it to them, to let them see how brutish they
are to worship such horrid things."-" Look you,
Sir." said he: " if your zeal prompts you to it so
warmly, you must do it: but in the next place. I
would have you consider these wild nations of people
are subjected by force to the czar of Mttscovy's domi-
nion. and if you do this. it is ten to one but they will
come by thousands to the governor of Nenzinskay.
and complain. and demand satisfaction: and if he
cannot give them satisfaction. it is ten to one but the
will revolt: and it will occasion a new war with a
the Tartars in the country."

This, I confess put new thoughts into my head {or

all that day l was uneasy to put my project in execu-
tion. Toward the evening, the Scots merchant met
me by accident, in our walk about the town, and desi-

to speak with me: " I believe," said he, " I have
put you off your good design ; l have been a IiuIe
concerned about it since; for! abhor the idol, ana
idolatry, as much as you can do."--" Truly," said I,
" you have put it all a little, as to the execution ofit,
but you have not put it all outof my thoughts; and. I
believe,I shall do it still, before I quit this place,
though I were to be delivered 0 to them for a satisfac-
tion."--" No, no," said he, " od forbid 'hey should
deliver you up to such acrewof monsters! they shall
not do that neither; that would be murdering you in-
deed."--" Why," said I, u how would they use me?"
--" Use you I" said he: " I'll tell you how they serv-
ed a Poor Russian, who afi'ronted mom in their wor-
ship )USI as you did, and whom tney took prisoner,
after they had lamed him with an arrow,that he could
not run away: they took him and stripped him stark
naked, and set him upon the top of the idol monster,
and stood all round him, and shot as many arrows
into him as would stick over his whole body; and
than they burnt him, and all the arrows sticking in
him. as a sacrifice to the idol."--" And was this the
same idol?" said I.--" Yes," said he, " the very
same."----"Well," said I, " I will tell you a story."

' So I related the story of our men at Madagascar. and

how they burnt and sacked the village there. and killed
man, woman, and child. for their murdering one of
our men, just as it is related before; and when I had
done, I added, that I thought we ought to do so to this
village.

, He listened very attentively to the story: but when
I talked of doing so to that village, said he, "You
mistake very much, it was not this village; it was
almost a hundred miles from this place; but it was the
some idol, for they carry him about in procession all
over the country."-" Well," said I, u then that idol
ought to be punished for it; and it shall," said I, " if
I live this night out." '

low, one of his countrymen, to go also with us ; "and
'one," said he, " as famous for his zeal as you can fle-
sire any oneto be against such devilish things as these."
In'a word, he brought me his comrade, a Scotsman,
whom he called captain Richardson; and I gave him
a full account of what I had seen,and also what I in-
tended: and he told me readily, he would go with me,
if it cost him his life. So we agreed to go, only we
three. 1 had, indeed, proposed- it to my partner, but
he declined it. He said he was ready to assist me to
the utmost, and upon all occasions, for my defence ;
but that this was an adventure quite out of his way:
so. I say, we resolved upon ourwork, only we three. and
my man-servant, and to put it in execution that night,
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable.
However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to
delay it till the next night. because the caravan being
- t-O set forward in the morning, we supposed the go-
vernor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction
upon us when we were out of his power. The Scale
merchant, as steady in his resolution to enterprise it, as
bold in executing. brought me a Tartar's robe or gown
of shee -skins, and a bonnet, with a how and arrows,
and he provided the same for himself and his coun-
g tryman, that the people, if they saw us, should not be
, able to determine who we were.

other materials as we could get; and, having a good
quantity of tar in alittle pot, about an hour after night
we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place abouteleven o'clock at night,
and found that the people had not the least jealousy of
danger attending their idol. The night was "cloudy, '
yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol
stood just in the same posture and place that it did
before. The eople seemed to be all at their rest;
only, that in t .e great hut, or tent, as we called it,
where we saw the three priests, whom we mistook for '

' butchers, we saw alight, and going up close to the
door. we hear] people talking, as if there were five or
six of them ; we concluded, therefore, that if we set
wildfire to th'e'idol, these men would come out imme-
diately, and run up to the place to rescue it from the
destruction that we intended for it; and what to do
with them we knew not. Once we thought-of carry-
'ng it away, and settin fire to it at a distance ; but
when we came to hand e it, we found it too bulky for
our carriage; so we were at a loss again. The second
Scotsman was for setting fire to the tent or hut, and
knocking the creatures that were there on the head,
when they came out; but I could not join with that;
[was against 'killing them, if it was possible to be
avoided. " Well then," said the Scots merchant. " X
will tell you what we will do; we will try to make
them prisoners, tie their hands, ,and make them stand
and see their idol destroyed."

As it hap ened, we had twine or packthread enough
about us, w ich we used to tie our fireworks together
with ;so we resolved to attack these people first, and
with as little noise as we could. The first thing we
did, we knocked at the door, when one of the priest!

went in after him. and taking out- a composition we
had made, that would only smoke and stink, he set
fire to it, and threw it in among them: by that time
the other Scotsman and my man taking charge of the
two men already bountl,_and tied together also by the
arm. led them away to the idol, and left them there,
to see if their idol would relieve them, making haste
back to us.

When the furze we had thrown in had filled the but
with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated,
we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind,
which flamed like a candle, and following it in, we
found there were but fourpe0ple leh, who, it seems.
were two men and two women. and, as we supposed,
had been about some of their diabolic sacrifices. They
appeared, in short. frighted to death, at least so as to
sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak neither,
for the smoke. ' _

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had
the other, and all without any noise I should have
said. we brought them out of the house, or hut, first,
for, indeed, we were not able in bear the smoke any
more than they were. When we had done this. we
carried them all together to the idol: when we came
there we fell to work with him; and first we'daubed
him allover, and his robes also, with tar, , and such
other stufi' as we had, which was tallow mixed with
brimstonerthen we stopped his eyes, and ears, and
mouth full of gunpowder; then we wrapped up a
great iecc of wildfire in his bonnet; and then stick-
mg allpthe combustibles we had brought with us upon
him, we looked about to see if we could find any
hing else to help to burn him : when my Scotsman
telnembered that by the tent, or hut, where the men
were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw
or rushes I do not remember; away he and the other
kicotsman ran, and fetched their arms full of that.
When we had done this, we took all our prisoners, and
brought them, having untied their feet and ungagged

their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them

just before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to

the whole. .
We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts,

till the powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the

idol blew up, and, as we could perceive, had split and.

deformed the shape of it; and. in a word, till we saw
it burnt into a mere block or log of wood: and then
setting the dry forage to it. we found it would be soon
quite consumed ; so we began to thinlt of going away;
but the Scotsman said, " No: we must not go. for
these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves
into the fire, and burn themselves with the idol." So
we resolved to stay till the forage was burnt down too,
and then we came away and left them.

In the morning we appeared among our fellow-
travellers, exceeding busy in getting ready for our
journey; nor could anyman suggest that we had been
any where but in our beds. as travellers might be sup--
posed to he, to fit themselves for the fatigues of that
da '5 journey.

ut it did not end so: for the next day came a great
multitude of the country people, not only of this vil-
lage, but of a hundred more. for ought I know, to the
town-gates: and in a most outrageous manner de-
manded satisfaction of the Russian governor, for the.
insulting their priests, and burning their great Cham-
Chi-'l'haungu: such a hard name they gave the mon-
strous creature they worshipped. The people of New
linskay were at first in great consternation: for they
said the 'l'artars were no less than thirty thousand, and
that in a few days more they would be one hundred
thousand stronger.

The Russian governor sent out messenaers to appease
them. and gave them all the good words imaginable.
He assured them he knew nothing of it, and that there
had not a soul of his gnrrison been abroad; that it
could not be from any body there: and if they would
let him know who it was. he should be exemplarily

unis-lied. They returned haughtily, That all the coun .

dwelt in the sun. and no mortal would have dared to
offer violence to his image, but some Christian mis-
creant; so they called them, it seems; and they there-
fore denounced waragalnst him, and all the Russians
who, they said. were miscreants and Christians.

The governor. still patient, and unwilling to make a
bleach, or to have any cause of war alleged to be given
by him, the czar having straitly charged him to treat
the conquered country.with gentleness and civility,
gave them still all the good words he could ; at last he
told them, there was a caravan gone toward Russia
that morning, and perhaps it was some of them who
had done them this injury; and that, if they would be
satisfied with that, he would send after them, to in nine
into it. This seemed to appease themalittle; an ac-
cordingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a
particular account how the thing was, intimating
withal, that if any in our caravan had done it, they
should make their esca ie; but that whether they had
done it or not, we shou d make all the haste forward
that was possible: and that in the meantime he would
kee them in play as long as he could.

his was very friendly in the governor. However,
when it came to the caravan, there was nobody knew
any thing of the matter; and, as for us that were
guilty. we were the least of all suspected; none at
much as asked us the question; however, the captain
of the caravan, for the time, took the hint that the go-
vernor gave us, and we marched or travelled two days
and two nights without any considerable sto , and then
we lay ata village called Plothus; nor di we make
any long sto here, but hastened on toward J arawena,
another of t te czar of Muscovy's colonies, and when
we expected we should be safe ; but it is to be observ-
ed, that here we began, for two or three day's march
to enter upon a vast nameless desert. of which I shall
say more in its place: and which if we had now been
upon it. it is more than probable we had been all de-
stroyed. It was the second dav's march from Plothur

that by the cloudsof dust behind us at a great distance,
some of our people began to be sensible we were up
sued. We had entered the desert, and had passed y a
great lake, called Schanks Osier, when we perceived a

. very great body of horse appear on the other side of
the lake to the north, we travelling west. We observ-
ed they went away west, as we did ; but hadsupposed .
we should have taken that side of the lake. whereas
we very happily took the south side: and in two days
more we saw them not. for they, believing we were
still before them, pushed on, till they came to the
river Udda: this is a very great river when it passes

farther north, but when we came to it, we. found it

narrow and fordable.

The third day, they either found their mistake or
5 had intelligence of us, and came ponrin in upon us
e toward the dusk of the evening We ad, to our
great satisfaction, just pitched upon a place for our
i camp, which was very convenient for the night ; for as

. we were upon a desert, though but at the beginin of
3 it. that was above five hundred miles over, we ha no
towns to lodge at. and indeed, expected none but the
2 city of J arawena. which we had yet two days match.
to'; the desert, however, had some few woods in it on
, this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great

' river Udda. it was in a narrow strait. between two
small but very. thick woods, that we pitched our little
cerpp for that night, expecting to be attacked in the
mg 13.

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued
for; but as it was usual for' the Mogul Tartars to go
about in troops in that desert, so the caravans always
fortify themselves every night against them, as against
armies of robbers; and it. was therefore no new thing
to be pursued. ,

' But we had, this night, of all the nights of our tree
! vels, a most advantageous camp; for we lay between
two woods, with a little rivulet running just befom our
front; so that we could not be surrounded, or attacked
any way, but in our front or rear: we took care also

to make our front as strong as we could, by placing
our packs, with our 'camels and horses, all in a line on
the side of the river, and we felled some'trees in our
rear. '

In this posture we cnoamped for the night; but the
enemy was u on us before we had finished our situa-
tion: they di not come on us like thieves, 'as we ex
peeled, but sent three messengers to us, to demand the
men to be delivered to them, that had abused their
priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi-Thaungu, that
they might burn them with fire; and, upon this, they

said, they would go away, and do us no farther harm, i

otherwise they would burn us all with fire. Our men
leaked very blank at this message, and began to stare
at one another, to see who looked with most guilt in
their faces, but, nobody was the word, nobody did it.
The leader of the caravan sent word he was well as-
sured it was not done 'hy any of our camp; that we
were peaceable merchants, travelling on our busih'gss,
that we had done no harm to them, or to any one else;
and therefore, they must look farther for their enemies,
who had in'ured' them, {or we were not the people;
so desired them not to disturb us; for, if they did, we
should defend ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for an
mswer, and a great crowd of them came down in the
morning. by the breakot' day, to our camp; but, seeing
as in such an advantageous situation, they durst come
no farther than the brook in our front, where they
stood, and showed us such a number, as, indeed, ten.
rifled us very much ; fbr those that spoke least of them
spoke of ten thousand. Here they stood, and looked
at us awhile, and then setting up a great howl, thev
a fly a cloud of arrows among us: but we were well
mough fortified for that, for we were sheltered under
our baggage; and! do not remember that one man
of us was hurt. .

Some time afler this we saw them move a little to
our right and expected them on the rear, when a cum

in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader a!
the caravan, said to him. "I will send all these peo-
ple away to Sibeilka. This was a city four or five
days 'nurney at least to the south, and rather behind
us. 0 he lakes his bow and arrows, and getting on
horseback, he rides away from our~rear directly, as it
were, back to Nertzinskay; after this, he takes agreat
circurt about. and comes to the army of the Tarters,
as if he had been sent express to tell them 3 ion story
that. the people who had burnt their Cham-Chi- haun
gu were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants,
as he called them ; that is to say, Christians; and that
they were resolved to burn the god Seal lsarg, belong-
ing to the Tonguses. '

As this fellow was a mere Tartar, and perfectly
s oke their language, he counterfeited so well, that
t ey all took it from him, and away they drove, in a
most violent hurry, to Sibeilka, which, it seems, was
five days journey lo the south; and in less than4hree
hours they were entirely out of our sight. and we never
heard any more of them, or ever knew whether they
went to that other place called Sibeilka or no.

So we passed safely on to the city of Jarawena,
where there was a garrison of Muscovites; and there
we rested five days, the caravan being exceedingly
fatigued with the last day's march, and with want of
rest in the night.

From this city we had a. frightful desert. which held
us three-and-twenty days march. We furnished our-
selves with some tents here, for the better accommo-
dating ourselves in the night: and the leader of the
caravan procured sixteen carriages, or wagons of the
country, for carrying out water and provisions; fins
these carriages were our defence every night round on:
little cam ; so that had the Tartars appeared. unless
they had geen very numerous indeed, they would not
have been able to hurt us.

We may well be supposed to want rest again alter
this long journey; for in this desert we saw neither

SS house or tree, or scarce a bush -. we saw, indeed,
e abundance of the sable-hunters, as they called them.
These are all 'l'artars of the. Mogul Tartary, of which
this country is a part; and they frequently attack small
caravans; but we saw no numbers of them together.
I was curious to see the sable skins they catched; but
l could never speak with any of them ; for they durst
not come near us; neither dnrst we Straggle from our
company to go near them.

After we had passed this desen, we came into a
country pretty well inhabited t that is to say, we found
, towns and castles settled by the czar of Muscovy. with

garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans
and defend the country against the Tartars, who would
otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his
czar'tsh majesty has given such strict orders for the
well guarding the caravansand merchants, that if there
are any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments
of the garrison are always sent to see travellers sat' e
from station to station.

And thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom I had
an opportunity to make a visit to. by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, ofi'ered
us a guard of fifty men, if we thought there was any
danger, to the next station.

l thought long before this, that as we came nearer
to Europe we should find the country better peopled
and the peeple more civilized ; bttt I found myself

' mistaken in both, for we had yet the nation of the
Tongnses to pass through ; where we saw the same
tokens of paganism and bat-barity. or worse, than be-
fore ; only as they were conquered by the Muscovites,
and entirely reduced, they were notso dangerous; but
for the rudeness of manners, idolatry. and polytheism,
no people in the world ever went beyOnd them. They
ate clothed all in skinsot' beasts, and their houses are
built of the same. You know not a man from a. wo-
man. neither by the ruggedness of their countenances

or their clothes; and in the winter, when the ground

:3 covered with snow, they live under ground, in
houses like vaults, which have cavities or caves going
from one to another.

If tne T artars had their Cham-Chi--Thaungu for a
whole village, or country, these had idols in every hat
and every cave; besides, they worship the stars, the
sun, the water, the snow ; and, in a word, every thing

'that they do not understand, and they understand but

very little; so that almost every element, every unv
common thing, sets them a sacrificin . _
But I am no more to describe poop e than countries
any farther titan my own story comes to be concerned
in them. Imet with nothing peculiar to myself in all
this country, which,l reckon, was from the desert
which 1 spoke of last, at least four hundredfmiles, half
of it being another desert, which took us up twelve
days severe travelling, without house, tree, or bush ,
but we were obliged again to carry our own provi.
sions, as well water as bread. After we were out of
this desert, and had travelled two days, we came to
J anezay, a Mu'scoviteeity or station, on the great rivet
J attezay, This river, they told us, parted Europe from
Asia, though our map-makers, as lam told, do not -

. agree to it ; however, it is certainly the eastern bound,

ary of the ancient Siberia, which now makes a pro
vince only of the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself
equal in bigness to the whole empire of Germany.
And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism
still prevailed, except in the Museovite garrisons. All
the country between the river Oby and the river Jane-
zay is as entirely pa an; and the people as barbarous,
as the remotest of t e Tartars; nay, as any nation,
for aught 1 know, in Asia or America. I also found,
which I observed to the Muscovite governors, whom
[had opportunity to converse with, that the again:
are not much the wiser, or the nearer'Christiamty, for
being under the Mnscovite government; which they
acknowledged was true enough, but, they said, it was
none of their business; that if the czar expected to
convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar subject:

It should be done by sending clergymen among them,
not soldiers ;and they added, with more sincerity than
I expected, that they found it was not so much the

'eoncern of their monarch to make the people Chriy

tittus. as it was to make them subjects.
From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed
a wild uncultivated country; I cannot say 'tis a bar-
barous soil: 'tis only barren of people, and wants
good management; otherwise it IS in itself a most
leasnn t, fruitful, and agreeable country. What inha-
Eitants we found in it are all agans, except such as

.are sent among them from ussia; for this is the

country, I mean on both sides the river Oby, whither
the h'lus'covite criminals, that are not put to death, are
banished, and from whence it is next to impossible
they should ever come away.

I have nothing material to say of my particular
affairs, till 1 came to Tobolski, the capital of Siberia,-
where I continued soine time, on the following ocea-
810":--

We had been now almost seven months on our jour-
ney, and winter began to come on apace; whereupon
my armor and [called a council about our particular
affairs; in. which we found it. pro or, considering that
we were bound for England, an not for Moscow, to
consider how to dispose of ourselves. They told us
of sledges and rein-deer to carry us over the snow in
the winter-time: and, indeed, they have such things,
as it would be incredible to relate the particulars of,
by which meansthe Russians travel more in the win-
ter than they can in summer; because in these sledges.
they are able to run night and day: the snow being
frozen. is one universal covering to nature, by which
the hills, the vales, the rivers, the lakes, are all smooth,

and hard as a stone; and they run upon the surface -

without any regard to what is underneath. ,

ofi' west for Nerve, and the nll' of Finland, and s~
either by sea or land to Dantztc, where 1 might possi.
bly sell myChina cargo to good advantage; or I must
leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from
whence I had but six days by water to Archangel,
and from thence might be sure of shipping, either to
England, Holland, or Hamburg.

Now to go any of these journeys in the winter
would have been preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the
Baltic would be frozen up, and I could not get pas
sage; and'to go by land in those. countries, was [at
less safe than among the Mogul Tartars; 'likewise to
Archangel, in October all the ships would be gone
from thence, and even the merchants, who dwell them
in summer, retire south to Moscow in the winter, when
the ships are gone; so I should have nothing but
extremity of cold to encounter, with a scarcity of
provisions, and must he there tn an empty town all
the winter: so that, upon the whole, I thought it
much my better way to let the caravan go, and to
make provision to winter where I was, vrz. at Tohol-
ski, in Siberia, in the latitude of sixty degrees, where
I was sure of three things to wear out acold winter
with, viz. plenty of provisions, such as the country
afiorded, a warm house, with fuel enough, and excel-
lent company; of all which lshailgive afull account

in its place. . y '
I was now in a "quite different clnnate from my

beloved island, where 1 never felt cold, except when i
had my ague; on the contrary, I had much to do to
hear my clothes on my hack, and never made any fire
but without doors. for my necessity, in dressing in
food, 6m. New I made me three good vests, with
arge robes, or gowns over them, to hang down to the
feet, and button close to the wrists, and all these lined
with furs, to make them sufl'tciently warm.

As to a warm house, l must confess, I greatly die
like our way in England, of making fires in every
room tn the house, in oven chimneys, which, when to

lire was out, always kept the air in the room cold as
the climate. But taking an apartment in agood house
in the town, i ordered a chimney to be built like a
firmace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove;
the funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the
dnor to come at the fire went in another, and all the
rooms were kept equally warm, but no fires seen ; like
as they heat the bagnios in England.

By this means we had always the same c'dmate in
all the rooms, and an equal heat was. preserved; and
how cold soever it was without, it was always warm,
within: and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incom-
mmled with any smoke.

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should
be possible to meet with good company here, in a
countr so barbarous as that of the most northerly
part0 Europe, near the Frozen ocean, and within but
tt very few degrees of Nova Zembla.

But this being the country where the state criminals
of Muscovy, asI observed before, are all banished;
this city was full of nohlemen. princes, gentlemen,
colonels, and, in short, all degrees of the nobility, gen-
try, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. Herc were
the famous rince Galifken, or Galofi'ken, and his

tr general Robostisky, and several other
persons of note, and some ladies.

By means of my Scots merchant, whom, neverthe-
less. 1 parted with h'ere,I made an vauaintance with
several of these gentlemen, and some of them of the
first rank.- and from these, in the long winter nights,
in which I staid here. I received several agreeable vi-
sits. It was talking one. night with a certain prince,
one of the banished ministers of state belonging to the
czar of Muscovy, that my talk of my particular case,

fled in littylepsulrjprised, and fixing his eyes $2"in
upon me, began to wonder what I meant.

I told him his wonder would cease when Ithad ex-
plained myself. First, I told him, I had the absolute
disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects:
that notwithstanding my absolute power,l had not
one person disaffected to my government, or to my
person, in all my dominions. He shook his head a
that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid the czar of Mus
eovy. I told him, that all the lands in my kingdom
were my own, and all my subjects were not only my
tenants, but tenants at will; that they would all fight
for me to the last drop; and that never tyrant, for
such I acknowledged myself to be, was ever so uni-
versally beloved, and yet so horribly feared, by his
subjects,

After amusing them with these riddles in govern-
ment for awhile, I opened the case, and told them the
story at large, of my living in the island, and how I
managed both myself and the people there that were
under me, just as I have since minuted it down.
They were exceedingly taken with the story, and espe-
cially the prince, who told me with a sigh, that the
true reatness of life, was to be master of ourselves;
that he would not have changed such a state of life as
mine, to have been czar of Muscovy; and that he
found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to be
banished to there, than ever he found in the highest
authority he enjoyed in the court of his.master, the'
czar: that the height of human wisdom was to bring
our tempers down to our circumstances, and to make

perfectly capable of making a felicity for itscl , fully
satisfying to itself, and suitable to its own best ends
and desires, with but very little assistance from the
world; that air to breathe in, food to sustain life,
clothes for warmth, and liberty {or exercise, in order
to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the world
cottd do for us: and though the greatness, the autho
rity, the riches, and the pleasures, which some enjoy-
cd in the world. and which he had enjoyed his share
of, had much in them that was agreeable to us, yet
he observed, that all those things chiefly gratified the
coarsest of our affections; such as our ambition,our
particular pride, our avarice, our vanity, and our sexy
suality; al which were, indeed, the mere product oi
the worst part of man, were in themselves crimes;
and had in them the seeds of all manner of crimes;
but neither were related to. or concerned with, any of
those virtues that constituted us wise men,or of those~
graces which distinguished us as _Christians; that be-
ing now deprived of all_ the fancied felicity which he
enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices, he said
he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of them .
where he found all manner of deformity; and was .
now convinced, that virtue only makes a man truly
wise, riclr, and great, and preserves him in the wa
to a superior happiness in a future state; and in this
he said, they were more happy in their banishment,
than all their enemies were, who had the full posses-
sion of at; the wealth and power that they (the ba-
nished) had leli. behind them.

lie 5 take this with so much warmth in his temper,
so much earnestness and motion of his spirits, which
were apparent in his countenance, that it. was evident
it was the true sense of his soul; and indeed there
was no room to doubt his sincerity.

i told him, I once thou ht myself a kind of a mo-
narch in my old station, 0 which I had given him an
account, but that i thought he was not a monarch
only, but a great conqueror; for that he that has got
a. victory over his own exorbitant desires, and has the
absolute dominion over himself. and whose tensor
entirely governs his will, is certainly greater than he
that conquers a city. " But, my lord," said I, " shall
i take the liberty to ask you a question 2"--" With
all my heart," said he. " If the door of your liberty
was opened, " said I," would not you take hold of it
to deliver yourself from this exile ?"

-' Hold," said he," your question is subtle, and
requires some serious just distinctions to give it a sin~
core answer ; and I'll give it you from the bottom of
my hearL Nothing that i know of in this world
would move me to deliver myself from the state of
banishment, exce t these two: first, the enjoyment of
my relations; an secondly, a. little warmer climate.
But i protest to you, that to go back to the pomp of
the court, the glory, the power, the hurry of a minister
of state; the wealth, the gayety, and the pleasures,

that is to say, follies of a courtrer 3 if my master should '

send me word this moment, that he restores me to all
he banished me from, I protest, if I know myself at
all, 1 would not leave this wilderness, these deserts
and these frozen lakes, for the palace of Moscow."

" But my lord," said i, u perhaps you not only
are banished from the pleasures of the court, and from
the power, and authority, and wealth, you enjoyed

before, but you may be absent too from some of the,

nonveniences of life; your estate perhaps, confiscat-
ed, and your effects plundered ; and the supplies left
you here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands
of life."

" Ay," said he, " that is. as you su pose me to be
a lord, or a prince, 6w. So indeed Pam; but you
are now to consider me only as a man, a human crea-
ture, not at all distinguished from another; and so I
can suffer no want, unless [should be visited with
sickness and distemper-s. However, to put the ques-
tiou out of dispute; you see our manner; we are in
this place five ersons of rank ; we live perfectly re-
tired, as suitet to a state of banishment: we have
something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes
which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting
for our food ; but the poor soldiers who are here, with-
out that help, live in as much plenty as we. They go
into the woods, and catch sables and foxes; the la.-
buur of a month will maintain them a year; and as
the wa of living is not expensive, so it is not hard to
get an cient to ourselves; so that objection is out of
doors. "

I have no room to give a full account of the most
agreeable conversation i had with this truly great
man 1 in all which he showed, that his mind was so
inspired with a superior knowledge of things. so sup-
ported by religion, as well as by a vast share of wis-
dom, that his contempt of the world was really as
much as he had expressed, and that he was always
the same to the last, as will appear in the story I am
going to tell.

I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful
winter! thought it to be. The cold was so intense,
.hat I could not so much as look abroad without he-
ng wrapt in furs, and a mask of fur before my face
or rather a hood, with only a ghole for breath, and
two for sight. The little daylight we had. as we reck-
oned, for three months, not above five hours a day,
or six atmost; only that the snow lying on the ground
continually, and the weather being clear, it was never
quite dark. Our horses were kept (or rather starved)

under ground; and as for our servants, (for we hired
servants here to look after our, horses and ourselves)
we had every now and then their fingers and toes to
thaw, and take care' of, lest they should mortify and
fall off. '

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses
being close, the walls thick, the lights small, and the
glass all double. Our food was chiefly the flesh of
deer, dried and cured, in the season; good bread
enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several
sorts, and some flesh of mutton.and of buffaloes, which
is pretty good beef. All the stores of provisions for
the winter are laid up in the summer, and well cured.
Our drink was water mixed with aqua-vita: instead
of brandy; and, {or a treat, mead instead of wine;
which. however, they have excellent good. The hun-
ters, who ventured abroad all weathers, frequently
brought us in fresh venison, very fat and good ; and
sometimes bear's flesh, but we (lid not much care for
the last. We had a good stock of tea, with which we
treated our friends as above; and in a word. we lived
very cheerfully and well, all things considered.

It was now March, and the days grown consider
ably longer.'mnl the weather at least tolerable; so
other travellers bean to prepare sledges to carry them
over the snow, and to get things ready to be goin ;
but my measures being fixed, asl have said, for Arj-

motion, knowing very well, that the ships from the
south do not set out for that part of the world till
May or June; and that if 1 was there at the beginning
of August, it would be as soon as any ships would be
ready to go away; and therefore, I say,I made no
haste to be gone, as others did; in' a word, I saw a

before me. t seems, every year they go from thence

In short. about the latter end of Ma'y,l began to
make all ready to pack up; and as I was doing this,
it occurred to me, that seeing all these peOpIe were
banished by the czar of Muscovy to Siberia, and yet,
when they came there. were at liberty to go whither
they would; why did they not then 0 away to any
part of the world wherever't'hey thoug tfit'? and I be-
gan to examine what should hinder them from malt
mgsuch an attempt. .

But my wonder was over when I entreated upon
that sub'ect with the erson I have mentioned, who
answere me thus: " onsider, first," said he, " the
place where we are; and, secondly, the condition we
are in; especially," said he, "the enerality of the
people who are banished hither. e are surround-
ed," said he, " with stronger things than hers and
bolts: on the north side it is an unnavigable ocean,
where ship never sailed, and boat never swam; nei-
ther, if we- had both, could we know whither to go .
with them. Every other way," said he, " we have
above a thousand miles to pass through the czar's own
dominions, and by ways utterly impassable, except
by the roads made by the government, and throu h
the towns garrisoned by its trooPs; so that we cou d
neither pass undiscovered by the road, or subsist any .
other way: so that it is in vain to attempt it.

I was silenced indeed. at once, and found that they

came into my thoughts, that I might certainly be made
an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent
person, and that it was very easy for me to carry him
away, there being no guard over him in the country;
and as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel,
and that I went in the nature of a caravan, by which
I was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the

culars, that should be my care, till he should better
on 1y himself.

e heard me we attentively, and looked earnestly
on me all the whi e I spoke; nay, [could see in his
verv face, that what I said put his spirits into an ex-
ceeding ferment; his colour frequently changed, his
eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, that it might
be even perceived in his countenance; nor could he
immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it
were, expected what he would say to it; and after he
had paused a little, he embraced me, and said, " How
unhappy are we, unguided creatures as we are, that
even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares
to us, and we are made tempters of one another! My
dear friend." said he. " your offer is so sincere, has
such kindness in it, is so disinterested in itself, and is
so calculated for my advantage, that I must have very
little knowledge of the world, if I did not both won
do: at it, and acknowledge the obligation l have
upon me to you {or it: but did you believe I was sin-
cere in what I have so often said to-you of my con-
tempt ot' the world? Did you believe I spoke my
very soul to you, and that 1 had really maintained that
degree of felicity here, that had placed me above all
that the world could give me, or do for me? Did you
believe I was sincere, when I told you I would not
go back, if I was recalled even to be all that once I
was in the court. and with the favour of the czar my
master? Did you believe me, my friend, to he an ho-
nest man, or did you think me to be a boasting hypo-
crite ?" Here he stopped, as if he would hear what I
would say; but. indeed, I soon after perceived. that
he stopped because his spirits were in motion : his heart
was full of straw les. and he could not go on. I was,
Iconl'ess, astonished attire thing, as well as at the
man, and Iused some arguments with him to urge
him to set himself free; that he ought to look upon\\\v\.wv\~\/\MA~\M

this as a door opened by Heaven for his deliverance,
and a summons by Providence. who has the care and
good disposition of all events, to do himself good,and
to render himself useful in the world.

He had by this time recovered himself. " How
do you know, sir," said ne, warmly, " but that, in-
stead of a summons from Heaven, it may be a faint
of another instrument, representing, in all the alluring
colours to me the show of felicity asa deliverance,
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directl to
my ruin? Here i am free from the temptation 0 re.
turning to my former miserable greatness; there I am
not sure, but that all the seeds of pride, ambition,
avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in my na-
ture, may revive and take root, and in a word, attain

you see now master of his soul's iberty, shall be the

sion of all personal liberty. Dear sir, let me remain
in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes
of life, rather than purchase a show of treedom at the
expense of the liberty of my reason, and at the ex-
pense of the futurehap iness which now I have in m

and stood silent, looking at him; and, indeed, admir-

that, though the weather was extremely cold, it put
him into a most violent sweat, and 1 found he wanted

hat I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on
him again; and then I withdrew to my own apart-
ment.

but I am recovereclido not take it'ill that I do not

, close with your offer; I assure you, it is not for want

of a sense of the kindness of it in you ; and I come
to make the most-sincere acknowledgment of it toyou;
but, I he e, I have got the victory over myself."
" y Ear ," said I, " I hope you are fully satie-
fied, that you did not resist the call of Heaven."--
" Sir," said he, " if it had been from Heaven, the
same wer would have influenced me to accept it;

but I me, and am' fully satisfied, that it is from '

Heaven 1 at I decline hr; and I have an infinite satis-
faction in the departing, that you shall leave me an ho-
nest man still, though not a free man."

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make
profusion to him of my haVinEI no end in it, but a
sincere desire to serve him. e embraced me very
passionately. and assured me, he was sensible of that,
and should always acknowledge it: and With that he
dilated me avery tine present of saliles, toomuch
indeed for me to accept from a man in his circum-
stances; and I would have avoided them, but he would
not be refused.

The next morning I sent my servant to his lord-
ship, with a small resent of tea, two pieces of China
damask, and {our ittle wedges of Japan gold, which

_did not all weigh above six ounces, or thereabouts;

but were far short of the value of his sables, which in-
deed, when I came to England, I found worth near
uvo hundred pounds. He accepted the tea, and one
piece of the damask, and one of the pieces of gold,
which had afine stam upon it, of the Japan coinage
which I found he tool: for the rarity of it, but would
not take 'any more; and sent word by my servant,

that he desired to speak with me.

When I' came to him, he' told me, [knew what
had passed between us, and hoped I would not mcve
him any more in that" afl'air; but that, since I made
such a generous offer to him, he asked me, if I had

that he would name to me. in whom he had a great
share of concern. I told him, that I could not say]
inclined to do so much for any one but himself, for
whom I had a particular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance:

owever, if he would please touame the mum: to
me, I would give him my answer, and hoped he would
not be displeased with me, if he was with my answer.
He told me, it was only his son, who, though I had
not seen, yet was in the same condition with him-
self, and above two hundred miles from him. on the
other side the Oby; but that, if lconsented, he would
send for him.

I made no hesitation. but told him l would do it.
I made some ceremony in letting him understand that
it was wholly on his account; and that'eeeing I could
not prevail on him, I would show my respect to him
by mv concern for his son: but these things are too
tedious to repeal here. He sent away the next day
for his son. and in about twenty days he came back
with the messenger, bringing six or seven horses loaded
with very rich furs, and which, in the whole amount-
ed to a very great value.

His servants brought the horses into the town, tut
left the young lord at a. distance till night, when he
came incognito into our apartment, an his father
presented him to me; and, in short. we concerted
there the manner of our travelling, and every thing
preper for the journey.

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black
fox-skins, fine ermines, and such other furs that are
very rich: I say, I had bought them in that city for
exchange for some of the goods brought from China:
in particular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I
sold the greatest part here ; and the rest afterwards at
Archangel, for a much better price than 1 could have
done at London : and my partner, who was sensible
of the profit, and whose business, more particularly
than mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased
with our stay, on account of the traffic we made here.

It was in the beginning of June when I left tlm
remote place, a ci , I believe, little heard of in the
world; and, indee , it is so far out of the road of
commerce, that I know not how it should be much
talked of. We were now come to a very small eara
van, being only thirty-two horses and camels in all.
and all of them passed for mine, though my new
guest was proprietor of eleven of them. It was most
natural also, that 1 should take more servants with
me than I had before, and the young lord passed for
my steward, what great man I passed for myself 1
know not, neither did it concern me to inquire. We
had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over
that we met with in all the journey; indeed, I call it"
the worst, because the way was very deep in some
places, and very uneven in others; the best we had to
say for, it was, that we thought we had no troops of
Tartars and robbers to fear, and that they never came
on this side the river Oby, or at least but very sel-
dom; but we found it otherwise.

My young lord had with him a faithful Muscovita
servant, or rather a Siberian servant, who was r-
fectly acquainted with the country; and who le us
by private roads, that we avoided coming into the
principal towns and cities upon the great road, such
as Tumen, Solay, Kamaskoy, and several others; be.
cause the Muscovitefarrisons, which are kept there,
are very curious an strict in their observation on
travellers, and searching, least any of the banished per-
sons of note should make their escape that way into
Muscovy; but by this means, as we were kept out of
the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we
were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when
we might have had good accomodation in the cities
on the way: this the young lord was so' sensible of;
that he would not allow us to lie abroad. when we

came to several cities on the way ; but lay abroad him-
self, with his servant, in the woods, and met us aL
ways at the appointed places.
We were just entered Europe, having passed it.
river Kama, which, in these parts, is the boundary

between Europe and Asia; and the first city on the

European side was called Soloy Kamaskoy, which is

as much as to say, the great city on the river Kama;

and here we thou ht tohave seen some evident alto-

_ ration in the peop e, their manners, their habit, their
religion, and their business; but we were mistaken;
or as we had a vast desert to pass, which, by rela-
ion, is near seven hundred miles long in some places,
but not above two hundred miles over where we
passed it; 50, till we came past that horrible place,
we found very little difierence between that country
and the Mogul Tartary; the people mostly Pagans,
and little better than the savages of America; their
houses and towns full of idols, and their way of livin
wholly barbarous, except in the cities as above, an
the villages near them; where they are Christians, as
they call themselves, of the Greek church, but even
these have their religion mingled with so many relics
of superstition, that it is scarce to be known In some
places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.

In passing this forest,l thought indeed we must,
after all our dangers were, in our imagination, escapv
ed, as before, have been plundered and robbed, and
perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves: of what
country they were; whether the roving bands of the
Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the
banks of the Oby, had ranged thus far; or whether
they were the sable hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a
loss to know; but they were all on horseback,carriecl
bows and arrows, and were at first about five-and-
forty in number. They came so near to us as within
about two musket shot; and, asking no uestions
they surrounded us with their horses, and loo ed very
earnestly upon us twice. At length they placed them-
selves just in our way; upon which we drew up in
a little line before our camels, being not above sixteen
men in all; and being drawn up thus, we halted,
and sent out the Siberian servant who attended his

nrd, to see who they were; his master was the more-.~.-v.-vv\.vusv~x~ xwxveww. vnxwvanvx \WWMWW

willing to let him go, because he was not a little apt
prehensive that they were a Siberian troop sent out
after him. The man came up near them with a flag
of truce, and called to them; but though he spoke
several of their languages.or dialectsof languages ra-
ther, he could not understand a word they said: how-

them at his peril. so he said he understood them to
mean, offering to shoot at him if he advanced, the
fellow came back no wiser than he went only that
by their dress he said, he believed them to be some
Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes; and
thal there must be more of them on the great desert,
though he never heard that ever any of them were
seen so far north before.

This was small comfort to us; however, we had no
remedy: there was on our left hand, at about a quar
ter of a mile's distance, a little grove or clump of
trees. which stood close together. and very near the
rnad ; I immediately resolved we should advance to
those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could
there: for, first. I considered that the trees would in a
great measure cover us from their arrows; and in the
next place. they could not come to charge us in a
body: it was. indeed, my old Portuguese pilot who
proposed it: and who had this excellency attending
him. namely, that he was always rcadiest and most
apt to direct and encourage us in cases of the most
danger. We advanced immediately with what speed
we could. and gained that little wood, the Tartars. or
thieves. for we knew not what to call them, kce mg
their stand, and not attempting to hinder us. ll hen
we came thither, we found, to our great satisfaction,
that it was a swampy, springy. piece of ground, and
on the other side. a great spring, of water. which, run-

; ning out in a little rill or brook. was a little farther
joined by another of the like bigness: and was. in

were very large, and stood pretty thick; so that as
soon as we got in, we saw ourselves rfectly safe
from the enemy, unless they alighted an attacked us
ou foot. -

But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese.
Willi indefatigable application, cut down great arms
of the trees. and laid them hanging, not cut quite off,
from one tree to another; so that he made a conti-
nued fence almost round us.

We staid here, waiting the motion of the enemy
some hours without perceiving they made any offer

to stir; when about two hours before night, they came'

down directly upon us; and, though we had not per-
ceived it, we found they had been joined by some
more of the same, so that they were near foursome
horse, whereof, however, we fancied some were wo-
men. They came in till they were within half a shot
of our little wood, when we fired one musket without
ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue, to
know what they wanted, and bid them keep off; but
as if they knew nothing of what we said, they came
on with a double fury, directly to the wood-side, not
imagining we were so barricaded, that they could not
oreak in. Our old pilot was our captain as well as
he had been our engineer; and desired of us, not to
fire upon them till they came within pistol shot, that
we might be sure to kill: and that, when we did fire,
we should be sure to take good aim. We bade him
give the word of command ; which he delayed so long
that they were, some of them, within two pikes length
of us when we fired.

We aimed so true, (or Providence directed our shot

0 sure) that we killed fourteen of them at the first
volley, and wounded several others, as also several of
heir horses; for we had all of us loaded our pieces,
with two or three bullets apeace at least.

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and re-
treated immediately about one hundred rods from us,
in which time we loaded our pieces again, anal. see

four or five of their horses, whose riders, we suppos-
ed, were killed; and coming up' to the dead.we could
easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew not from
what country, or how they came to make an excur-
sion of such an unusual length.

About an hour after. they made a motion to attack
us again; and rode round our little wood, to see where
else they might' break in; but finding us always ready
to face them. they went oil" again, and we resolved
not to stir from the place that night.

We slept but little, you may be sure; but spent the.
most part of the night in strengthening our situation,
and barricading the entrances into the wood; and1
keeping a strict watch, .we waited for daylight, and,
when it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discovery
indeed: for the enemy, who we thought were discou;
raged with the reception they had met with, were now
increased to no less than three hundred, and had set
up eleven or twelve huts or tents, as if they were
resolved to besiege us; and this little camp they had -
pitched, was upon the open plain, at about three quar-
ters of a mile {mm us. We were indeed surprised at
this discovery; and now, I confess, I gave myself
over for lost, and all that-l had. The loss of my ef~
fects did not lie so near me (though they were very
considerable) as the thoughts of falling into the hands
of such barbarians, at the latter end of my journey,
after so many difliculties and hazartlsas I had gone
through ; and even in sight of our port, where we ex-
pected safety and deliverance. As [or my partner,

re was raging: he declared, that to lose his good:
would be his ruin; and he would rather die than be
starved ; and he was for fighting to the last drop,

The young lord, as gallant as ever flesh showed it '
self; was for fighting to the last also; and my old pilo
was of the opinion we were able to resist them all,
in the situation we then were in: and thus we spent
the day in debates of what we should do; but toward
evening, we found that the number of our enemie-

mansmexm\ss~\\\\~~\"~mw"\~mvvsw
still increased : perhaps, as they were abroad In seve-
lal parties for prey, the first had sent out scouts to
call for help, and to acquaint them of their booty; and
we did not know but by the morning they might still
be a greater number; so I began to inquire of those
people we had brought from Tobolski, if there were
no other, or more private ways, by which we might
avoid them in the night. and perhaps either retreat to
some town, or get help to guard us over the desert.
The Siberian, who was servant to the young lord,
told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight,
he would engage to carry us all in the night by a way
that went north toward the river Petraz. by which
he made no doubt but we might et away, and the
Tartars never the wiser; but he saig, his lord had told
him he would not return, but would rather choose to
fight. I told- him, he mistook his lord; for that! he
was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it;
that I knew his lord was braVe enough by what he
had showed already; but that his lord knew better
than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men fight
five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity forced
them to it: and that if he thought it possible for new
escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to

attempt it. He answered if his lord gave him such '

order, he would lose his lifeif he did not perform it
We soon brought his lord to give that order, though
privately, and we immediately prepared for the put-
ting. It in practice.
nd first, as soon as it began to be dark,we kindled
a fire in our little cam , which we kept burning, and
repared so as to ma c it burn all night, that the
'artars might conclude we were still there; but, as
soon as it was dark. that is to say, so as we could see
the stars, (for our guard would not stir before havin
all our horses and camels ready loaded, we ollowe

by the pole or north star, all the country being level

gun to be lighter still -. not that it was quite dark all
night. but the moon began to rise . so that, in short,
it was rather lighter than we wished it to be; but by
six o'clock next morning we were gotten neat- forty
miles, though the truth is, we almost spoiled our
horses. Here we found a Russian village, named Ki>>-
ntazinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing of
the Kalmuek Tartars that Jay. About two hours be-
fore night we set out again, and travelled till eight the
next morning, though not quite so hastily as before;
and about seven o'clock we passed a little river, called
Kirtza. and came to a good large town inhabited by
Russians. and very populous, called Ozomys. There
we heard, that several troops or herds of Knlmucks
had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were
now completely out or danger of them. which was to
our gram mtisfaction, you may be sure. Here we
were obliged to get some fresh horses, and having
need enou-vh of rest, we staid five days; and my part-
ner and Tagreetl to give the honest Siberian, who
brought us hither, the value of ten pistoles for his con-
ducting us.

In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the
river Witzogda, \vhicn running into the river Dwina,

' we were there verv happily near the end of our tra-
vels by land, that river being navigable in seven days
passage to Archangel. From hence we came to Law-
renskoy, where the river joins, the third of July, and
aovided ourselves with two luggage-boats, and a

rge, for our convenience. We embarked the se-
venth, and arrived all safe at Archangel the eighteenth,
having been a year, five mouths, and three days on
the journey, including our stay of eight months and
odd days at 'l'obolski.

We were obliged to stay at this plane six weeks for
