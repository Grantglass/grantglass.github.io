The sen of a good honest tradesmen of York,
My heart ever turned to the sea;

,Though kind parents urged me, againand again,

. A lawyer or merchant to be.

' A good education they gave me when young,
Yet when I arrived at man's years,
I ran off from home, and for Lendon set sail,
' N 0t heeding their wishes or tears.

""Our ship was soon wrecked in a terrible storm;

So to London my way I then made,
<<And sailed with a trader, this time with success,
As our voyage most amply repaid.

,' The second, however, proved woeful. for us,
As the wild Moorish pirates gave chase;

' I was thus taken prisoner, sold to a Turk,

And lived two years a slave on his place.4 T1111 HISTORY OF ROBINSON CRUSO'E.

Thus day after day I returned to the wreck,
Storing all that of value "could be,

Until, the" twelfth. time,whe11 a storm coming on,
Without raft, I swam back through the sea.

I had made me a hut of sea--chests and planks,
IVithin which to sleep safely at night.

The next morning, rising, I looked for the ship----
It had vanished forever from. sight.

Not knowing how long I must live 011 the isle,
I looked out for a well-sheltered spot,

Whoreon I might dwell, and as well as I could,
Make the best of my sad lonely lot.

A1ou11d a half cir,cle in front of a cave,
Stakes I d1ove deep and fi11n in the gmund,
And interw ove these with some ship cable st1o112;,
Makinv thus a close wall all 211 ound

Within this enclosule I made a good '0,th
S1301 ed n1wgyooods in the cave, which hold all

And femino an opening the wild beasts nught see
Made a laddol to climb 11 e1: the wall.

' With gun 011 my shoulder, I daily sought food,
"71th my dog I had brong ht from the boat;

' And led home beside me, one day, a young kid,
Which had strayed from its mother, the goat.

~ Without 111211112111 friends, I was not all a1: ne,
For in one of my rambles I caught

. A Sprightly green parrot, Which gave me delight,
As it uttered the few words I taught.

' Beside this, tWO cats I had in ourrht f1 0111 the ship,
W'ho shared with me lodging and food .
So, While I longed oft for my kindred andfriends,
A I gave thanks for so 111111311 that was good.

I My furniture, true, was both scanty and mean:
Having made a rude table and chair,

I tried my pom hand at some long 011 basket wo1 k,
And some dishes of queer eai' thenware.6 Tun- Hils'ronr or lionnxsox Unusen'.

In order to keep strict account of the time,
And be able the Sundays to tell,

I cut a deep noteh every day in a post,
Thus, from year to year, keeping time well.

One day having need of an empty grain bag,
I had brought from the ship stores with me,

I threw by my place the few seeds that remained,
Little dreaming how fruitful they'd. be.

'In less than. a month, with much wonder1 I saw
Blades of barley and rice both appear;
Securing the seed, I continued to sow,
Having more than I needed each year.

One day; when exploring the isle's western coast,
I was smitten with terror and pain,

As here, on the land Where I felt I reigned. king,
Was the print of a, man's feet quite plain.

Lying by on the ground were hands, feet. and skulls ;
Near a spot Where a. fire had been;

In horror I ran, nor felt safe till I set
In my cave with the ladder drawn in. I;THE HISTORY or ROBINSON (lenses. 4

'I new knew that eennibals came to the place,
And for months ventured scarce from my door:

WI}? hopes Were reviving, when early one morn
Fiw canoes landed. thirty or more.

sB'rom one of' the vessels two men. they soon dragged,
Killing one on the spot with a blow; '

The other escaped, and, as swift as a>> deer,
Ran and fell at my feet, bowing low.

"Though two had pursued him, I fully resolved
I Would save him or die on the spot,

And felling one savage I ended the fray,

. As the second I pierced with a shot.

file poor one 1 saved was afraid of my gun,
And, at first, to come near did not dare;

But, gaining more courage, he kneeled at my feet,
His shbmission at once to declare.

:I now had a servant, companion tend fi'iend,

' Who ever proved faithth and true;

1 tz'tught him to help me in various ways,
And all that he could he would do.
One day my man Friday--I gave him that name,
Since I found him that day Of the week----

Returned in dismay from the sea--shore and said,
There were cannibals nOW at the creek. 4

We both seized our muskets and ran to the shore, '
Killing several, lbeside wounding five _ F.

'l'hey fled in great haste leaving, tied in a boat,
A poor savage more dead than alive.

Friday ran to the poor man and kissed him with joy, 4.;
Telling me 'twas his own father dear.

He had been taken captive, While seeking a ship,
That lay by an island quite near.

They took a canoe, paddled Off for the ship,
With the hope it might come by our way.

The good ship heading straight for our bay! ""3

When I he a1 (1 English welds, myheart leaped for joy,
As the captain I seized by the hand

He quickly gave 1)} omlse to carry us all
To England, my own native land. '

Having lived there for twenty-eight years;
And said in my heart, as I saw the far shore,
" God was better to me than my fears." aan Friday.
