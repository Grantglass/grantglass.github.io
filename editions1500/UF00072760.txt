'l'llOH-J who are accustomed in their
early days to do wrong, will with difficulty,

oi Robinson lelt him entirely to the guid<<
ancc 01 his own \\ ill and, as he loved play
better than his book, his youthful days pass--
ed without any attention being paid to the
improvement of his mind. Those hours,
which ought to have been spent in some use-
ful study. were squandered away among
idle boys in the streets, to his own detriment,
and disgrace ot'his fond parents.

"'hen young Robinson was grown up, his
parents knew not what to do with him. His
father wished to put him to some trade, but
the youth could not think of confinement and
rather wished to see the world atlarge.

Unoday. as Robinson was walking about
the port ol'Ncw-York, the place of his nativity,
he met with one of his old companions. whose4.

father was master of a ship, and who was then
on the point of sailing for London. The young
sailor persuaded Robinson to go with him,
which he did Without taking leave of his parents
and thereby committed a rash and wicked action.

 

The wind was favorable, they weighed an>>
clior and proceeded on their voyage, Robinson
soon lost sight ofthe land, and nothing was left
to his view but the ship in which he was sailing,
the water beneath, and the sky above.

The two following days, the wind and wea-
ther proved favorable: but on the third, the'hea-
vens began to be overcast, and every thing
seemed to forebode an approaching storm.
The air sometimes appeared to be on fire, and.
dreadful peals of thunder followed the vivid
flashes 0f lighting ; the rain fell in torrents, and
the wind blew the hillows of the ocean to a trc-
menduous height. One moment the vessel ape
pearcd mounting to the clouds, and the next.5

moment as it' descending to the lowest regions;
sometimes it lay on one side, and sometimes on
the other.

Robinson was not accustomed to such scenes
as these, he began to grow dizzy, and was soon
overtaken with what they call the sea sickness.
"Ah, my parents, my parents, he exclaimed,
you will never see me more ! This is a judge-
ment on me for my wickedness !"

All on a sudden, crack ! crack ! went the
deck. "Heaven have mercy on us cried the
sailors, who turned pale with terror, and lined
up their eyes to heaven. "We have sprung a
leak, and are already four feet water in the hold."

At these words. Robinson who was seated on .
the cabin cabin floor, fell into a swoon, and en- '

tirely lost his senses. All the crew ran to the
pumps, and exerted all the force they were
masters. of to keep the ship from sinking: The
captain fired signals of distress, which awakened
from his swoon, but soon threw him into a worse
state, when be supposed it to be the noise oc-
casioned by the ship's'foundering.

After some time, a large boat came to their
assistance: but it was with great difiieulty, on

account of the dreadful waves, that they could-

get on board of it ; and Robinson must have
perished had not a compassionate sailor thrown
him on board of the boat. They had rowed but
a short distance from the ship when the saw it

sink. After many dangers they use old ,the;

ship and were all taken on board.6

The ship that had received them set sail for
England, and, in a few weeks, entered the mouth
of the river Thames, and soon after anchored
in the port of London. They there went on
shore, happy in the idea of having escaped with
their lives.

Robinson amused himself for a few hours in
in viewing some parts of this great city: but
his stomach soon telling him that he stood in
need of something to eat, he went in search of
the master of the vessel, who received him kind-
ly, and made him sit down to the table with
him.

After dinner he asked the captain if he
would take him back to New-York : but the cap-
tain reminded him that his ship was lost he
must wait some time before he could procure
another, and therefore advised Robinson to de-
part in the first ship that sailed for America. a.

Our imprudent adventurer then took his
leave of the captain ; but, as he was going to
inquire for a ship, different ideas crowded on
his.mind. " If I now return (said be) my pa-
rents will punish me for leaving them, and my
companions will laugh at me for having seen on-
ly two or three streets in London."

On his reaching the quay, he found no ship
ready to sail for the United States; but he met
with the captain of a Guineaman, who very
kindly invited him to take a cup of tea on board
his ship, and Robinson accepted the invitation.
The consequense of this meeting was that Rob3..
l

inson agreed to go to Guinea with the captain ;
and, at that moment, he totally forgot his parents
friends, and country. >>

 

They accordingly set sail with every apper-
ance of a pleasant passage ; they had passed by
Calais, cleared the channel, and got into theAtlantic Ocean, without any accident. The
wind, however, now changed, and was so con-
trary and violent, that it blew them on the
coast of America. A

They had not sailed long on the coast, when
they heard the report of cannon; and as they
were at some distance from the land, they con-
cluded they were signals of some ship in distress.
They therefore steered their course towards the
report of the guns, and soon discovered, by a
flame at a distance, that it was a ship on fire.
which soon blew up, and nothing more was
heard or seen of her. The captain however,
lientjhis course that way, and continued his signals
hoping he might thereby pick up some of the
crew, who had probably taken to their boats.
It fortunately so happened, that the'crew of the
unfortunate ship, directed by the signal guns
of the Guineaman, came up with her and were
all saved.

Robinson during this interval was troubled
with the most frightful ideas. "Heaven! ( said
he to himself.) if these peeple, among whom
there must be some virtuous characters, have
experienced so great a misfortune, what ought I
not to expect ? I, who have acted with so much
ingratitude to my kind parents!"

The good and generous captain, having safe-
ly conveyed to Newfoundland the people he had
saved, pursued his voyage to Guinea with 8. {ac
vorable wind and arrived safe at Madeira, carry-
ing with him thither the crew of another ship he
had met with in the greatest distress.Q

As the captain was obliged to stop here some
time, in order to repair his ship, which had been
damaged by the storm, Robinson in a few days,
began to be tired of inactivity, and wished for
wings that he might as quick as thought fly over
the whole universe. ' -

About this time a Portuguese ship arrived
from Lisbon, bound to Brazil ; and ' Robinson
getting acquainted with the captain, heard him
talk so much of gold and precious stones, that
he conceived the most ardent desire to go there,
and load his pockets with those valuable articles.

 

-- Robinson, finding that the Portuguese captain
was willing to take him without any pecuniary
consideration, took akind leave of his friend,
went on board the Portuguese ship, and sailed
for the Brazils.

The voyage proved agreeable for several
days ; at last, a violent storm blew from the
south east. _

a After weathering the storm seven days a sail-

or cried out with excess of joy, that he saw land,
which brought every one on deck, This joy how-
ever was of short duration ; for they ran upon a

 

bed of sand, where they remained fixed, and ex-
posed to the furious wavem which rolled over the
ship in vast bodies.
All on a sudden the cry was general that the
ship was filling with water. Every one instantly
flew upon deck, the long boat was handed out
with incredible haste, and every one endea-
vouring who should first get in. The boat was
so loaded, that it was easy to foresee, that it
would never reach the shore, which was at a
considerable distance. In fact a monstrous wave
was seen rolling towards them which buried
them all in the bosom of the deep.

The boat being thus overset, Robinson and
the rest of the ship 8 company were eXposed to
the mercy of the ocean; but the same wave that
overset them carried Crusoe with it and threw
him on the shore. He was thrown against a
peice of rock with such violence that the pain a-
woke him from the swoon into which terror had
thrown him. He Opened his eyes, and seeing
himself upon land, be exerted all his efforts to
gain the height of the shore.

Scarcely had be accomplished that end, when
his weakness overcome him. and he remained
for some time insensible. When he again recov-
ered himself, he rose to look round. Good God,
what a sight! The ship, the boat and his com-
panions had all disap peared! Nothing remained
but a few planks of pthe ship which the waves
had thrown on shore. Himself was the only
one who had escaped death.

Trembling with joy and fear he threw himself
on his knees, lifted up his hands towards heaven
and 1n aloud voice. accompanied with atorrent12
of tears thanked the God of Heaven and Earth
who had so miraculously saved him.

As soon as the emotion of his joy was a little
abated he began to reflect on his present situa-
tion.

Weary and fatigued, he wished to find some
place, in which he might enjoy a little repose;
but no hut was in view, nor could he find any
apartment so secure as that of the birds, who
pass their evenings in the trees. He clamhered
up into one, and there passed the night, having
preperly secured himself from falling while a-
sleep.

In the morning he decended from the tree in
search 'of food, having eaten nothing the pre-
ceeding day , but his "searches were vain, no-
thing presented itself that the human stomach
could digest. He threw himself on the ground,
shed a torrent of tears, and wished he had per-
ished in the sea, rather than left to die a mis--
erable death by famine.

He was now forming in his mind by what
means he should put an end to his miserable
existence, without waiting the tediousness of
dying with hunger, when turning himself, he saw
a sea falcon devouring a fish he had taken.
Saying to himself, " lf God furnishes these birds
with food, he will not suffer me to die with hun-
ger." This idea renewed his spirits, he and ex-
erted himself to walk along the sea shore.

At last perceiving some shells lying on the sand,
he ran to them, and to his inexpressible joy
tound they were oysters.13

Though these saved him from perishing with
hunger, yet he knew not where to take his noc-
turnal abode, secure from savages and wild
beasts, if any such were there. His last
night's lodging had been so uncomfortable that
he dreaded repeating the experiment. "What
will it serve (said he to himself) that I have es-
caped the fury of the sea and have found some- '
thing to keep me from dying with hunger if I am
at last to be devoured by wild beasts?"

Amidst such sorrowful reflections as these, he
espied a mountain at some distance from him.
In his way thither he discovered, that the un-
known country in which he then was, afforded
nothing but sterile trees and grass. He with
difficulty climbed to the top of the mountain,
and from thence looking all around him, he
discovered that he was on an Island, perfectly
surrounded by the sea.

"Poor unfortunate wretch that I am ! ex-
claimed he, at the same time lifting up his trem-
bling hands to heaven. It is then true that I am
separated from all human beings, and that I must
remain here without any hopes of ever being
taken from this desert island!"

His attempts to discover a place where he
might repose in safety, were a long time ineffec-
tual -, but at last he came to a small mountain,
the front of which was as perpendicular'as a
wall. He examined this side with great atten-
tion, and found in it a little hollow place, to .
which the entrance was very narrow. ~

It?H

As he had neither pick-axe nor chisel, with
which he might easily have increased the de-
mensions of the hollow place, he set his head to
work how to supply the want of them. He ob-
served that there were several willow trees near
the Spot ; these he pulled up by the roots, with
great difficulty, in order to plant them at the en-
trance of his intended cavern, and thereby made
his habitation more comfortable and secure.

Having carried his trees to the spot. and hav-
ing no implement to dig a hole to receive the
roots, he was obliged to make use of his hands
for the purpose, which naturally so retarded the
work, that the evening approached betbre he
had planted more than five or six trees. Exer-
cise had increased his appetite. when he return-
ed to the coast to look after some oysti-rs ; but
the tide being at flood, he was obliged to retire
supperless for the night and tnade himslf con-
tented with the water he drank from the purling
stream he had discovered.

He rose the next morning at break ot'day.
when he hastened to the shore to appease his
hunger with oysters and then return to his la-
bour. Having pursued a difl'erent route this
morning. he. in his way to the shore. had the
good fortune to meet with a tree that bore large
truit. Ile indeed knew not what they were but
hoped to find them good to eat. and immediate-
ly knocked one down.

This was indeed a most glorious repast to

the half tarnished Robinson. It was the cocoa-
nnt.1;")

His empty stomach could not be contented
with one single nut, but he knocked down a
second, which he ate with the same eagerness.
His joy on this discovery filled his eyes with
tears, and lifted his hands to heaven in gratitude
The tree was very large, but it was the only one
he saw in the place.

I le carried with him some oysters to serve him
for his dinner, and went cheerfully to his la-
hour. He had collected on the borders of the
sea, some large shells, which served him Instead
of a spade, and which very much accelerated
his business. He soon afterwards discovered a
tree. the inner bark of which formed a good
substitute for cords or threads.

He then continued his work With great as-
suidity, and t-lanted tree against tree until he had
formed a strong paiisade before his intended ha-
hitation. livery night and morning he watered
his little plantation from the neighbouring rivu-
let and for that purpose made use ofthe cocoa- _
nut sh: ll lle 5mm had the pleasure to see his W's
little plantation m a thriving condition, and ref
hcautitul to the tie". "

Having hitherto succeeded to his wishes, he
hogan to think in what manner to hollow out
the little catity in the rock, so asto make it big
enough for his use. As he knew it would be in
win to attempt it with his hands alone, he set
about looking for some tool that might assist
his operation.

It was not long before he met with atlarge
and sharp stone, which not only resembled a
hatchet with a sharp edge, but had even a
hole in it to receive a handle. After repeated
trials, he fixed a handle to it, and gave it all the
appearance of the tool so much wanted. Search-
ing further among the stones, he found some
that answered the purpose of a chisel and others
that proved exellent substitutes for a mallet.

By the assistance of these tools his work was
so far advanced, in the course of a few days,
that he had made suflicient room to lie 1n com-
fortably. He collected a sufficient quantity of
grass, of which he made hay by exposing it to
the sun; and of this made his bed.

From this time nothing prevented his sleep-

ing like the rest of mankind, he frequently
thanked God for his goodness to him and
made himself happy in the reflection, that his
parents knew nothing of his distresses.

The next day being Sunday, he consecrated
it to rest, to prayer and meditation. He pass-
ed whole hours on his knees, and lifted up his
eyes, bathed in tears, to heaven. He begged
pardon for his past sins and prayed for the hap-
piness and consolation of his dear parents.

Robinson, in order that he might not forget
the order of the days, and to, know 'when Sun-
day returned, invented a new kind of Almanac.
As he had neither paper, nor any thing else to
write on, he made choice of four trees that stood
close together, and whose barks were smooth.
On the largest of the four trees be every night17

made a mark with a sharp stone, to show that
the day had passed. When seven marks had
been made, he made a stroke through them all,
and this was a mark for a week. Every time
that he had made four marks in the second tree
he knew that one month had passed, forwhich
he made one mark on the third tree. When he
had made twelve marks on the third tree, he then
made'one on the fourth. which denoted the year
being completely finished.

Necessity obliged him to make large excur-
sions into the island. in pursuit of the iudespemao
ble necessaries of life.

Robinson rose in the morning with the sun
and prepared for his tour. He hung his pouch
to a string. which he threw across his sh'olderl,
put his hatchet instead of a sword, int? hisjbelt,
and began his march. ' '

His first visit was to his cocoa tree, inorder to
furnish his pouch with two nuts. Having sup-
plied himself with this excellent provision, he
went in search of some oysters : and'being sup-
plied with these matters, to be eaten only in case.
of necessity, he took a hearty draught' of pure
water for his breakfast, and then proceded on
his journey

He kept travelling, without meeting with any
thing to reward his labour, or gratify his curi-
OSIty.

At last he came to a brook, where he resol-
ved to set down and dine. He seated'himsalf
under a large tree, whose spreading bou'gh'sat?18

Q

forded a shade to a great distance; and joyful-
ly regaled himself, But in the midst of his re-
past, and all on a sudden, a distant noise terribly
alarmed him. He looked, around him on all
sides, and at last perceived a whole troop of
savage animals approaching him, which had
some resemblance to our sheep,ex'cept that they
had a hump on their backs,. which, on that ac-
count made them resemble little camels.
These are called lama--they are beasts of bur-

den, and peculiar to some parts of South-Am-

enca.

Robinson, having killed one of these crea-
tures with his hatchet, threw it across his shoul-
ders, and was carrying it home to his cavern,
when, in his way thither, to his great joy,
he discovered seven or eight citron trees, whose
ripe film had fallen to the ground. He care-
fully collected them, and carried them home to
his habitation.

-8." With a sharp stone he skinned the lama,
whose flesh he so far roasted in the sun, as to

make it eatable; and some of his citrons squeeo
zed into water afforded him an excellent end
refi'eshing liquor. The skin he hung-up to dry,
and of this hereafter intended to make himself
shoes.

Robinson slept very soundly this night, and
was angry with himself for lying so long, He
was going out in order to make war on the
lamas, but heaven prevented; for he had no "
sooner put his head out of his cavern, than he a
was obliged to return. It rained so violently,
that the ground was covered with water and
this accompanied with the most dreadful thunder,
which broke with such violence on therrock,
that it seemed to shake it to the vervt'oundation.
This so terrified poor Crusoe. whw'lijom a want
of proper education, was naturally timid and en-
perstitious, that he ran out of hiscavern, and tell?
down in a swoon.

He remained for some time in a stateofiinsen-
sihility; but, on recovering himself,- fonnd the
rain, thunder and lightning, had ceased.

During the thunderstorm, a flash oflightning
had set fire to a large piece of wood, which had
kept homing for a considerable time. Robinson-
now rejoiced to find that he had some fine, Land
even fi'orn that very event which had before gir-
en him so much uneasiness. He immediately,
set about to keep in the fire constantly,: anilfor

that purpose built a kind of stone chimney, in '

his new habitation. He watched his fireatteno
tively, that it might not go out, so that he could
now roast the the flesh of his lamas,=in antanuer
fitfor human creatures to eat. \

As the heat was insupportahle tn Robinson' a"

island during the day, he was obliged. when he
undertook any work, to attend toit earlyin the
morning, and in the evening.

Goingoneday to the borders ofthesea toool-
lect oysters, he could find only a few, but instead
of them discovered what gave him infinitely tum:
Iatisfaction. Though he had never eatot' them20

himself, he had heard that they were wholesome
and delicious food. This was a fine large turtle
which weighed near an hundred pounds.

Robinson, with some difficulty, carried the
turtle home to his habitation, by the assistance
of his hatchet penerated the under shell, dressed
a part of it for his dinner, and made of it a most
sumptuous feast. As he could not possibly eat
it all at once, he was at loss how to preserve it
from putrefaetion.

Necessity had taught him wisdom ; and, as he
had neither tub nor salt, he set his head to work
in what manner he should preserve the delicate
food. He found the upper shell, which he had
not broken. would supply the the place of a tub
and then nothing but salt wanting.

"What a fool, I am ! said Robinson to himself
here is a plenty of sea water, and that will sup-
ply the place of salt." He filled his shell with sea
water. put the remainder of the turtle in it was
thus preserved from putrefaction.

These happy successes encouraged him to
exert his genius in greater attempts. Wishing
to have some living animal about him, and the
lamas were the only animate hein'g except the
spider, which he had seen on this island. But
- how he should get a pair of them alive into his
possession was a great difficulty to surmount.
He determined to form one of his cords into a
noose, and throw over the head of the first lama
that should approach him.

He rose next mornrg early, and having furnish-
~

ed himselt'with his hatchet, 'provisiuns, and other
things necessary, he proceeded in his desxgn

catching lamas alive.

 

In course of his journey. he saw a pit at. adie-
tance, and advancing up to it'. he found it'. fun
of a white substance.' How shall I express his

0.22

joy when, on tasting it, he found it tobe excellent
salt! he instantly'filled all his pockets with it.
This dieovery gave fresh spirits to Robinson, and
he he hastened to the spot where he hoped to
trap alama.

It was not long before he ensnared a female
lama, which had two young ones, who, seeing
their dam ensnared .came up, without any ap-
pearance oflear. to Robinson, and licked his
hands. meaning thereby, perhaps, that they wish-
their dam to be set at liberty.

Robinson then dragged the old lama to his ha-
bitation. and then the two young ones of course
followed her On his arrival at his hut, he form-
ed a little stall with stones into which he put the
lama and her young ones. It is impossible to ex-
press the joy Robinson felt on having three li-
ving companions, even though they were not hu-
man. ,

He had reason to lament that he had hitherto
discovered only one cocoa-tree, and could not
help reflecting within himself, what were the e-
vil. consequences of his having learned nothing
useful in his early days that might improve his
invention. However, determined to make an
experiment, he made a short slit in the bark of
some of the most florishing trees, havingfirst cut
off the heads of them, then introduced into. the
slit so made, young suckers ol the cocoaotree;
then closed the bark nicely, and bounditrou'nd
tightly. He waited with some degree zofihpe-
tience,to see what would be mg" of thine:-

be determined therefore to proceed on his tour;
the next morning he loaded One of his lamas with
four days provisions, equipped himself, and hav-
ing implored the divine protection, set out on his
journey. '

He had reached the centre of the island when
he saw the'impressious of human feet on the
sand, at which he grew pale and motionless,
concluding that if there were inhabitants on the
island, they could be only savages or canibals,

not less to be dreaded than the beastsof the for-'

est. A little farther he discovered a pit which
were evident marks of a fire extinguished, and
about it were scatered the hands and feet,'sculls
and other bones of human creatures, the re-
mains of a horrible and unnatural repeat.

He returned home and put his habitation in

the best state of defence, and cut a subterraneons>>

passage from his house, through which he might
escape in case of an attack.

Some years paged without anything material .. ._,'l'

occurring. One clear and serene morning,
he perceived a smoke rising at a distalifi'; his
fright was followed by curiosity, and he hasten-
ed to the top of the hill at the foot of which was

I pared for a feast. The other captive, while the
savages were butchering his companion, took
to flight, and ran with great swiftness near to
Robinson's habitation.

Robinson descended the tree and proceeded
to the spot where the fugitive had concealed him-
self. Robinson made signs for him to follow
him. which he did with evident marks of fear.
In a little time the fears of the Indian were re-
moved. and he made Robinson to understand
that he was willng to become his slave , but our
hero wanted a friend rather than a slave; for
though he understood not the language of the
Indian,he was charmed with the sound of a hu~
man voice, to which he had long been a stranger

As this affair happened on a F riday, Robinson
gave to his companion the name of F away.
He gave him a skin to cover himself with. and
made him set down by him. Friday obeyed in
the most respectful manner: offering a lance to
Robinson. and holding the point to his own
breast, in token of absolute submission to his
will.

Now Robinson was truly become a king, the
island was his kingdom, his lamas his fruits and
his treasures. a parrot his courtier, who was in.
capable of acting the part of a sycophant, and
Friday his faithful'se'bject.

Robinson. ever since his arrival on this island
had experienced no felicity like'the present; all
his fears centred in the idea, that the savages
might return in quest of their victim, and de--

molish his habitation.
("2 r ,w. --'i --~' _'-'.' ' '
. 26

lletherefore set about making his cottage as
strong as possible, by throwing up entrenchments
around it, and t'ortifying it. with all the methods
he could devise. During this time. Robinson
endeavored to learn Friday something of the
english language, and the man seemed no less
desrrous. In less than six months he made
such progress, that he could make himself tol-
erably well understood. '

One morning as Robinson was walking to-
wardsthe sea shore, he was much pleased with
the sight of a ship, though at a great distance.
Robinson soon perceived her to be an American
vessel, which was steering for the island, and
soon came to an anchor. Surprise, fear, and joy,
seized Robinson by turns, as also his attendant,
Friday. The sight of a vessel, which might
take him off that island, gave him joy; but this
succeeded by surprise and fear, because he could
not comprehend the motive that could bring a
ship on those coasts; but supposed that she
must have been driven out of her course by tern-
pestuous and contrary winds. This turned out
as Robinson supposed; they cast anchor near the
island, and sent lllctl' boat on shore in search of
fresh water, and were much surprised at finding a
white man on an island in so desolute a part of
the globe. Robinson was quite overjoyed at the
proSpect he now had of once more returning to
his native home and the great pleasure he enjoy-
ed in the company and conversation of man,
{rum whom he had been so long separated.27

After taking in a small supply of water, they set
off for the ship, with Robinson and his compan--
ion. The next day they again went on shore for

more water: Robinsun now tuck from his ca~
bin such things as he thought might be useful
to him on the passage; he then took a last'28

farewell of his habitation, and the water easks
" being filled they all returned on board, and t he
ship sailed. '

A favourable voyage at length brqught him
within sight of his native country, and the heart

 

of Robinson was expanded with ; joy when, sud-
.denly a violent tempest arose which in spite'of
all the efforts of the seamen, drove the ship on a
sand bank, and forced away the keel and part of
the hold. The water rushed in with such vio-
lence, that the only chance of escaping was in
