SCENE L
REpresents the habitation of Robin-
son Crusoe. c< A tent under the side
€C of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale
*< of posts and cables, with a kind of wall
€C of turfs, and after he had been there
<c about a year and a half, he raised rafters
"from it, leaning on the rock, and thatche-
s' ed and coyered it with trees, and such
cc things as he could get to keep out the
"rain."—Robinson Crusoe describes the
situation in these words:
cc In search of a place proper for this. I found a lit-
cc tie plain on the side of a rising hill, whose form to-
*c wards this plain was as steep as an house-side, so that
cc nothing, could come down Upon me, from the top:
"op the side of this rock there was an hollow place,
£ Wpp* $ little way in, like tlie entrance or door of a
« cave!
( 6 )
«
*cave, feut there wasTIot really any caVS dr way 1nw
*l tjbie rock at all.
cc On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch *ny tent; but first I drew an
a half-circle before the hollow place, in which I pitched
, "two rows .of strong stakes, and then laid the pieces of
"cable which I had cut in the ship, in rows upon one
.^imotfier, .within t\œ circle, apd t$t>veen tljose two
"row$ of flakes, facing othersin the 'W&dv leiming
^against them, and this fence was so strong, that
"neither man nor beast could get into it, or over it.
tt This cost me a great deal of time and labour, efpe-
<c daily to cut tiic piles4riHJ»e wood) -bring them to the
K place, and drive them into the earth."

(?)
**• sketch of my figure, as follows: I had a great^higfi
"shapeless cap, made df goat's -skin with a flap hanging
"down behind, as well to keep the fun from me, as to
"slioot the rain off my nsck.
"I had a short jacket of goatVfkin, the skirts coming
fc 4ownto about the middle of my thighs; and a pair
"of open- kneed breeches qf the fame: The breeches
*c were made of an old skin whose hair hung down such
€c a length on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reach-
"ed to the middle of my legs. Stockings and (hoes I
<c had none; but I had made me a pair of something, I
44 scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to flap
« over my legs, and lace on either side like fpatterdathes *
<c but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the
k<c rest of mycloathes.
*€ I had on a broad belt of goat's-sldn'clried, which I
u 4rew together with two thongs of the fame, instead of
"buckles; and in a kind of frog on either side of this*
€t instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and
;** an hatchet, one on ohe side, one on the other* I
<€ had another belt not so broad and fastened in the same
"manner, which hung over my shoulder ; and at the
€C end of it under my left arm, hung two pouches, both
** made of goat's-skin too, in one of which hung my
".powder, in the other my shot; At my back 1 car-
<€ ried a great clumsy ugly goat-skin umbrella, but
€i which, after all, was the most neceslary thing I had
4< about me, next to my gun:—My beard I had once
*€ suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a yard
*c long 5 but as I had both scissars and razors sufficient,
** I had cut it pretty short except what grew on my up-
^c per lip, which 1 had trimmed into a large pair ot Ma-
<c hometan whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some
iC Turks whom I saw at Sallee; for the Moors did not
<c Wear such, though the Turks did: Of these musta-
«« chios, or, whiskers, I will not fay they were Jong
:?*eoough to hang my hat upon themj but they were of
'length
|c length and shape monstrous enough, and such as iiJ
** England woultWiavepasted for frightfUL"
In this first: scene also is exhibited the
melancholy way in which this desolate ma-
riner contrived, by a wooden calendar, to
keep anr account of his silent solitary life,
"After I had ticen there about teri or twelve, days, it
<c came into my thoughts that I should lose my reckon:-
u ing of time for want of books, and pen and ink, and
** should even forget the Sabbath days from the working
<c days: But to prevent this, I cut it with mykhife upon
<c a large post in capital letters; and making it into a
"great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first land-
"ed, viz, / came onjbore here the %Qth of September^
"1659. Upon the sides of this square post I cut every
<c day a notdi with my knife, and every seventh day
** was as long again as that long one; and thus I kept
u my calendar of weekly, monthly, or yearly reckoning
« of time"
And here is also introduced the interest-
ing circumstance of the parrot's return.
c* I got over the fence, and laid me down in the (hade
*' to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep;
<c But judge you, if yoi| can, that read my story, what
* a surprise I must be in, when I heard a voice calling
** me by my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin
<c Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe!
'<c At first I thought it had been a.dream, and started,
« up in the utmost consternation; But Isoon saw mv
a Pol sitting on the top of the hedge, and immediately
"knew that this was he that spoke to me; for just m <
"such bemoaning language I had used to talk to him
w and teach him.
"However; even though I knew it wa$ the parrot, it
"was a good while before I could compose myself. But
"as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest
u Pol, I got it over; and holding out my haslfl, and
"calling him by his name, Pol, the social creature came
<c to me, and tet upon my thumb, just as if he had
<c been overjoyed to fee me again ^ and so I carried him
c* home along with me," »
SCENE II.
Is a view of the grove near the sea-shore,
where Robinson Cruioe worked on two
boats. His long labour and final disap-
pointment in the first are thus feelingly
described:
<* I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool
*c that ever man did, who had any of his fenses awake*
"I pleased myself with the design, without determining
"whether 1-was able to undertake it; not but that the
* difficulty of launching my boat came often into my
*' head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it
*c by this foolish answer, which I gave myself 5 let me
"fir/l make it> Til warrant I'll fad some way or other
**> 10 get it along, when it is done.
B «Thi*
( I<? )>
v^4 p"hisf Was ra rrfoi prepdsterouS method 5 but the
CCJ eagerness of fny fancy prevailed, and to work I went,
u and felled a cedar tree: I question much whether So-*
<c lomon ever had such an one for the building the
€f> temple at Jerusalem*; it was five feet ten inches dia-
<c meter if she lower part next the stump, and four feet
tC eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
<c after Miich it lessened for a while^ and then parted into
tc branches: it was not without infinite labour that I
cc felled this tree: I was twenty days hacking andhew-
*<cingat it at the bottom; 1 was fourteen days more
c* getting the branches, limbs, and the vast spreading
<c head of it cut off: which I hacked and hewed through
"with my ax and hatchet, an expressible labojur: after
"this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it to pro-
"portion, and to something like the bottom of a boat,
41 that it might swim upright as it ought to do. It cost
u me near three months more to. clear the inside, and
"work it out so, * as to- make ah exact: boat of it: this
<c I did indeed without fire, by mere mallet and chissel,
<c and by the dint of hard labour; till I had brought
cc it to be a ^erj .handsome Periagua, and big enough to
a have carried fix and* twenty, men, and consequently
'* big enough to have carried* nie and all i^iy cargo.
cc When I had gone through t.his Work, I was ex-
cc tremely delighted with it: the boat was really much
<c bigger than I ever saw a Canoe or periagU%>that wa$
"made of one tree, in my life; many a weary stroke it
"cost you may be sure, for there remained nothing but
*< to get it into the water; I make no question bxit I
IC should have begun the madest voyage^ and the most
u unlikely to be performed, that ever was undertaken,
"But all my devices to get it into the water failed me^
u though they cost infinite jabour too; it lay about
u one hundred yards from the water, and not more 5
H but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill to*
l( wards the creek: to take av^ay this discouragement*
"Ire-
C ** )
u I resolved to dig into the surface £s t^e^u*^ |fid so
u make a declivity j this I i>egfin, and k?cpflt',cp^ipp^
"digiousdeal of, painst»twt when,this yyas/worked
cc through^ and this difficulty nranaged,rjt ,w^s still
fC much at on$> for I could no more sti^the fcanoej
u than I could the pthff1* boat, 5 so at length,- though
u with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.''
cc This grieved *me h^rtily, and now I saw, thpugh
cc too late, the folly of, beginning a work before we
"count the cost, and before we judge right of otij: owrt
u strength to go through with it."
His more successful work is thus re*
lated:
"Besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour of
*c going out with my gun, I had one labour to make me
u a cslnoe, which at last I finished: So that by digging a
*c canal to it fix feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought
"it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first,
<c that was so vastly big, as I made it without consider-
"ing beforehand, as I ought to dp, how I should be
cc able to launch it; so never being able to bring it to the
"water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let
<c it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to
"be wiser next time."
During his workitig bn this canoe, the
first terrof of the Savages breaks in on his
mind, from the, following circumstance/
so pathetically told. .\
B*S '' '—:->", £Jt
%
cl It happened one day about noon, going towardsr
*f ttjy canoe I was exceedingly surprised with the print
u of a niin's naked foot oh the shore, which was very
€t plaiiily seen in the sand: I stood like one thunder-struck,
<c or as if I had seen an apparition; 1 listened, Hooked
*c round me, I could hear nothing, nor see any thing: I
<c went up to a rising ground to look farther: I went up
€t the shore and down the shore, but it was all one, I
€t could fee no other impression but that one: I went to
u it again to fee if there were any stiore, and to observe
* if it might not be my fancy j but there was no room
<c for that, for there was exactly the very print of a
<• foot, toes, heel, and every part of a foot; how it
€i came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least ima-
gine. But after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a
"<c man perfectly confused and out of myself I came
<c hdme to my fortification, not feeling, as we fay, the
<c ground I went on, but terrified to the last degree,
<c looking behind me at every two or three steps, mis-
<c taking every bush or tree, and fancying every stump
<c at a distance to be a man; nor is it possible to describe
<c how many various shapes an affrighted imagination
•c< represented things to me inj how many wild ideas
"were formed every moment in my fancy, and what
<c strange, unaccountable whimsies came into my
"thoughts by the way,"
SCENE III.
Represents the arrival of the Savages,
in their canoes, with their prisoners, and
among the rest was Friday, whose escape
and refuge is thus described;
"I was
€<
tt I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
<c ledge) when I perceived him to run my way; and
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued by
cc by the whole body: However, I kept my station, and
"my spirits began to recover, when I found that there
*c was not above three men that followed him; and
<l still more was I encouraged when I found he out-
"stripped them exceedingly in running, and gained
"ground of them, so that if he -could but hold it for
"half an hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away
"from .them all."
SC&NE IV.
Changes again to the view of the boats,
where Robinson Crusoe first sees Friday*
It is thus described:
c< It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and
"indeed irresistible, that now was my time to get me a
cc servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, and
tL that I was called plainly by Providence to save this
u poor creature's life; so I immediately clapped my-
*< self in the way between the pursuers and pursued,
c* hollooing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back,
c« was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as at
<c them j but I beckoned with my hand to him to come
ie back. I was loth to fire, because I would not have
"the rest hear; and being out of sight of the smoke
"too, they would not have easily known what to make
*f Qf it, The poor savage^ though he saw all his ene-
"mies
*c itues fly, yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of
"my gun, that he stood stock-still, and neither came
<c forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather
"inclined to fly still, than to come on.v I made signs
cc to come forward, which he easily understood, and
lc came a little way, and then stopped again, and I
<c could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he
<c was taken prisoner* I beckoned him again tp come
<c to me, and gave him all the signs of encdufagement
"that I could think of; and he came nearer and dearer,
<c kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
cc acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled at him,
cc and looked pleasantly, and beckoned hirn to come
"still nearer. At length he came close to me, and then
cc he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid
"his head upon the ground, and taking me by the
cc' foot, set my foot upon his head: This, it seems,
<c was in token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I
cc I took him up, and made much of him, and encou-
"raged him all I could."
SCENE V,
Is the Bower of Robinson Crusoe, where
he first carried Friday, as safer than making
an immediate discovery to him of his Cave,
This, his second plantation, was of a dif-
ferent nature from his fortified tent. It is
thus described;
"Besides this, I had niy country-seat, and I had now
"a tolerable plantation there also; for first, I had my
"little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair 5 that
"is to fay, I kept the hedge which circled it in, con-
<c stantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder stand-
c< ing always in the inside; I kept the trees, which at
"first were no more than my stakes, but were now
*c grown very firm and tall, and herp, whenever I had
"occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up
M my country habitation.
The inclosures for his cattle are here
exhibited;
cc Adjoining to this I had my inclosures for my cattle,
cc that is to fay, my goats: and as I had taken an incon-
*c ceivable deal of pains to fence and inclose this ground,
** I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, least the goats
"should break through, that I never lest off, till with
a infinite labour I had stuck the outside of the hed^e
a so full of small stakes, and so near to one another,
<c that it was rather a pale than an hedge, and there
"was scarce room to put an hand through between
cc them; which afterwards, when those stakes grew,
cc as they all did in the next rainy season, made the in-
^c closure strong, like a wall -, indeed stronger than any
*< wall.
u In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
"<rI principally depended on for my winter store of rai-
'**' sins, and which I never failed to preserve very care-
"fully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my
"whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable only,
k but physical, wholsome, nourishing and refreshing to
V {he last degree,"
SCENE
SCENE VI.
Is the arrival of Savages a second time,
^slth more prisoners,
SCENE VII.
Is a view of the Savages round their
fire.—
cc I was surprised with seeing a light
cc upon the shore—and terrified at the
cc sight—I loaded my muskets and all my
fC pistols.— The naked Savages sitting
"round a small fire they had made, not
cc to warm them, for they had no need
V of that, but to prepare the barbarous
cc diet of human flesh, which they had
<c brought with them."—Friday's tenw
is thus described;
cc Friday flew over my outward wall, or fence, lik$
f ong that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his
"feet
£L
** Feet on: I heartened him up as well as I could;
u however, I saw the poQ& fellow most terribly scared*
cc for nothing ran in his head but that they were come
tc to look for him, arid would cut him in pieces and eat
*c him; the poor fellow trembled so that I scarce knew
*c what to do with him: I comforted him as well as I
"could, and told him that I was in as much danger as
u he, for. that they would esat rhe ks well as him.
"I took ffrst and divided the arms which I had
tc charged, as before, between us: I gave Friday otie
u pistol to stick in his girdle, and thtee guns upon his
"slioulder; and I took one pistols and the other thnte
<c myself j and in this posture we marched out.
"I entered the wood, and with all possible wariness
*c and silence (Friday following close at my heels) I
u mardied till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the
"side which was next to them; only that one corner of
ic the wood lay between me and them: here I called
"softly to Friday, and shewing him a great tree, which
<c was just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to
"the- tree arid bring me word if he coiild fee there
sC plainly what they were doing i he did so, and came
"immediately to me, and told me they might be plainly
"viewed there 5 that they were all about the fire, eating
"the flesh of one of their prisoners; and that another
tc lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, whom
u he said they would kill next, and which fired the very
"soul within me. He told me it was not one of their
*c nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had
"told me of, who cairie to their country in the boat.
*c I was filled with horror at the very naming the white-
"bearded man, and going to the tree, I saw plainly by
ki my glassy a white man, who lay upon tie beach of
"the sea, with his hands and feet tied With flags, or
"things like rushes; and that he was an Europeaa
u and had cloathes on.
 . .' C "Ihad
( iB J
« I had now hot a moment to lose; so I set <fowft
H one of the muskets and the fowling piece upon thtf
cc ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with
u the other musket I took my aim at the Savages, bid-
a ding him do the like. Then asking if he was ready,
"he said yes. Then fire at them, said 1; and the
"same moment I fired also. They were in a dreadful
"consternation 5 and all of them, who were not hurt^
<c jumped up upon their feet immediately, but did not
** know which way to run or which way to look j for
cc they knew* not from whence their destruction came.
<c Upon which I rushed out of the wood and shewed
<c myself, and Friday close at my feet: I made directly
cc tbwgrds the poor victim, who was lying upon the
"beach. I pulled out my knife and cut the flags that
K bound him, and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted
"him up, making signs that he should drink -r and I
"gave him bread, which he eat."
In this scene the plan that Robinson
Crusoe followed- to .surprize the Savages,,
and the assistance that Friday gave to*
rescue the victim, are conformable to the
history*
SCENE TIIL
Represents the inside of Robinson*
Crusoe's cave, with the furniture, and
the various contrivances he formed for
supplying his wants.
*c Had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a ge-
*c neral magazine of all necessary things, and I had
«< every thing so ready at my hand, that it was a great 4
cc pleasure to me to see all my goods in such-order,
« and especially to iind my slock of all necessaries so
*' great.
cc I made me a table and a chair, in the first place,
cc and this I did out of the short pieces of boards that
** I brought on my raft from the ship:. but when I
<c had wrought out some boards, I made large shelves
u of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another,
ic all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
"nails, and iron-work, and in a word, to separate eve**
"ry thing at large in their place6, that I might easily
*c come at them; also I knocked pieces into the wall of
« the rock to hang my guns, and all things that would
** hangup."
During this scene, the found of signal
guns gives the first notice of some ship's
having approached the island; and in the
ninth scene, Robinson Crusoe, Friday, &c.
pass the stage towards the fea-sliore.
SCENE X.
Discovers the English ship at anchor
near the island—Theory relates it thus:
»
cc I cannot express the confusion I was in, at the joy
* Vf feeing a ship, and. one, which I had reason to
0 2 « believe,
* believe, was itianned by my own countrymen. •. .\ T
c When the bdat drew near the shore, I saw* it con*
t#tained eleven men, whereof three of them were
c unarmed, and bound; and when the first four or"
five of them had jumped on shore, they took those
three out of the boat as prisoners: one of the three
I could perceive usi#g the most passionate gestures of
iqtreaty, affliction, and despair. The other two
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared con-
cerned, but not to so violent a degfee. After the
outrageous usage of the sailors, I observed they ran
talking about the island, while the three others had
liberty to go where they pleased: and while the sail-'
ors; rambled aboyt, they had carelessly staid till the
tide was ebbed away, and their boat aground. At'
the time they were rambling about, or laid down to
sleep, the three distressed men were anxious to. take
reft—I resolved to take this time to discover myself to
them, and learn something of their condition. At
first they started at my appearance, and w^re con-
founded 4 my unaccountable figure 5 but observing
my gestures, they fell at my feet, and disclosed their
misfortunes explaining tome, that the crew of the
{hip had mutinied against them. Our cafe, Sir,
said their Jeader, is" this:—I was*commanderof£hat
stiip; my men having mutinied against me, they
have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me,
and at last have set me on shore in this desolate place,
with these two men with me, one my mate, the ,
other a passengef. After*!his explanation, I condi-*
tioned with them to obey"my commands, and in cafe
of their preservation, and the recovery os the stiip, tq
Sf carty me and my man Friday to ^gland/' "^
SCENE
SCENE XL
Represents a woody; part of the islands
when Robinson Crusoe enters with Friday,
and dispatches him to observe the rest of
the crew, who had now landed in quest of
their companions,
*' Those who last came, set up two or three great
"(hoots—hallooing with all their might, to try if they
*c could make the rest hear. I ordered Friday and the
cc Captain's mate to go over the creek to the westward;
"and as soon as they came to a little rising ground, 1*
u bade them halloo as loud as they could, and wait till
<c they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as
<c they did, they (hoqld return it again, and then keep-
"ing out of sight, takearpund, always answering when
<c the others hallood, to draw them as far into the
*c island, and among the woods, as possible, and then
c* wheel about to me by such ways as I described. Fri-
"day and the mate managed their business so wel],
cc that they drew them by hallooing and answering from
*c one to another, till they not only heartily tired them,
*c but brought them where they could not find their
*c way back. We had nothing now to do but to watch
*c them in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to
# make sure work; but to be more certain, I drew my
H my ambuscade nearer, till, in a word, they all laid
tf dov^n their arms, and begged their, lives/'
