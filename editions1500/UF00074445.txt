ran away from home. He went to a seaport,
and then on board a big ship to learn to be a sailor.
The captain liked him, and he made several voyages,
without any serious ill luck, Until he became a man. _

He then sailed on'a ship that was going to Africa.
Before they were out many days a great storm came up,
and the ship was driven on the rocks and wrecked.
Everybody was drowned except Robinson Crusoe, and
he was thrown upon the beach almost dead. When he
was able to walk, he went up on a hill, and found he
was 'on an island, with no sign of other inhabitants.

about getting some ashore. He
made a raft of some planks, and
saved all he could from the ship
before she went to pieces. His
next task 'was. to make a place
to live in. He found a cave,
and around the entrance
he drove a row of piles, to
get over which he had

to use a ladder. This
he called his Castle.

After this he made
a table and chair,
. and some other use-
ful things. Often, he
_ went about the island
with his gun. and shot birds and wild goats, whose flesh
he used for. food. He also caught aparrot alive; this,
and raxdog. and two cats that had been on board the
ship, were his only companions. At last he thought
he would capture some goats, and they would supply
him, with milk as well as: meat. and clothing besides,
for hecould make garments out of their skins. He
also Wished to make a canoe, and. after a "great deal of
labor, he cut down a-large tree, and Shaped a boat out
of it.. With this he could sail around the island. After
- many. yearshad passed, Robinson Crusoe, one day, saw
the prints of naked feet in the sand on the shore; these
tracks were made by savages. Not long after, he-saw
smoke at a distance, and very soon a lot of savages
gathered about a fire. They killed one of two mem.

who lay bound on the ground, and placed the body on
the fire to cook. While they were busy, the other man
managed to free himself, and ran straight to Robinson
Crusoe. He decided to try to save him, and fired his
gun at the men when they came near enough.

One was killed; 'the others ran to their canoes,
and paddled away. The captive fell on his knees
before Crusoe, who took him with him to his Castle.
He taught him a little English,;.-and named him Friday
----as it was on that day he saved- his life. He soon be-
came a pleasant companion, as .well as a useful servant.

Nearly two years passed before they saw any more
savages. One morning, Friday came running in, to
tell Crusoe that a- large number had landed with some
captives, whom they had begun to kill and eat.

Robinson Crusoe armed- 'himself and Friday,
and both went to attack the savages. They killed
several, and the rest-were so. frightened that they fled
to their canoes, leaving on the ground a prisoner
whom they had notkilled: Crusoe saw that he was
a white man, and set him free.' .Friday found another
captive in a canoe which the savages had
left behind. This '
was an old man,
and, when Friday
looked in his face,
he saw that- it was.
