1803.PREFACE j

 

F ever the {tory of any private man's adven-

tures in the world were worth making pub-
lic, and were acceptable when pubiifhed, the-
Editor of this account thinks this will be fo.

The wonders of this man's life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant ; the
life of one man being fcarce capable of a great-
er variety. .

The t'rory is told with modefty, with fe-
rioufnefs, and with a religious application of
events to the ufes to which wife men always
apply them, viz. to the infiruetion. of others
by this example, and tojufiify and honourthe
wifdom of Providence in allthe variety of our
circumfiances, let them happen how they will.

The Editor believes the thing to be a j'ufi;
hiilory of fact ; neither is there any appear-
ance of fiction in it: And thoughhe is. well
aware there are many, who on account of the
very fingular prefervations the author met
with, will give it the name of a romance ;-
yet, in whichever of thefe lights it {hall be
viewed he imagines, that the improvement .
of it, as well to the diverfion as to the in-
firuetion of the reader, will be the fame; and,
as fuch, he thinks, without farther compli-
ment to the world, he does them a great fer- ' ,
vice in the publication.. .

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

ROBINSON CR 0303.13

N the year 1632 I was born at York, of a reputu
able family. My father was a native of Bre- -
men, who, merchandifing at Hull for fame time',
gained a very plentiful fortune, and married my mo-
ther in York, who received her firfl: breath in that
country; and as her maiden name was Robinfon, I
was called Robinfon Kreutznaer, which not being
eafily pronounced in the Englifh tongue, we are
commonly known by the name of Crufoe. -- ,
I was the youngefi; of three brothers; the ddefl:
was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart's regiment, but
flain by the Spaniards; Wh'at became of the other I'
could never learn. - .
No charge nor pains were wanting in my educa-
tion,'1'ny father defigning me for the law; yet ne'-

0
thing would ferve me but I mull go to fea, both
again'lt the will 'of'my father, the tears of my mother,
and the entrcaties of my friends. One morning my
father expellulated very warmly with me : Says he,
What reafon have you to leave your native country,
where there mutt be a more certain prol'peet of con-
tent and happinefs, than to enter into a wandering
conditibn-'of uneafinefs and uncertainty? He recom-
mended to me Agar's with, trait/oer to (If/Ire adverflty
nor ric/m ; that a middle time of life was the moll:
happy ; and that the high towering thoughts of rail-
ing our condition by wandering abroad, were fur-
rounded with mifery and danger, and often ended
with confulion and difirppoi'ntment: Ientreat you,
nay I command you, lays he, to delii't from thefe in-
tentions; contider your eldelt brother who laid down
his life for his honour, or rather loft it for his dif-
obedience to my will. If you will go, added he, my
prayers however {hall be offered for your preferva-
tion ; but a time may come, when, defolate, opprelled,
or forfaken, you may will: you had taken your poor de-
fpifed father's counfel.----He pronounced thefe words
with fueh .a moving and paternal eloquence, while
floods of tears ran down his aged checks, that {cem-
ed to item the torrent of my refolutions.
But this wore otl' foon, and a little after I informed
my mother that I could not fettle to any hulinefs,
my refolutions were fo {trong to fee the world, and
begged {he would gain my father's confent only to
go one voyage, which if it did not prove profperous
I would never attempt a fecond ; but my delire
was as vain as my folly in alking : My mother pal:-
fionately exprefled her diflike of this propofal, telling
me, That a: fit fine I was be"! upon my own alc-
flruflion, contrary to Ibeir will and my d"'y>>]/'" wood?
szy no more, but leave me to my] , to do w Jag/5w" I

plea/ed.

I was then, I think, nineteen years old, when
"one time being at Hull, I met a {drool-fellow of
mine, going along with his father, who was malier
of a fillp, to London; and acquainting him with my
wandering defires, he afl'ured me of my free paii'age,
and a plentiful {hare of what was necefl'ary. Thus,
without imploring a blefling, or taking a farewell of
my parents, I took {hipping on-the firll: of September
1651; when our {hip having no fooner left the
Humber a-ltern, but there arofe fuch aviolent florm,
and being extremely {ea-lick, I thought the judg-
ments of God defervedly followed me for my dif-
obedience to my dear parents. It was then only
I called to mind the good advice of' my father,
how eafy and comfortable was a middle [tare of life -,
and if it plea'fed God to fet me on dry land once
more, I would return to my parents, implore their
forgivenefs, and bid a final adieu to my wandering
inclinations.
:\ Such were my thoughts while the Pcorm conti-
! nued; but thefe good refolutions decneafed with the
: danger ; more efpecially when my companion came
to me, clapping me on the {boulden W/mt, Boo!

' Upon the fixth day we came to an anchor in
Harwieh road, where we lay wind-bound with fome
Newcafile _lhips,_ and there being good anchorage,
and our cables'found, thefeamen forget their late
toil and danger, and {pent their time as merry as if
they had been on ihore ; but on the eighth day there
arofe fueh a brill: gale of wind, which prevented
our tiding it up the river, and iii" increaling, our
{hip rid forecalile in, having {hipped feveral large
feas. ' ' .
' It was n6t long before horror feized the feamen
themfelves, when Iheard the mailer exprefs this the:-

dreadful apprehenlions among us of our fpeedy-fate
made me get up upon deck,and therel was dreadfully
affrighted indeed; the feat went niountainshigh; I
could fee nothing but diflrefs around us; two. {hips
had cut their malts on board, and another was foun-
dered; two more that had loft their anchors were
forced out to the mercy of the ocean; and to fave
our lives, we were forced to- cut our foremali. and
maimnafl quite away.

_ When I; had been at Yarmouth three days,.I met
my old companion, who had given me the-invitation
to go on board along with his father. His behaviour.
and fpeech was altered, and in a melancholy manner;
afked me how I did, telling his father who I was,
and how I had made this voyage for a trial only to
proceed farther abroad ; upon which the old-gentle-
man, turning to me gravely, faid, 1" oung man, you
ought ueverto go to/ea any more, but to take flairfor a
eertaiuflgn tloat you will never pro/per in a flafariug
audition. Sir, aufwered I, will you take the fame

you go to yea ? Upon which, I very freely declared
my whole flow, at the- endof which he made this
exclamation, Ye facred powers l .what had I'corna
mitted, that fuch a wretch lhould enter into. my,
fhip, to heap upon me- fuch a deluge of miferies!

parted.
I thought at firft to .return home, but {hame op;

pofed that good motion, as thinking I, {houldt be
laughed at by my neighboursand acquaintance. So
flra'nge is the nature of youth, who are not afhamed
to fin, but yet alhamed to repent ; and. far from be-
ing alhamed of thofe ae'tions forwhichthey may 'be
accounted fools, think it folly in returning to theiu
duty, which is the principal mark of wifdom. _- Inc
Ihort, I travelled up to London, refolved upon away;-
age 5 and a voyage I. foon heard of, by my. acquaint;
ance with a captain who, took a fancy to me, to go; 'ROBINSON, causon. 7

to the coall: of Guinea. Having romp money, and
appearing likesa gentleman, I went, on board, not
as a common failor or foremafl-man; nay, the com-
mander agreed I ihould. go that voyage with him
without any expence, that I (hould be his mefl'mate
and companion, and I was very welcome to carr
any thing with-me, and; make...the belt merchandi e
I could. .

l blefi'ed m happy: fortune, and humbly thanked
my captain or, his offer; when acquainting my
friends in Yorklhire, forty pounds were fent me, the
greateft part of which I believe my dear father. and
mother contributed to, and with which I bought
toys and trifles as the captain direaed me, My
captain alfo learned me navigation, how to keeper!
account of; the {hi ,'s courfe, take an obfervation,
and led me into the knowledge of} feveral. ufeful
branches of ' the mathematics; and. indeed this my.
age made me, both a failor and merchant; for I
brought home 5 ounds 9 ounces of gold-daft. for
my adventure, w ich produced at mgretum to Lon-
don almoft three hundred pounds. in in thisvoyg-
age I was extremely lick, being thrown into a vio-
lent calenture, through exceflive heat, jtradiln upon
the coaft from the latitude of.- 15 degrees nor even
to the line itfelf. . , -

But alas! my dear friend the captain foon departed
this life after his arrival. This-was; a, fenfible grief
to me, yet I refolved to goanother voya c with his
mate, who had now got command 0 the, thin
but this proved unfuccefsful; for though I .did not
carry quite 1001. of my late acquired wealth,rfo that
I had, 2001. left, which I depofited with fire captain's
widow, who was an honefi gentlewoman, yet my
misfortunes in this voyage were very great upon. me,
{er-our {hip failing towards the Canary Iflands, we
Ewerexhaced by a Sallee rover, and in fpite of all the
Jailewe could make, by crowding as much cane

A48 _ , n'onmson cnvson.

m" as our yards would l'pread, or malts carry, the
pirate gained upon us, and fo we prepared ourfelves
to light. They had 18 guns, and we had but 12.
About three in the afternoon there was a defperate
engagement, wherein many were killed and wound-
ed on, both tides; but finding ourfelves overpowered
with numbers, our {hip difabled, and ourfelves too
impotent to have the leafl hopes of fuccefs, we were
forced to fu'rrender, and accordingly were all carried
into the port of Sallee. Our men were (em to the
emperor's court to be fold there ; but the pirate
captain taking notice of me, kept me to be his own
flave. ' '

In this condition I thought myfelf the moli mil'er-
able creature on earth, and the prophecy of my fa-
ther came afrefh into my thoughts. As it happened,
. my condition was better than I thought it to be, as
will [con appear. Some hopes indeed I-had, that
my new patron would go to fea again, where'he might
be taken by a Spanifh or Portugal man of war, and
then I {hould be [at at liberty ; but in thisI was mif-
taken, for he never took me with him, but left me
to look after his little garden, and to the drudgery
of his houfe 5 and when he returned from (ea, would
make me lie in the cabin, and look after the (hip.
I had no one that I could communicate my thoughts
to, which were continually meditating my efcape;
no Englifiiman, Irifhman, or Scotchman here,but my-
felf, and for two years 1 could fee nothing praeli-
cable, but only pleafe myfelf with the imagination.

After fome length of_ time, my patron, as I
found, grew l'o poor, that he could not fit'out his
{hip as ufiial; and then he ufcd conflamly, once
or twice a' week, if the weather was fair, to go out
a fifhing, taking me and a young Morefco boy to row
the boat ; andfo much pleafed was he with me 'for
my dexterity in catching the fifh, that he wouldnonmson enusoa. 9"

often {end rue-with a flIoor, who was one of his
kinfmen, and the More/Ea youth, to catch a dtlh of

fiilt for him. . _

, .One morning as we were at the fport, there arofe
inch 3 thick fog, that we left fight of the ihore,
and rowing we knew not which way, we laboured-
all the night, and in the morning found ourfelves m
the ocean,;.two leagues from land ;~ however, we at---
tained there at length, and' we made the greater
halte, becaufe' our {tomachs were exceeding {harp
andhungry. . But the-betterto prevent fuch difafiers,
my patron ordered a carpenter to build a little {late-
room or cabin in the middleof the long-boat, with-
n plaCe behind it to fleet andhawl home the main-
iheet, with other conveniencies, to keep him from
the weather, as- alfo lockers to put in all manner of
provifions, with a'handfome {hould'er of mutton fail-
gibing ,over the cabin.

In this-he frequently took us;a-filhing; and one
time inviting two or three perfons of dii'tinetion to-
go with him-,ztmade provifion extraordinary, provid-
ing alfo three fufees, with powder and (hot, that
they trt-igirt:4rave fome {port at fowling along the {ea
coalh .The next morning, the boat being clean,
her autients and pendents out, and every thing
ready, their minds altering, my patron ordered us- '
to goafifhing, for- that his guefis would certainly
{up with him that night, '

And now I began to [think of my deliverance in--
deed. In order to this, I perfuaded the Moor to get
fonte provifions on board, as not' daring to meddle
with our. patron's ; who, taking my advice, we
ftored ourfelves with rulk'bifcuit, and three jars of:
water'; befides,11_privately conveyed into 'the boat
a bottle of' brandy, fome twine, thread, a ham--
mgr, hatchet, and a faw ;. in particular fome bees--
wax, which;w:ts a great comfort to me, andfervedi
igamake candles. I thenperfuaded Muley (for {0:

.- ' A--s ' < 'to Ronmso-N. Gnuson.

was the Moor called) to procure fome powder and
that, pretending to kill fea curlieus, to which he
innocently and readily agreed; and in ihort, being-
provided with all things necefl'ary, we failed out,
rcfolving for my own part to make my efcape, though

it might cofi me my life.
When we had pafi'ed the came, we fell to fiihino -

9
but though I knew there was a bite, I difl'embled the
matter, in order to put farther out to tea; accord-
ingly we ran a league farther, when giving the boy
the helm, and pretending to itoop for fomething, l
feized Muley by futprife, and threw him overboard.
He was an excellent fwimmer, foon arofe, and made
towards the boat; upon which I tool: out a fufee,
' and prefe'nted it at him: Muley, {aid I, I never yet
a'f/{gned to do you any harm, and flak nothing now out
my redemption. I know you are able enough to fwim
tofiore andfiw your If}? ; hut f you are re/e/wd to,
follow me, to (be endangering of wing; the wry moment
you proceed, I will/boot you throng/2 the :bond; The
harmlefs creature, at thefe words, turned himfelf
from me, andI make no doubt got fafe to land.
Then turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he
trembled at the aflion -, but I put him out of all fear,
telling him, that if he would be true and faithful
to me, I would do well by him; and tbergfwe, [said-
I, you mtg/I flroke yourflzce to be fafifirl, and, a: the

teach an obliging fmile confented, that I readily be-
lieved him, and from that day forward began to
love him entirely, . '

Thus we purfued our voyage, and that they would
think me gone to the Straits mouth, I kept to the
fouthward, to the truly Barbarian ceafizg bat-in that:

I was 150 miles beyond the Emperor 'of Morocco'&

days fucceflively, till fuch time as the wind {luftmg
*to the fouthward, made me conclude, that If any,
vefl'el was in chace of me, they would proceed no;

anchored in the mouth of a little river, I knew not
what or where, neither, did I then fee any pcoplCm
WhatI principally'wanted was freih water, and .I'
was refolved about dufltilh to fwim afhore ;.,w but
no fooner did the gloomy clouds of night begin to,
fucceed the declining day, when then .it was we heard
fuch barking, roaring, and howling of wild creag
tures, that one might have thought the very {tran-

refidence there. Poor. Xury, almofi: dead with fear,.

would take one of the jars and bring me fome; I

(fur. . So giving Xury a piece of rulk bread to eat,
and a>> dram, we waded afhore, carrying nothing with
us but our arms, and two iars for water. I did not
go out of fight of the boat, as dreading the Livage
coming clown the river in their canoes ; but the boy
feeing a low defcent, or vale, about a mile in the
country, he wandered to it, and then running back
to me with great precipitation, I thought he was
purfued hy fome farage or wild beaft, upon which I
approached, refolving to perifh or protect him from
danger; As he came nearer to me, I faw fomething
hanging over his flaoulders, which was a creature
he'fhad (hot, like a bare, but different in colour, and
longer legs; however, we were glad of it, for it
proved wholefc-me nourifhing meat ; but what added
to our joy was, my boy afl'ured me there was plenty

"of water, and that he fee no wild mam. And greater
"ill, Was our comfort, when we found frefh water in
the'creek where we were, when the tide was out,
without going {0- far up into the country.

In this placel began to confider that the Cana-
ry and the Cape de Verd iflands. lay not far off ; but
having no infirument, I knew not what latitude, or
when to {tand of? to tea for them; yet my hopes
were, I {hould meet fome of the Englifh trading refs
fels, who would relieve and take us up.
The place I was in, was, no doubt, that wild fort~
of country, inhabited only by a few, that lies be.-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's dominions and the-
negroes ; it.was filled with wild bealts, and the Moors
ufed it for hunting chiefly. From this place I thought
I faw the top of the mountain Tenerifl'e, in the Ca-
naries, which made me try twice to attainit; but as.
often was I drove back, and fo forced to- purfue my
fortune along the flrore.

Early one morning we came to_an anchor under a.
little point of land, but pretty high, and the tide be-
ginning to flow, we lay ready to go farther in; but
Xury, whofe youthful and penetrating eyes were-
{-harper than mine, in a foft tone delired me to keep:
far from land, left we {hould be devoured ; fir, look-
yomler, JIIeytcr, faid he, and fie (I.- dreadful margfler

where he pointed, I cfpied a fearful moniter indeed ;,

_ it was a terrible great lion that lay on (here, covered,

as it were, by the lhade of a piece of the hill. Xury,
faid I, youflml! g5 onflvre and kill [vim ,- but the boy
looked amazed: Me kill lvim, fays he, be eat mg" at-
one moat/J, meaning one mouthful. Upon which I;

me for a bed to lie upon.

And now we failed fouthwardly, living fparingly-

we were obliged, for frelh water. My defign was to
make the river Gambia or Senegal, or any where about
the Cape de Verd, in hopes to meet fome European

was to feek for the iflands, or lofe my life among.

But, as we were failing along, we {aw pe0ple {tand-

they were black and {tank naked. I was inclined to-
go on lhore, but Xury cried, No, no ,- however, I>>
approached nearer, and I found they run along the
{bore by me a good way ; they had no weapons in.
their hands, except one, who held a long flick, which
Xury told me was a lance, with which they could
kill at a great dil'tance. I talked to them by ligns,
and made them fenlible I wanted fomething to eat:
They beckoned to me to {top my boat, while two of
them run up into the country, and in lefs than half
an hour came back and broUght with them two pieces-
of dry flelh, and fame corn, which we kindly ac-
cepted ; and to prevent any fears of either fide, they
brought the food to the more, laid it down, then;
went and {tood a greatway 01?, till we fetched it on.
board, and then-came elofe to us again.

But while we were returning thanks to them, be.

ing all we could offer, two mighty creatures came.-7.." -,_a--. .r--v--

from the mountains, one as it were purfuing the
other with'greut- fury, which we we're inclined to-
believe, becaufe they feldom appear but in the night;
and both thefe pa'ffing 'fwiftly by the negroes, jumped
into the fea, wantonly fwimming about, as though
the diVerfion of'the waters had put a flop to their
fiercenefs. At laft, one of them coming nearer my
boat- th'a'n I"eXpe&ed or defired, I, {hot him direetly
through the head, upon which he" funk immediately,

yet filing-again, would have willingly made to the,

ihore; but between the wound and the ltrangling
of the water, he died before he could reach it. '

It is not polli'ole for me to exprcl's the conl'terna-
tion the poor- negroes were in at the firing my gun,
much lefs can I mention their furpril'e, when they
perceived the creature to be {lain by it. I made figns

to them- to draw near it, and then gave them a rope'

to. hale it on fhore. It was a. beautiful leopard,

which madeame' delire its lkin; and the negroes'-

feerning-to (foyer the carcafe, I, very freely gave it to
them. As for the 'other leapard, it made to lhore,
and ran with a. prodigious fw-iftncfs out of - fight.
T he .negroes hating'kindly; furnilhed me with water,
and with what roots and grain their country afi'orded,
I took my leave, and after eleven days fail, I came
in light of the Cape de Verd, and thofe iilands calla

Encouraged at this, I fet up my patron's antient,
and fired a gun, both as fignals of diflrefs, upon
which they very kindly lay to, fo that in threehours
time I came up with them. They {poke tome in
Portuguefe, Spanilh, and French, but neither of thefe
did I untlcrfland ;' till at length a Scots failor called,
and then I told him I was an Englifhman, who. had
efcapcd from the Moms of Sallee ; upon which they
took me kindly on board, with all my efi'ee'csa,
Surely none can exprefs that inconceivable joy my
heart felt at this my happy deliverance; who, from
being a miferable and forlorn creature, was not only
relieved, but in favour with the mafier of the fhip,

indeed he afted with the firie'telt juflice in what he
did, taking my things in his polleflion, and giv--
ing me an exact inventory, even to my earthen jars..
He bought my boat of me for the lhip's ufe, giving.
me a note of eighty pieces of eight, payable at Bra-
fil, and if any body ofli'ered more, he would make it
up. He alfo gave me fixty pieces for my boyIXuryh
It was with great relue'tance I-was prevailed upon to
fell the child's liberty, who had'ferved me {0 faith-
fully; but the boy himfelf was willing; and it was;
agreed, that after ten years he,fhoulcl_,be, made free,
upon his renouncing Mahometanifm and embracing
Chrifiianity. :5 _ g {.V 3.
Having a pleafant voyageto the Brafilaye arr
rived in the Bay de Tudor Io} Santor, or All-saint: Bay,
in about 22 days after. And here I cannot forget
the generous treatment of the captain; he would

take nothing for my pafl'age, gave me 20 ducats for
the leopard's (kin, and 30 for the lion's ; every thing
he caufed to be delivered, and what I would fell he!
bought. In fhort, I made about 220 pieces of my
cargo, and with this Rock I entered once more, as I
may fay, into the flame gflgfi'.

Being recommended to an honeft planter, I lived
with him till fuch time as I was informed of the man-
ner of their planting and making fugar; and feeing
how well they lived, and how fuddenly they grew
rich, I was filled with an emulation, at leafl, to fet-
tle among them, refolving to get my money remit-
ted to me, and to purchafe me a plantation.

To be brief, I bought a'fettlement nexr door to an
honei'c and kind neighbour, born at Lifbon of Englilh
parents, whofe plantation joining to mine, we im#
proved it very amicably'together: Both our flocks
were low, and for two years we planted only {or
food; 'but the third year we planted fome tobacco,-
preparing each a large piece of ground for planting
canes the enfuing year ; but now wanting affii'tance,
I repented the lofs of my dear boy Xury.

Here having none to aflift me, my father's wOrds
came again into my mind; and if only a middle Pta-
tion of Mel fought, why could it not as well be
obtained in England as here? When I pondered of
this with regret, the thoughts of my late deliverance
forfook me ;'I had none to converfe with but'm'ys
neighbour; no work to be done but by my owr'r
hands; and this often made me fay, my condition '
was like that of a man cail upon a defolate'ifland.
So unhappy are we in our reilefiions, f0 forgetful:
what good things we receive ourl'elves, and fo un-Z

thankful for our deliverance from thofe calamities
that oth:rs em. lire. ' 'I8 Roxmson causoz.

I was in fome meafure fettle'd bef'ore the captain
who took me up departedfrom the Bralils. One day
I went to him, and told him what {tockI had in
London, defiring his aflil'tance in obtaining its remit-
tance, to which the good gentleman readily con-
fented, but would only have me fend for half my
money, lell; it {liould mifcarry, which if it did, the
remainder might fuppott me, and fo taking letters
of ptocuration from me, bid me trouble myfelf no
farther about it.

And indeed wonderful was his kindnefs towards
me 5 for he not only procured the money I had drawn
for upon my captain's widow, but fent me over- a
fervant, with a cargo proportionable to my condi-
tion; he alfo fent me over tools of all forts, iron-
work, and utenfils neceii'ary for, my plantation, and
which proved of the greatef't- ufe to me in my bulinefs.

Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncommon
fuccefs crowning my profperous labours, I might
have refled happy in that middle Rate of life my fa.-
ther had fo often recommended; yet nothing would
content me, fuch was my evil genius, but I muft
leave this. happy Ration, for a foolifh ambition in

' tiling greater than the nature of the thing admitted ;
and thus, once more, I call myfelf into the deepelt
gulf of mifery that ever abandoned creature fell
into; for having lived four years in Bralil, I not
only learned the language, but contraeted acquaint-
ancc with the molt eminent planters, and even the
merchants of St. Salvadore, to whom, by way of
difcourfe, giving an account of'my two voyages to
the wait of Guinea, and the manner of trading there
for mere trifles, by which we might furnifh our
plantations with negroes, they gave fuch attention
to what I faid, that three of them came one morn.
ing to me, and told me they had a fecret propofal to
make. After enjoining me to fecrefy (it being an
infringement on the powers of the kings of Portugal{crimson causes. r9

and Spain),;they told. me they had amind to fit out:
a {hip to go to Guinea, in order to (lock the plantar-r
' tion with.negroes, which, as:they.- could write pub-
" licly fold, they. would divide. among them,;andrif I:
would go their fupercargoin the (hip, to manage the.
;, trading part, 1 {ho'uld have an equal {hare of the ne-.
,7 groes, withoutproviding any (lock. The thing in-
( deed. was fair enough, had I. been in another condi-
tion; but I, born to'be my owndeflzroyer, could: not
refill; the propo'fal, but-accepted: the offer, upon con-
e" dition of: their looking after my plantation ;' f0, mak-
j ing a formalwill, [bequeathed myefi'ee'tsto my good:

friend' the captain, as my univerfal . heir, but obli ed:
him to difpofe of myetTeets as direeted, one hal of

 

15'. my produce to himfelf', and the Other to be {hipped
:1; for Englandt ' -

The {hip being fittedout, and all. things ready,
wefe'h fail the firfl: 01; September 1659, being the
fame day eight years I' left my father and mother in
Yorkfhire. We failed northward upon the coafl,
.53. in order to gain Africa; till we made Cape Auguftine,
, from, whence going further in the ocean, out of fight
f. of land, we iteered- as though we were bound for the
f, ifle of'Fernand de Noremba, leaving the iflands on
;.'j the eafi-gt and then it. was we met with. a. cruel; rem.
pel't, which. heldusfor- twelve days fuccefiively, fo,
5:. that the waters car-tied us. wherefoever they pleafed'.
i'fi In this perplexity one of our men died, and one man
' and the boy; were walhed overboard. When thewea--
' that cleared up a little, we- found, ourfelves eleven
5. 1' degrees north latitude upon the (:0th of Guinea;
j. Upon this- the captaingave reafons for returning,
which I Oppofed, counfell-ing-him- to {land away for.
.~ Barbadoes, which, as I. fuppofed', might be attained
" m :5 days; fo altering-our courfe, we failed north--
. welt and by weft, in order to reach the Leeward
.3 iflands -;- 'but a. fecond {torm fucceeding, drove us to
theweliward, fo-that-- we were jufily afraidrofi't'alling
into the hands of cruel favages, or the paws of de-
vouring bealts of prey. _

In this great diltrefs, one of our men, early in the
morning, cried out, Land! land! when no fooncr'
looking out, but our {hip {truck upon a fund, and in
a moment the {ca broke over her in fu'ch a manner,
thatwe expeeled we {hould all have perilhed imme-
diately. \Ve knew nothing where we were, or upon-
what land we were driven, whether an ifland or the'
main, inh'ahited or not inhabited ; and we could not
fo much as hope that the fhip would hold many mi-i
nutes without breaking in pieces,-except the wind
by miracle fhould turn about immediately. While
we flood looking at one another, expeeting death
every moment, the mate laid hold 0f the boat, and,'
with the help of the ref't, got her flung over the
{hip's fide, and getting all into her, being ekven' of
us, committed ourfelves to God's mercy, and the
wild fea. And now we faw that this lull:_eli"ort would
not be a fuflicicnt protection from death ,~ {0 high
did the tea run, that it was impolhble the boat lhould'
live. As to making, fail, we had none, neither if
we had, could we make ufe of any; f0 thatwhen
we had rowed, or rather were driven about a league
and a half, a raging wave, like a lofty mountain,-
came rolling altern of us, and took us with/fuch fu-
ry, that at once it overfet the boat. Thus being
fwallowed up in a moment, -we had hardly time-to
call upon the tremendous name of God, much lefs
toimplore, in. dying ejaculations, his infinite mercy,
to receive our departing fouls. . - ..

Men are generally counted infen-fible,when drug-.-
gling in the pangs of death; but while I was over-
whelmed with water, I had the molt dreadful appre-t
henfions imaginable; for the joys of heaven, and
torments of hell, feemed to prefent themfelves' before-
rne in thefe dying agonies, and even in thefmall fpace'
of time, as it were, between. life and death. I: was
'going, Ithought, I knew not whither," in a dilmal
gulf unknown, and as yet Iunperceivedflnever to be-
hold my friends, nor the light of this world any
more ! Could I even have thought of annihilation, or
a total difl'olution of foul as well as body, the gloomy
thOughts of having no further being, no knowledge
ofwhat. we hoped for, but. an eternal quietus,.with-
out life or fenfe; even that, I fay, would have been
enough to ftrike me with horror and confufion! But
firiving to the. lal't extremity, while I thought all my
companions were overpowered and entombed in the
deep, 'it was with great difliculty I kept my breath
till the wave fpent itfelf, and retiring back, 'left me
' on the {bore half dead with the water! had taken in .;
howevbr, I got on my feet-as fall: as I could, lefl:
another wave {hould .purfue, and . car . me, back
again; but afor_all the halie I. made,.? could not
, avoid it, for the [ca came after :me like a high
' mountain, or furious enemy, ('0 that my bufinefs was
" to hold my breath, and: by. railing myfelf on the

water, preferveit' by fwimming ; the next dreadful
Wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep,
but at the fame time carried me with a mighty force
and f-wiftnefs towagds the lhore; when railing my;
felf, I held outas well as poflible, till at length the
waterhaving {pent itfelf, began to return, at which
I [track forward, and feeling ground with my feet,I

took to my heels again. Thus being ferved twice more,
I- was at laihdalhed againft a piece of rock, in fueh
a. manner-as'left me fenfel'efs; but recovering a little
beforethe return of the waves, which, no doubt,
then would have overwhelmed me, I held--fafi by the
rock till thofeufucceedingz'waves abated, and then,
fetching'anoth'er 'run,vwas Overtook by a [mall wave,
which'wae)-foon conquered; but before any more

of the foaming ocean.
No tongue can exprefs the ecfiafies and tranl'ports
that my foul felt at this happy deliverance; it was
like a reprieve to a'dying malefaelor, with the halter
about his neck, and ready to be turned off. I was
wra'pt up in contemplation, and often lifted up my
hands, with the profoundefi humility, to the Divine
Powersfor faving my life, when the rel't of my com-
panions Were all drowned. And now I began to caft
my eyes around, to behold what place I was in, and
what I had next to do. I could fee no houfe, nor
people; I was wet, yet had no clothes to {hift me;
tungry and thirfty, yet nothing to eat or drink; no
weapon to defiroy any creature for my fullenance,
nor defend myfelf againil devouring bealls; in'fhort,
I had nothing but a knife, 2 tobacco-pipe,.and/a box
half filled with tobacco. The darkfome night com-
ing upon me, increafed my fears of being devoured
by wild creatures ; my mind was plunged in de.
fpair, and having no profpee't, as I thought, of life
before me, prepared for another kind of death than
what I had lately efcaped. I walked about -a fur- '
long, to fee if could find'any frefh water, which I
did to my great joy, and taking a quid of tobacco to
prevent hunger, I got up into a thick bulhy tree, and
{eating myfelf {0 that I could not fall, a deep fleep
overtook me, and for that night buried my {arrows
in a quiet repofe.

It was broad day the next morning before I aWako

- ed, when not only I perceived the tempelt was

ccafed, but the {hip was driven almolt as far as the
rock before-mentioned, which the waves had dafh-
cd me againit, and which was about a mile from the
place where I was. When I came down from my
apartment in the tree, I perceived the 'fhip's beat
two miles diftant on my right hand, lying"!on more,"
as the waves had cait her; I thought to have got to '
her, but there being an inlet'of 5wate'rrof aboutzhalf
a mile's breadth between it'an'd me, I' returneda'gain-

towards the lhip, as hoping-to'find fomething form'y
mere immediate fublilience. ' 'AbOut noon, when the
{ca was calm, that'l could come within a quarter 'of
a mile of her, it was to my" grief 'I perceived that, if
We had'kept on board, all 'our "lites 'ha'd -been'faved ':
Thefe thoughts. and my 'folitude, drew tears [from
my e7es,'though all in vain. 'So 'refolving toget to
the (hip, I (tripped, and leaped into the water, when
fwimming round her, I'was afraid 'I fhbula not, get

:3 indeed was all, to carry away what was need'ful "fo'r.

vi. Necellity occalio'ns quick'nefs of thought. We
{ had feveral {pare yards, a {pare topmali or two, and
, ,two or three large {pars of wood; withthefe I fell
to work, and flung as many of them overboard as I
'_ could manage, tying every one of them with a , r'o'pe
,f that they might not drive away. This done, I went

   
   

gadown the thigh tide, and tied four of them" 'f'a'ft to"-
'3,

geth'er at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying
- two 0r three fhort pieces of plank upon them crofs-
, 'ways, I found it would 'bear me, but not any confi-
' (le'rabl'ewe'ight'; 'up'o'n WhichI wenf'tbwmk again,
1 cutting a'fp'are 't'o'pmaft into three len' ths, adding
.. them 'to "my raft with a great deal 0 ~labour'arrd'
; pains, I then confidered' what I flzould load it with;
it being not able to bear a ponderous burden ; and
this Ifoon thought of, lirll: laying upon it all the
planks and boards I could get ; nextI lowered down
three of the feamens chelts, after I had filled them
with bread, rice, three Dutch cheefes, five pieces
of dried goats flefh, and fome European corn, what
little the rats had fpared; but for the liquors, I
found feveral cafes of bottles belonging to our Ikip-
per, in which were fome cordial Waters, and four
or five gallons of arrack, which I flowed by them-
felves; by this_time the tide beginning to flow, I
perceived my coat, waificoat, and fhirt fwim away,
which I had left on the fhore; as for my linen,
breeches, and fiockings, I fwam with them on to the
fhip; but I foon found clothes enough, yet took
no more than I wanted for the prefent. My eyes
were chiefly on tools to work with; and after
long fearch I found out the carpenter's cheflz,
which I got fafe down on my raft; then I looked
for arms and ammunition, and in the great cabin,
found two good fowlingcpieces, two pil'tols, feveral
powder-horns filled, a {mall bag of fhot, and two
rufly old fwords. I alfo found three barrels of pow-
,der, two of which were good, but the third had
taken water: With two or three broken oars, two
faws, an axe, and a hammer, I put to fea, and in
getting to fhore, I had three encouragements; t. A
fmooth calm (ea. 2. The tide rifing and fetting in
to the lhore. 3. The little wind there was blew to-
wards land; but after I had failed about 'a mile, I ,
found the raft todrive a little difiance from the place
whereI firll: landed; and then 1 perceived a little
opening of the land, and a {trong current of the tide
running into it, upon which I kept in the middle of
the firearm; but great was my concern, when on a
fudden the fore part of my raft run aground; fo that

had I not with great difiit dry, for near half an hour,
I .
kept my baclt {training againft the chefts, to keep
;., my ctihtls in their places, all I had would have gone
i? into the fen. But after fome time, the tiling oi the
V water .caufed the raft to float again, when coming up
a little river, with land on both (ides, I landed, in a
little cove, 'as near [the mouth as pofliblc, the better
to difcovcr a fail, if any fuch providentially pulled
by that way. '

Not far oif, I {pied a hill of a i'tupendous height,
furrounded with Idler hills about it, and thither I
, was refolved to go and view the country, that I
_' might fee what part was the bell place to fix my ha-
bitation in. Accordingly, arming myfelf with a
, pifiol, a. fowling-piece, powder and ball, Ial'cended
,, the mountain; there I perceived I was in an ifland

~encoraymti'ed by the fca, no difiant lands to be
' lie-en, but t'cattering mess that lay to the well:; that
v? it feemed a barren place, and, as I thought, inhabit-
ii} ed only by wild bealls. I perceived abundance of
y'd'owls, but was ignorant of what kind, or whether
Itfigood for nourilhment; l ihot one of them at my re-
'turn, which occafioned a conful'ed fcreaming among
H" the Other birds; anciI found it, by its colour and
" beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its lieflt was perfeflf
; carriou.

'W hen I came to. my raft, I brought my efl'eets on
{hot-e, which work limit that day entirely; and
fearing that fome cruel healls might devour me in
the night while I flept, I made a kind of hut or bar-
5,Iricade With the CllCitS and boards I brought from
ie'i'ihorc. That night i flept very comfortably, and the
f next morning my thoughts were employed to make
'.'a further attempt on the lhip, and bring away what
neceliltries I could lind, before another ltorm ihould
'"break her to pieces. Accordingly I got on board as
before, and prepared a fecond raft, far more nice
"_..than the firfl, upon which I brought away the car-
hpentet's fiores, two or teiree bags full of 1125.13, at.-26 rtosmsox causes.

great jack ferew, a dozen or two of hatchets, and
a grind-(tone. I alfo took away feveral things that
belonged to the gunner, particularl two or three
iron crows, two barrels of mufltet-hullets, another
fowling-piece, a fmall quantit of powder, and a
large bag full of fmall lhot. fiefides thefe, I tool:
all the mens clothes I could find, a fpare fore-top
fail, hammock, and fome bedding; and thus com-
pleting my fecond cargo, I made all the haiie to
fhore I could, fearing fome wild bealt might deftroy
what I had there already; but I only found a little
wild cat fitting on one of the chefis, who not feem-
ing to fear me, or the gun that I prefented to her, I
threw her a piece of bifcuit, which {he inftantly ate,
and departed.

\Vhen I had gotten thefe efl'eets on fliore, I went
to work, in order to make me a little tent with the
fail and fume. poles which I had cut for that purpofe ;
and having Iiuilhed it, what things might be damaged
by the weather I brought in, piling all the empty
chelts and talks in a circle, the better to fortify it
againit any fttdden attempt of man or beaii. After
this I blocked up the doors with fume boards, and an
empty chcll. turned the long way without. I then
charged my gun and piflol, and laying my bed on the
ground, flept as comfortably, till next morning, as
though I had been in a Chriitian country.

Now, though I had enough to fubfill: me a long
time, yet, defpairing of a fudden deliverance, or that
borh ammunition and provifion might be {pent be--
fore fuch a thing happened, I coveted as much as I
could, and to long as the (hip remained in that con-
dition, I daily brought away one necetlhry or other;
particularly the rigging, fails, and cordage, fome
twine, a barrel of wet powder, fome fugar, a bar.
rel of meal, three caiks of rum, and what indeed
was molt welcome to me, a whole hogfhead of

bread.aonmson causoc. 27

The next time I went, I cut the cables in pieces,
carried off a hauler whole, with a great deal of iron-
work, and made another raft With the mum and

' fprit-fail yards, but this being {0 unwieldy, by the
i too heavy burden I laid upon it, and not being able

dexreroufly to guide it as the former, borh my cargo
and I were overturned; for my part, all the da-
mage I fuftained was a wet fltin; and at low water,
after much labour in diving, Igot molt of the cables,
and fome pieces of iron.

Thirteen days had I now been in the ifland, and
eleven times on board, bringing away all that was
pollible; though, I believe, had the weather been
calm, I fliould have brought away the whole [hip
piece by piece. As I was going the twelfth time,
the wind began to rife; however, I ventured at low
water, and rummaging the cabin efl'eetually, in a
locker I found feveral razors, fcifl'ars, and fome
dozens of knives and forks, and in another thirt -
fix pounds in pieces of eight, [liver and gold. A g

ing from the more, and the (icy overcafi with clouds
and darknefs. So thinking 'a raft to be in vain, I let
myfelf into the water, with what things I had about
me, and it was with much difliculty I got alhore,
when foon after it blew a fearful fiorm.

That night I flept very contentedly in my little
tent, furrounded with all; my efl'eets; but when I

' 2
looked out in the morning, no more fliip was to be
feen'. This much {urprifed me for the prefent, yet
when I confidered I had loll no time, abated no pains,
and had got every thing ufeful out of her, I com-
forted myfelf in the bell: manner, and entirely {ub-
mitted to the will of Providence.

My next thouights were, how I {hould defend
and fecure myl'elf from {avagcs and wild beafls, if
any fuch were in the illand. At one time I thought
of digging a care; at another, I was for ereaing
a tent; and, in lhort, l refolved to do both: The
manner or form of which will not, I hope, be un-
pleafing to delcribe. -

"'hen I confidered the ground where I was, that
it was moorifh, and had no frefh water near it, my
refolutions were to fearch for a foil healthy and well
watered, where I might not only be Iheltered from
the fun's [catching heat, but be more conveniently
lituated, as well to be fecured from wild men and
bealls of prey, as more eafily to difcover any diftant
fail, {hould it ever f0 happen.

And indeed it was not long before I had my de-
lire; I found a little plain near a rifing hill, the
front towards which being as lteep as a houfe-lide,
nothing could defcend on me from the top. On the
tide of this rock was a little hollow place, refem-
bling the entrance or door of a cave. Jul't before
this place, on the circle of the green, I refolved my
tent {hould (land. This plain did not much ex-
ceed too yards broad, and about twice as long, like
a delightful green before my door, with a pleating,
though irregular defcent every way to the low
grounds by the {ea-fade, lying on the N. N. W. fide
of the hill, f0 that it was lheltered from the excel-
five heat of the fun. After this I drew a femi-
circie, containing ten yards in its femi-diameter,
and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two
.rows of llrong flakes, .not fix inches from each
' other; then, with the pieces of cable which Ihad
. cut on board, I regularly laid them in the circle be-
' tween the piles up to their tops, which were more
than five feet out of the earth, and after drove ano-
' ther row of piles looking within-fide againfl'. them,
between two or three feet high, which made me-
conclude it a little impregnable caitle from men and
.7 bealis ; and, for my better fecurity, I would have no
" door, but entered in and came out by the help of a
ladder, which I alfo made.
. Here was my fence and fortrefs, into which I
7 carried all my riches, ammunition, and iiores. Af-
, ter which, working on the rock, what with the dirt
' and flones I dug out, I not only raifed my ground
., two feet, hut made a little cellar to my manfion-
1 home, and this wit me many days labour and pains;
but one day in particular, a fhower of rain falling,
' thunder and lightning enfued, which put me in ter-
"jror lefi my powder {hould take fire, and not only
:'f hinder my necefiary fubfilience from killing me food,
:1' but even blow up me and my habitation; to pre-
_;=':vent which, I fell to making boxes and bags, in or;
der to feparate it, having by m: near : Sclbs. weigh-t.
'1 And thus being efirbhfhed as king of the .ifland,
every day I went on: with my gun to fee Wh-J'i I
.; could kill that was fit to eat. I foon perceived numg-
,'lgbers of goats, but very {hy ; yet having watched
a gthem narrowly, and {eving i could t; trer (hoot ofl'the
, rocks than when in the low grounds, I one day hap-
pened to {boot a {he-goat fuckling a young kid, who
knot thinking its dam flain, lizood by her unconcerned,
"i and when I took the dead creature up, the young
3 one followed me even to the inclofure. I lifted the
kid over the pales, and would wiliingly have kept it
; alive ; but finding it could not be brought to eat,_'I:
,5 was forced to flay it alfo for my own fubfifience. ,
Thus entered into a iirange fame of life as" ever;
my man was in, 1 had rgoit melancholy appreheno-
' ' 3.
lions concerning my deplorable condition, and many
times the tears would plentifully run down my face,
when I confidered how I was debarred from all com-
munication with human-kind ; and while {ome de-
fponding cogitations would {com to make me accufe
Providence, other good thoughts would interpofe,
and reprove after this manner: Well, fuppofing you
are defolate, is it not better to be f0 than total.
Iy perifh? Why were you {ingled out to be fared,
and the ref: defiioyed? Why fltould you complain,
when not only your life is preferred, but the {hip
driven even into your reach, in order to take what
was neceflary out of her for your {ubfiflence ? But to
proceed. It was, I) the account I kept, the 30th of
September when I grit landed on this ifland; about
twelve days after, fearing I {hould lofe my reckon-
ing of time, nay even forget the Sabbath-days, for
want of pen, ink, and paper, I carved it with a
knife upon a large pofi, in great letters, and {etting
it up, in the fimilitude of a crofs, on the feafhore
where I landed, viz. 1 came cit/liar: Sept. 30. 16 59.
Every day I cut a notch with my knife on the (ides
of this fquare poll, and that on Sabbath was as long
again as the refi, and every firfl: day of the month as
long again as that long one. In this manner I kept
my kalendar, weekly, morfthly, or yearly reckoning
of time; but had I made a more {trie't fearch (as
I did afterwards) I need not have fet up this mark ;
for among the parcels belonging to the gunner,
carpenter, and captain's mate, thofe very things I
wanted I found, particularly pens, ink, and paper;
alfo two or three compafi'es, fome mathematical irr-
flruments, dials, profpee'tive glafs, books of naviga.
tion, three Englifh bibles, and feveral other good
books, which I carefully put up. But here I cannot
but call to mind our having a dog and two cats on
board, whom I made inhabitants with me in my ca-

ttle. But though one might think I had all the necefa _
faries as were defirable, yet (till I found feveral things
wanting. My ink was daily waiting; I wanting nec-_
dles, pins, and thread, to mend or keep my clothes

together, particularly a fpade, pick-axe, or (hovel,
to remove the earth. It was a year before I finifhcd

my little bulwark, and having fome intervals of re-
laxation, after my daily wandering abroad for provi-
fion, I drew up this plan alternately, as creditor and
debtor, to remind me of the'miferies and bleflings

of my life, under fo many various circumftances.

EVIL.

I am call upon a defolate
ifland, having no hopes, no
profpee't of a welcome deli-
verance.

Thus miferably am I fin-
gled out from the enjoyment
or company of all mankind.

Like an hermit Srather
{hould I fay, a lone y an-
chorite) am I forced from
human converfation.

My clothes, after fome
time, will be worn out ;
and then I {hall have none
to cover me.

When my ammunition is
waited, then {hall I remain
without any defence againll;
wild men and beafls.

I have no creature, no
Ibul to {peak to; none to
beg allifiance from. Some
comfort would it be to re-
found my woes where I am

underliood; and beg aliilt-

ance, where I might hope
for relief.

GOOD.

But yet I am prefervcd,
while my companions are
perilhed in the raging ocean.

Yet fet apart to be {pared
from death ! and he who
has l'o preferved me can de-
liver me from this condition.

However I have food to
eat, and even a happy pro-
fpefi of fubliitence whilfl'.

life endures.

At refent I enjoy what'
is abfo utel needful; andthe
climate is 0 hot, that, had
I ever fo many, I lhould
hardly wear them.

Yeti f it does, I fee no dan-
ger of any to hurt me, as in
Africa : And what if I had
been cafl: away on that coaft?

Is there not God to con-
verl'e to, and is not he able _
to relieve thee 2 Already has
be afforded thee fuflenance,
and put it in thy power to
provide for thyl'elftztill he
{ends thee a deliverance. '

B4
And' now eafing my mind a little by thefe reflec-'
tions, I began to render my life as eafy as poflible'.'
I' mull here add to the defcription I have given of
my habitation, that having raifed a turf wall againfi
the outfide of it, I thatched it fo clofe as might keep
it from the inclemency of the weather. I all'o im-
proved it within, enlarged my cave, and made a paf-
{age and door in the rock, which came out beyond
the pale of my fortification. I next proceeded to
make a chair and table, and fo began to Rudy thofe
mechanical arts that feemed to me prafticable ; for
when I wanted'a plank or'board, I hcwed down a
tree with my hatchet, making it as thin with my
axe as pollible, and then' fmooth enough with my
adze to anfwer my deligns; yet this way could I
make no more than one board out of a tree ;' but in
length'hf time I got boards enough to {helter all my
flores, every thing being regularly placed, and my
guns fecurely hanging againll the tide of the rock.
All this made it a very pleafant fight to me, being the
refult of vaft labour and diligence; which leaving
for a while, and me to the enjoyment of, I {hall give
the reader an account of my journal, from the day
of my landing till the fixing and fettling of my ha-
bitation, as heretofore flaown.

JO U R N A L.

Septrmber 30, 1659. I unhappy Robinfon Crufoe,
having fufi'ered {hipwreck, was driven on this defo-
late ifland, which I named the Defolate [flaml qf De-
flmir, the rel't being fwallowed up in the tempef-
tucus ocean. The next day I {pent in confideration
of my un ppy circmnl'cances, having no profpet'l
but of dea I, either to be {larved with hunger, or
devoured by beafls or mercilefs favages.

beheld the {hip drove ailiore. Some hopes I; had,"nonmon cansom 3 5-.

that-when the fiorm was abated,- I might be able to:
get fome food and necefl'aries out of' her, which I;
conceived were not. damaged, beeaufe the {hip didr
Rand upright. At this time Ilamented the lofs .of '
my companions, and our misfortune in leaving the'
veii'el. When I perceived the (hip,- as it were,.lie:
dry, I waded through the fands, . then fwam aboard,.

Nov. 7. Fair weather. I worked till the 12th,
but omitted the 11th, which, according to my calcu-
lation, I fuppofed to be Sunday.

Nov. 13. Rain in abundance, which however
much cooled the earth, when thunder and lightning
caufed in me a terrible furprife. The weather clear-
ing, in feparate parcels I fecured my powder.

Nov. 14, to 16'. I made little boxes for my pow-

large fowl, which proved excellent meat.

Nov. 17. I began to dig in the rock, yet was obli-
ged to delifl: for want of a pick-axe, (hovel, and
wheelbarrow. Iron crows I caufedrto {apply the
place of the firft, but with all my art could not make
a wheel- barrow.

Nov. 18. It was my fortune to find a tree, refem-
bling what the Brnfilians call an iron tree. I had
like to have fpoiled my am with cutting it, being
very hard, and exceeding heavy; yet with much la-
bour and indufiry I made a fort of a fpade out of it.

Nov. 23. 'l'hefe tools being made, I daily carried
on my bufinefs ;' eighteen days I allowed for enlar-
ging my cave, that it might ferve me not only for-
a warehonfe, but kitchen, parlour, and cellar. I
commonly lay in the tent, unlefs the weather was
rainy that I could not lie dry. 80 wet would it be at
certain feafons, that I was obliged 'to cover all within

the pale with long,:polcs in the form ti rafters'leaning.
againll the rock, and load them with flags and large
leaves of trees refembling a thatch.

Dec. 19. No fooner did I think my habitation fi-
nilhed, but fuddenly a great deal of the top broke in,
lo that it was a mercy I was not buried in the ruins.
This occalioned a great deal ofpains and trouble to
me before I could make it firm ,and durable.

Dec. 17. I nailed up fome flielves, and drove. nails
and {taples in the wall and pofts, to hang things out
of the way. '

Dec. 20. Every thing I got into its place, then
made a fort of a drefi'er, and another table.

Dec. 24. 25. Rain in abundance.

Dec. 26. Very fair weather.

Dec. 27. I chanced to light on fome goats, {hot
one, wounded another; I led' it home in a firing,
bound up its leg, and cured it in a little time; at
length it became fo tame and familiar, as to feed be-
fore the door, and follow me where I pleafed. This
put me in mind to bring up tame creatures, in order
to fupply me with food after my ammunition was-
1' pent. ' .

fity, I went out with my gun, and found a great {lore
of goats in the valleys ; they were exceeding thy, not
could my dog hunt them down. ' _

fan. 3. to 14. My employment thigtitnewas to.
finifh the wall before defcribed, and {catch-the-iiland.
I difcovered a kind of pigeons like our magpi-
geons, in a nolt among .'the rocks; I broughtgthent
home, nut-fed them till they could fly. and then1they
left me; after this I {hot fome, which prove'd'ex-
cellent food. Some time I {pent vainly ,in conniving
mmakea calls; [may wglefay it was rain, becauftr
'I could neither join the fiaves, or fix the heads, fo

as to make it tight ; then taking fome goat's tallow

Iliad by me, and a little 01mm for the wick,I provided:

gliyfelf with a lamp, which ferved me inl'tead of can-
es.

Bnt now a very firange event happened ;- for being
in the height of my fearch, what lhould come into
my hand, but a bag, which was tilted to hold corn (as
I fuppofed) for the fowls: So immediately refolving
to put gunpowder in it, I {book all the. huiks and dirt
upon one fide of the rock, little fufpeeting what the
confcquence would be. The rain had fallen plenti-
fully a few days before ; and about a month after, to
my great amazement, fomething began to fprout out
very green and flourifhing ; and when I- came to
view it- more nicely every day, as it grew, 1 found
about IO or t2 ears of green barley appearing in the
very fame fhape and make as that in England.

I can fcarce exprefs the agitations of my mind at
this light. Hitherto I had looked upon the aetion's _
of this life no otherwife than only as' the events of
blind chance and fortune; but now, the appearance
of this barley, flourifhing in a barren foil to the fort
of grain, and my ignorance in not conceiving how it
_fliould come there, made me conclude, tbat miracle:
were not yet cert/Ed : Nay, I even thought- that God
had appointed it to grow there without any feed,
purely for my fuflenance in this miferable and defo-
late ifland. And indeed fuch great eEe& had this
upon me, that it often made me melt into tears,
through a grateful-fenfe of God's mercies; and the
greater {till was my thankfulnefs, when I perceived
about this little field of barley fome rice (talks, won-

~derful-1y' flourifhing in proportion to the crop within.

While I was thus furprifingly pleafed in mind, I
concluded there mull: be more corn in the ifland;
and therefore made a diligent fearchnart'owly among
the rocks, but could not find any 5 when upon a
hidden, it came into my mind, how I had {halten
the hunts of corn out of the bag, and then my admi-
ration eeafed, with my gratitude to the Divine Being,
a: thinking it war "but "antral, and not to be conceived
a miracle ; though even the manner of its preferva- e
tion might have made me own it as a wonderful
event of God's kind providence. '

It was about the latter end of June when the ears
of this corn ripened, which I laid ufp very carefully,
together with 20 or 30 {talks 0 rice, expeeting
one day I ihould reap the fruits of my labour ; et-
four years were expired before I could allow my elf
to eat any barley bread, and much longer time before
I had any rice. After this, with indefatigable pains
and induftry for three or four months, at lalt I finilh.
ed my cave on the nth of April, having no way to
go into it but by a ladder again" the wall. '

April 16. I finifhed my ladder and afcended- it;
after pulled it up, then let it 'down on the other tide,
and defeended into my new habitation, where I had.

{pace enough, and fo fortified that nothing could at.
tack me .without fcaling the walls. 3

But what do all human pains and indufiry avail,
if the blefiings of God do not crown our labours I4 '
Or who can hand before the Almighty, when he
firetcheth forth his arm : For one time, as I was at
the entrance of my cave, there happened {achi-
dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof of the
cave came crumbling about my ears, but the polis-
feemed to crack terribly at the ame time ,~ this made
me, in great amazement, run to my ladder, and get
over the wall ; when there I plainly knew it was -'an
earthquake,_ the place I Ptood "on fufiaining three
terrible {hocks in lefs than three minutes. And when
'I-faw the top-of a great rock roll into the fea, then
I-expeeited the ifland would be fwallowed up every
"moment 5} and dreadful it was to fee the [ca thrown.38 1033850): causox.

into the molt violent agitations and diforders bythis
tremendous accident.-

For my part I flood like a criminal, at the place
of execution, ready to expire. At the moving of the
earth, I was, as it were, fen-lick, and very much a-
fraid lefl: the rock, under which was my fence and
habitation, lhould overwhelm me and it in a laiting
tomb. '

"When the third dreadful {hock had {pent itfelf,
my fpirits began to revive ; yet fiill I would not ven-
ture to afcend the ladder, but continued fitting, not
knowing whatI fhould do. 80 little grace thenI
had, only to fay, Lord, bane mercy upon me ! And no
fooner was the earthquake over, but that pathetic
prayer left me.

It was not long after when a horrible tempefl: a-
rofe, at the fame time attended with a hurricane of
wind. The fea feemed mountains high, and the
waves rolled fo impetuonlly, that nothing could be
perceived but froth and foam. Three hours did this
fiorm continue, and in fo violent a manner as to tear
the very trees up by the roots, which was fucceeded
by abundance of rain; when this was over I went
to my tent, but the rain coming again upon me in a
furious manner, obliged me to take lhelter in the
cave, and then I was forced to cut a channel through
my fortification to let the water out. It continued
raining all that night, and fome time the next day :
Yet no fooner did the weather clear up, but I re-
folved .to build _me a little hut in fome Open place,
walled round, .to defend ,me from wild creatures and
favages, as not drinking but at the next earthquake
the mountain would fallnpon myhabitation and me,
and {wallow up all in its bowels.

April 19. 20. Thefe days I fpentincontriving how
and in what manner I fhould fix my place of abode 3
all this while I was under the molt dreadful,,ap-

prehcnfions. When I looked round my habitation,
'every thing I found was in its proper plate. I had

feveral refolutions whether I-(hould move or not ; at
length l refolved to Ray where I was, till [had found
a convenient place where I might pitch my tent.

A r. 22. \Vhen I began to put my refolutiens in
pra ice, I was flopped for want of tools and infirm-
ments to work with. Molt of my axes and hatchets
were ufelefs, occafioned by cutting the hard timber
that grew on the ifland. It took me up a full week
to make my grind-{tone of ufe to me. and at hit I
fOund out a way to turn it about with my foot, by
the help of a wheel and a firing.

Apr. 28. 29. Thefe days were fpent in grinding
my tools.

Apr. 30. My bread falling {hort,I allowed my- -

{elf but one buifcuit a~day.

May I. As I walked along the {ea (here, I found
a barrel of gunpowder,- and feve'ral pieces of the
wreck, which the ("ca had flung up. Having fecured
thot'e, I made to the fhip, whofe item was torn .ofl',
and walhed a great diftancc alhore, but the re": lay
in the lands. This I fuppoefed was occafioned by the
earthquake. New I refolved to keep my old place
of abode, and alfo to go to the [hip that day, but
found it impoflible. o '

May 3. I went on board, and with my (aw famed
off one of the .beams which 'kept the: quarter-deck ;
then I cleared the {and till flood. '

May ,4. I. caught fome fifh, but they were not
wholefome ;' the {me day I alfo catehed :a young
dolphin. ,

May 5. This day I alfo repaired to the Wreck, and
{awed another piece of timber; and- when the flood
came, I made a float of three .great @lmks, which
was driven alhore by the tide. .

Ma] 6. 7. 8. 9. Thefe days I brought 'afl' the imn
bolts, opened the deck with the iron crow, and car.-
ried two planks to land, having made a way into the
very middle of the wreck. .

May 10. it. :2. r3. 14. All this timeI {pent 1m

for employing myfelf in looking for pigeons, I out-
fiayed my time.

May 17. I perceived feveral pieces of the wreck
blown afhore, which I found belonged to the head
of the fhip.

May 24. To this day I worked on the wreck,
and with great difficulty loofened fome things fo
much with the crow, that at the firit flewing tide
feveral calks floated out, and many of the feamens
chefts; yet that day nothing came to land but pieces
of timber, and a h0glhead which had fome Brafil pork
in it. I continued working to the 15th of June (ex-
cept necefl'ary times- for food and refl), and had I
known how to have built a boat, I had timber and

planks enough: I had alfo near too weight of fheet
lead.

june 26. Better, but very weak, yet I fcrambled
out, {hot a {he-goat, brought it home, and broiled
fame of it; 1 would willingly have flewed it and
made fome broth, but had no pot.

farm 27. All this day I was afliified with an ague ;
thirfly, yet could not help myl'elf to water; prayed
to God in thefe words, Lord, in pity look upon me,
Lord loam mercy upon me, have mercy upon me! After
this I fell afleep, which I found had much refrefhed'
me when I awaked: I fell afleep a fecond time, and
fell into this {trange and terrible fort of dream :

Methought I was fitting on the fame fpot of
ground, at the outlide of the wall, where I fat-when-
the florm blew after the earthquake, and that I {aw
a man defcending from a great black cloud and a-
light upon the ground : He was all over as bright as
a flafh of fire that a little before furrounded him ',
his countenance inconceivably terrible; the earth,
as it were,trembled when he {tepped upon the ground ;
and flafhes of fire feemed to fill all the air. No fooner
I thought him landed upon the earth, but with a
long {pear or other weapon he made towards me,
but firft afcending a rifing ground, his voice added
to my amazement,'when I thought I heard him pro-i
nounce thefe dreadful words, Unhappy wretcb .'fl'eing
Ill t/Je/e tbz'ngr bow not [wag/2t the to repentance, 2/2014.
jbalt immediately die. In pronouncing this dreadful
{entence, I thought he went to kill me with the {pear
that was in his hand. '

Any body may think it impoflible for me to exprefs
the horrors of my mind at this vifion, and even when
I awaked, this very dream made a deep impreflion
upon my mind. The little divine knowledge I had
I received from my father's inl'ttuetions, and that was
worn out by an uninterrupted feries of, feafaring im-
piety for eight years (pace; except what ficknefs for-
ced from me, I do not remember I had one thou ht of
lifting up my heart towards God, but rather ad a
certain Rupidity of foul, not having the leall: fenl'e
of fear of the Omnipotent Being when in difirefs, nor
of gratitude to him for his deliverances. Nay, when
I was on the dcfperate expedition on the defert Afri-
can fliore, I cannot remember I had one thought of
what would become of me, or beg his confolation
and alfiftance in my fufi'erings and dil'trefs. When
the Portugal captain took me up, and honourably ufed
me, nay, farther, when lwas even delivered from
drowning, by efcaping to this ifland, I never looked
upon it as a judgment, but only {aid I was an unfor-
tunate dog, and that is all. Indeed fome fecret tranf-
ports of foul I had, which was not through grace,
but only a common flight of joy, thatI was yet alive,
when my companions were all drowned ; and no
Other joy could I conceive but what is common with
the failors over a bowl of punch after they have
efcaped the greatefl dangers.

The likelihood cf wanting for neither food no:
conveniencies might have called upon me for a
thankful acknowledgment to Providence. Indeed the
growth of my corn touched me with fome fenfe, but
that foon wore ofl' again: The terrible earthquake

pointed to me as it were the finger of God, but my.

dreadful amazement continued no longer than its
duration. But now when my fpirits began to link

I
under the burden of a {irong diliemper, and I could
leifurely view the miferies of death prefent themfelves
before my eyes, then' my awakened confcience began
to reproach me with my pail: life, in which I had fo
wickedly provoked the jufiice of God to pour down
his vengeance upon me.

Such refleelions as thefe opprefl'ed me even in the
violence of my diftemper; forne prayers I uttered,
which only proceeded from my fear of death; but
when I confidered my father's advice and prophecy,
I could not forbear weeping; for he told me, 1/14!
at I did peg/{[1 in myfdly, I flmu/d not only be deprived
9)" God': bleflx'ng, but brave time enough to reflee? upon
my defiying bi: iryimfliom, and Ibis in a wretebed time
tuber: name could be? me. And now concluding it to
be fulfilled, having no foul in the ifland to admini-
Ilzer an comfort to me, I prayed however earnefily
to the Lord that he would help me in this my great
calamity ; and this, I think, was the firfl: time I
prayed in fincerity for many years. But now I mull:
return to my journal.

june 28. Something refrelhed with fleep, and the
(it quite off, I got up. My dream (till occafioned in
me a. great confiernation, and fearing that the ague
might return the fucceeding day, 1 concluded it a
time to get fomething to comfort me. I filled a cafe
bottle with water, and fet it within the reach of my
bed, and to make it more nourifliing and lefs chilly,
I put {ome turn into it. The next thing I didwas to
broil me a piece of goat's flefh, of whichI eat butlittle.
I was very weak, however walked about, dreading
the return of my diiiemper, and at night I (upped.
on three of the turtle's eggs, which I waited and:
cat, begging God's blefling therewith. '

After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again out of
doors with my gun, but fo weak that I fat down
and looked at the fea, which was fmooth and calm.

h
WhileI continued here thefe thoughts came into my
mind :

In what manner is the produftion of the earth and
fea, which I have feen to much of ? From whence
came myfelf and all other creatures living, and of
what are we made ?

Our beings were afi'uredly created by fome Ai-
mighty invifible power, who framed the earth, the
fea, and air, and all therein ; but what is that

power ?

Certainly it mnft follow that God has created it
all. Yet, faid I, if God has made all this, he mufl:
be the ruler of them all, and what is relating there-
to; for certainly the power that makes mutt indif-
putably have a power to guide and direel: them.
And if this be {0, (as certainly it mutt) nothing can
happen without his. knowledge or appointment.
Then, furely, if nothing happens without God's ap-
pointment, certainly God has appointed thefe my
fufi'erings to befal me. And here I fixed my firm
belief, that it was his will that it {hould be f0; and
then proceeded to inquire, why fhould God deal
with me in this manner? or what had I done thus
to deferve his indignation ?

Here confcience flew in my face, reprehending
me as a blafphcmer, crying with a loud and piercing
voice, Umvort/Jy ear-etch! dare you q/k <<what you have
done .9 Look upon your pq/I ljfi, and fie wbat you bane
left undone. All: thyfelf, why thou wert not long
agoin the mercilefs hands of death? Why not
drowned in Yarmouth Roads, or kilied in the fight
when the {hip was taken by the Sallee man of war?
\Vhy not entombed in the bowels of wild beafts on
the African coaft, or drowned here, when all thy
campanions {uflered ihipwreck ?

Struck dumb with thefe refieelions, I rofe up in a
penfive manner, being {0 thoughtful that I could not
go to fleep; and fearing the dreadful return of. my
diftemper, it caufed me to remember that the Bra-
filians ufe tobacco for almoi'c all difeafes. I then went '
to my chefl: in order to find fame, where heaven no
doubt direeted me to a cure for both foul and body,
for there I found one of the bibles, which till this
time I had neither leifure nor inclination to look
- into; I took both the tobacco and that out of the
chefl: and laid them on the table. Several experi-
7 ments did' I try with the tobacco; firfl: I toOk a
" leaf and chewed it, but it being very green and
" {trong almolt fiupified me ; next I lteeped it in
fome rum an hour or two, refolving when I went to
(I bed to take a dofe of it; and in the third plaCe, I
burnt fome over a pan of fire, holding my note over
it fo long asI could endure the lealt heat withcut
,V fuffoeation.

_' In the intervals of this operation, though my head
1 Was giddy and diflurbed at the tobacco, I took up
" the bible to read : No fooner did I open it, but there
'1 appeared to me thefe words, Call or; me in the (lay of

trouble, and I will deliver, and t/Joujbalt glorify me.

' At firfi this fentence made a very deep impreflion
on my heart, but foon wore offing-din, when I con-
fidered the word deliver was foreign to me'; and as
, the children of Ifrael faid, when theyywere promifed
flefh to eat, Can God/bread a table in the wildernefr .7
' In like manner I began to fay, Can God himfelf
deliver me from this defolate ifland ? However, the
'~. words would fiill return to my mind, and after made
,. a great impreflion upon me. As it now was very
' late, and the tobacco had dozed my head, I was in.
elined to fleep, but before I would lie down, I fell
: on my knees, and implored the promife that God
_3 had made to me in the holy fcriptures, that? I call-
: ed upon bin: in the day a trouble, be would deliver me.
=1 With much difiiculty after drank the rum, where-y
" in I had fieeped the tobacco, which flying in (my
: head very violently, threw me into fuch a profoungl -
- I . . " "
fleep, that it was three o'clock the next day before
I awaited, or rather, I believe, I flept two days, ha-
ving certainly loft a day in my own account, and I
could never tell any other way. When I got up, my
fpirits were lively and cheerful, my {tomach much
better, being very hungry ; and, in lhort, no fit re-
turned the next day, which was the 29th, but I found
myfelf much altered for the better.

The 30th I went abroad with my gun, but not far,
and killed a fea fowl or two, refembling a brand-
goofe, which yet I cared not to eat when I brought
them home, but dined on two more of the turtle's
eggs. In the evening I renewed my medicine, ex-
cept not taking that quantity, neither did I chew of
the leaf, or hold my head over the fmoke; yet the
next day I had a little fpice of the cold fit, which was
on the lit of July.

3'uly 2. Itook my medicines as I did the firll time.

711/}, 3. The fit quite left me, but very weak. In
this condition I often thought of thefe words, 1 will
deliver tbee ; and while at fome times I would think
Of the impoflibility of it, other thoughts would <re-
prehend me for difregarding the deliverances I had
received, even in the mall orlorn and dillrefl'ed con-
dition. What regard had I to God's abundant mer-
cies .9 Had I done my part? He bad delivered me, but
I bad not glorified bim ; as much as to fay, I had not
owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance,
and how could I expeet a greater ? So much did this
fenfibly touch my heart, that I gave God thanks for
my recovery from ficknefs in the molt humble pro-
firation.

july 4. This morning I began .ferioufly to ponder
on what is written in the New Teltament, refolving to
read a chapter every morning and night, as long as
my thoughts would engage me; but when foon after
I fet about this work ferioully, I found my heart
deeply afi'eeted with the impiety of my pail: life.

"a
db Words that I thou ht were fpoken to me in my
PS23m, reviv'ed, All the/g: thing: have not brougbt the:
to repentance .- After this, I begged of God to allifl:

1 me with his hol fp'irit in returning to my duty;
.' when perufin t e {criptures one day, I came to
r? thefe words, '9 ba: exalted a Prince and 'a Saviour,
- to give repentance and to give remfflen : Immediately
; I laid down the book, and with uplifted hands to
deg eaven, loudly cried, O 'Hefled jefiu, tbou Son 'qf
- David, jefm, thou exalted Prime and Saviour, give me

3' epenta'nce.' And now indeed I prayed with a true
{is enfe of my condition, and a more Certain hope
founded on the word of God ; now I had a different

2 fenfe of thefe words, Call on m and 1 will deliver
on 3 that is, from the dreadful load of uilt which
'3' Opprcfi'ed my finful foul, and not from a olitary life,
which might rather be called a blefling (feeing I

5; wanted neither food nor raiment) than living among

i the race of human-kind, furrounded with fo much
opprellion, mifery, and alilielion; and in a word, I

i,' came to this conclulion, That a deliverance from rm
was a much: greater blelling than a deliverance from

i. afllielion. But again I proceed to my journal.

To the 14th of 72:1)>>, I walked about with my gun,
} a little and a little at a time, having been reduced to
it, the greatelt extremity of weakncls. The- applica-
[ tion and experiment I ufed were perfeEURtly new ; nei-
"ti-ther could I recommend it to any one's praetice ;

.; f for though it carried off the fit, it very much weak-
'ened me, and I had frequently convullions in my
-" erves and limbs for fome time. From hence I
-3534 earned, that going abroad in rainy weather, efpe-
fcially when it was attended with ftorms, and hurri-
"ll canes of wind, was molt pernicious to health. In

to make a tour round -my_kingdom, in order, to make
new difcoveries.

- The 15th of .7111): I began my journey.- I. firft
went to the creek, where I had brought my rafts on
fhore, and travelling farther, found the tide going
no higher than two milesup, where there wasa little
brook of running water, on the banks of which were.
many pleafant favannas or meadows, plain, fmooth,
and covered with grafs : 0n the rifmg parts, where
I' fuppofed the water did not reach, I. perceived a
great deal of tobacco growing to a very {irong (talk.
Several Other plants I likewife found, the virtuesof-
which I did not underltand; but a long time I
fearched for the cafl'ava root, which -I knew the In-
dians in that climate made their bread of, but all in
vain. There were feveral plants of aloes, though at]
that time I knew not what they were ;_ likewife I faw
feveral fugar-eanes, but imperfeet for. want of culti-
vation. With thefe few difcoveries I came back
that night, and flept contentedly in my little cattle.

The next day, being the 16th, going the fame
way, and farther than the day before, I found the
country more adorned with woods and trees. Here
I perceived different fruits, which lay in very great
abundance. The melons in plenty lay on the ground,
and clufters of grapes, ripe and very rich, fpread'
over the trees. You may imagine I was glad of
this difcovery, yet eat very fparingly, left I lhould
throw-myfelf into a flux or fever. As for the grapes,
I found them of excellent ufe; for when I hadydried
them in the fun, which preferved them as dried rai--
fins are kept, they proved very wholefome and nou-
rifhing, and ferved me iri' thofe feafons when no
grapes were to be had.

The night drawing on apace, I afcended up a tree,
and flept very comfortably, though it was the firfl'.
time I had lain out of my habitatit'm. And when
the morning came, I proceeded with great .ple'afure
on my way, travelling about four miles, as I ima-
gined, by the length of the valley, directing my
courfe northward, there being a ridge of hills on the
1 {outh and north tide of me. At the end of this val.
? ley I came to an opening, where the country fee'med
to defcend to the well: T hereI found a little fpring
of frelh water proceeding out of the fide of a hill,
with its cryltal flreams running direetly ealt. And
indeed here my fenfes were charmed with the mail:
lovely objeet nature could afford; for the country
appeared fo flourithing, green, and delightful, that
, to me it feemed like a planted garden. I then defcend-
ed on the fide of that delicious vale, where I found
abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon and Citron trees,
but very wild and barren at that time; the juice
of which I afterwards ufed to mix in water, which
made it very cool and refrefhing. And now I
was refolved to carry home and lay up a [lore of
grapes, limes, and lemons, againft the approaching
wet feafon: So laying them up in feparate parcels,
and then taking a few of each with me, I returned to
my little cafile, after having {pent three days in this
journey: But before I got home, the grapes were {0
hruifed that they were utterly fpoiled; the limes in;-
dced were good, but few could I bring away.

59:1); 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned
thither again ; but to my great furprife found all the
grapes fpread about, trod to pieces, and abundance
eaten, which made me to conclude there were wild
creatures thereabouts. To remedy this, I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon
the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure
and dry in the fun; and having well loaded myfelf

with limes and lemons, I returned once more to my
old place of refidence. ~

And now it was, that contemplating on the fruit-
fulnefs of the valley, the pleafantnefs of the fituation',p

$0~ ROBINSON CRUSOE.

the fecurity from fiorms on that fide the water, and
the delightfulnefs of an adjacent wood, I concluded
Iwas fettled in the worlt part of the country, and
therefore was thinking to remove my habitation. But
when I confidered again, that though it was pleal'aut,
it was not by the fea-fide, where there was a polIibi-

lity, fome time or other, a {hip might either be driven ,

to, or fail by that coaft; and that to inclofe myfelf
among hills and woods mull: certainly fruflrate all

hopes of a deliverance, I refolved to let my callle ?

remain where Providence had firll: afligned it. Yet

{0 ravilhed wasI with this place, that I made me a .'

little kind of bower, furrounding it at a diltance
with a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well
flaked and filled with bullrufhcs ; and having {pent

a great part of the month Of July, I think it was the "

firfl of Auguft before I began to enjoy my labour.

Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes to be dry, I took
them from the trees, and they proved excellent good
raifins of the fun; the rnofl of which I carried to my
cave; and happy for me I did [0, by which I faved
the bell. part of my winter food.

Aug. 14. It began to rain this day; and though I
had made me a tent like the other, yet having no
flielter of a hill to keep me from florms, nor a cave
behind me to retreat to, I was obliged to return to
my old cafile. Still the rain continued more or lefs
every day till the middle of Oelober; and fometimes
fo violently that I could not l'tir out of my cave
forneveral days. This feafon I found my family to
incrcafe -, for one of my cats that ran away from me,
and whcm I thought had been dead, returned about
Augufl, with three kittens at her heels, like herfelf,
which I thought flrange, becaufe both my cats were
fr males, and the wild cars of the ifland feemed to be
of a different kind from our European cats; but from-
.thefe cats proceeded luch numbers, that I was forced

to kill and deflroy them, as I would do wild beads or

' vermin.

 

To the 26th of this month I could not fiir out, it
raining incefiantly; when beginning to want food,
I was compelled to venture twice, the firfl: of which
I {hot a goat, and after found a very large tortoife.
' The manner of regulating my food was thus: A
bunch of raifins ferved me for breakfaii; a piece of
goat's flefh or turtle broiled for my dinner; and two
or three turtle's eggs for my (upper. While the rain
' lalted, I daily worked two or three hours at enlar-
: ging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards
' one fide till I came to the outlide of the hill, and
' made a door or way out, which came beyond my
fence or wall, and fo I came in and out this way,
{ But after I had done this, I was troubled to fee my-
, {elf thus expofed, though I could not perceive any
1 thing to fear, a goat being the biggell: creature I had
~ {een upon this ifland.

Sept. 30. Calling up my notches on tn poft, which
amounted to 365, [concluded this to e the anni-
verfary of my' landing; and therefore humbly pro-
[lrating myfelf on the ound, confefling my fins,
acknowledging God's rig teous judgments upon me,
and praying to jefus Chrifl: to have mercy on me, I
fafted for twelve hours till the going down of the fun 5
and then eating a bifcuit and a bunch of grapes, laid
me on the bed, and with great comfort took my
night's repofe. Till this time, having no fenfe of reli-
gion, I never dii'tinguifhed the Sabbath-day; but now
I made a longer notch than ordinary for the days of
refl, and divided the weeks as well as I could, though
I found I had loll a day or two in my account. Soon
after, my ink failing, I omitted a. daily memoran-
dum of indifferent things, and comented myfelf to
write down only the mofl: remarkable events of my
life. The rainy and dry feafons appeared now re-
gular to me, and experience taught me how to pro-

02
vide for them ; yet, in one thing I am going to re.
late, my experience very much failed me. You may
call to mind what I have mentioned of fome bar-
ley and rice which I had faved ; about thirty flalks
of the former, and twenty of the latter; and at that
time the fun being in its fouthetn pofition going front
me together with the rains, made me conclude it a
very proper {eafon to fow it. Accordingly, [dug up
a piece of ground with my wooden fpade, and divid-
ing it in two parts, {owed about two-thirds of my
feed, preferving by me about a handful of each. And
happy it wasI did (0, for no rains falling, it was
choked up, and never appeared above the earth till
the wet feafon came again, and then it grew as if it
had been newly fown.

I was refolved {till to make another trial; and
feeking for a moifter piece of ground near my bower,
there I {owed the refl of my feed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox, which having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, yielded a
noble crop, and fprung up very pleafantly. Part of
the feed I had yet faved, not daring to venture all;
and my crop amounted to above half a peek of each
fort. But by this time I found the proper feafons to
low in 3 and that two feed-times and two harvclts I
might expeel: every year. .

No fooner were the rains over, and the flakes,
which I had cut from the trees, {booting like willow
trees the firit year after lopping their heads, than I
was ignorant of the tree I cut them from ; but they
grew {0 regularly beautiful, that they made a molt
lovely appearance, and llouriflned fo in three years
time, than]: refolved to cut fome more; andlthefe
foon growing made a glorious fence, as in order I
{hall obferve. .

' And now I perceived that the feafon of the year
might generally be divided, not into fummer and Win-
ter as in Europe, but into wet and dry feafons, as in
this manner :

As the winds happened to blow, i'o the wet feafons'
would continue longer or (hatter; but when I found
the ill confequence of being abroad in the rain, I

took care beforehand to furnilh myfelf with provi-
fions, and during the wet months {at within doors
as much as poilible; and in this time I contrived
to make man things that I wanted, though it was
with much lahour and pains before I could accom-
plilh them. The firit I tried was to make abaiket,
but all the twigs I could get proved fq brittle, that .
I could not then perform it. But now it proved of
excellent advantage to me, that, when a boy, I took
great delight in {landing at a bafket-maker's in the
fame town where my father lived, to view them at
work, and like other boys, curious to fee the man-
ner of their working thefe things, and very oificious
to ailill, I perfcflly learned the method of it, and;
wanted nothing but the tools 5 and then it came
C 3
into my mind that the twigs of that tree of which I
made my flakes might be as tough as fallow, willow,
and ofiers, growing in England ; and {o refolving to
make an experiment, I went the next day to my
country feat, and found fome .fit for my turn; and
cutting down numbers with my hatchet,I dried them
in my pale, and when fit to work with, carried them
to my cave, where I employed myfelf in making fe-
veral forts of baikets, to put in whatfoever I pleafed ;
it is true, they were not cleverly made, yet they ferv-
ed my turn upon all occalions.

But {till I wanted two necell'ary things; I had ne-r
ver a caflt to hold my liquor, except two rumlets al-
mofi full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary lize,
and fome fquare cafe bottles; neither had I a pot to
boil any thing in, only a large kettle, unfit to make
broth or flew a bit of meat 3 after this I wanted a
tobacco pipe, {or which lalt I found an expedient.

I kept myfelf employed in planting my fecond row
of (lakes, and worked m this wicker the dry feafon.
You may remember before, that when I travelled up
to the brook, I had a mind to fee the whole iiland;
accordingly, taking my dog, gun, hatchet, two bif.
cnit cakes, a great bunch of railins, with a larger
quantity of powder and (hot than ufual, I began my
journey ; and having pulled the vale where m bower
flood, I came within View of the (ca, lying to e welt,
when it being a clear day, I fairly defcried land, but
could not fay whether it was an ifland or acontinent.
It extended from the W. to the W. S. W. about ten
or fifteen leagues, as I concluded ; neither could I
tell what place this might be, only thought it was
part of America, and where I might have been in a
miferable condition had I landed. Again,lconfidered,
that if this was the Spanifh coatl,cet-tainly one time or
other I flzould fee fome {hip pafs by; and if it was not,
then it mutt be the favage coal't between the Spanifh
country and Brafil, which abounds with cannibals or
mameaters, that devour human-kind.

As I proceeded forward I found this fide of the
illand much more pleafant than mine, the fields fran-
grant, adorned with fweet flowers and verdant grafs,
together with feveral very fine woods. There were
parrots in plenty, which made me long for one to be
my companion ; but it was with great difficulty that
I could knock it down with my flick, and it was
fome years I kept him at home before I could get
him to call me by my name.

In the low grounds I found various forts of hares
and foxes, as I thought them, but much different from
all I had met with: Several of thefe I killed, but
never eat them, neither indeed had I any occalion,
for abounding with goats, pigeons, turtle, and grapes,
I could defy Leadenhall-market to furnifh me a
' better table; In this journe I did not travel above
two miles in a day, becaufe took feveral turns and
windings to fee what difeoveries I could make, re-
turning weary enough to the place where I defigned
to rel't all night, which was either in a tree or in a
place which I furrounded with (takes, that no wild
creature might fuddenly furprife me. When I came
to the {ea-{hare 71 was amazed to fee the fplendour
of it; its {hand was covered with (hells of the molt
beautiful fifh, and conl'tantly abounding with innu-
merable turtles and fowls of many kinds, which I
was ignorant of, except thofe called penguins. 'I
might have {hot as many as I pleafed, but was {par-
ing of my ammunition, rather chooling to kill a {he-
goar, which with'much difficulty I did, becaufe of
the flatnefs of the country. '~

Now, though this journey produced therm'enfi'pleaf-
ing fatisfaelion, yet my habitation was fe-na'tura'Lto-
me, that I did not repine. at my being feafed [on the .
worfl part of the ifland -,~ and fo travelling about 1':
miles towards the call, I get a great pile on the

4,.
{here for a mark, concluding that my next journey
fltould be on the other fide of the ifland, ealt from
my callle, and fo round till I came to my poll again.
However I took another way back, thinking I could
not mifs by having a cont'tant view of the country ;
but (came had I travelled three miles, when I de-
fcended into a very large valley, f0 furrounded with
hills that were covered with wood, that I had no guide
but by the fun, nor even then nnlefs I knew well
the polition of the fun at that time of the day. What
added to my misfortune was, the weather proved fo
hazy for three or four days as to oblige me to re-
turn to my pol'c by the fea-lide, and fo backwards the
fame way 1 came. My dog futprifed a kid in this
journey, and would have killed it, had I not pre-
vented him. I had often been muling whether I
could not get a kid or two, and {o rail'e a breed of
tame goats to fupply me after my ammunition was
'fpent. Upon which I made a collar for this little
creature with a firing made of rope-yarn which I al-
ways carried about with me ; and when I came to
my bower, there I inclofed and left him, and after a
month's time in this journey I came home to my old
habitation. '

Nobody can fuppofe otherwife but that I had a
pleating fatisfaetion when I returned to my little
caltle, and repofed myfelf in my hammock. After
this journey I relied myfelf a week; and the princi-
pal concern I then had was to make a cage for my
pretty poll; and then I began to confider the poor
kid I had left at my bower, and immediately I went
' to fetch it home. When I came there, I found the
young creature almoflt flawed; when feeding it with
branches of fuch flirubs as I could find, I tied it: as
before; but there was no occalion, for it followed me
likea dog, and as I conliantly fed it, became 'fo lov.
ing, gentle, and fond, that it commenced one of my
domeltics, and would never leave me.In

The rainy feafon of the autumnal equinox be'
now come, I kept the 30th of September in the mo
folemn manner as ul'ual, it being the third year of my
abode in the ifland. I {pent the whole day in acknow-
ledging God's mercies, in giving him thanks for make
ing this folitary life as agreeable, and lefs finful, than
that of human fociety, and for the communications of
his grace to my foul, fupporting, comforting, and en-
couraging me to depend upon his providence, and"
hope for his eternal prefcnce in the world to come.

Before _I confidered how happy I was in this. ltate
of life, towards that accurfed manner of living I for-
merly ufed, while either I was hunting or viewing
the country, the anguilh of my foul would break out
upon me.on a fudden, and my very heart would link
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains,
the deferts I was in, and how I was a pril'oner, lock-
ed up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean,
in an uninhabited wildernefs, without hopes and
without redemption deg, and in this condition I would
often wring my hands and weep like a child; even
in the middle of my work this fit would take me,
and then I would immediately fit down and ligh,
looking on the ground for an hour or two together,
till fuck. time as my grief would be vented, by burlt~
ing out into melting tears. .

As one morning I was fuddenly pondering in my'
mind, I opened my Bible, when immediately I fixed.
my eyes upon thefe words, I will never leave tbee nor
for/21k: t/Jre! Surely, thought I, thefe- words are di-~
reeted to me, or elfe why lhould they. appear jufl: at
a moment when I am bemoaning my forlorn condi-
tion? And if God does not forfake me, what matters.
it, time he can make me more happy in'this Rate of
life than if I enjoyed the greateft. fplendour in the
world ? But while I was going to return God
thanks \for my prefent fiate, fomething feemed to-
lhock my mind, as if iehad thus faid, unworthy

.5,58 momson (mason.

wretch ! can you pretend to be thankful for a con-
dition from which you would pray to be delivered ?
Here I flopped; and though Icould not fay I thanked
the divine Majel'ty for being there, yet I gave God
thanks for placing to my view my former wicked
courfe of life, and granting me a true knowledge of
repentance. And whenever I opened or {hut the
Bible, I blefl kind Providence that direeted my goods
without my order, and for aflifiing me to fave it from
the power of the raging ocean.

And now beginning my third year, my feveral
daily employments were thefe : Firfl, My duty to
Heaven, and diligently reading the holy fcriptures,
which I did twice or thrice every day. Secondly,
Seeking provifion with my gun, which commonly
took me up, when it did not rain, three hours every
morning. flira'ly, The ordering, curing, referv-
ing, and cooking what I had killed or catched for
my fupply, which took me up a great part of the
day; and in the middle of the day, the fun being in
its height, it was fo hot that I could not {lit out,
f0 that I had but four hours to work in; and then
my want of tools, help, and lkill, waited a great
deal of time; for I was two-and-forty days making
a board fit for a long flielf, Whereas two fawyers,
with their tools and fawpit, would have cut feveral
out of the fame tree in half a day. But this was the
cafe, it was to be a large tree, becaufe my board was
to be broad; I was three days in cutting it down,
and two more in lopping oil" the boughs and redu-
cing it to a piece of timber-,this I hacked and hewed
off each lide till it became light to move, then I
turned it, made one tide of it fmooth and flat as a
board, from end to end, then turned it downward,
cutting the other tide, till I brought the plank to be
about three inches thick, and fmooth on both tides.
Any body may judge my great labour and fatigue.
in fuch a piece of work; but this I'went through
with patience, as alfo many other things that my cir-
cumliances made necefi'ary for me to do.

' But now came my harvefi months, November and:
December, in which I had the pleating profpeel: of
a very good crop ;but fuch was my misfortune, that
the goats and hares having. once taltcd of the fweet-
nefs of the blade, kept it fo (hurt, that it had not
{trength to (heat up into a fialk. To prevent which,
I inclofed it with a hedge, and b day {hot fame of
its devourers, and my dog, whic I had tied to the
field-gatc, keeping barking all night, frightened the
creatures away.

No fooner did I get rid of thefe, but other eneo
mics appeared, whole flocks of feveral forts of birds, \be'
who only waited till my back was turned to ruin me. '
So much did this provoke me, that I let fly and
killed three of the malefaetors, and afterwards ferved'
them as they do notorious thieves in England, hun
them up in chains as a terror to others 5 and indeed'
fo good an'cfl'cet had this, at they not only forfook
the corn, but all that part the ifland, to long as.
thcfe criminals hung there.

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of
December, which was my fecond harvcll: of the year,.
I reaped it. with a fcythe made of one of my broad
fwords. I had no great fatigue in cutting down my
firl't crop, it was fo flender, the cars of which I
carried home in a bafkct, rubbing it out with m ~
hands i'nftead of threfhing it; and when my harve '
was over, I found my half peek of feed produce near
two bufhels of rice, and two bufhcls and a half of
barley. And now I plainly forefaw that, by God's.
goodnefs, I- {hould be furnilhed with bread; but yet:-
I was concerned, becaufc I knew not how to grind or
make meal of- my corn, nor bread, neither knew how-
to bake it. Upon thefe confiderations I would not
take any of the crap, bat preferve it againlt the next

6.
feafon, and in the mean while ufe my beli endeavours
to provide myfelf with materials to make bread.

But where were my labours to end 2 aflhe want of
a plough to turn up the earth, or {ho'vel to dig it, I
conquered by making me a wooden fpade after a
particular manner; the want of a barrow, I {up-
plied myfelf by dragging over the com a great bongh
of a tree; when it was growing or fully ripe, I
was forced to fence it, mow it, Carry it home, threfh
it, part it from the chafi', and fave it; and after all
this, I wanted a mill to grind it, lieves to drefs it,
zeal} and {alt to make it into bread, and an oven to

ake it. This let my brains on vork to find fome.
expedient for every one of thefe cclTaries againll;
the next harvefl.

And now, having more feed, my firll: care was to
prepare me more land. I pitched upon two large
flat pieces of ground near my cattle for that pnrpofe,
in which I fowed my feed, and fenced it with a good
hedge, which took me up three months, by which
time it was the wet feafon. While the rain kept:
me within doors, I found feveral occalions to em-
ploy myfelf ; and while at work ufed to divert my-
felf with talking to my parrot, learning him to know
and {peak his own name Poll, the firll welcome
word I ever heard {poke on the illand. I had been a
long time contriving how to make earthen vefl'els,
which I wanted extremely; and when I confidered
the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but, if I could
find any prOper clay, I might botch up a pot, (irong
enough, when dried in the fun, to bear handling,
and to hold any thing that was dry, as corn, meal,
and other things.

To be fhort, the clay I found; but it would oc-
calion the molt ferious perfon to {mile to fee what
auk'ward ways I took, and what ugly mifhapen things
I made; how many either fell out or cracked by the
violent heat of the fun, and fell in pieces when they .
were removed; fo that I think it was two months
time before I copld perfeet any thing, and after this
great fatig'ue, made two clumfy things in imitation
of earthen jars'; thefe however I very gently placed
in wicker balkets, made on purpofe for them, and
between the pot and the balltets, fiuffed it full of
rice and barley (traw, and thefe I prefumed would
hold my dried corn, and perhaps the meal when the
corn was bruifed. But as for {mallet things,l made
them with better fuccefs, which the fun baked very
hard, fuch as little round pots, flat difhes, pitchers,
and pipkins. ' '

Yet {till I wanted one thing abfolutely necefl'ary,
and that was an earthen pot, not only to hold any'
liquid thing, but to bear the lire, which none of
thefe could do. It once happened, that as I was
putting'out my fire, I found therein a broken piece
of one of my veii'els burnt hard as a rock, and red as
a tile. This made me contrive how to order my fire,
as to make it burn fome pots ; and having no notion.
of a kiln, or of glazing them with lead, I fixed three
large pipkins, and two or three pots, in a pile one
upon another; the fire I piled round the outfide
with dry wood, and on the top, till I {aw the pots
in the infide red hot, and found that they did not
crack at all; and when I perceived them perfeetly
red, I let one of them (land in the fire about five or
fix hours, till the clay melted'by the extremit of
'the heat, and would have run to glafs had I fu cred
it; upon which I flackedmy fire by degrees, till the
rednefs abated; and watching them till the morning,
I found I had three very good pipkins, and two
earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn as I
could defire.

No joy can be greater than mine at this difco-
very; for after this, I may fay, I wanted for no
fort of earthen ware. Ifilled one of my pipkins with
water to boil me fome meat, which it did admirably

t9-
well, and with a piece of kid I made me {ome' good
broth, as well as my circumflances would afi'ord me
at that time.

The next concern I had was to make me a lione-
mortar to beat fome corn in, inltead of a mill to
grind it. Here indeed I was at a great lofs, as not
being fit for a flone-cutter, and many days I {pent
to find out a great {tone big enough to cut hollow
and make fit for a mortar, and {tron-g, enough to bear
the weight of a peltle, as would break the corn-
without filling it with {and ; but all the {lones'of the
ifland being of a mouldeting nature, rendered my
fearch fruitlefs; and then I refolved to look out a
great block of hard wood, which having foon found,
1 formed with my axe and hammer, and then with
infinite labour made a hollow place in it, jult as the
Indians of Brafil make their canoes. When I had
finifhed this, I made a great peftle of iron-wood,
which I had formerly laid up againit my fucceeding
harvefi.

My next bufinefs was to make me a fieve to lift my-
meal, and part it from the bran and the hulk. Hav-
ing no fine thin canvas to {catch the meal through,
I could not tell what to do; what linen I had was
reduced to rags; I had goats hair enough, but nei-
ther tools to work it, nor did I know how to fpin it :\
At length I remembered I had fome neckcloths of ca-
lico or mufliu of the failors, which I had broughi:
out of the lhip, and with thefe I made three {mall
fieves, proper enough for the work.

And now I come- to confider the baking part in
courfe. The want of an oven I fupplied by making
fome earthen pans very broad but not deep. When
I had a mind to bake, I made a great fire upon my
hearth, the tiles of which I had made myfelf, and-
when the wood was burnt into live coals, I fpread-I
them allover it, till it became very hot -, then {weep-

' ' :r

p
ing them away, I let down my loaves, and whelm-
ing down the earthen pots upon them, drew the allies
and coals all around the outfide of the pots to con.
tinue the heat; and in this manner I ufed to bake
niy barley loaves, as well as if I had been a complete

paltry-cook, making myfelf of the rice feveral cakes
and puddings.

It is no wonder that all thefe things took me up
the heft part of a year, fince what intermediate time
I had was bellowed in managing my new harvefl and
hufbandry; for in the proper feafon I reaped my
corn, carried it home, and laid it up in the ear in my
large balkets, till I had time to rub, inflead of threfho
ing it. And now indeed my corn increafed (0 much,
that it produced me about twenty bufhels of barley,
and as'much of- rice, fo that I not only began to ufe
it freely, but was thinking how to enlarge my barns,

and was refolved to fow as much at a time as would
' be fuflicient for me for a whole year.

All this while the profpeet of land, which I had-3""
feen from the other lide of the iiland, ran in
mind. Illill meditated a deliverance from this pl _ ,
though the fear of greater misfortunes might have
deterred me from it; for after I had attained -that
place, I run the hazard of being killed and eaten by
the devouring cannibals; and if they were not (0, yet-
I might be flain, as other EurOpeans had been who
fell into their hands.. Notwithlianding all this, my
thoughts ran continually upon my acquiring that
ihore; and now I wanted m boy Xury, and the ~
long boat, with the ihoulder o mutton fail. Then I .
went to the thip's boat that had been call: a great 5
way on the ihore in the late Rorm; (he was but a
little removed, but her bottom was turned up by the
impetuolity and fury of the waves and wind. With
all the flrength I had, I tried whatever I could do,
with levers and rollers I had cut frOm the wood, to_'
turn her, and repair the damages the had fufiained.
This work took me up three or four weeks, when
finding my little lirength all in vain, I fell to under-
mine it by digging away the fand, and ('0 make it fall
down, fetting pieces of wood to thruf't and guide it
in the fall; but after this was done, I was unable to
fiir it up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move
it forwards towards the water, and to I was forced to
give it over.

Not contented with this difappointment, I began
to think whether it was not poflible for me to make
a canoe or periagua, fuch as the Indians make of the
trunk of a tree; but here I lay under particular
inconveniencies, want of tools to make it, and
want of hands to move it to the water when it was-
made ; however, to work I went upon it, {topping
all the inquiries I could make, with this very fimple
anfwer I made to myfelf, Let's firfi; make it, I'll war-
rant I'll find forne way or other to get it along when-
it is done.

I firft cut down a cedar tree, which was five feet
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the (lump,
and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end
of twenty-two feet, after which it leffened for a
fpacc, and then parted into branches. Twenty days
was I hacking and hewing this tree at the bottom,
fourteen more in cutting off the branches and limbs,
and a whole month in {haping it like the bottom
of a boat ; as for the infide, I was three weeks with-
a mallet and chifl'el, clearing it in fuch a manner
as that it was big enough to carry twenty-fix men,
much bigger than ever a canoe I {aw in my life, and
confequently fuflicient to tranfport me and all my
effects to that wiihed-for {hore I fo ardently' delir-
ed. -

Nothing remained now, but indeed the greatefi
difficulty to get it into the water, it lying about too
yards from it. To remedy the firlt inconvenience,
which was a tiling hill between this boat and the
creek, with wonderful pains and labour I dug into
the furface of the earth, and made a declivity; but
when this was done, all the {trength I had was as
infuflicient to move it, as it was when I attempted
to move the boat. Then I proceeded to meafure the
diltance of ground, refolving to make a canal, in or-
der to bring the water to the canoe, {ince I could not
bring the canoe to the water; but as this'feemed to
be impraeticable to myfelf alone, under the {pace of
eleven or twelve years, it brought. me into "Tome fort
of confideration, that I concluded it impollible to
be done, and fo this attempt was in vain alfo. And
now I faw, and not before, what llupidity it is to be-
gin a work before we reckon its cofts, or judge right

of our own abilities to go through with its perform-
ance. '

It was in the height of this work my fourth year
expired fince I was call on this ifland,, and then
I did not forget my anniverfary, but kept. it with the
fame ardent devotion I had done before: But now
my hopes being fruftrated, I looked upon this world
as a-thing I had nothing to do with; and very well
might fay, as father Abraham unto Dives, Between
me and (be? tlwre ir a gulffixed. And indeed from
the world I was feparated, from its wickednefs too,
having neither the lull of the flefh, the lull. of the
eye, or the pride of life ; I had nothin to covet, be-
ing lord, king, or emperor over the w ole country I
had in pcli'eflion, without difpute, and without con-
troul; I had loadings of corn, plenty of turtles,
timber in abundance, and grapes above meafure;
but after I was ferved, what was all the mil to me 9
The money I had by me lay as dcfiiicable drofs,
which I would freely have given for a grofs of to,
bacco-pipes, or a hand-mill to grind'my corn.my In a.
word, the nature and erperienee of thefe things die,-

kilo
tated to me this juii reflection, That the good things
of this world are no farther good to us than they are
for our ufe ; and that whatever we may heap up to
give others, we can but enjoy as much as we ufe, and
no more.

Thefe thoughts rendered my mind more eafy than
ufual. Every time I {at down to eat'I did it with
thankfulnefs, admiring the providential hand of God,
that in this wildernefs had fpread this table to me.
And now I confidered what I enjoyed, rather than
what I wanted, compared my prefent condition with
what I at firft expeelzed it {hould be; how I ihould
have done if I had got nothing out of the {hip ;
that I mult have perifhed before I had caught fiih
'or turtles, or lived, had I found them, like a'mere
favage, by eating them raw, and pulling them in
pieces with my claws, like a beaflz. I next compared
my Ration to that which Ideferved ; how undutiful
I had been 'to my parents; how dellitute of the fear
of God; how void of every thing that was good;

and how ungrateful for thofe abundant mercies I had
received from Heaven, being fed, as it were, by a mi-
racle, even as great Elijah's being fed by ravens,
and caft on a place where there was no venomous
creature to poifon or devour me. In 'fhort, mak-
king God's tender mercies matter of great confo~

'lation, I relinquiflied all fadnefs, and gave way to
contentment.

As long as my ink continued, which with water I
made lafl: as long as I could, I ufed to minute down
the days of the month on which any remarkable thing
happened. And,

Firli, I obferved, That the fame day I_ for-fool: my
parents and friends, and ran away to Hull, in order
to go to fea, the fame day afterwards, in the next

year, I was taken and made a flare by the Sallce ma
'VCfo ' '
The very day I efcaped out of the wreck of the
{hip in Yarmouth Roads, a year after,.on'the fame
day, I made my efcape from Sallee, in my patron's
fifhing-boat. '

The 30th of September, being the day of the year
I was born on, on that day twenty-{ix years after,

' was I miraculoufly faved, and cail on {here on this
ifland.

The next thin that waited after my ink, was the
bifcuit which I ad brought out of the 'fhip; and
though I allowed myfelf but one cake a day, for
above a twelvernonth, yet I was quite our of bread
for near a year, before got any corn of my own.

In the next place, my clothes began to decay, and
my linen had been - one long before; however, I
had prefierved about rec dozen of the failoa's chec-
qued thins, which proved a great refrefhmcnt tome,
when the violent beams of the fun would not'fufi'e'r
me to bear any of the feamena heavy watch-coats,
whichvmade me turn taylor, and after a miferable
botching manner, convert them into jackets. To pre-
ferve my head, I made me a cap of goat-{kit}, with
the hair outwards, to keep out the rain, which in-
deed ferved me fo well, that 1 afterwards made me
a waiftcoat and open-knee'd breeches of the fame;
and then I contrived a fort of an umbrella, covering
it with (kins, which not only kept out the heat of
the fun, but the rain alfo. Thus being eafy and fet-
tled in 'my mind, my chiefefl: happinefs was to con-
verfe with God, in molt heavenly and comfortable
ejaculations. ,

For five years after this I cannot fay any extraor-
dinary thing occurred to me. My chief employ.
ment was to cure my'raifins, and plant my barley and
rice, of both which I had a year's provifion before;
hand. But though I was difappointedfin <<my firfi
canoe, I made it at intermediate times my bufinefs'to
make a fecend, of much inferior fize 5 audit was two

years before I finiihed it. But as I perceived it would
no ways anfwer my defign of failing to the other
fhore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour
round the iiland, to fee what further dil'coveries I
could make. To this intent. after having moved
her to the water, and tried how {he would fail, I
fitted upia little mall: to her, and made a fail of
the {hip's fail that lay by me; I then made lockers
or boxes at the end of it, to put in neeefl'ary provi<<
{ions and ammunition, which would preferve them
dry either from rain or the {pray of the fea; and in
the infide of the boat I cut a long hollow place to
lay my gun, ande'gflteep it dry, made a flag to hang
over it; my umbrella'l. fixed in a Rep in the item
like a mall, to keep the heat of the fun 08' me. And
now refolving to fee the circumference of my little
kingdom, I vielualled my {hip for the voyage,
putting in two dozen of my barley bread loaves,
an earthen pot full of parched rice, a little bottle
of rum, half a goat, powder and fhot, and two
watchcoats. It was the 6th of November, in the
6th year of my reign, or captivity, that I fet out in
this voyage, which was much longer than I expee't-
cd, being obliged to put further out, by reafon of the
rocks that lay a great way in the fea; and indeed
{0 much did thefe rocks furprife me, that I was for
putting back, fearing that if I ventured further, it.
would be out of my power to return. In this con-
fulion I came to an anchor jolt off there, to which
I waded with my gun on my fhoulder, and then
climbing up an hill, which overlooked that point, I
faw the full extent of it, and refolved, to run all
hazard. '~_.

In this profpeel: from the hill, I perceived a vio-
lent current running to the call, coming very clofe
to the point, which I the more carefully obferved,
thinking it dangerous, and that, when I came to it,I-
might be drove into the fea by its force, and not able
to return to the ifland; and certainly it mull have
been ('0, had I not made this obfervation; for on
the other fide was the like current, with this differ-
ence, that it fet off at a greater diftance, when I per-
ceived there was a flrong eddy under the land, fo
that my chiefefl: bufinefs was to work out of the firll:
current, and conveniently get into an eddy. Two
days I ftaid here, the wind blowing very brilkly
E. S. E. which being contrary to the current, leaves
a great breach on the {ca upon the point; fo it was
not fit for me to keep too near the lhore, upon ac-
count of the breach, nor to fiand at too great a dif-
tance for fear of the fireams. \ That' night the wind
abating, it grew fo calm that I ventured out; but.
{urely l was to be a memento to all ralh and igno-
rant pilots; for I was no fooner come to the point,
and not above the boat's length from the fhore, but
I was got into a deep water, with a current like a
mill, which drove my boat along fo violently, that
it was impoflible for me to keep her fo much as to
the edge of it; but it forced me more and more out
from the eddy to the left of me, and all I could do
with my paddles was ufelefs, there being no wind to
help me. '

Alas! now I began to think myfelf quite loft;
fince, as the current ran on both {ides of the ifland, I.
was very certain they mult join again, and then I
had no hopes but of perilhing for want, in the fea,
after what provifions I had was fpent, or before, if a
tlorm fhould happen to arife.

\Vho can conceive the prefent anguilh of my
mind at this' calamity? \Vith longing eyes did I
look upon my'little kingdom, and thought the ifland
the pleafantefl: place in the univerfe. Happy, thrice .
happy defert, faid I, {hall I never fee thee more?
Wretched creature ! whither am I going 3 Why did
I murmur at my lonefome condition, when now I
would give the whole world to be there again?

.t
While I was thus contemplating, I found myfelf to
be driven about two leagues into the {ca ; however,
I laboured till my (trength was fpent, to keep my
boat as far north as poflibly I could to that lide of
the current where the eddy lay on. About noon, I
perceived a little breeze of wind fpring up from the
S. S. E. which overjoyed my heart the more, when,
in about half an hour, it blew a gentle line gale.
Had any thick weather fprung up, I had been loft
another way, for having no compafs on board, I
{hould never have found the way to lieer towards the
ifland, if once it had difappeared; but it proving the
contrary, I let up my mall: again, fpread my fail, and
flood away northward, as much as I could, to get
rid of the current; and no fooner did the boat be-
gin to firetch away, but I perceived by the clearnefs
of the water, a change of the current was near; for
where it was clear the current abated. To the call:
I [can faw, about half a mile, a breach of the fea
upon fome rocks, which caufed it again to l'eparate;
and as the main force drove away more fouthwardly,
leaving the rocks to the north eaflz, fo the other came
back by the repulfe of the rocks, making a {harp
- eddy, which returned back again to the north well:
with a very fwift flream.

They who have experienced what it is to be re-
prieved upon the ladder, or to be faved from thieves
jult going to take away their lives, or eife fuch who
have been in the like calamities, may guefs my pre-
fent excels of joy ; how heartily I run my boat into
the {tream of this eddy, and how joyfully I fpread
my fail to the refrefliing wind, {landing cheerfully
before it with a {mart tide under foot. By the af-
lil'tance of this eddy, I was carried above a league
home again, when being in the wake of the iflmd,
betwixt the two currents, I found the water to'be
at a fort of a Rand. About four o'clock in the after-
noon I reached within a league of the ifland, and
perceived the oints of the rock which caufed this
difailer, firetc 'ng out as I obferved before to the
fouthward, which throwing 05 the current more
fouthwardly, had occafioned another eddy to the
north; but having a fair brill: gale, I firetched a~
crofs this eddy, and in an hour came within a mile
of the (bore, where I foon landed to my unfpeakable
comfort; and after an humble proflration, thanking
God for my deliverance, with a refolution to leave
all thoughts'of efcaping alide, I brought my boat
fafe into a little cove, and laid me down to take a
welcome repofe. When I awoke, I was confidedng
how I might get my boat home; and coal'ting along '
the (bore 1 came to a good bay, which>> ran up to a
rivulet or brook, where finding a fafe harbour, I {tow-
ed her as fafe as if {he had been in a dry dock made
on purpofe for her.

And now I perceived myfelf not far from the place
where before I had travelled on foot; when taking
nothing with me except my gun and umbrella, I be-
gan my journey, and in the evening came to my
bower, where I again laid me down to tell. But it
was not long before I was awakened in great furprife
by a firange voice that called me feveral times, Robin,
Robin, Robin Cry/2e, Poor Rabin! W [were are you,
Robin Crufoe ;' W here are you :9 W bere [Jaw you been I

'80 fall was I afleep at firfl: that I did not awake

thoroughly; but half afleep and half awake, I thought
I dreamed that fomebody {poke to me. But as the

voice repeated Robinfon Crufoe feveral times, being
terribly afi'righted, I ltarred up in the utmol't con-
fufion; when no fooner were my eyes fully open,
but I beheld my pretty Poll fitting on the top of the
hedge, and foon knew that it was he that called me 3
for jull: in fuch bewaiiing language I ufed to talkand
teach him, which he fo exactly learned, that he
Would fit upon my finger, and lay his bill clofe to my
a
face, and cry, Paar Robiry'on Cry/5:, tuber: are you ?
"420': [mm you been ? How came you bare :' and fuch
like prattle as I had eonltantly taught him. But
though I knew it to be the parrot, it was a great
while before I could adjult myfelf ; firfl, I was amaz-
ed how the creature got thither, and that he {hould
fix about that place, and no where elfe. When I
was afl'ured it could be no other than my honel't Poll,
my wonder ceafed; fo reaching out my hand, and
calling familiarly Poll, the creature came to me, and
perched upon my thumb, as he was wont, conflantly
prating to me, with Poor Robiiyfm Crzybe, and How
did I came here ? and when bad I been :9 as if the
bird was overjo ed to fee me', and [0 I took him
home along wit . me.

Now though I was pretty well cured of my ram- .
bling to {ea again, yet I could wifh my boat, which
had coll: me f0 much trouble and pains, on this tide
the ifland once more, which indeed was impraeti-
cable ; and fo I led a very retired life, living near a
twelvemonthin a very contented manner, wanting
for nothing except convcrfation. As to mechanic
labours, which my necellities obliged me to, I fanci-
ed I could, upon occafion, make a tolerable carpen-
ter, were the tools I had to work withal but good.
Befides, as I improved in my earthen ware, I con-
trived to make them with a wheel, which I found
much eafier and better ; making my work Ihapeable,
which before was rude and ugly. But I thinkI was
never fo elevated with my own performance or pro-
ject, as for being able to make atobacco-pipe, which
though it proved an aukward clumfy thing, yet it
was very found and carried the fmoke perfectly well,
to my great fatisfaetion.

Alfo I improved my wicker ware, making me a-
bundance of necefl'ary balkets, which though not very
handfome, were very handy and convenient to fetchacumen): causal>>: ' 73

things home in,>> as a'lfo for-holding my"; flares, bar.
ley, rice, andother provifions. , - a

My powdervheginning to fail, made me examine
after what manner I lhould- kill the goats or birds to
live on, after it- was all and Upon which I con,
trived many ways to, en t; the goats, and fee if I
could, catch them alive, particularly a fire-goat with
young. At laft I had m delire; for making pit-
falls and traps, baited wit barley and rice, I found
one morning in one of: them an old began, and in
the other three kids, one male, the other two fes-
males. . ' , -

So boifterous was the old one, that I could not:
bring him away. But I forgot the proverb,'. Tm
banger will tame a lion: For ad I kept .him th'rep
or four days without vieiuals, and then :giyen'hina
fome water with a little corn, he would have been;
as tame as a young kid. The other creatures Iibounfl>>
wit-h ftrings together. But I had great dificulty beg
fore I could bring them to my habitation. It Was
fome time before they would feed, when throwing
them fome corn, it- fo much tempted them, that ther
began to be tame; from hence I concluded that'iE
I deligned to furnilh myfelf with goats flelh, whom
my ammunition was fpent, the tamely breeding them: .'
up like a flock of theep about my fettlement wealth: ' -'
only method I could take. I concluded alfo I mutt: ' " f

for this was to have forne inclofed piece of groufid,

or thofewithout break in. Such an undertaking
was very; great for one pair of hands; but as them
was an ab olnte neceflity, for doing it, my, firfl: we - .
was to, find a convenient piece of ground, where-there, ~v
was likely to be herbage for them' to-eat, waterjo,

- drink, and cover to keep lt)hem from the fun. ' "

.
. J '
But here I began madly, pitching upon a piece bf
meadow land fo large, that had I inclofed it with
infinite pains, this hedge or pale mull have been at
leaft two miles about. Indeed had it been ten miles
I had time enough to do it in; but then I did not
confider that my goats would be as wild in fo much
compafs as if they had had the whole i-lland, and
confequently as difficult for me to catch them. And
this thought came into my head, after [had carried
on, I believe, about fifty yards; when I refolved to
inclofe a piece of ground 150 yards in length and
ICC in breadth, fuflicient enough for as many as
would maintain me, till fuch time as my flock in-
creafed, and then I could add more ground. Upon
which, I vigoroufly profecutcd my work, and it took
me about three months in hedging the firfl piece; in
which time I tethered the three kids in the belt part
of it, feeding them as near me as poflible to make
them familiar: And indeed very often would I carry
fome ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand ; by which means they grew
fo tame, that when my inclofure was finifhed, and I
had let them loole, they would run after me for an
handful of com. This indeed anfwered my end;
and in a year and a half's time I had a flock of about
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years after
they amounted to three-andvfotty, belides what I had
taken and killed for my fultenance. After this, I
inclofed five feveral pieces of ground to feed them in,
with pens to drive them into, that I might take them

as I had occafion.
But {till I had additional blefiings, not only in

having plenty of goats 'fiefh, but milk too, which in
my beginning I did not f0 much as think of : And
indeed, though I had never milked a cow', much lefs
a goat, or feen butter or cheefe made, yet after fome
efl'ays and mifcarriages I made me both, and never
afterwards wanted.
How mercifully can the Omnipotent Power com-
fort his creatures, even in the midfl: of their greatefl:
calamities ! How can he fweeten the bitterelt provi-
dences, and give us reafon tomagnify him in dun-

cons and prifons ! What a bounteous table was here
Fpread in a wilder-net's for me, when I expeelcd no.
thing at firfi: but to perifh with hunger !

Certainly a floic would have fmiled to have feen
me at dinner. There was my royal Majefty, an abfo-
lute prince and ruler of my kingdom, attended by
my dutiful fubjeets, whom, if I pleafed, I could ei.
ther hang, draw, quarter, give them liberty, or take it
aWay. When I dined, I {cemed a king, eating alone,
none daring prefume to do fo till I had done. Poll,
as if he had been my principal court favourite, was
the onl perfon permitted to talk with me. My old
but faithful dog, now grown exceeding crazy, and who
had found no fpccies to multiply his kind upon, con-'
tinually fat at m right hand; while my two cats
{at on each tide o the table, cxpeeting a 'bit from my '
hand, as a principal mark of my royal favour. Yet
thefe were not the .cats I had brought from-1h:
{hip ; they had been dead long before, and interred
near my habitation by mine own hand : But one of
them, as I fuppofe, generating with a wild cat, thefe
were the couple I had made tame ; whereas the reflc
run into: the woods, and grew fo impudent as to re-
turn and plunder me of my flores, till fuch- time as I
{hot 3. great many, and the rcfl left me with this at.
tendance. And in this very plentiful manner'did I
live, wanting for nothing but converfation. One
thing more indeed concerned me, the want or"- my
boat. I knew not which way to get her roundaghes
ifland. I refolved one time to go along the moieby
land to her; but had any one in England met Inch .3:-

at my habit, which I think, in this place, it is very
proper to defcribe.

The cap I had upon my head was great, high, and
fhapelefs, made of a>> goat-thin, with a flap or pent-
houfe hanging down behind, not only to keep the
fim from me, but to (boot the rain off from running
into my neck, nothing being more pernicious than-
the rain falling upon the flelh in thefe parts. I had
a lhort jacket of goat-flein, whole hair hung down
inch 3 le th on either fide, that it reached to
the calves o my legs. As for (hoes and fiockings, I
had none, but made a refemblance of fomething, I
know not what to call them; they were made like
bulkins, and laced on the tides like fpatterdalhes,
barbaroufl. lhaped, like the roll of my habit. I had
on me a grand belt of goat-(kin dried, girt round
.with a couple of thongs infiead of buckles; on each
of -which, to fupply the deficiency of {word and
dagger, hung my hatchet and faw. I had another
belt, not fo broad, yet failenecl in the fame manner,
which hung over my {boulder ; and at the end of it,
under my left arm, hung two pouches, made alfo of
gOat-lkin, to hold my powder and lhot. My balket
I carried on my back, and my gun on my (boulder,
and over my head a great clumfy ugly goat-{kin
umbrella, which, however, next my gun, was the
molt necefiary thing about me. As for my face, the
colour was not {0 fwarthy as the mulattos, or as might
be expeeted from fuch a perfon as I, who took [0
little care of it, in a climate within nine or ten de-
grees of the equinox. At one time my beard grew
f0 long, that it hung down above a quarter of a

ard 5 but as I had both razors and fcifl'ars in (lore,
'-cut it all oil, and fufl'ered none to grow except a
'large pair of Mahometan whilkers, the like of which.
I had {ecn worn by fome Turks at Sallee, not, long:
enough to hang a hat upon, but of fuch a man-J
{trons fize, as would have amazed any in England to
have feen.

'But all: this was of no confequence "here, there
being none to oblerve my behaviour or habits ma
fo without fear, and without controul, I proceeded
on my. ioumey, the profecution of which took me up
five or fix days. I lit-Pt travelled along the Tea-{here

to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; but now, hair-'-
ing no boat to take care of, I Went over the had a

Here 1 think it very proper to inform my readers,
that I had two plantations in the ifland; the firft
was my little fortification, fort, or cattle, with many
large and fpacious improvements; for by this time'
I had enlarged the cave-behind me with feveral little
caves, one within another, to hold my balkets, corn,
and firaw. The piles with which I made my wall
were grown to lofty and- great, as obfcured my ha-
bitationggand near this commodious and .pleafant
fettlement lay. my two well cultivated and improved
corn fields, which kindly yielded me their fruit in
the proper fe'afon. My fecond plantation was that
near nay-country feat, or little. bower, where my
grapes flourifhed, and where, having planted many
flakes, I-made inclofures for my goat-s, f0 {trongl .
fortified by labour and time, that it was much
fireng'er than a wall, and confequently impoflible
for them to break through. As fpr my bower itfelf,
I, kept it confiantly in repair, and cut the trees: in
Inch a manner as made them grow thick and wild,
and form the molt, delightful made. .In theeentre
of- this flood my tent thus cream: I had driven four
piles-in the ground, I reading over them a, piece of
the {hip's fail, benea which I made me a fort of
,a couch, with the {kins of the creatures I had flain,
and other things; and having laid thereonone of the
.failors blankets, which I had {aved from the wreck
of the (hip, and covering myfelf with a great watchfi
coat, I took up this place for my country retreat.
.. Very frequently from this fettlement did I ufe to
vifit 'rny boat, and keep her in very good order; and
fornetimes I would venture in her a caft or two from
(hora, but no farther, lei]; either a firong current, a
fudden flormy wind, 'or fome unlucky accident,

Youmay fuppofe that after I had been here fo
long, nothing could have been more amazing than to
have feen a human creature. But one day it ha -

that, venturing too far in the ocean, was driven here
either by the violent currents or contrary winds; and
f0, not caring to Ray on this defolate ifland, was
gone back to {ca again. '

Happy was I in my thoughts that no favage had
feet: me in that place, yet much terrified, left, hav-
ing found my boat, they {hould return in numbers
and deftroy me, or at lealt carry away all my corn,
and defiroy my flock of tame goats: In a word, all
my religious hopes vaniflied, as though I thought
God could not proteei me by his power, who had f0
"wonderfully preferved me fo long.

YVhat various chains of Providence there are in the
life of man l How changeable are our affec'lions, ac-
cording to different circumflances ? We love to-
day what we hate to-morrow; We {hun one hour what
we feel: the next; and this was evident in me in the
mofl perfpicuous manner; for I, who before had {0
much lamented my condition, iii-being banilhed from
all human kind, was now almofi ready to eXpi-re,
when I confidered that a man had fer his foot 0:: this
defolatc ifland : But when Iconfitlered my {ta'tion of
life, decreed by the infinitely wife and good provi.
dence of God ; that Iought not to tlifpute my Crea-
tor's fovereignty. who had an undoubted right to go-
vern and difpofe of his creatures as he thinks conve-
nient; and that his jultice and mercy could either
punilh or deliver me: Ifay, when I conlidered all
this, I nomfortably found it my duty to trul't fincere-
ly in him, pray ardently to him, and humbly rcfign
myfeif to his divine will, ,

One morning, lying on my bed,thefe words pf the
{noted writings came again into my mind, Call upo>>
me in the day offload/e, and I will deliver thee, and
{boy/bolt glorify me. Upon this {ClitfthC, tiling more
cheerfully from my bed, I ofi'ered up my prayers in
the molt heavenly manner; and when I had done, talc-t .

pofe the next morning; and then, joining reafon
with my fear, I confidered, that this delightful and
pleafant illand might not be entirely forfaken, as I
might think ; or that the inhabitants from the other
{hore might 'fail either with defign or ncceflity by
crofs winds 5 and if the latter circuntltance, they de-
parted upon the firft- Opportunity. But [till my fear
occafioned me to think of a place for retreat, upon
an attack. I now repented that I had made the door
that came out beyond my fortification ; but refolving
to make me a fecond, I drove between that double
row of trees, which I planted about 12 years'before,
feveral piles, thickening it with pieces of timber and
old cables, and fitengthening the foot of it with
earth. which I dug out of my cave. I alfo made me
feven holes, wherein I planted my mulkets like can-
non, fitting them into frames refembling carriages.
This being finifhed with indefatigable indufhy, for
a great way every way I planted {ticks of ofier-like
,wood, about twenty thoufand of them, leaving a
large {pace between them and my wall, that I might
have room to fee an enemy, and,that they might not
be {heltered by the young trees, if they offered to
approach the outer wail. And indeed fcarce two
years had pafl'ed over my head, when there appeared
a lovely {hady grove, and in fix years it became a
thick woodperfeelly impailable. For my fafety, I
left no avenue to go in or out -, inflead of which I
fer two ladders, one to a part of the rock which was
low; and then broke in, leaving room to place ano-
_.ther ladder upon that; fo that when I took thofe
down, it was impoflible for any man to defcend with-
outfhurting himfelf ; and if they had, they would

for the moi't retired part of the ifland,.which was the
place where I hadlolt myfelf beforeomentioned, and
there finding a clear piece of land, containing three
acres, furrounded with thick woods, I worked fo
hard, that in lefs than a month's time I fenced it l'o
well round, that my flocks were very well fecured
in it, putting therein two he-goats, and two (he ones.
As this labour was occalioned.>> purely by my fear-
ful apprehenfions, on accountof, {ceing the print of
a man's foot ; not contented with what I had done,
I fearched for another place towards the weft oint
oflthe ifland, where I might alfo retain another oclt.'
Then methought I perceived a boat at a great diftance
in the far, but could not oilibly tell what it was for
want of my perfpcetive g afs. I confidered then it
was no {tr-tinge thing to fee the print of a man's foot;
and concluding them cannibals, blefl'ed God for my
being call on the Other tide of the. ill-and, where none
of the favages, as I thought, ever came. ,But when I,
came down the hill to the there, which was the S. W.
point of the ill-and, I was not only amazed, but per-
feetly confirmed in my opinion; for. the place was
fpread with lkulls, hands, feet, and bones of human
bodies; and then I perceived af ace like a circle, in
the midlt of which had been a-- re; about this fire
I conjectured thefe wretches; fat, and unnaturally fa-
crificed and devoured their fellow-creatures' '
The horror and loathfornenefs of this dreadful

fpeflacle both confounded my fenfes, and made me
difcharge the violent diforder'from my flomach. So-
that when I had vomited in a very excellive manner,
I returned towards my habitation, and in my way
thither .flzedding floods of tears, and falling: down on-
my bended knees, gave God thanks for making my
nature contrary to thefe wretches, and delivering me'
taking out of. their hands. ~ _

the thick woody parts of the country; and that I had
no occafion to difcover myfelf, who was (0 perfeelly
concealed from them; yet fuch an abhorrence did I
{till retain, that for two years after I confined myfelf
only to my- three plantations; I mean my cattle,
country feat, and inclofure in the woods. And when
in this folitary life, my dreadful apprehenlions began
to wear away, yet my eyes were more vigilant for
fear of bein futprifed, and I was cautious of firing
my gun, le being heard by thofe creatures, they
{hould proceed to attack me ; but refolving manfully
to lofe my life if they did, I went armed with three
pillols {luck in my girdle, which, added to the de-
fcription I have given of myfelf before, made me
look with a very formidable appearance.

And thus my circumflances for fome time re-
mained very calm and undil'turbed. When I com-
pared my condition to others,l found it far from
being miferable : And indeed would all perfons com-
pare their circumfiances, not with>> thofe above them,
but with thofe innumerable unhappy objeeis beneath
them, I am lure we fhould not hear thofe daily mur-
murings and complainings that are in the world. For
my part, I did not want many things : Indeed the
terror which the {wages had put me in fpoiled fome.
inventions for my own conveniencies; one of which
was really very ridiculous, except I could accomplilh
it, and happy it was they hindered me from putting
it in praetice. My delign was to brew me fome beer,
when I had neither calks fuflicient, nor could make
any, to preferve it in ', neither had I hops to make it
keep, yeafi to make it work, nor a capper or kettle
to make it boil. Perhaps, indeed, - after fame years,
I might bring this to bear, as I had done other things :\
But now my inventions were placed anather <<way 3
'and one Was, how I might deltroy fame-of thefe can;
nibals, when proceeding to their bloody-entertain:
penis; and {o faring a vietim from beingfiicti'n'eed,
he might after become my femur. ' Many were my
contrivances for this purpofe, and as many more, ob-
je'e'tions occurred after I hatched them ;' for when I
contrived to dig a hole under the place where they
made their-fire, and put therein five or fix. pounds of
gunpowder, which would confequently blow up all
thofe that were near it; why then I was 10th to {pend
{0 much upon them, lefl: it lhould not do that certain
execution I could defire; and but only afi'right, and
not kill them. Having laid this defign alide, I ro-
pofed to myfelf to lie privately in ambulh, in cm
convenient place, with my three 'guns double loaded,
and let fly at them in the midfl of their dreadful ce-
remony ; and having killed two or three of them at
every (hot, fall upon the reft fuddenl'y with my three
pillols, and not let one mother's {on efcape ;, and {6

in execution, I was not long feeking for a place very'
convenient for my purpofe, where, unfeen, I. might
behold every aaion of the favages. Here I placed my
~ two mulkets, each of which was loaded with a brace
of flugs, and four or five fmaller bullets, about the

his hands, to {bower down vengeance upon them;
and perhaps he does {0, in making them become one

doings jail, according to the knowledge which they
conceive, what authority have I to pretend to altemhe

what right have I then to concern myfelf in their
{bedding one anothcr's blood ? And, as I have lince
known, they value no more to kill and devour a cap-
tive taken in war, than vre do to kill an ox, or eat
inutt'on. From hence it followed, that thefe people
were no more murderers than Chril'tians,who many
times put whole tr00ps to the fword, after throwing
down their arms. AgainI Confidered, that ifl fell
upon them, I fhould be as much in the wrong as the

do with it, but leave it to the God of all poWer and
dominion, as I laid before, to do' therein what Icem-

~ vering me from blood--guiltin'efs, and beg ed his pithy-tr

teelion that I might never fall into theiriand's. ' i

\
Thus, giving over an .attempt whichI had rafhl
begun, I never afcended the hill on that occafion aty-
terwards; only I removed my boat which lay on the
other tide of the ifland, and every thing fueh as they
were that belonged to her, towards the eafi,.into a
little cove, that there might not be the lealt lhadow
of difcovery of any boat near, or habitation upon the
ifland. And then my cafile becamemy cell, keeping
very retired in it, except to milk my fhe~goats, and
order my little flock in the wood, which was quite
out of danger; for fure it is, thefe favages never
came here with expeetations to find any thing, and
confequently never wandered from the c'oafl ; and as
they might have feveral times been on {hore, as well
before as after my dreadful apprehenlions, I looked
back with horror to thinkdn what a. (late I might
have been, had I fuddenly met them flenderly armed,
with one gun only loaded with lmall {hot ; and how
great would have been my amazement, if, inflead-
of feeing the print of one man's foot, 1' had perceived
fifteen or twent favages, who, having once fer their
eyes'upon me, y the fwifttiefs of their feet, have,
left me no poflibility of efcaping. 'l'hefe thoughts
would link my very foul within me, fo that I would
fall into a .deep melancholy, till fuch time as the con-
fideration of my gratitude to the Divine Being, mov-
ed it from my heart i And then I fell into a content-
plation, of the fecret fprings of Providence 5 how
wonderfully we are delivered, when we are infenfible
of it 3 and when intrieated in uncertain mazes or la-
byrinths of doubt or helitation, what fecret'hint {hall

W But let it be how it will; the advantage- degf; this
conduet very eminently appeared in the latter part
of my abode on this ifland. I am a firan er in deter--
mining whence thefe fecret intimations o Pravidence
derive; yet, methinlrs, they are notonly fome proofs of
the converfe of fpirits, but alfo of the {ecret commu-
nications they are fuppofed to have with thofe that
have not pafl'ed through the gloomy vale of death.
As in thefe many anxieties of mind, the care of
my prefervation put a period to all inventions and
contrivances, either for future accommodations or
conveniencies; fo I never cared to drive a nail, cho
a (tick, fire a gun, or make a fire, left either the noifg
fhould be heard, or the {make difcover me; and,.
upon this account, I ufed to burn my earthen ware
. privately in a cave which I found in the wood, and
which I made convenient for that purpofe; but the
principal caufe that firl't brought me here was to
make charcoal, {0 that I might bake and drefs my
bread and meat, without any danger. While I was-
cuttingdown fome wood for this purpofe, I perceiv-
ed a cavity behind a very thick branch of under-
wood. Curious to look into it,.I attained-its mouth,

and perceived it fuficient for me to {tand upright in
it a but .when I had entered andmk a further view,

Wining eyes, like flaming (tars, feemed
to dart themfelves at me, lo that I made all the halt:
out that I could, as not knowin whether it was the
Devil or a monitor that had en his refidence in
that place. But when I recovered from my furprife,
I called myfelf a thoufand fools, for being afraid to
fee the Devil one moment, who had now lived a].
molt twenty years in the molt retired folitude;
and therefore, refuming all the coura I had, I
took up a flaming firebrand, and in I 111 ed again ;
when not having prOceeded above three fleps, I
was more afi'righted than before; for then I heard
a very loud figh, like that of a human creature in

the greatel't agony, fucceeded with a broken mite,acetates: meme. 89

refemhlingj words half exprell'ed, and then a broken

klf) where am I at? Into what enchanted place
have I plunged my elf, fuch as are reported to con-
tain miferable captives, till death puts an end'to their
{on-ow? And indeed Inch a great amazement was I
in, that it {hock me witha cold fweat; and had my
hat been on my head, I believe my hair would have
moved it off; But'again,'encoutaging myfelf'with
the hopes of God's roteekion, I proceeded forward,
and, by the ligcht o my firehrandfi perceived it-to'be

hut {mall and fixapelel's; at the further lide o it I
perceived a fort of an entrance, yet to low as mull;

delightful cavity or grotto, of its kind, that could he

very necefi'ary for my defence, and therefore Was re-
folvedto make this place in molt. principal maga-
zine. I brought hither two ibwling-pieces and three
muikets, leaving only five pieces at my cattle, plant-
ed in the nature. of cannon. In a barrel of gun-
powder, which I took out of the fea, I brought a-
way about fixty pounds of good powder, which was
not damaged; and thefe, with a great quantity of
lead for bullets,-I removed from my cafile to this re--
treat, now fortified both by art and nature. ;

Surely it is no Wonder, if at this time I thought
myfelf like one of the giants of old, who were faidto
live in caves and holes among the rocks, inacceflible'
to any but themfelves, or, at leaf}, moltdangerousto
attempt; {0 that now I defpifed both the cunning
and firength of the favages, either to find me out '01:
to hurt me. . , z ' ,

But I' muft not forget the old goat, who caufed my
late dreadful amazement: The poor creaturegave
up the ghoi't theday after my difcovery; and it-
being diflicult to drag him out, I dug his grave, and
honourably entombed him in the fame .place where
he departed, with as much ceremony as any Weill:
goat has been interred about the high 'mounta'm Pen:
menmoure. . - '

I think I was now in the twent -third year of my
reign, and much eafierwere my thoughts than for:
merly, conniving feveral pretty amufements and di-
verfions to pafs away theutime in a pleafant manner.
By this time my pretty Poll had learned to fpealtEng-~
liih, and pronounce is words very articulately and
plain, {0 that for many hours we ufed to chat toge-
ther after a very familiar manner, and he lived with
me no let's than twenty-fix years : My dog, who was
nineteen years old, fixteen years of which he lived
with me, died of mere old age: As for my, cats,
they multiplied {o faf't that l was forced to kill or,

me them into the woods, except two or Lhr;ec,aonmsmt cmsor; - 91

which became my particular fayOurites. I Befides
there, I continually kept two or three houfehold kids
about me, which "I did learn to feed out-of 1!;

Several {ea fowls I had alfo, which having pounded,
Icut their wing,: and growing-tame, they ufed to

which were very agreeable to me. ' . .
A But what unforefeen events fuddenly dellroy the .
enjoyments of this uncertain (late of life, when we
leaf't expeCt them ! It was now the month of Deceme
her, in the fouthern folfiice, and particular time of
my harvefi, which required my attendance in, the
fields; when going out pretty early one morning,
before it was day--light, there appeared to me, from

ing for the flood to carry them off again. You can-
not eafily exprefs the 'conf'ternation I was in at this
fight,efpecially feeing them near me; but When I per-
ceived their coming mul't be always with the current
of the ebb, I became more eafy in my thoughts, be.
ing very full convinced that I might go abroad with
fecurity all the time of flood, if they were not before
landed. And indeed this proved jufl: as I imagined;
for no fooner did they all take boat, and paddle away,
but the tide made north-weft. Before they went
off they danced, making ridiculous 'poftures and
geftutes, for above an hour, all f'tarlt naked, but
whether men or women, or both, I could not per-
ceive. When I {aw them gone I took two guns upon.
my fhoulders, and placing a couple of pittols in my
belt, with my great {word hanging by my 'fide, I

of thefe cannibals, and then faw there had been three
canoes more of the favages on fhore at: that place,
zhich, with the reit, were making over to the main

But nothing could be more horrid to me, when go-
ing, to the place of facrifice, the blood, the bones,
and other mangled parts of human bodies, appeared iri-
my light; and f0, fired with indignation,l was fully?
refolved to be revenged of the firfi that came there,
though I loft my life in the execution. It then ap-
peared to me that the vifits which they made to this.
ifland were not very frequent, it being fifteen. months
before they came again ; all this time I was very uno
early, by reafon of the difmal apprehenfions I had of
their furprifing me unawa'res; nor dared I ofl'er to fire
a gun on that tide of the ifland where they ul'ed
to appear, left taking the alarm, the favages might
return with many hundred canoes, and then God
knows in what manner I Ihould have made my end :
And thus I was a year or more before I ever-{aw any:

But to wave this; the following accident, which.
demands attention, . for, a while chided. the, force
of my thoughts in revenging myfelf on thbfe heap

It was the 16th of May (according to nay- wooden.

panied with. abundance of lightning and thunder all y '
that day, and fuceeeded. by a. very, (Emmy. night.
What occafio'ned this I could not imagine]; butas

upon it, I was fuddenly alarmed, with theanoife of-a

Such an unufual. furprife. made me {tart-up inea mi;

{aged the report>>? another gun,- , which. 1"prefently

where the current drove me away. Icould notthen"

a fpeedy deliverance. Indeed, great was my furrow
upon this oceafion, but altogether vain andfruitlefa,
However, I brought together all the'dry wood that
was at hand, and making a handfome pile let it. on

tisfied,' that, taking my gun, ,I went (tithe {MW
part of the ifland, to the fame rocks where I had been
formerly drove away by the current; in which time
the weather being perfeeily cleared up, to m great

forrow I perceived the wreck of a {hip ca away
upon thefe hidden rocks, which I found when I was

out with my boat, and which, by making .a kind of

an eddy, were the occafion of my prefervation.
Thus, what is one man's fafety is another's ruin ;

for undoubtedly this {hip had been driven on them
in the night, the wind blowing firong at E. N. E.
Now, had they perceived the ifland, as I could not
imagine they did, certainly, infiead of firing their
guns for help, they might rather have ventured in
their boat, and faved themfelves that way. Then I
thought that perhaps they had done fo upon feeing
my fire, and were cafi away in the attempt; for I
perceived no boat in the fhip. Again, I imagined,
that perhaps they had another vefl'el in company,
which, upon fignal, faved their lives, and took the
boat up. Or, lalily, that the boat might be driven
into the main ocean, where thefe poor creatures
might be in the molt miferable condition. But as all
thefe conjeetures were very uncertain, I could do no
more than commiferate their dii'trefs, and thank God
for delivering me in particular, when [0 many periih-
ed in the raging ocean.

When I confidered ferioufly every thing concern-
ing this wreck, I could perceive no room to fuppofe
any of them faved : I cannot explain, by any poliible
force of words, what longings my foul felt upon this
fight, often breaking out in this manner : Oh ! that
there had been but two or three, nay, even one perfon
faved, that we might have lived together, converfed "
with and comforted one another ! And [0 much were
my delires moved, that when I repeated thefe words,
0/)! that tbere bad been but one! my hands would
{0 clench together, and my fingers prefs the palms of

my hands ('0 clofe, that had any foft thing been be-
2 .
tween, they would have crulhed it involuntarily,
while my teeth would {trike together, and fet again'fl:
each other ['0 Rrong, that it required forne time for
me to part them.

Till the lafl: year of my being in this illand, I ne.
ver knew if any had been faved out of this {hip or -
not, and had only the afflie'tion fome time after to
fee the corpfe of,a drowned boy come on {hore at the
end of the illand whichwas next the fhipwreck:
There was nothing on him but a feaman's wailtcoat,
a pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue
linen fhirt, but no particular mark to guefs what
nation he was of ; in his pocket were two pieces of
eight and a tobacco-pipe, the lal't of which '1 pre-
ferred much more than I did the firfl. And now the
calmnefs of the [ca tempted me to venture out in m
boat to this wreck, not only to get fomething nece -
fary out of the flip, but perhaps fome living creature
might be on board whole life I might preferve. This
had fuch an influence upon my mind, that imme-
diately I went home and prepared every thing necef-'
fary for the voyage, carrying on board m boat pro-
vifions of all forts, with a good quantity 0 rum, frefh
water, and a compafs. So putting of}, I paddled the
canoe along the {bore till I came at lafl' to' the N. E:
part of the ifland, from whence I was to launch into
the ocean; but here the currents run fo violently,
and appeared fo terrible, that my heart began to fail
me, forefeeing that if I was driven into any of thefe
currents, I might be carried not only out of the '
reach or fight of the ifland, but even inevitably loll;
in the boiling {urges of the ocean. 1

So Opprefl'ed was I at thefe troubles, that I gave
o'ver my enterprife, failing to a little creek on the
ihore, where ftepping out, I fat me down on a tiling
hill, very penfive and thoughtful. I then perceived
that the tide was turned,and the flood came on, which
made it' imprae'ticable for me to go out for fo many"96 ROBINSON-03.6505.

hours. To be more certain how the lets of the
tides or currents lay when the flood came in, I af-
cended a higher piece of ground, which overlooked
the fea both ways; and here I found, that as the
current of the ebb' fet out clofe by the fouth point
of the ifland, fo the current of thefiood fet in clofe
by the lhore of the north fide, and-all that I had to
do was to keep to the north of the ifland in my
return.

That night I repofed myfelf in my canoe, covered
with my watch-coat inflead of a blanket, the hea-
vens being my teller. I let out with the firlt of the
tide full north, till I felt the benefit of the current,
whichcarried me at a great rate eaftward, yet not
with fuch impetuofity as before, as to take from me
all government of my canoe; {0 that in two hours
time I came up to the wreck, which appeared to me
in a moft melancholy manner. It feemed to be a
Spanifh velTel by its buildings, Ruck fall between two
rocks; her item and quarters beaten to pieces with
the fee, her mainmaft and foremoft were brought
oil" by the board, as much as to fay, broken than
of. As I approached nearer, I perceived a dog on
board, who perceiving me coming yelped and cried,
and no fooner did I call him, but the poor creature
jumped into the fea, out of which I took him al-
mofi famifhed with hunger and third -, {0 that when
I gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous wolf could
devour it more greedily, and he drank to that de-

gree of frefh water that he would have hurft himfelf
had I fufl'ered him.

The firfl; light I met with in the {hip were two
men drowned in the cook-room or forecaltle, in-
clofed in one another's arms: Hence I very probably
fuppofed, that when the vefl'el {truck in the dorm,
{0 high and incefl'antly did the waters break in and
over her, that the men, not being able to bearjt,'
were {trangled by the confiant ruthing in of _the

lay in the lower hold, as were plainly perceptiblhe'iby-z' '
the ebbing out of the water, yet were t002larg'er3'br'-
me to pretend to meddle with: LikewifeI perceived"
ferret-:11 chelis, which I thought might belong-toxthe'
feamen; two of them I got into my boat, "idiom
examinin what were in them. Now, had the {tern
of the lip been fixed, and the fore-part broken
off, certain Iam I {hould have made a very 'prof-
pemus voyage ; {ince by what I after found in th'efe
. two chel'ts, I could not other-wife conclude but that
the {hip mull have abundance of wealth on board::
Nay, if I mul't guefs by the courfe {he fieeted, {he
mull; have been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the'.
Rio (l6 la Plata, in the fouthern part of America, be.
yond the Bratils, to the Havannah, in the Gulph of
Mexico, and f0 perhaps to Spain. What became of
the refi of her failors, I Could not certainly tell; and
all her riches fignified nothing at that time-to'any

Sbarching farther, I found a mile, containing'about
twenty gallons, full of liquor, which with' {chiefl-
bourl got into my boat: In a cabin were-feveral .
mulltets, which I let remain there, but tool: away
with me a great powder-horn,with about four pounds
'of powder in it; I took alto a fireofhovel and tongs, '
two brafs kettles, a c0ppet pot \to make chocolate,
- and a gridiron, all which were extremely neccfl'ary
to me, et'pccially the fire-{hovel and tongs. And
{0 with this cargo, accompanied with my dOg, [came
away, the tide lerving far that purpole; andi'the
fame evening, about an hour within night, I attain-
ed the ifland, after the greatefl: toil andfatigue ima-
ginable. " ' _ :
That night I repofed my wearied limbs in the
boat, refolving the next morning to harbour'svhat?! "

had gotten an my. new'found fubterraneous'fgmm '
and not carry my cargo home to my ancient caflle.
VJ hen I had rcfreflied myfelf, and got all my effee'ts
'on lhore, Iproceeded to examine the particulars:
And ('0 tapping the caflt, I found the liquor to be a
kind of mm, but not like what we had at the Bralils,
nor indeed near fo good. At the opening of the
chelt, feveral things appeared very ufeful to me; for
infiancc, I found in one a very fine cafe of bottles,
containing the finelt and belt forts of cordial waters:
Each bottle held about three pints, curioufly tipped
with filver. Ifound alfo two pots full of the choicefl:
fweetmeats, and two more which the water had ut-
terly fpoiled. There, were likewife feveral' good
fhirts, exceedingly welcome to me, and about a dozen
'and a half of linen white handkerchicfs and coloured
neckelorhs, the former of which were abfolutely ne-
ccfl'ary for wiping my face in a hot day; and in the
till, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about
eleven hundred in all; in one of which, decently
wrapped up in a piece of paper, were lix doubloons
of gold, and fome {mall bars and wedges of the fame
.metal, which, I believe, might weigh near a pound.
In the other cheft, which I guefi'ed to belong to the
gunner's mate, by the mean circumflances that at-
tended it, Ionly found fome clothes of very little
value, except about two pounds of fine glazed pow-
der, in three flaflts, kept, as I believe, for charging
their fowling-pieccs on any occafion. So that, on
the whole, I had no great advantage by this voyage.
The money indeed was as mere dirt to me, ufelefs
and unprofitable, all which I would have freely parted
with for two or three Englilh pair of faces and Rock-
'ings; things that for many years I had not worn,
except lately thofe which I had taken off the feet- of
thofe unfortunate men I found drowned in the wreck,
'yet not fo good as Englifh (hoes, either for eafe or
ferricc: And having found in the feamens chefis
about fifty pieces of eight in rials, but no gold, I
fuppol'e what I tool: from the firll: belonged to, an
officer, to whom this feemed to have a much inferior
perfon for its owner. Well, the money, as defpicable
as itfeemed, I likewife logged to my cave, laying
it up fecurely as I did the relt of my cargo. After 'I.
had done all this, I returned back to my boat, rowing
or paddling her along till I came to my old harbour,
where I carefully laid her up, and {0 made the bell;
of my way to my cattle. When I arrived there, every
thing feemed quiet and fafe; {0 that now my only
bufinefs was to repofe myfelf after my wonted man-
ner, and take care of my domellzic affairs. But
though I might have lived very eafy, as wanting for
nothing abfolutely needful, et {till I was more vigi-
lant than ufual on account 0 the favages, never going
much abroad ; or if I did, it was to the eaft p'art :of
the ifland, where I was well afl'ured that the favages
never came, and where I might not be troubled to
carry that heavy load of weapons for my defence,
as I was obliged to do if I went the other way.

Two years did I live in this anxious cOndition, in
all which time, contrary to my former refolutions,
my head was filled with nothing but projeets and de-
ligns how I might efcape from this iiland: And 'fo
much were my wandering thoughts bent on a ram;
bling difpofition, that had I the fame boat I went
from Sallee in, I {hould have ventured once more to
the uncertainty of the raging ocean.

But certainly I was an unhappy inflance of that
part of mankind, who make themfelves wretched by
their dillatisfaetion with the Ration which God has
placed them in : for, not to take a review of my pri-
mitive condition, and my father's excellent advice,
the contrary to which Was, as I may fay, myph';
ginaljin, my following mil'takes of the fame nature
had been the means of my prefent unhappy Ration.
What bufinefs had I to leave a fettled fortune, and,
well-{locked plantation, iEmproving and increafiug,

3
where iy this time I might have been worth a hun--
dred tl.oui'and moitlores, to turn fupchargo to
Guinea, to fetth negroes, when time and patience
would have {0 much enlarged our flock at home, as
to be able to employ tltoie u-hofe more immediate
bulinefs it was to fetch them home, even to our
doors ?

But as this is commonly the fate of young
heads, fo 3 ferious relleflion upon the folly of it
ordinarily attends the cxcrcife of future years, when
the dear-bought experience of time is {0 much re-
pented of. Thus it was with me at that l'eafon; but
notwithl'tancling whatI had, or might fulfi'r upon
thefe creations, the thoughts of my deliverance
ran [0 'trongly in my mind, as feemed to check all
the (inflates of my poor reafon and phiiofoyahy. And
flow, to ulher my kind reader uith greater pleafure
to the remaining part of my relations, I flatter my-
{elf it will not be taken amifs to give him an account
of my firi't conceptions on the manner of efcaping,
and upon what foundation I laid out my foolilh
{chenics.

-I muf't now {uppofe tnyfclf retired to my cafile
after my late voyage to the litip, my frigate laid up
and feeurccl, as ufual, and my condition in the
fame manner as before, except being richer, though I
had as little occalion for riches as the Indians of Peru
had {Or gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among
them. One night in March, being the rainy i'ealbn,
in :he four-anthwenticth year of this my folitude, I
was lying on my bed awake, very well in health, with-
out dzttemper, pain, or uncommon uneafinefs, either
of body or mind; yet for all this I could nor com-
pofe myfclf to fleep the night long. All this tedious
while it is impoflible to exprel's what innumerable
thoughts came into my head : I tract-ti quite over the
whole hiftory of my life in miniat~.;u:, from my ut-
molt remembrance of things till I came to this ill-and;
and then proceeded to examine every afiion and puf-
{age that had occurred Gnce I had taken poll'ellion
of my kingdom. In my reflections upon the latter
I was comparing my happy pollute of affairs in the
beginning of my reign, to this life of anxiety, fear,
and concern, lince l difcovered- the print of a foot
in the fand; that while I continued free without no-
tions, I was capable of forming any dreadful appre-
henlions; though I ought rather to be thankful for
the knowledge of my danger,' {ince then it was the
greatell: happincfs to have fufiicient time to provide
againlt it. How ltupendous is the goodnefs of Pro-
vidence, which fet fuch narrow bounds to the fight
and knowledge of human'nature, that while men
walk in the midft of fo many dangers, they are kept
{erene and calm, by having the event of things bid
from their eyes, and knowing nothing at all of thofe
many dangers that furround them, till perhaps they
are diflipated and vanilhcd quite away ! ;

When I came more particularly to confider of the
real danger I had for fo many years efcaped; how
I had walked about in the greatefl: fecurity and tram.-
quillity at a time, perhaps, when even nothing but
the brow of a hill, a great tree, or the common_ap-
proach of night, had only interpofed between me and
the deltrut'live hands of the cannibals, who would

devour me with as good an appetite as I would ajpi... ' 'V

geon or curlcu: Surely all this, I fay, could not but
make me lincerely thankfui to my great Preferver,
whofe {ingular protec'iiou I acknowledged with the
greatefl: humility, and without which I mull: inevi-
tably have fallen into the cruel hands of thefe devour-
ers.

Thus having difcufTed thcfe thoughts in the clear-
efl: manner, according to my weak underltanding, I
next proceeded to confider the wretched nature of
thefe defiroying favages, by fceming, though with
great reverence, to inquifi: why God Ihould give up

' 3
any of his creatures to fuch inhumanity, even to bru-
tality itfelf, to devour its own kind .9 But as this was
rather matter of abltrul'e fpeculation, it better became
me to inquire, what part of the world thefe wretches
lived in; how far of? the coafl: was from whence they
came; why they ventured over fo far from home;
what kind of boats conveyed them hither ; and why
I could not order myfelf and my bulinefs f0, that I
might be as able to attain their country, as they were
to come to my kingdom ?

Never had I the leall thoughts how I {hould ma-
nage myfelf when I came thither; what would become
of me if I fell into the hands of the fivages; or how
I lhould efcape from them if they made an attempt
upon me. And fuppofing I fhould fall into their
power, what could I do for provifion, or which way
{hould ] bend my courfe? Now, though lhefe things
did exprefs the greatelt horror and confufion imagin-
able, yet hill I looked upon my prefent condition the
moil: miferable that poflibly could be, and that nothing _
could be worfe except death. For (thought I) could _
I but attain the {bore of the main, I might perhaps
meet with fome relief, or coall it along, asl did with
my boy Xury on the African fhore, till I came to
fome inhabited country, where I might meet with
fome relief, or fall in with forne Chrifiian {hip that
might take me in; and if I failed, why then 1 could
but meet with death, which would put an end to all
my miferies. But yet I mult here note, that all this
was the fruit of a diftempered mind, an impatient
temper, made defperate, as it were, by long conti-
nuance of the troubles and the difappointmentsl had
met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have found
fome living perfon to {peak to, by whom I might have
known inwhat place I was, and of the probable means
of my deliverance. Thus, while my thoughts were a-
gitated, my refignation to the will of Heaven was en-
tirely fufpcnded; {0 that I had no power to fix my
mind to any thing but the projee't of a voyage to. the
main. And indeed fo much was I inflamed upon this;
account, that it fet my blood into a ferment, and my.
pulfe beat high as though I had been in a fever; till.
' nature being, as it were, fatigued and exhaufted widr
the very thoughts of it, made me fubmit myfelf to a
filent repofe. . -
Certainly it is very "range that I did not dream of
whatI was {0 intent upon ; but inflead of which,
my mind roved on a quite different thing, altogether
foreign to it. I dreamed, that as I was ifl'uing from
my cattle one morning, as cuftomary, I perceived up-
on the ihore two canoes, and eleven fava es coming
to land, who had brought with them anot er Indian,
whom they defigned to make a facrifice of, in order
to devour; but juft as they were going to give the fa.-
tal blow, methought the poor deligned vie'tim jumpd
ed away, and ran direetly into a little thick grove be-
fore my fortification, to abfcond from his enemies 5,:
when perceiving that the others did not follow him
that way, I appeared to him ; that he humbly kneela '
ed down before me, feeming to pray for my aflift.
ance; upon whichl {howed him my ladder, made
him afcend, carried him to my cave, and he became
my fervant; and when I had gotten this man, Liai'd;
to myfelf, now {urely I may have fome hopes to ate
rain the main land; for this fellow will ferve me as a-
pilot, tell me what to do, and where I mufl: go for
provifions; what places to fliun, what to venture to,:
and what to efcape. But whenI awaked,and found all
thefe inexpreflible impreflions of joy entirely vaniflied,'
I fell into the greatefl: dejee'tion of {pirits imaginable;
Yet after all, I made this conclulion, that my only
way of efcaping was to get a lavage; and after I had
ventured my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws
of his devourers, the natural fenfe he might have of
tech a pretervation might infpire him with a "lifting!
gratitude and molt fincex; afl'eetion. But then this
4
objeetion reafonably interpofed, how can I efl'eet this
(thought I) without I attack a.wltole caravan of them,
and kill them all .3 \Vhy lhould I proceed on fuck a
def erate attempt, which before my fcruples had fug--
ge ed to me were unlawful, and made my heart
tremble at the thoughts of f0 much blood, though it
were-a means to procure my deliverance! And though
I might, according to my reafon, fuppofe that thefe
men were the real enemies to my life, and would de-
vour me, was it in their power, f0 that it was {elf-
prefervation in the highell degree to free myfelf from
this dread of life, by ac'ling in my own defence, as
if they were aetually afiaulting me; though all thefe
things, I fay, feemed to me to be of the greateflz.
weight, yet, as I jult faid before, the dreadful
thoughts of {bedding human blood, l'truck fuch a
terror to my foul, that it was a long time before I
could reconcile myfelf.

. But how far will the artlency of delire prompt us
on? For, notwithltanding the many difputcs and per-
plexities 1 had with myfelf about it, right or wrong,
I was refolved to get one of thefe favages into my
hands, let it call what it would, or lofe my life in
the attempt. Thus infpired with a firm refolution,
all my wits were at work, in the nexr place, to find
out what methods I {hould take to anfwer my delign;
and this indeed was very diificult to refolve on. Since
then I could not pitch upon any probable means for
it, I refolved continually to be in a vigilant pollute,
to perceive u hen the favages came on Ihorc, and f0
leave the tell to the event, let the opportunities of-
fer asthey would.

Such was my fixed refolution, and accordinglyI
fet myfelf upon the fcout as often as I could, till
fuel: time as I was heartily tired of it. I waited for
above a year and a half, the greatel't part of which
timeI went out to th~ well: end,and {oath-well: corner '
of the ifland almoft every day to feel: for canoes, but.
none appeared. This was a very great difcouragement,
at which I was very much concerned ; yet never did
this wear off the edge of my delire to the thing;
but the longer it feemed to be delayed, the more eager
I was for it: In a word, I was never at firl't fo careful
to {hun the loathed fight of thefe favages,asI was now
eager to be upon them. Belides, I thought myl'elE
fulliciently able to manage one, two, or three favages,
if I had them, {0 as to make them, my entire flaves,
to do whatfocvcr l {hould direct them, and prevent
their being able at any time of doing me a mifchief.
Many a time did I ufe to pleafe myfelf with this af-
fair, with long and ardent expeetations; but nothing
yet prefented; all my deep projee'ted fchemes and nu-
merous fancies vanilhed away, as though while I 1'39
tained thofe thoughts, the decree of Providence was
fuch that no favages were to come near me.

It was about a year and a half, that as I was mofl:
ferioufly mufing of fundry ways how I lhould attain
my end, one morning early I was very much furpril'ed
by feeing no lefs than five canoes all on (bare toge-
ther on my {ide the ifland, and the creatures that be-
longed to them all landed, and out of my light. Such
a number of them difconcerted all my meafures; for
feeing ['0 many boats, each of which would contain
fix, and fometimes more, [could not tell what to
think of it, or how to order my meafures to attack
twenty or thirty men fingle handed: Upon which,
much difcomforted and perplexed, I lay (till in my
came; however I put myfelf in the fame pofiure for
an attack that I had formerly provided againflz, and
was ready to enter upon an engagement, {hould they
attempt it. But when I had waited a long while, .till.
fuch time as my impatient temper would let me bear
it no longer, I fet my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and, as ufual, afcended up to the top of the hill at
two Rages; however, fianding that my head did not
' appsar above the hill, to tlfiat by any means they could

'5
not perceive me; and here 1 obferved, by the affili-
ance of my perfpeeiive glafs, no lefs than thirty in
number around a fire, fealting upon what meat they
had drell'ed : How they cooked it, or what it was, I
could not then perfet'lly tell ; but they were all dan-
cing and capering about the flames, ufing many fright-
ful and barbarous gei'tures.

But while with a curious eye I was beholding thefe
wretehes, mt {pirits funk within me, when I per-
ceived them did; two miferable creatures from the
boats to act afrefh the dreadful tragedy, as I fuppofed,
they had done before. It was not long before one of
them fell {tron the ground, knocked down, as I {up-
pol'ed with a club, or wooden {word ; for that was
their manner, while two or three others went imme-
diately to work, cutting him open for their cookery,
and illcl'. tell to devour him as they had done the for-
mer, while the lad unhappy captive was left by him-
felf till i'uch time as they were ready for him. The
poor creature looked round him with a wilhful eye,
tren'bling at the thoughts. of death, yet feeing him-
felf a lit:le at liberty, nature that very moment, as it
were, infpirt d him with hopes of life, that he {hired
away from them, and ran with incredible fwiltnefs
along: the {ands direelly to that part of the coait where
my ancient and venerable came flood.

You may imagine I was dreadfully al'frighted upon
this occalion, when, as I thought, they purfued him
in a whole body, all running towards my palace. And
now indeed I expctj'ted that part of my dream was
going to be fulfilled, and that he would certainly fly
to my grove for proteetion; but for the refi of my
dream I could depend nothing on it, that the favages
would purfue him hither and find him there. How--
ever, my i'p'nits beginning to recover,l {till kept upon
my guard, when I plainly perceived there. were but
three men out of the number that purlued him;
and I was infinitely pleafed with what fwiftnefsfiithet
poor creature ran from his purfuers, gaining {'0 much
ground of them, that I plainly perceived, could he
thus hold it for half an hour, there was not the leaf!
doubt but he would fave his life from the power of
his enemies. '
Between them and my came there was a creek, that
very fame where I failed into with all my effeetsfrorn
the wreck of the (hip, on the (keep banks of which I.
very much feared the poor vifiim would be. takenrif'
he could not fwim for his efcape; but foon wasZI out
of pain for him when he made nothing of it though
at full tide, but with an intrepid courage, [patted
on by the fenfe of danger, he plunged into the flood,
fwimming over in' about thirty firokes, andthen landq
- ing, ran with the fame wonderful firength and fwifbi
nefs as before. When the three purfuers came to;
the creek, one of them, whom I_ perceived couldf
not fwim, happily for his part, returned back to his
company; while the others with as equal courage,
but much lefs fwiftnefs, attained the other fide, as
though they were refoived never to give ,oivertheir'
purfuit. And now, or never, I thought was the time,
for me to procure a fervant, compang ~51, or afliflant y
and that I was decreed by Providence to be the infirm;
ment that {hould fave this poor creature's life. Iiit'nm
mediately defcended my two ladders with the greatc'ft:

the tell fliould hear, though at that difiance I que-
flion whether they could or not; and being out of
fight of the fmoke, they could not eafily have known
what to make of it. The other favage feeing his
fellow fall, tinpped as if he had been amazed, when
advancing towards him, Icould perceive him take
his bow from his back, and fixing an arrow to it, was
preparing to (boot at me, and without difpute might
have lodged the arrow in my breaft, had] given him
leave; but in this abfolutely necefi'ary caufe of {elf-
prefervation, I immediately fired at him, and (hot
him dead, jufi as his hand was going to draw the
fatal tiring. All this while the lavage who had fled.
before, flood (till, had the fatisfaeiion to fee his ene-
mies all, or killed, as he thought, who defigned to
take away his life: So affrighted was he with the fire
and noil'e of my piece, that he flood as it were like
Lot's wife, fixed and immoveable, without fenfe, and
without motion. This made me hallow to him again,
making the plainefi ligns I could to him to draw near-
er: l'perceived he underflood thefe tokens, by his ap-
proaching' to mu a little way, when, as if afraid I
{hould kill him too, he flopped again. Several times
did he advance, and as often flopped in this manner,
till coming more to my view, I perceived him trem-
bling, as if he was to undergo the fame fate. Upon
which I looked upon him with a fmiling countenance,
and {till beckoning to him, at length he came clofe to
me, kneeled down, kiflbd the round, laid his head
upon it, and taking me by my cot, fet the fame upon
his head ; and this, as l underflood afterwards, was
a token of {wearing to be my flave for ever. I took
him up, and making very much of him, encouraged
him in the belt manner I could; But here my work
was not yet finiihed; for I perceived the (wage whom
I knocked doivn was not killed, but {binned with
the blow, and began to come to himfelf. Upon which
I pointed to my new fervant, and {bowing him that
his enemy was not 'yet expired, he {poke fome words
to me, but what I could not. underfiand; yet being
the firil; found of a man's voice I had heard for above.
thefe twenty-fire years, they were very pleaiing to me.
But there was no time for refleetion now, the wound-
ed favage recovering himfelf ('0 far as to {it upon the
ground, which made my poor prifoner as much afraid
as before ; to put him out of which fear I prefented
my other gun at the man, with an intent to (heat
him; but my favage, for fo I mui't now call him, pre-
vented my firing, by making a motion to me to lend
him my fword, which hung naked in a belt by my
fide. No fooncr did I grant his requefiz, but.away
he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut of his
head, as dexteroufly as the mofl: accompliihed execu-
tioner in Germany could have done; for it feems thefe
creatures make ufe of wooden fwordS, made of hard
wood, which will hear an edge, enough to cut 05'
heads and arms at one blow. When this valorous
exploit was done, he came to me laughing, as a token
of triumph, delivered me my {Word again with absin-
dance of furprifing geflures, laying it along with"the
bleeding and ghaftly head of the Indian at my feet. '

The greatell afioniihment that my new {errant
conceived was the manner of killing the favage at fuch
a diflance without a bow and arrow; and fuch was
his longing defire to know it, that he firil pointed to
the dead creature, and thenmade figns to me to grant
him leave to go to him. Upon which I bid bingo,
and as well as I could made him fenfible I granted is
requeft. But when he came there; how wonderfully.

was he {tricken with amazement! Firfl he turned him
on one tide, then on another, wondering he could

was :0 {mu-3: them, that they might not be feen if it
lament-if; and which by figns againl made him
{entibic i very much approved of. Immediately he
fell to work, and never was a grave-digger more dex-
tern-.15 in the world than he was; for in an inliant,
as l nigh: lay, he l'craped a large hole in the'l'and
Wliil his hands fulficient to bury the firll in, there
he dragged him, and without any ceremony covered
him out. In like manner he ferved the other: So
that I am lure no undertaker could be more expert
in his bulinefs, for all this was done in lefs than a
quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and
inflead of carrying him direfily to my caltle at firll,
Iconveyed him to my cave on the further part of
theiflaml: And [0 my dream was not fulfilled in
that particular, that my grove {hould prove an ally--
lum or Pancftuary to him.

Weary and faint, hungry and thirfty, undoubted-
ly mull: this poor creature be, fupported chiefly by
that vivacity of fpirit, and uncommon tranfports of
joy that his deliverance occafioned. Here I gave
him bread and a bunch of railins to eat, and water
to drink, of which feeding very cheerfully, to his
exceeding refrcihment, I made him a convenient bed
with a parcel of rice firaw, and a blanket upon it, (a
bed which I ufed myfelf fometimes) and then points
ing to him made figns for him to lie down to fleep,
uponwhicb the poor creature went to take a welcome
repofe. _ ',

Indeed he was a very handfome comely young felt,
low, emremely well made, with {traight long limbs,
not too large; tall, and well fliaped; and, as I could
reckon, about twenty-fix years of age. His counc-

a
tenance had nothing in it fierce and furly, but rather
a fort of majell y in his face; and et, efpecially when
he fmiled, he had all the fweetnezs and foftncl's of an
European. His hair was not curled like wool, as
many of the blacks are, but long and black, with the
molt beautiful, yet carelefs trefles fpreading over his
fhoulders. He had a very high and large forehead,
with a great vivacity and fparkling lharpnels in his
eyes. His {kin was not f0 tawny asthe Virginians,
Brafilinns, or other Americans, but rather of a bright
dun olive colour, that had fomething agreeable in it,
though not very eafy to give a defeription of. His face
was round and plump, with a {mall nofe, very dif-
ferent from the fiatnel's of the negroes, a pretty final!
mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well fer, and white
as the driven fnow. In a word, fuch handfomc
features, and exae't fymmetry in every part made
me confider that I had faved the life of an Indian
prince, no lefs graceful and accomplifhed than the
great Oroonoko, whofe memorable behaviour, and
unhappy contingencies of life has charmed the world,
both to admiration of his pcrfon, and compallion to
his fufi'erings. .; -
But let him be either rince or peafant, all my 'h'apa
pinefs centered in this, t at I had now got a good fer-
vant, or companion, to whom, as he defervcd, 1 Was
refolved to prove a kind matter, and killing. friend.
He had not, I think, flept above an hour, when he-
awakened again, and wlnle I was milking mytgoats
hard by, out he run from the cave towards gne iii-tiny
inclofure, and laying lrimii:lf down on the ground in
the lowelt proltration, made all the antic geftures
ima inahle, to exprefs his thanklulnefs to me for lac-'-
ing is deliverer.- I confefs, though the manner of
his behaviour feemed to be ludicrous enough to'oe- '
cafion laughter, yet I was very much moved at his
aEeEtion, f0 that my heart melted within me,' fearq

ing he: might die away in excels of joy, like reprieved
malefae'tors ; and then I was incapable either to let
him blood, or adminifier phylic. And I with many
Chril'tians would take example by this heathen, to
have a laiting remembrance of thofe great benefits
and deliverances they have received, by the kind me--
diation and powerful interpolition of their benefac-
tors and deliverers : And I lhould be glad alfo if I-
had no occalion to blame many, who, inftead of
thankfully acknowledging tliefe kind of favours and
benefits, rather abufc and contemn thofe who have
been the principal infiruments to fave them from de-
l'truetion.

But leaving thofe very julI refleeiions, ' I mull re-
turn to the objeet that occafioned them : For my man,
to conclude the l alt ceremony of obedience, laid down
his head again on the ground, clofe to my foot, and
fet my other foot upon his head, as he had done be-
fore, making all the ligns of fubjeetion, fervitude
and fubmifiion imaginable, to let me underfiand he
would ferve me as lOng as his life endured. As I un-
derl'tood him in many things, I made him fenlible I
Was very well pleafed with him; and in a little time
I began to {peak to him, and learn him how to talk
to me again. In the firlt place I made him to un.
derftand his name to be Friday, becaufe it was on
that day I faved his life. Then I taught him to fay
.Mqfler, which I made him fenlible was to be my
name. I likewife learned him to fay yes and no, and
to know what they meant. I gave him fome milk in
an earthen pct, making him view me while I drank
it before him, and foaked my breadin it, andI gave
him a cake of bread, caufing him to do the like, to
which he readily confented, making ligns of the
greateit fatisfae'tion imaginable.

All that night did I keep him there, but no fooner-
did the morning light appear, than I ordered him to
arife and come along with me, with certain tokens
that I would give him fome clothes like mine; at

f
which he feemed- very glad, as being limit naked, not
{0 much as any thing to cover what ought to be con-
' cealed. As we pafi'ed by the place where the two
' men had been interred, my man pointed direeily to
their graves, {howing me the marks that he'had made
to find them again; giving me to under'ftand by ligns
that he (hould dig them up and devour them: Upon
which I appeared extremely difpleafed, cxprelTed my
utmolt abhorrence, made as if I would vomit at the
apprehenlions of it, beckoning him with my hand to
come away, which he did with the greatefi: reverence
and fubmiflion. After this I condueied him to..the
t0p of the hill, to view if the tell of the favages were
yet remaining there; but when I looked through my
'perfpee'tive glafs, I could fee no appearance-oi them,
nor of their'canbes, ii) that it was very evident they
never minded their deceafed companions whom we
had flain, which if they had, they would furely have
fearched for, or left one boat behind for them to
follow, after they returned from their purfuit.

But {till my curiufity and defire of fatisfaeiion ani-
mating my fpirit with frclh courage, I took my man
Friday with me, putting a {word into his hand, with
the bow and arrows at his back, which I perceived
he could ufe very dexteroufly, cauling him to carry
one sun for nu; and I two for'mylllf; and thus
equipped againfi all attacks, away we marched direCt-
ly to the place 03 their bloody entertainment. But
when I came there,'I was {truck wit'ithe utmoft hor-
ror at {o dreadful a {peetacleg whim: Friday indeed
was no way concerned about it, being no_ doubt, .in
his turn, one of thefe devourers. Here lay feveral.
human bones, there {everal pieces of mangled flelh,
half eaten, mangled and feorched, whillt ltreams of
blood ran promifcuoufly as waters from a fountain.
As I was mufing on this dreadful light, Friday took all '
'thev'pains he could, by particular tigns, to make me un-
der-Rand, that they had brought over {our prifoners to
feafi upon, three of whom they had eaten, and that
he was the fourth, Pointing to himfelf; that there
having been a blood battle between them and his
great king, in the ju defence of whom he was taken
pril'oner, with many others; all of thefe were carried
to feveral places to be devoured by their conquerors,
and that it was his misfortune to be brought hither
by thefe wretchcs for the fame purpofe.

After] was made fenfible of thefe things, I caufed
Friday to gather thofe horrid remains, and lay them
together upon a heap, which I ordered to be fet on
fire, and {o burned them to allies: Still I found my
man retained the nature of a cannibal, having a han-
kering fiomach after fame of the flefh ; but fuch an
exrreme abhorrence did I ~exprefs at the leafi appear-
ance of it, that he durll. not but conceal it; for I
made him very fenfible, that if he offered any inch
thing I would certainly (hoot him.

All this being done, I carried my man with me to
my cattle; and then I gave him a pair of linen draw.-
ers,which I had taken out of the poor gunner's chell:
before-mentioned, and which, with a little altera-
tion, fitted him .very well ;' In the next place I made
him a jerkin of goat's fltin, fuch as m {kill was able
to manage, though I thought myfelf en a tolerable
good tailor. I gave him alfo a cagywhich I made
of a hare-flint, very convenient and fafitionable.
Thus being clothed tolerably well, my man was no
leis proud of his habit than I was in feeing him in
it. Indeed he went very aultwardly in thefe things
at firfi, the drawers being too heavy on his thighs,
not ufed to wear any weight, and the fleevcs of the
waificoat galled his {hou'aders and the infide of his
arms; but by a little eating where he complained
they hurt him, and by ufing himfelf to them, at
length he tool: to them very well.

My next concern was where l fhould lodge him;
and that I might do very well by him, and yet be per.-
fcetly eafy myfelf, I ereeted a tent for him in the va-
cant place between my two fortifications, in the in-
fide of the hit, and outfide of the firlt; and as there
was an entrance or door in my cave, I made a formal
framed door-cafe, and a door to open on the infide.
I barred it up in the night time, taking in my ladn
ders too; fo that was my man to prove treacherous,-
there would be no way to come at me in the infide
of my innermoft .wall,without making [0 much~noife
in getting over, that it mutt neets waken me ;- for
my 'firlt wall had now a complete roof over it of
long poles, fpreading over my tent, and leaning up to
the tide of the mountain, which was again laid-
crofs with fmaller Ricks infiead of laths, and thatch-
ed over a great thickncfs with the riceflraw, which
was as firong as reeds; and at the hole of'theplace,
left on purpofe to go in or out by the ladder, I- had
placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had. been at-
tempted on the -outfide,would not have openedat all,
but have fallen down and made a great noife; and as

to my weapons, every night Itook them all to my:
bed-fide. . .

But there was no occafion for- this precaution; for
furely never mafter had a more fincere, faithful, and;
loving fervant than Friday proved to me,without paf-
(ion, fullennefs, or defign, perfeetly obliging and en'-
gaging; his afi'eetio'ns were as much tied to me as
thofe of a chiid to his parents; and I might venture to
fay, he would have 'facrificed his life forthe faring of
mine,'upon any occafion whatfoever. And indeed the
many teltimonies he gave me of this very fuificzent'ly
convinced me that I had no occafion to ufe there"
precautions. And here I could n0t but reflee't,wi'th'
great wonde'r,that however it has pleafed the Almighty
in his providence, and. in the government of the crea-
tion, to take from {0 great a part of the world of his
creatures, the noblcft ufes to which their faculties,-
and the powers of their fouls are adapted; yet that .

he' has bellowed upon them the fame reafon, afl'ec-
tions, fentiments of kindnefs and obligation, pallions
of refentment, fincerity, fidelity, and all the capa-
cities of doing and receiving good, that he has given
us; and that when he is gracioufly pleafed to ofl'er
them occafions 'of exerting thefe, they are as ready,
nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper ufes
for which they were bellowed, than we often are.
T hefe thoughts would make me very melancholy,
efpecially when I confidered how mean a ufe we
make of all thefe, even though we have our pow-
ers enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, and by
the knowledge of his word, as an addition to our un-
derflanding; and why it has pleafed the heavenly
wifdom to conceal the like faving knowledge from {0
many millions of fouls, who would certainly make a
much better ufe of it, than mankind generally-do
at this time. Thefe refleetions would {ometimes
lead me fo far, as to invade the fovereignty of Provi-
dence, and, as it were, arraign the jultice of fuch an
arbitrary difpofition of things, that {hould obfcure that
light from fome, and reveal it to others, and yet ex-
peet a like duty from all. But I clofed it up, check-
ing my thoughts with this conclufion ; fif/I, that we
were ignorant of that right and law by which thefe
{hould be condemned; but that, as the Almighty was
necefl'arily, and by the nature of his efl'cncc, infinitely
jult and holy, {o it could not be otherwife, but that
if thefe creatures were all deltined to abfence from
himfelf, it was on account of {inning againft that light,
which, as the Scripture fays, was a law to themfelves,
and by inch rules as their confcience would acknow-
ledge to be jult, though the firl't foundation was not
difcovered to us; and, fee-anally, that {till as we are
the clay in the hand of the potter, no vell'el could
thus fay to him, Why haft thou falhioned me after
this manner?

I had not been above two or'three days returned
to my callle, but my chief delign was how I {hould
bring Friday off from his horrid way of feeding, ' and
to take from him that inhuman relilh he by nature
had been accullomed to; I thought it my duty to let ,
him talte other flelh, which might the rather tempt
him to the fame abhorrence I f0 often exprefl'ed
againll'. their accurfed way of living. Upon which,
one morning, I took him out with me, with an im-
tention to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it
home and drefs it; but as I was going,I perceived a
ihe~goat lying down in the fliade, and two young kids
fitting by her. Immediately I catched hold of my man
Friday, and bidding him fiand liill, and net fiir, I pre-
fented my piece, and {hot one of the kids. My poor
fervant, who had at a dillance perceived me kill his
adverfary, and yet did not know by what means, or
how it was done, flood trembling and l'urprifed, and
looked fo amazed, that I thought he would have funk
into the earth. He did not fee the kid I aimed at,
or beheldI had killed it, but ripped up his waif'tcoat
to fee if he was not wounded, thinking my refolution
was to kill him; fo coming to me, he fell on his
knees, earnefily pronouncing many things which [did
not underfiand the meaning! of, which at length I
perceived was, that I would'iiot take away his life.

Indeed I was much concerned to fee him in that
condition where nature is upon the feverefl: trial,when
the immediate hand of death is ready to put for ever a
period to this mortal life ; and indeed {0 much com;
pailion had I for this creature, that it was with diffi.
culty I refrained from tears. But however as another
fort of countenance was neceiTary to convince him
that I would do him no harm, I took him fmilin'g
by the hand, then laughed at him, and pointing, to.
the kid which I had flain, made figns to him to fetch
it, which according! he did. No.1efs'curious ms
he in viewing how tie creature was killed, than he
had been before in beholding the Indian; while he
was admiring it I charged my gun again, and pre-
fently perceived a great fowl, like a hawk, perch-
ing upon a tree within lhot; and therefore to let Fri-
day underfland what I was going to do, I called him
to me again, pointing at the fowl, which I found to be
a parrot. I made him underfland that I would [boot
and kill that bird ; accordingly I fired, and bade him
look, when immediately he {aw the parrot fall down.
Again he flood like one amazed, notwithl'tanding all
I had faid to him; and the more confounded he was,
becaufe he did not perceive me put any thing into
my gun. Undoubtedly a thing fo utterly firange,
carrying death along with it far or near, either to
man or beai't, mufi certainly create the greatell: a-
floniihment to one who never had heard of fuch a
thing in his whole life; and really his amazt-mcnt
continued {0 long, that, had I allowed it, he would
have profirated himfelf before me and my gun, with
the greatefl worfhip and adoration. As for the gun in
particular, he would not f0 much as fuffer his fin-
gers to touch it for fevcral days after, but would come
and communicate his thoughts to it, and talk to it,
as if the fenfelefs piece had underflood and anfwered
him : All this I could perceive him do, when he-
thought my back was turned ; the chief intent of
which was to delire it not to kill him, as I afterwards
came to underfland.

I never firove to prevent his admiration, nor hinder
him from thofe comical gellures he ufed on fuch oc-
calions; but when his altonifhment was a little over,
I made tokens to him to run and fetch the parrot that
I had fliOt, which he accordingly did, ftaying fome
time longer than ufual, by reafon the bird not be-
ing quite dead, had fluttered fome way farther from
the place where he fell. In the mean time, as he was
looking for h'er,I took the advantage of charging my
gun again, that I might be ready for another marl>>:.R 031N308 081180!- I 19

that might offer itfelf; but nothing more occurred at
that time. So I brought home the kid, and, theifame
evening tool: of? the thin, and'divided the carcafe as
well as I could. Part of this fleih I ltewed, and boil-
ed in a pot I had for the purpofe; and then fptead-
ing my table, I fat down, giving my man fame to eat
too, who was wonderfully pleafed, and feemed to like
it very-well; but what Was moft, furpriflng to him
was to fee me eat falt with it; upon which he made
me underftand'that the {alt was very bad for me;
when putting a little into his mouth, he feemed to
naufeate it in fucli a manner as to {pit and {putter at
it, and then wafiied his mouth with <<freih water;
but to" {how him how contrary his iqpiniqn was to
mine, I put fome meat in my mouth without falt,
and feigned to fpit and {putter as much for the want
. of it as he had done at it; yet all this proyedof no
fignification to Friday, and it was along while be-
fore he could endures {alt in his meat or broth, and
even then but a very {mall quantity. .

Thus having fed him fufliciently with boiled meat
and broth. at that time, the next day I was refolved to
fcafl him with a waited piece ofthe kid; and having
no fpit to falten it, nor jack to turn it,,.l made ufe of
that common artifice which many of the, people ,of
England have, that is, to fet two poles upon each
tide of the fire, and one crofs on the tOp, hanging the
meat thereon with a firing, and {o turning round con>>
tinually, roaft it, as we read bloody tyrantshave
cruelly roaited martyrs. This praetice canted--great
admiration in my man Friday, being quite another
way to what the barbarous favages were accufiomed.
But when he came to taiie the fweetncfs and-tender:-
nefs of the flefli,.he exprefled his entire fatisfaetion
above .a;thoufand different ways; and, asil could
not but underfland his meaning, you maybe; fure'l
waswonderfully pleafed, efpe'cially :wlien he ,made>>

'.')
it alfo very plain. 'to' me, that he would never whilft
he lived eat tnan-'tsfflelh more. 't . '

Well, now it has high time I {hould fet my fer.
vant to work ; fo the' next day I put him to beat out
fome corn, and lift it in the fame manner as I had
dOne before; and really the fellow w-as very quick
and handy in" the execution of any thing I ordered
him to go about. ' I made him underflan'l that it was
to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him
fee me make 'and bake. it :' In fhort, he did every
thing as I ordered him in a little time as well as I
could do it myfelf. . '-

W'hen I, confidered that I had two mouths to feed
infiead of one, I was necclTarily obliged to think'that,
in confequence thereof, I muft provide more ground
for 'my'harveft, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I commonly ufed to do ; upon which I marked
out a larger 'piece of land, fencing it in the fame
manner as I had done before; in the execution of
which I mull give Friday this good word, that no man
could work more hard or willingly than he did: And
when I made him fenfible that it was for bread to
'ferve him as well as me, he then very paflionately
made me nnderltand that he thoughtI had much
more labour on me on his account than I had for my-
felf; and that no pains or diligence {hould bewant-I
ing in him, if I Would but direethim in thofe'Works
wherein he'might fucceed.

I mutt certainly own that this was the mol't plea-
fant year I ever had in this illand, for after {ome time
Friday began to talk pretty well, and underfland the
names of- thofe things which I was won't to call for,
and the places where I ufed to fend him: So that my
long' filent tongue,- which had been ufelefs-l'o many
years, except in an etclamatory manner, either for
deliverance or bleflings, now began to be occupied
in teaching and talking to my man Friday 5- for in-
deed I had fuch a fingular fatisfaa'ion in the fellow
himfelf, {o innocent did his fimple and unfeigned ho-
ncfiy appear more and more to me every day, that I
really began entirely to love him': And, for his
part, I believe there was no love loft, and that his na-
ture had been more charmed with my exceeding

kindnefs, and his afi'ee'tions more placed upon me,
than upon any other object whatfoever among his own

countrymen. Once I had a great mind to try if he had
any hankering inclination to return to his own coun-
try again : And by this time, having learned him
Englilh [0 well that he Could give me tolerable anfwers
to any queltions which I demanded, I alked him,
Whether that nation, to which he belonged, ever con-
quered in battle? This quefiion made Friday fmile,
and to which he anfwered, Yes, yes, we alwayrfigbt

the better ,- as much as to fay, they always got the
better in fight. Upon which we proceeded on the
following difcourfe. You fay, {aid 1, that you alt
_ Ways fight the better; why then, Friday, how earn:
you to be taken .prifoner .9

Friday. But for all that my n'ation beat much.

Ilia/fer. How, fay you, beat! if your nation beat.
them, how came you to be taken 3

Friday. They more many mans than my nation in
the place where me was; they take one, two, three,
'and me: My nation much over beat them in the'
yonder place, where me no was; there my nation
mans beat one, two, three great toufands.

Jllq/t'er. Then why did not your men recover you
from the hands of your enemies ?

Friday. They run one, two, or three, and me;
they make all go in the canoo; my nation have no
Canoo that time. - \

Mtg/Fer. It is very well, Friday: But what does
your nation do with the prifoners they take? Do
they carry them away, and eat them, as thefe'have

done 3
F
"Friday, Yes, yes, my nation eat mans too, eat up
a .
flIq/Iar. To what place do they carry them to be
devoured P

Friday. Go to Other nations where they think.

Ilia/Far. Do they bring them hither ?

Friday. Yes, come over hither, come over other
place.

111.90%. And have you been with them here, Friday ?

Friday. Yes, me been here ; (pointing to the north-
weft of the ifland, being the fide where they ufed to

land.)
Thus having got what account I could from my

man, I plainly untlerflzoozl, that he had been as bad as
any of the relt of the cannibals, having been formerly
among the favages who ufed to come on {hore on
the farthefi part of the ifland, upon the fame bloody
occafions as he was brought here for: And fome time
after I carried him to that place where he pointed ;
and no fooner did he come there but he prefently knew
the ground, fignifying to me, that he was once there,
when they eat up twenty men, two women, and a
young child. But as he could not explain the num-
ber in Englifh, he did it by {0 many {tones in a row,
making a fign to me to count them.

' This pail-age I have the rather mentioned, becaufe
it led to things more important and ufeful for me to
know : For after I had this fatisfarftory difcourfe with
him, my next queliion was, how far it was from the
iflmd to the lhore, and whether the canoes were not
often loft in the ocean ? to which he anfwered, there
was no danger, no canoes ever loll: ; but that after a
little way out to the fea, there was a ltrong current,
and a wind always one way in the afternoon. This
I thought at firlt to be no more than the {ets of the
tide, of going out, or coming in; but I afterwards-un-
derflood it was occalioned by the great draught and
reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, in the mouth

' .
or gulph of which I imagined my kingdom lay ; and
that the land whichI perceived to the W. and N. W.
mufl: be the great illand Trinidad, on the north 'of the
river. A thoufand queflzions (if that would fatisf y me)
did I all: Friday about the nature of the country, the
fea, the emits, the inhabitants, and what nations
were neareft them: To which queltions theT poor
fellow declared all he knew with the greatefl: open-
nefs and utmofl: fincerity. When I demanded of him
the particular names of the various nations of his
fort of pe0ple, he could only anfwer me in general
that they were called Caribbee. Hence it was I confi-
dered that thefe muft be the Caribbees, fo much taken
notice of b our maps to be on that part of America,
which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonolto
to Guiana, and In on to St. Martha. Then Friday
proceeded to tell me, that up a great way beyond the
moon, as much as to fa , beyond the fetting ofwthe
moon, which mufi: be . from their country, there
dwelt white bearded men, fuch as I was, pointing'to
my whiikers, and that they had killed much mans.
I was not ignorant with what barbarity the Spaniards
treated thefe creatures ; {'0 that I prefently concluded
it mull: be them, whofe cruelties had fpread through-3
out America, to beremembered even~to fucceeding
generations. . .. ;:
Well, you may be (are, this knowledge, which
the imperfeet information of my man had let me
to, was very comfortable to me, and made me [o cu,
rious as to aik him, how I might depart from this
ifland, and get among thofe white men ? lie-toldme
1" er, yes, 1 might go in two tamer. In two canoes,-
thought I, what does my man mean ? furely hemeans,
one for himfelf and another for me; and if not, how,
muit two canoes hold me, without being joined, and.
then put one part of my body in one, and the otherin
the Other; and indeed it was a long while before I uno'

derl'tood his meaning, which was, that it mutt be a

large boat as big as two canoes, able to bear with the
waves, and not-f0 liable to be overfet as a finall one
would be.

I believe there is no {late of life but what may be
happy, if people would but endeavour for their part to
make it fo. He is not the happieit man that has the
molt riches, but he that is content with what he hath.
Before I had my fetvant I thought myfelf miferable
till I had him ; and now] enjoyed the happy benefits
of him, I llill complained, and begged a deliverance
from a place of retirement, cafe, and plenty, where
Providence had fufliciently blelTed me: In a word,
from this time I entertained fame hopes, that one
time or other [might find an opportunity to make
my efcape from this ifland, and that this poor favage
might be a great furtherance thereto.

All the time time my man became {o intelligent
as to underlhnd and {peak to me, I {pared no pains
or diligence to inilru'tl him, acourding to my poor
{hare of knowledge, in the principles of religion,
and the adoration that he ought to pay to the true
God. One time, as I new well remember, I afked
him who made him .9 At {it-ll, the innocent creature
did-not underltantl what I meant, but rather thought
I afked him who was his father ? upon which 1 tool:
another way to make him fenfibie, by demanding of
him an anfwer to this queltion. Friday (faid I), who
is it that made the fea, this ground whereon we walk,
and all thefe hills and woods which we behold ? And
here indeed I (llll not mill: of my intention; for he told
me it was old Bummer/lee, (:he Cod whom I fuppoled
thel'e favages adored) who lived a great way beyond
all. But as for his attributes, poor Friday was an
utter tlrauger to them. He could defcribe nothing

'of dis great perfon ; and all that he could fay was,
that he was very old, much older than the tea and
land, the moon, or the liars. Friday (find I again),-
if this great and old perfon has made all things in the
world, how comes it to pals, that all things, as you
in particular, do not adore and worlhip him ? Upon
this, looking very grave, with a perfeet fweet look of
innocence, he replied, Ale/lair, all thing: ay 0- to
Mm,- by which it may reafonably be fuppofed e meant
adoration. And where, {aid 1, do the people of your
country go when thev die ? He anfwered, They all
go to Benamuckee. \Vhat, and thofc people that are
eaten up, do they go there? Said he, Bermmm'beelow
tbem dearly; we pray to Bewamucltee in de canoe, and
Bandwidth" would love me, tube): (by (at a me all up. ,

Such difcourfes as thefe had I with my man, and
fuch. made me fenfiblc that the true God is worihipa
ped, though under imperfefifimilitudes; and that the
falfe adomtion which the heathens give to their ima.
ginary deity, is as great an argument of the divine
efl'ence, as the molt learned atheiflzs, falfely fo called;
can bring againll it : For God will be glorified in his
works, let the denomination be what it will; and I
cannor be of that opinion which fome conceive, that
God lbould decree men to be damned for want of a
right notion of faith, in a place where the wifdom of
the Almighty has not permitted it to be preached; and
therefore cannot but conclude, that fince obedience
isthe belt facrifice, thefe poor creatures, a. acting by
that light and knowledge which they are pollell'ed
of, may undoubtedly obtain a happy falvation, though
not that enjoyment. with Chrill as his faints, confef-
fora, and martyrs mull; enjoy.

But laying thefe determinations alide, more fit for
the ablel't divines than me to difcufs, I began to in.

itruel my fervant in the faving knowledge of the a

true deity ; in which the directions of God'spHol'y
Spirit allit'ted me. I lifted up my hands to heaven,
and pointing thereto, told him, that the great Maker
of heaven and earth lived there : That as his infinite
power-fafhioned this world out of a confufed chaos,
and'made it in that beautiful frame which we behold,

fo he governs and preferves it, by his unbounded
knowledge, fovereign greatnefs, and peculiar provi-
dence: That he was omnipotent, could do every
thing for us, give every thing to us, and take every
thing away from us : That he was a rewarder and
pnnilher of good and evil aetions: That there was
nothing but what he knew, no thoughts fo fecret
but he could bring to light: And thus by degrees I
Opened his eyes, and defcribed to him the manner of
the creation of the world, the fituation of paradife,
the tranfgreflions of our lirfl: parents, the wicked-
nefs of God's peculiar people, and the univerfal fins
and abominations of the whole earth. When thefe
things were implanted in his mind, I told him that
as God's jufiice was equal to his mercy, he refolved
to dellroy this world, till his fort Jefus Chrifi inter-
pofed in our behalf, and to procure our redemption,
obtained leave of his heavenly Father to come down
from heaven into the world, where he took human
nature upon him, inflrue'ted us in our way to eter-
nal life, and died as a [acrifice for our fins : That he
was now al'cended into heaven, mediating for our
pardon, delivering our petitions, and obtaining all
thofe benefits which we alked in his name, by hum-
ble and hearty prayers, which were heard at the
throne of heaven. As very frequently I ufed to in-
culcate things into his mind, Friday one day told
me, that if our great God could hear us beyond the
fun, he mull then be furely a greater God than their
Benamuckee, who lived but a little way of, and yet
could not hear them, till they afcended the great moun-
tains, where he dwelt, to fpeak to him. What, faid 1,
Friday, did you go thither to {peak to him too ? He
anfwered, No, they never went that were young
men; none but old men, called their Oowokakee,
meaning the Indian priel'ts, who went to fay 0 (lo he
called faying their prayers), and they returned back,
and told them what Benamuckee faid. From hence];
could not but obferve how happy we Chrillians are,
who have God's immediate revelation for our certain
guide; and that our faith is neither milled, nor our
reafon impofed upon, by any fet of men, fuch as '
thefe Indian impellers.

But to clear up this palpable cheat to my man Fri-
day, Itold him, that the pretence of their ancient
men going up to the mountains to fay O to their
god Benamuckee, was an impol'ture ; and that their
bringing baelr an anfwer was all a {ham, if not
worfe ; for that, if there Was any fuch thing {poken
to them, furely it muft proceed from an infernal
fpirit. And here I thought it necefl'ary to enter in-
to a long difcourfe with him, which I did after this
manner:

Friday, (faid I) you mull know, that before this
World was made, there was one Almighty Power
cxifling, by whole power all things were made, and
whofe majefty {hall have no end. To be glorified
and adored by beings of a heavenly nature, he creat-
ed angels and archangels, that is, glorious fpirlts re-
fembling himfelf, to encompafs his throne, eternal-'-
ly linging forth his prail'e in the molt heavenly founds
and divine harmony : And among this heavenly
choir, Lucifer bore a great fway, as being then one
of the peculiar favourites of thefe celel'tial abodes;
but he, contrary to that duty he owed his heavenly
Sovereign, with unbounded ingratitude to his divine
Creator, not only envied him that adoration which
was his due, but thought to ufurp that throne,
which he had neither power to keep, nor title to'
pretend to. He raifed a diffention and civil war in
heaven, and had a number of angels to take his part.
Unbounded folly, ftupendous pride, thus to hOpe for
vietory, and afpire above his powerful Creator! The
deity, not fearful of fuch an enemy, yet jultly pro-
voked at this rebellion, commiflions his archangel.
Michael to lead forth thelheavenly heft, and give him:

battle ; the advantage of which was quickly perceiv-
ed, by Satan's being overthrown, and the prince of
the air (for fo the devil was called) with all his fallen
angels, driven headlong into a difmal place, which is
called hell.

The recital of this truth made my man give the
greateit attention, and he exprefi'ed a great fatisfac-
tion, by his geflures, that God had fem the devil
into the deep hole. And then I delired him to give
great heed to what I had further todi y.

No fooner (proceeded I) was God freed from,and
the heavens clear of this arch-traitor, but the Father
{peaks to the Son and Holy Spirit, who belonged to
his efl'ence, yet equal to him in power and glory, Come,
let (I: make 111(1)) (faid he) in cur 67w: image, offer our
cum Iii-weft, Gen. i. 26. to have dominion over the
creatures in the world which we have created. And.
thefe he intended lhould glorify him in heaven, ac.
cording to their obedience in this Rate of probation on
earth, which was as it were to be the fehool to train
them up for thofe heavenly manlions. Now Satan,
feeing himfelf foiled, yet that God had not taken
the power from him, as prince of the air, which
power Heaven defigned he lhould retain, whereby his
creatures might be tried ; in revenge to the tliigrzice
he had received, he tempts Adam's wife, Eve, to mile
of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which God
had forbidden. He appears to her in the fhape of a
ferpent, being then a mofi beautiful creature, and
tells her, that it was no better than an impofition
which God had put upon her and her huiband, not
to eat of that fair fruit which he had created ; that
the tal'te thereof would make them immortal, like
God himfelf, and confequently as great and power-
ful as he : Upon which {he not only eat thereof her.
leif, but made her hulband eat alfo, which brought
them both under the heavenly difpleafure.

2
Here Friday exprefl'ed a great concern : A}: .' poor
mam .' (cried he) naugbfy woman: .' naugbfy devil !
make God not [we de main, make man: like devil bim-
.fif-

Friday, (faid 1) God liill loved mankind ; and
though the devil tempted human nature fo far, he
would not fuller him to have abfolute power over
them. I have told you before of his tender love to
his people, till they, like Lucifer, difo'ocyed his com-
mands and rebelled againft him; and that even then,
how jefus Chrilt his only {on came to fave finners.
But ltill every man that lives in the world is under
temptation and trial. T he devil has yet a power, as
prince of the air, to fuggelt evil cogitations into our
minds, and prompt us on to wicked nations, that he
might glory in our dellrue'tion : Whatever evil
thoughts we have proceed from him. So that God,
in this our diltrefs, expeflstxthztt we {hould apply our-
{elves to him by fervent prayer for fpeedy redrefs: He
is not like Bcnamuckee, to let none come near him but
()owokakee ; but {offers the people, as well as priefls,
to other theml'elves at his feet, thereby to be delivero.
ed from the power and temptation of the devil.

But though at iii-ll my man Friday exprefl'ed fome
concern at the wickednefs of Lucifer, 1 found it not
{0 eafy to imprint the right notions of him in his.
mind, as it was the divine effence of God : For there
nature allilied me in all my arguments to {how to him
plainly the neeeflity of a, great firft eaufe, and over-
ruling governing power, of a feerst direfting Provii
deuce, and of the equity and reafonablenefs of . pay-
ing adoration to our Creator; whereas there appear-
ed nothing of all this in the notion of an evil fpirrt,
of his firft beginning, his nature, and. above all,. of
his inclination to evil actions, and his power to tempt
us to the like. And indeed this unlearned Indian,
by the mere force of nature, puzzled me with one
particular queliion, more than ever I could have ex-

eeted. '
P . F 5
Ihad, it feems, one day been talking to him of
the omnipotent power of God, and his infinite ab-
horrence of fin, infomuch that the Scriptures {{ka
him a confuming fire to all the workers of iniquity ;
and that it was in his power, whenever he pleafed, to
deflroy all the world in a moment, the greater part
of which are continually ofl'ending him. ,

\Vhen, with a ferious attention, he had liflzcned a
great while to what I find, after I had been telling
him, how the devil was God's enemy in the hearts
of all men, and ufcd all his malice and {kill to defeat
the good defigns of Providence, and to deitroy the
Lingdomof Chrill: in the world, and {o forth: Very
well, Mallet (laid Friday), you fay, God is lo Rrong,
11) great, is he not much llronger, much mightier than
the naughty devil ? To be lure, Friday, laid 1, God
is more wife and tironger than the ferpent: He is
above the devil, which makes us pray to him, that:
he would tread down Satan under our feet, enable us
to refill his violent temptations, and quench his fiery
darts. 7V1); tbm, (anfwered Friday quickly) ff God, a:
you/21y, 1:5: mur/aflrong, mar/J might a: l/Jt' devil, 701*}
God no kill devil, male no more tempt, no more do wicked ?

You may be certain I was lirangely furprifed at this
quefiion of my man's; and though an old man, I was
but a young dotior,and confequently very ill qualified
for a cafuilt or a refolver of intricate doubts in reli-
gion. And as it required fome time for me to Rudy
for an anfwer, I pretended not to hear him, nor to
alk him what he laid: But f0 earnel't was he for an
anfwcr, as not to forget the queflion, which he re.
peated in the very fame broken words as above. "When
Ihad recovered myfelf a little, Friday, (laid I) Godwill
at [fl pang/l) lzimflwrc/y, being re/e'rvc'dfirjudgmem',
and i: to be m'l into tire bottom/y} pif, to remain in fire
we -/:3/!ing. But all this did not fatisfy Friday, for rei
turning upmi me, he repeated my worls, Rzflrm at
[4/], me no under/712ml ; but ruby not kill devil mow,
not'Ei/I devil great, great wbile ago .9 Friday, (raid I);
you may as well all: me why God does not kill you:
and me, when by our wicked aetions' we {0 much
offend his divine Majelty : He gives us time to re-
pent of our fins, that thereby we may obtain pardon.
At thefe words, obtain pardon, Friday mufed a great
. while, and at lull, looking me liedfaltiy in the face ::
IVe/I, well, (laid he) that's very well; f} you, I, devil,
all wicked mam, all pre/Erw, repent, Gad pardon all.

Indeed here I was run down to the lafi: extremity,
when it became very evident to me, how mere natural
' notions will guide reafonable creatures to the know-
ledge of a deity, and'to the homage due to the fur
preme being of-a God ; but however nothing but di-
vine revelation 'ca'n'form 'the' knowledge of Jel'us
Chrilt, and of t'a'lretlemption purchaled' for us, of
the Mediator of'the new covenant, and of an inter-
eeflbr at the footl'tool of God's throne; and there-
fore the gofpel of bur Lord and Saviour Jefus Chrift,
that is, the word and fpirit of God, promifed fomhe
guide and fant'lifier of his people, are the molt ne-
ceflitry ittltriietors of the fouls of 'men, in the fav'
ing knowledge of the Almighty, and the means to'
attain 'etern'al happinefs.

And now I found it necefl'ary-to put an end to this-
difcourl'e between my man and me,'for which purpofe
l rofe up haliily', and made as if I had fome occalion
to go out, fending Friday for femething that-was a'
good way off. I then fell on-my knees, and befeeche
ed God that he would infpire'me ['0 far, as to-guide .
this poor lavage in the knowledge of Chrifl, to anfwet"
his queltions more clearly, that his confcience might
be convinced, his eyes opened, and his foul- faved.
"Then he returned again, [entered into a very long
difcourfe- with him,upon the fubjeel: of the world's re-
demptionlhby the Saviour of it, and the doetrine of re.

capacity, the reafon why our Saviour took not on
hint the nature of angels, but rather the feed of A-
braham ; and how upon that account the fallen an-
gels had no benefit by the redemption; and lafllv,
that he Came only to the loft lhcep of the houfe of
Jfrael, and the like. God knows, I had more fun-
eerity than knowledge in all the ways I took for this
poor I ndian's infiruCtion ; and l mull acknowledge,
that I believe every body that acts upon the fame
principle will find, that in laying heavenly truths
opcn before him, linformed and inllrucled myfelf
in many things, that either I did not know, or had
not perfeeily conlidered of before. But as I {catch--
ed into them for the information of this poor favage,
Io they naturally occurred to my mind; and my in-
quiry after many things was more affeelionate than
ever I felt in my life: So that however this poor
creature might be improved by tn infiruaion, CCTv
rain it is, that upon this account had great reafon
to blefs kind Providence for {ending him to me. His
company allayed my grief, and made my habitation
tore comfortable: And when I reflected that this
folitary life, to which I had been fo long confined,
had not only moved me to look towards heaven, but
made me the inllrument, under ProvidenCe, to fare
the life, and for atmht I knew, the foul of a poor fa-
vage, by bringing im to the knowledge of Jefus
Chrill: ; this caufed a fecret joy to fpread through c-
very part of my foul, and I frequently rejoiced that
ever I was brought to this place, which I once
thought to be the moll miferahle part of the world.
In this thankful frame of mind did I afterwards con-
tinue while I abode on the illand; and for three
years did my man and I live in the greateft enjoy-
ment and happinefs, by our converfation one with
another. And indeed I believe the favage was as
good a Chriltian as I 3 and I hope we were equally
penitent; and fuch penitents that. were comforted
andreltored by God's Holy Spirit; for now'we110111115011 CRnSOE. '1 3,3,

had the word of the Lord to inflruft us in the right
way, and we were no farther or? the afhftance of the
Holy Gholt, than if we had been on the L11Ll1fl1 there.

By the eonllant applicationsl made of the Scriptures,
as I read them to my man 1. rtday I eatneltly endea.
voured to make him underliand every part of them,
as much as lay 1n my power. He alto, 011 the other
hand, by his yer lerious quellions and inquiries,
m ade me a much getter p rolicient 1n Scripture know-
ledg e than I {hould have been by my own plivate
reading and lludy. I mull nOt omit :.nozher thimr
proceeding from the experience I had 111 my retire-'
ment , it was, that infinite and inexpreilible blelling,
the knowledge of God through Chrilt Jefus, which
was to plain and eafy to be u11derllood,as immedi-
ately to direet roe to car1y on the great work of (in-
ccre re ret tance {or my tins, and laying hold of 11811-
1iour for eternal life, to a practical ltated reforma-
tion, and obedience to all God' 5 inititutions, without
the alliltance of a reverend and orthodox divine; and
Llpccially by this fame i illruelion, lo to enlighten

1l1is lavage Lreature as to make him Inch :1 good
Chrillian as 1ery fen could exceed him , and there
was only this great thing wanting, that I had no au-
thority. to adminil'ter the holy facrament, that heaven-
ly participation of Chrill' 5 body and blood; yet, how-
ever, we 1clted ou1lelves content that God would ae-
cht our defines, and, aCCOrding to our faith, have
mercy on us,

But what we. wanted one way was made up in ano-
ther, and that was univerfal peace in our little church.
VVc' had; no difp tit-es not wranglinos about the nature
and? quality of- the holy, bleflizd, and undivided Tri-
nity , no niceties in Lloe'trine, or fchemes of church-
gavernment; up four and morofe diilenters to impofe.
more fublimated notions upon us, nor. pedant {Op hif--
1:13, to confound us with unintelligible myfi'cerics;P But
inflicadxof all this, we enjoyed- the molt certain guide
to heaven, that is, the word of God; befides which
we had the comfortable views of his Spirit leading
us into the truth, and making us both willing and-
obedient to the infiruftion of his word. And as the
knowledge and praetice of this are the principal
means of falvation, I cannot fee what it avails any
Chrifliatt church or man in the world, to amufe
themfelves with every indifferent fpeculation and opi-
nion, except thofe who have a mind to difplay their
particular vanity and afi'ee'tation.

You may well {uppofe that, by the frequent dif-
conrfes We had together, my man and I became moll:
intimately acquainted, and that there was but very
little that I could fay, but Friday underliood, {peaking
very lluently, though indeed it was but broken Eng--
lilh. And really I now took a particular pleafure in '
relating all my adventures, efpecially thofe that oc--
curred {ince my being calt on this ifland. I made
him underfiand that wonderful myltery, as he con-
ceived, of gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how
to (hoo: : l alfo prefented him a knife, which pleaf-
ed him exceedingly; making him a belt with a frog
hanging thereto, like thofe' in which we wear hang'
ers in England 3 and inltead of a hanger to put in
that frog, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only
as good, but even a better weapon upOn any occalion.
In a word, my man thus accoutred, looked upon him-
felf as great as Don (Luixote, when that celebrated
champion went to combat the windmill.

After all this, I gave him a very particular defcrip---
tion of the territories of Europe, and in a particular
manner of Old England, the place of m nativity. I'
hid before him the manner of our wo ipping God,
our behaviour to one another, and how we traded in
{hips to every part of the univerfe. 1 then told him-
my misfortunes in being fhipwrecked, {bowing him,;
as near as I could, the place where the {hip lay, which
had been long gone before. 'I brought him- to the?
ruins of my boat, which before my whole fircngth'.

could not move, but now was almol't rotten and falo
len to pieces. I obferved my man Friday to view this
boat with an uncommon curiofity, which when he
had done, he lioo'd pandering a great while and {aid
nothing. At lalt, {aid I, Friday, what makes you
ponder ('0 much? he replied, 0 lqu/ler, me fee like
170.11 tome to plate at my mviion.

I was fome time indeed before I underltood what
my mm meant ; but examining farther into it I
plainly found fu-ch another boat, refembling that, had
come to the country where he dwelt ; as much as to
fay, by his farther exnlanation, that the boat was
driven there through violent florms and {trefs of wea-
ther. It prefently came into my mind, that time Eu-
rope ln {hip having been call away, the poor diltrell'o
ed creatures were forced to have recourfe to the boat
to fave their lives; and being all, as I thought, drown-
ed, I never concerned myfelf to all: any thing about
,them, but my only inquiry was about the boat, and
what defcription my man could give of it.

Indeed Friday anfwered my demands very well,
making every thing very plain to my underlianding ;
but efpecially I was fatisfied when he told me, with
a great warmth and ardour, 0 Illa/leer, eve/Ewe vubite
mamfimn drown : Upon which I immediately alked
him, if there were any wbz'te mam, as he called
them, in the boat ? Yer, yer, (faid he) the baffle/l, very
full, white mam. How many, Friday ? {aid I. Here-
upon be numbered his fingers and counted feventeen.
And when I afked him what became of them all, and'
whether they lived or not? he replied, 1" er, Mgr/let",
tlwy all li-ve, tbey be live 'mong my nation. This plainer
information put new thoughts into my head, that
thefe mult be thofe very men, which befiore I con-
cluded had been fwallowed up in the ocean after they
had left their lhip, that had {truck upon the rocks of
my kingdom; and after efcaping the fury of the
deep; landed upon the wild (bore, and committed
themfclves to the fury of thofe devouring Indians.
The mmucr of their cruelties to one another,
which, ('tizzll'qtietttly, :13 I thought, mull he afletl with

within ms, Illlzi nulc me llill more curious to n k

obfervation which I had, made me not fol well {1.633

lied with my man Friday aslbefore; for by this ap-
pearance I made no difpute, but that if he could get;
back thither again, he would not only be unmindful
of what religion I. had taught him, but likewife of the
great obligation that he owed me for his wonder-
ful deliverance : Nay, that he would not only inform
his countrymen of me, but accompany hundreds of
them to my kingdom, and make me a miferable facri~ 5
lice, like thofe unhappy wretches taken in battle.
Indeed I was very much>> to blame to have theft: cruel
and unjull fufpicions, and mull freely own I wronged
the poor creature very much, who was quite of a con-g
trary temper; and had he that difeerning acutenefs'
which many Europeans have, he wouldhave perceived
my coldnefs and inditlei'ence, and alfo have been very;
much concerned upon this account: For as I was nova
more circumfpeet, I had much lelTened' my kindnefs
and familiarity with him 5 and while this jealoufy cone
'tinned, 1 tifed that artful way (now too much in fa-
ihion to occalion itrir'e and dillbnlion) of pumping him
daily, thereby to (iii-cover whether he Was deceitful in
his thoughts and inclinations: But certainly he had
nothing in him but what was confllient with the bell.
principles, both as a religious Chriltian and grateful
friend; and indeed I found every thing he faid was
fo ingenuous and innocent, that I had no room for fuf-
picion, and in fpite of all unealinefs, he nor only mach
me entirely his own again, but alfo caufed me much
to lament tlzat lever conceived one ill thought of him.
As we were walking up the fame hill another day,
when the weather being ('0 hazy at fea that I could
not perceive the continent, Friday, faid I, don't you
with yourfelf to be in your own Country, your own
nation, among your old friends and acquaintance 9
1" er, (fairl he) me mac}: 0 glad to be at myown nation.
And what would you do there, Friday ? (faid I) would
you tutti wild againd eat man's tlefh, and be a favage
asyou was formerly? No, no, (anfwered he, full of
concern, and fhaking his head), Friday nc'zv Irll then}

(replied 1) if you fhould offer to do all this, they will
kill you, and to manifefl their contempt of fuch in-
llruelion, may eat you up when they have done. He
then put on a grave, yet innocent and {month coun-
tenance, laying, .No, they no I'll] me, (Ivy willing low

he could not {wim fo far. But, {aid 1, I will make a
canoe for you ; 1'23 filo/lam (raid he) me go ffyon go ,-
me no go ffym/la '. Friday ! (laid I) why would you
have them eat me up, and devour your kind mailer ?
1V0, no, (laid he) me make they no out ling/761', me make
they nmrl) love'rsn ,- that is, he would tell them how
I had ilain his enemies, and thereby fared his life,
for which reafon he would make them love me ; and
then he related to me, as well as he was able, how
exceeding kind thofe of his nation were to the white,
or bearded men as he called them, who, in their
great calamity, were driven into their country.

It was from this time, indeed, I had ftrong incli-
nations to venture over, and nfe my utmolt efforts, if
pollible, to join thefe white bearded men, who un-
doubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguefe; f or (thought
I) it mull: he certainly a better and fafcr way to efcape
when there is good company, than for me alone,
from an iiland forty miles off the fhore, and without
any ailillance. Some days after, Friday and I being
at work as ufual, at the fame time diverting ourfclves
with various difcourt'es, I told him I had a boat which
I would bellow upon him, whenever he pleafed to te-
turn to his own nation -, and to convince him of the
truth of what I faid,I took him with me to the other
~tide of the ifland where my frigate lay, and then tak-
ing it from under the water (for I always kept it
funk'for fear of a difcovery), we both went into it,
to fee how it would manage fuch an expedition.
Really never'could any be more dexterous in rowing
than my faithful fervant, making the boat go as fall:
again as] could. Well now, Friday (faid I), {hall
we go to your {0 much delired nation ? But inftead
of meeting with that cheerfulnefs I expeel'ed, he
looked very dull and melancholy at my faying f0;
which indeed at firll {urprifed me, till he made me
fcnfible that his concern was about the boat's being

too fmall to go {0 far a voyage. Upon which I let
him underfland I had a much bigger; and according-
ly the next day, went to the place where the firfl boat
lay which Ilhad made, when all the {trength I had,
or art I could ufe, failed me in my attempt to get it
into the water; but now, it having lain in the fun
two-and-twenty years, and no care being taken of it
all that while, it became in a manner rotten. My
man told me, that fuch a boat would do ,very well
for the purpofe; {uificient to carry enough vittle,
tiring, bread, for that was his manner of talking. In
fhort, my mind being flrongly fixed upon my delign
of going over with him to the continent, I very plain-
ly told him that we would both go and make a boat
full as big, and more proportionable than that,
wherein he might fafely return to his own nation.
T hefe words I ohferved made Friday look {0 very
enfive, that! thought he would have fallen at my feet.
t was fome time before he could fpeak a word, which
made me ail: him what was the matter with him? He
replied, in a very loft and moving tone, Wbat bar

thong ties of friendship, which many times furpafs
thofe of ccmfanguiniry; for often we find a great
difagreement among kindred ; and when there is any
feeming regard for each other, it is very feldom true,
and (came ever laf'ting, if powerful intereil; does not
bear the fway; ad that alone is often the recalion
of the greateil hatred in the world; which is to de--
fire the death of parents and relations, for the fake
. of enjoying their fortunes: But here was no fuch
thing between my {errant and me 5 inflead of which
there was nothing but gratitude, and the Eocene":
love: He found me not only his deliverer, but his pres
ferver and comforter; not a fevcre and cruel tyrant,
but a kind, loving, and affable friend: He wanted for
no manner-of fultenance; and when he was ill, or
out of order,I was his phylician, not only for his
body, but his foul; and therefore no wonder was it that
fuch an innocent creature long lince divefled of his
former natural cruelty, lhould have an uncommon
concern at to cruel a feparation from me, which
pierced him to the very foul, and made him defire
even to die rather than live without me.

After I had told Friday, in a very carelefs manner,
that he fhould be at his liberty as foon as the boat was
made, the language of his eyes exprell'ed all imagin-
able confufion, when immediately running to one of
his hatchets which he ufcd to wear as a defenlive
weapon, he gives it into my hand with a heart {0
full that he could fcarce fpeak. Friday, (faid I) what
is it yOu mean ? What mull I do with this ? Only fill
Friday, (laid he) Friday no care 111;: long. But what

though the poor creature had faid, Alas ! my deareft,
kindelt mailer, how comes it to pafs that after having
ventured your precious life to fave me from the jaws
of devouring cannibals, like myfelf; after fuch a tender
regard to provide for me fuch comfortable nourilh-
menr, and continuing,1r f0 long a kind matter, and moll'.
finccre friend; and after making me forfake the falfe
notion of an Indian deity,and worlhip the true God in
fpirit and in truth; after'all this, I fay, how comes it
now that you are williiigto fend me away to my for-
mer courle of living, by which means undoubtedly we
ihall be dead to each Other; but greater mull: be my
misfortune, that I {hall never behold the belt friend I
have \in'this World any more ! And this certainly, though

I
he could not exprcfs himfelf fo fully, mull be his fen-
timents; for the tears ran down his cheeks in fnch a
plentiful manner, that I had much ado to refrain from
weeping alfo, when I beheld the poor creature's affec-
tion; fo that I was forced to comfort him in the belt
manner, which I did by telling him, if he was content
to abide with me, I lhould be ever willing to keep him.

After Friday's grief was fomething abated, more
fully to convince me of his affection, he faid, O .Mu/l
tar, me not (are lie in my nation, leave you Inert ,- me dejb'e
my nation learn good, (lea: all ; meaning that his delire
was for the converlion of that barbarous people. But
as I had no apol'tolic million, nor any concern about
their falvation, fo I had neither the leafl intention
or defire of undertaking it: and the firength of my
inclination, in order to efcape, proceeded chiefly from
my late difcourfe with Friday about thofe feventeen
white bearded men, that had been driven upon the
barbarian coal't, whom I defigned to join with, as a
furer means to further our efcape. To which intent
my man and I went to fearch for a pmper tree to fell,
whereof we might make a large periagua, or canoe,
to undertake the voyage : And indeed we needed not
be long in finding one fit for our purpofe, there be-
ing wood enough in the ifland to have built a fleet
of large veiTelS ; but the thing we principally wanted
was, to get one {0 near the water, that we might
launch it after it was iinilhed, and not commit f0
horrid a miftake as I had done once before.

\Vell, after a great fcarch for what was bell: and
moft convenient, Friday at laft, whofe judgment in
fuch affairs was much fuperior to mine, pitched upon
a kind of wood the molt fitting for it. To this day I
cannot tell the name of the tree I cut it from, nor
defcribe it any other way, thanpnly by faying, that it
is very like what we call fultic, or betwixt that and
the Nicaragua wood, being much of the fame colour
and fmell. But though my man exceeded me in the

knowledge of the molt pr0per tree, yet I fliowcd
him a much better and cleaner way to make a canoe
than ever he knew before; for he was for burning
the hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make this
boat ; but I then told him how we might do it with
tools, learning him at the fame time how to ufe them,
which indeed he did very dexteroufly; fo that in a
month's labour we finilhed it, making it 'very hand-
fome by Cutting the outfide into the true Ihape of a
boat. After this it took us full a fortnight before
we could get her into the water, which we did as it
were inch by inch, upon great rollers : But when {he
was in, {he would have carried twenty men with all '
the cafe imaginable.

As I was very well. pleafed you may be fure at the
launching of this man of war of mine, I was no lefs
amazed to behold with what dexterity my man would
manage her, turn her, and paddle her along. Well,
Friday, (faid I) what do you think of it now ? Do you
think this will carry us over? 1" er, Mtg/fer, (faid he) me
venture over we", t/Jougb great blow wind. But m dc.
fign was yet farther, which he was infenlible o , and
that was to make a mall and fail. and to provide her
with an anchor and cable. As for a malt, that was
no difficult thing at all to procure; fo I fixed upon a
flraight young cedar tree, which I found near the
place, there abounding great plenty of it in the ifland ';
and fetting Friday to cut it down, I gave him parti-
cular directions how to {hape and order it : But as to
the fail I managed it myfelf. I very well knew I had

fome old ones, or pieces of fails enough, which had
lain fix-and-twenty years by me ; but not being
careful to preferve them, as thinking I fhould have
no occalion to ufe them any more, when I came to
look over them, I found them almofl: all rotten, ex-
cept two; and with thefe I went to work, and after
a great deal of pains, and aukward tedious ftitching,
for want of needles, I finithed at 'length a three
cornered u ly thing, like that we call in England a
Chowder o mutton fail, to go with a boom at bot.-44 nohtxsos causoe.

torn, and a little finall fpri: at the top, like thal'e
which our long-boats ufe, and which I very well
knew how to manage, efpecially linee it was like
that which I had in my patron's lilhing-boat, when
with my boy Xury I made my efcape from the Bar-
bary fhore.

It was near two months, I think, before I completed
this work, that is, the rigging and fitting my mall and
fails; and indeed they were nicely done, having made
a fmall flay, and a fail or forefail to it, to allill, ifwe
{lmuld turn to the westward; and, wnich was llill
more, I fixed a rudder to the (km of her,to fleerwith ;
and though I was but a very indifferent lhipwright,

A-yet, as I was fenlil'ie of the great ufefulnefs and ab-
folute necellity of a thing like this, I applied myfelf
to it with fuel: coullant application, that 412 lre'l I ac-
complilhed my dtlign ; but what with the n: my dull
contrivanees I had about it, and the failure of many
things, it coll me as much pains in ordering as in
making the boat. Belides, when all this was done, I
had my man Friday to teach whatbelonged to its na-
vigation ; for though he very well underlie-ad how to
paddle a canoe along, yet he was an utter ilranger to
a fail, and a rudder, and was amazed when he {aw me
work the boat to and again in the fea by them, and
how the fail gibbed and filled, this way or that way,
as the courfe we failed chmged. After fome time,
and a little ufe, I made all thefe things very familiar
to him, {0 that he became an expert failor', except
in relation to the compafs; and that I could make
him umlerlland but very little of. But as it happened
there was lieldom oecalion for it, there being but lit-
tle cloudy weather, and fearee ever any fog in \thol'e
parts ; the flan~ were always vilible in the night, and
the there perfpicuous by day, except in the rainy fea-
fon, which confined every one to his habitation.

Thus entered in the feven-and-twentieth year of
my reign,or captivity, which you pleafe, (the lall three
of which, blefl'ed with the company of my man Fri-
day, ought not to be reckoned,) [kept the anniverfary
of my landing here, with the fame thankfulnelk to

God, for his tender mercies, as Idid before; and
certainly, as I had great caufe for a thankful ac-
knowledgement for my deliverance at firft, I had
much greater now, for fuch [ingular and additional tcf-
timonies of the care of Providence over me, in all my
diltrcfl'es, both of body and mind, and the great hopes
I had of being eti'eetually and fpeedily delivered; for
I had a lirong imprellion upon my mind, that I lhould
not be another year in this illand: But however I (till
continued on with my hufbandry, digging, planting,
and fencing as ufual, gathering and curing my grapes,
and doing all other things that were neceflhry.

And now the rainy feafon beginning to come on,
obliged me to keep longer within doors; but before
this I brought my new veITel into the creek, where
I had landed my rafts from the (hip, and'hauling
her up to the fliore, I ordered my man Friday to
dig a dock fuflicient to hold her in, and deep enough
to give her water, wherein (he might float; and then,
when the tide was out, we made a ltrong dam aerofs
the end of it, to keep up the water; b which
means {he lay dry, as to the tide from the ea; and
to keep the rain from her, we thatched her over, as
it were, with boughs of trees, like a houfe'; and'fo
waited for the months of November and Decemberfin
which I defigned to venture over the ocean. _

No fooner did the feafonable weather begin to draw
near, but {0 much was I elevated by this new defigned
adventure, that I daily prepared for the voyage.' 'Thc-
firlt thing I thought of was to lay by a certain quan-
tity of provifions, as a fuflicient {tore for fuch'anT ex-
pedition, intending in a week or fortni ht's time to
Open the dock and launch out the boat or that pur-
pofe. But one morning, as I was very bufy upon
fomething neceITary for this occafion, I called F riday?
to me, and bid him go to ehe [ea-(bore, and fee if he
could find a turtle or tortoife, a thing which we
commonly had once a--week, as much upon account
of the eggs, as for the lake of the flefh. He had not
been long gone, but he came running back, as though
he was purfued for life, and, as it were, flew over my
outward wall or fence, like one that felt not the
ground or fteps he fet his feet on ; and before I had
time to inquire the reafon of his precipitation, he
cries out, 0 .1114?ch O dear fifty?" ! Oforraw,jbr-
row! bad! 0 bad! Why, what is the matter, Fri-
day ? {aid 1. 0 yonder, yonder, (raid he) tbere be one,
two, tltrce canoe: ! two, three! Surely (thought I)
there mull be fix, by my man's way of reckoning:
but on a llrieler inquiry, I found there were but three.
\Vell, Friday,(faid1)do not be terrified, I warrant you
we will not only defend ourfelves againft them, but
kill the molt of thofe cruel favages. But though I com-
forted him in the belt manner I could, the poor crea-
ture trembled, fo that I fearee knew what to do with
him: 0 mq/ie'r, (faitl he) titty came look Friday, cut
pieces E'idny, eat a me up. W by, Friday, (faid I)
they will eat me up as well as you, and my danger is
as great as yours: But fince it is 1'0, we mutt rcfolve
to fight for our lives: What fay you ? can you fight,
Friday? 1'25, (laid he, very faintly) me flwot, we kill
what 1 at>>, but there tome great many "lander. That is
no matter, (faid I again) our guns will terrify thofe
that we do not kill : 1 am very willing to lland by you
till the lalt drop of my blood, now tell me, if you will
do the like by me, and obey my orders in whatfoever
I command 3 Friday then anfwered, 0 Illa/fer, me (of;
Iffi fir you, me die when you bid die. Thus conclud-
ing all quellions concerning his fidelity, immediately
I fetched a good dram of rum, (of which I had
been a very good hufbaud) and gave it him to com-
fort his heart. After he had drank it, I ordered him
to take the two fowling--pieces which we always car-
ried, and load them with large {wan {hot as big as
2
{mall piiiol bullets; then! took four mufkcts, and
loaded them with two Hugs and five final] bullets
each, charging my two piltols each with a brace. I
hung my great fword, as cuflomary, naked to my (ide,
and gave Friday his hatchet, as a molt excellent
weapon of defence.

Thus prepared, I thought as well of myfelf as any
knight-errant that ever handled a fword and fpear. I
took my perfpeclzive glafs, and went up the fide of the
hill, to fee what I could difcovcr; and I perceived
very foon,by my glafs, that there were one--anddwenty
favages, three prifoners, and three canoes ; and that
their chief concern feemed to be the triumphant ban-
quet upon the three poor human bodies, a thing "high
by this time I had obterved was very common with
them. From hence I alfo remarked, that they did not
land at that place from whence Friday made his efcape,
but nearer to the creek, where the thore was low, and
where a thick wood came very clofe to the fea. And
then it was my foul was filled with indignatiOn and
abhorrence of their inhuman wretches, that put a pee-
riod to all my former thoughts in their vindication ;
neither would I give myfelf time to confider their
right of conqueit, as Ihad done before. But defcend-
ing from the mountain, I came down to Friday, and
told him, I was refolved to go fpeedily to them and
kill them all; aiking him again in the fame breath if
he would {land by me ? When by this time being re-
covered from his fright, and his fpirits much cheered
with the dram I had given him, he was very pleafant,
yet ferioufly telling me, as he did before, " when I,
bid die, he would die."

And now it was, that having fixed my refolution'
in [0 firong a manner, that nething coulddivcit my
breafl: from its uncommon fury, I immediately divided"
the arms, already charged, between us. <<To my man
Friday I gave a pifiol to Rick in his girdle, with three
guns upon his {boulder}; weight two great I confefs

' t
to hear ; but u hat mull a poor hing do who had but
one {oldicr in rim: world ? But to lhow I made him
bear no more ll!.eh what] would lay on myfelt', I lluck
the otler piilol l'.' my girdle, and the three guns up-
On my llzoulders, nay fi-meihing more, but that was
like fl'il'ep's burden, a linall bottle of mm, which
foon was lightened to our exceeding refrelhmen .
Thus we marched out, under a ponderous load of ar-
mour, yet like two invincible champions, with a quan-
tity of powder and bullets to ltand our battle, when
the pieces were dil'eharged. And now my orders be--
ing to be obeyed. I charged Friday to keep clofe behind
me, and not to liir, or lhoot, or attempt any thing till
I commanded him, and in the interim, not to fpeak
{0 much as one word. It was in this order I fetched
a cortipafs to the right hand, of near a mile, with a
view to get over the creek within lhot of them be-
fore 1 could be difeerned, which I found by my glad};
would not be dillicult to aecomplilh.

But how fickle and wavering is the mind of man,
even in our greatell fury and ltrongell: inclination !
For while I was taking this march, my refolutions be-
gan to abate, not through fear'of their numbers, who
were a parcel of naked unarmed wretches; but thcle
rellefiions occurred to my thoughts, as what power
was I commillioned with, or what oecafion or necef-
fity had I to go and imhrue my hands in human blood,
and murder people who had neither done nor intended
to do me any wrong; they were innocent in particular
as to me ; and their barbarous cullom was not only
their misfortune,but :1 figs: that God had left them in
the molt imnienl'e llupidity; but yet did not warrant
me to be a judge of their actions, much lefs an exe-
cutioner of Illa righteous judgments; that on the con-
trary, whenever he thought fit, he would take Oven-
geanec on them himfell, and punifli them in a national
way, according to their national crimes -, but this was
nOthing at all to me, who had no concern With them.

I
indeed my man Friday might juilify himfcli', becaufe
they were his declared enemies, of that very fame na-
tion that went to facrilice him before; and indeed it
was lawful for him to attack them, which I could not
fay was ft) in rcfpeel: to me. So warmly did thefe
things prefs upon my thoughts all the way I went,
that I only refolved to place myfelf to as to behold
their bloody entertainment, without falling upon
them, except fontething more than ordinary, by God's
fpeeial direction, {hould oblige me thereto.

Thus fixed in my refolution, I entered into the
thick wood (my man Friday following me clofe be-
hind), when, with all poflible warinefs and filence, I
marched till [came to the (kirt of it, on that Me
which was the nearefi; to them 3 for only that one end
of the wood interpofed between me and them. Upon
which I called very fairly to Friday, and mowing him.
a great tree, that was jult at the corner of the wood,
I ordered him to repair thither, and bring me word
if he coulthplainly perceive their aEURtions ; according.
l y, he did as I commanded him, and came back with
this melancholy Rory, that they were all about their
fire, eating the flefh of one of their prifoners; and
that another lay bound upon the fand, a little diftant
from them, which they deligned to be their next fa-
criliee; and this, he told me, was not one of their
nation, but one of thofe very bearded men, who were
driven by a dorm into their country, and whom he
had {0 often talked to me about. You may be fure,
that upon hearing this my foul was ready to fink with-
in me; when afcending up into a tree, 1 faw plainly
by my glaz's, a white man, who lay upon the beach of
the fea, with his hands and feet tied with flags, or
things refembling ruihes, being covered with clothes,
and {eemed to be a European. From the tree where
I took this profpeet, I perceived another tree, and a
thicket beyond it, about fifty yards nearer to them
than .where I was, which, by taking a final] circle

G 3
round, I might come at undifcovered, and then I
fliould be within half a {hot of thefe devourers. And
this confideration alone, to he more perfeetly revengo
ed upon them, made me withhold my paflion, though
I was enraged to the higheft degree imaginable, when
gomg back about twemy pflCt'S,I gotihehind fome
bullies, which held all the way till I came to the o-
ther tree; and then I afeended a little tiling ground,
no; above eighteen yards diftmee from them, and
thereI had a full view of thefe creatures, and lcould
perceive all their aftions.

Such a fight did then appear as obliged me not to
lofe a moment's time. There were no lefs than nine-
teen of thel'e dreadful wretehes fet upon the ground,
clofe huddled together, cxprelling all the delight ima-
ginable at {o barbarous an entertainment; and they
had iull fent the ("her "'"' " ;',,,,',',{c'; {his poor un-

happy Chrifiian, and bring him perhaps limb by limb
to their fire 5 for they were juit then going to untie
the bands from his feet, in order for death, as fetters
are knocked off from the feet of malefaflors before
they go to the place of execution. Hereupon, imme-
diately turning to my man, Now, Friday,(faid I) mind
what I fay, fail in nothing, but do exafily as you fee
me do. All which he promifing he would perform,
I let down one of my muikets and the fowling-piecc
upon the ground, and Friday did the fame by his;
and with the other mulket I tool: my aim'at the fa-
vages, bidding him do the like: Are you ready ? {aid
I. Yes, Malter, {aid he. Vt'hy then fire at them, {aid
I; and that 'very moment I gave fire likewife. '
For my part, I killed one and wounded two; but my
man Friday, taking his aim much better than I, killed
two, and wounded three. Y on may be fore they were
in a dreadful confiernation at fueh an uttexpefled
difafter; and thofe who yet had efeaped our penetrat-
ing fliot, immediately jumped upon their feet, but" ,,
were in fuch confulion, that theyknew nor which Wafif .-
to run or look, not knowing from whence their 4,353:
{truaion came. We then threw down our pieces and
took up others, giving a fecond dreadful volley ; but
as they were loaded only with {wan (hot, or {mall pir-
tol bullets, we perceived only two of them fall; ut
fo many were wounded, that they run yelling and
{dreaming about like mad creatures. Now, Friday,
(fair! I) lay down your piece and take up the mufltet,
and follow me. He did (0, with great courage, when
{howing ourfelves to the favang, we gavea great lhout,
and made. direetly to the poor vietim, who would
have been facrificed, had not our firfl: fire obliged
the butchers, with three others, to jum into a canoe.
By my order,Friday fired atthem,at whichfhot I thought
he killed them all, by reafon of their falling to the bot-
tom of the boat; however he killed two, and mortally
wounded a third. In the mean time I cut the flags-
that tied the hands and feet of the poor creature, and
lifting him up, aflted him in the Portuguefe tongue,"
robot be war .9 He anl'wered me in Latin, Cbri farm: .-
but fo very weak and faint that he could {carce {land
or (peak. Immediately I gave him a dram and a piece
of bread to cherilh him, and alkcd him what coun-

. tryman he was ? He {aid Efpaniola, and then uttered

all the thankfulnefs imaginable for his deliverance.
Seignior (faid I, with as much Spanifli as I was mailer
of), let us talk afterwards, but light now; here take"
this {word and pillol, and do what you can. 'And'in-
deed he did [0 with fuch courage and intrepidit , that
he out two of them to pieces in an initant (t e fa-
vages not having the power to fly for their lives). I
ordered Frida to run for thofe pieces we had left at
the tree, whic he brought to me with great fwiftnefs,
and then I gave him my mulltet, "while I loaded the
reft. But now there happened a fierce encounter be.
tween the Spaniard and one of the favages, who had
made at him with one of their wooden fwords; and
thoughthe' former was as brave as could be expeeled,
having twice wounded his enemy in the head, yet

As to 12 r2d'2y, hL purlued the flying 22' retches with his

The famees in the cmoe worked 2"ery hard to get
out of ourr reach, and F2iday "as as eaget in purfuing
them; and indLed I 22 as no lefs anxious about their
efeape, lelt, aerr the 2222225212 2d been car2ied to their
peoyile, they thou d rettuu in multitudes, and defiroy
us. So being reloived to 12222f22e them, I iumped 222to

cue ol thLir c.2nocs,and hid F2ida) to lollow me; but

no looner was I in, when to my furp 2ife I found

another poor creature, bound hand andP foot for the _

ilaughter, jull: as the Snaniard had been, with very
little lile 222 him. Imdeiatelv I unbound him, and

"Laid ha2e 11C/l3Ld' him up, but he could neither {land
2: or fpeak, but g oaneu piteoufly, thinking he 22 as on.
1y unbound 2n calm to be flain. Hereupon I bid Fri-
dity {peak to him, and tell him of his dLliverance;

l
when pulling out my bottle, I made the poor WfCtCit
drink a dram; which, with the 'oyful news he had
received, [0 revived his heart, that he fat up in the
boat. As foon as Friday began to hear him fpeak,
and looked more fully in his face, it would have
moved any one to tears to perceive his uncommon
tranl'ports of joy; for he killed him, embraced him,
hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, fang, then cried again, wrung his hands,
. beat his face and head, then fung and jumped about;
again, like a dillraeied creature; fo that it was a
great while before I could make him {peak to me, or
tell me what was the matter with him ; but when he
came to the liberty of his fpeech, at lall: he told me,
it was his father.

Here indeed I was infinitely moved to fee the du-r
tiful and tender all'eelion this poor favage had to his"
aged parent. He would {it down by him in the boat,
open his brealt, and hold his father's head clofe to:
his bofom half an hour together to nourilh it; then;
he took his arms and ankles,'which were (till: and.
numbed with binding, and chafed and rubbed them.
with his hands; by which means, perceiving what
the cafe was, 1 gave him tome rum, which proved of
great benefit to him.

\ 'hile we were bufy in this aetion, the favages.
had gotten almoll: out of fight, and happy it was we
did noc purfue them ; for there arofe from the north--
well, which continued all night long, fuch a violent.
llorm, that I could not ,{uppofe otherwile but that
they were all drowned. After this .I Called Friday to'
me, and alked him if he had given his father any:
bread ? He (hook his head, and laid, None, not one 612,,
we eat a up all ,- fo 1 gave him a cake of bread out of:
a little pouch 1 carried for this each. I. likewife'gave.
him a dram for himfelf, and two or threebuncjzcs of
failins .for his father. 150th thofe he carried. to. him,
for. he.would make him drink the dram to comfort:
MAway he then runs ant of the boat as if hewas.
a it s
bewitched, with fuch an extraordinary fwiftnefs, that
he was out of light as it were in an infiant; but at
his return I perceived him flacken his pace, becaufe
he had fomething in his hand; and this I found to
be, as he approached nearer, an earthen 'ug with fome
water to his father and two more ca es of bread,
which he delivered into my hands. Being very thirl'ty
myfelf, I drank fome of the water, of which, when
his father had drank (efficiently, it more revived his
fpirits than all the rum I had given him.

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to car-
ry the Spaniard one of the cakes and fome water,
who was repofing himfelf upon a green place, under
the {hade of a tree, but f0 weak, that though he ex-
erted himfelf, he could not Rand upon his feet ; up-
on which I ordered Friday to rub and bathe his ankles
with rum as he did his father's. But every minute he
was employed in this, he would call: a wiihful eye to.
wards the boat where he left his father fitting -, who
fuddenly difappearing, he flew like lightning to him ;
and finding he only laid himfelf down to cafe his
limbs, he returned back to me prefently .3, and then I
{poke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and
lead him to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my
dwelling, where I would take care of him: Upon
which Friday made nothing to take him upon his
back, and fo carried him to the canoe, fetting him
clofe by his father; and prefently itepping out again,
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the {hate
falter than I could walk, though the wind blew very
hard too; and having brought them fafe to the creek,
away he runs to fetch the other canoe, which he
brought to the creek almofi as (con as I got to it by
land ; when wafting me over, he took our new guells
out of the boat. But fo weak were they, that I was
forcedto make a kind of hand-barrow ; and when}.
came to my caltle, not being Willing to make an end
trance into my wall, we made them a handfome tent;t
covered with old fails and boughs of trees, making 3.
two good beds of rice firaw, with blankets to lie up.
on and cover them. Thus, like an abfolute king,
over fubjeets who owed their lives to me, I thought
myfelf very great, efpecially 'confidering I had three
religions in my kingdom, my man Friday being a.
Proreltant, his father a Pagan, and the S aniard a
Papilt; but I gave liberty of confcience to t em all.

T 0 get provifions for. my poor weak fubjeels, I or-
dered'Friday to kill me a yearling goat, which when
he had done, I cut off the hinder quarters and chop--
ping it into fmall pieces, boiled and {tewed it, putting
barley and rice into the broth. This I carried into
their tent, fet a' table, dined with them myfelf, and
encouraged them. Friday was my interpreter to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too, who {poke
the language of the favages pretty well. After din-A
ner I ordered Friday to {etch home all our arms from
the field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead
bodies, which he did accordingly.

And now I made Friday inquire of his father,
whether he thought thofe favages had efeaped the
late {torm in their canoe; and if fo, whether they .
would not return with a power too great for us tore-
fil't ? He anfwered, that he thought it impolfible they
fhould outlive the ltorm; or if they were driven {out-ha
wardly, they would come to a land where they would
as certainly be devoured, as if they were droWned'in'
the fea; and fuppofe they had attained their own;
country, the {trangenefs of their bloody and fatal at-
tack, would make them tell their pe0ple, that the tell-I
of them were kilfed by thunder and lightning, not by
the hand of man, but by two heavenly fpirits (mean-e
ing Friday and me), who were fent from above to de-
firoy them: And this he faid he knew, beeaufe' he
heard them fay the fame to one another. And indeed
he was in the right on it ; for I have heard fince, that
thefe four men gave out,that whoever went to that en-
chanted ifland,would'be deltgoyed by firefrom the gods; .
No canoes appearing tome time after, as I cxpefletl,
my apprehcnlions eezdld; llllleldiot. which my for-
mer tItOuglts of n voyage took place, el'pceially when
l'ridJy's father utiitrul me I lhould have good ulirgc
in his country. As to the Spaninrd, he told me, that
{ixtttn more of his countrymen and Portuguefe, who
had heen thipwt'eeked, nude their eleaipe thither;
that though they were in union with the lineages, yet
they were very mifemhle for want of prm-ilions and
other neeetiitries. \Vhen I had allied him about the
pu'tieuiurs of his \oy.;ge. he unt'u'ered, that their {hip
was bound from Rio de la Plat-.1 to the llamnnah:
that when the llaip was loti only live men pet'ilhed in
the ocum, the red, h.\'irg titted theml'eives in the
bout, were. no" hurled on the main continent. And
"hat do they intend to do there? litid I. l'lt' repli-
ed, they had concerted mcut'ures to elixipe by build-
ing them a refill, but they h.id neizher tool>> nor pro-
x'ilions; fo that nil their deligns came to nothing.
liupppling, (find I) l lhould nuke them a propofal,
and invite them here, would tilt y not carry me pt":-
timer to New Spain .7 lle zutfwered, No, {or he knew
them to he. {nth honel't men as would feorn to are):
fueh inhuman hafenei's to their deliverer : That, if I
pleaded he and the old favagc would go over to them,
talk uith them about it, and bring,r me an nnfwer;
that they {build all {wear fidelity to me as their leader,
upon the holy facrament.' ; and that, for his part, he
would not only do the fame, hut ttand by me to the-
loft drop of his blood, lhould there be occafion.

Thefe foleuiu :tflhmnees made me refolve to grant
them relief, and tofend thefe two over for that purpofe:
But when every thing was ready, the Spaniard rait'ed
an objet'lion which carried a great deal of weight in
it. 1'3" [wow Sir, (fluid he) that being/5m: lime will: you,

'l'his advice oftizs: Spaniard 1 approved of extreme-
ly; and lb tittislied was l of his fidelity, that I clleemed
him ever after. And thus we all four went to work
upon lbme nmrt' land, and againll feed-time we had
got fo much cured and trimmed up, as was fullicient
to row twenty-tam bulhels of barley on, and [ix-teen
jars of rice, which was in Hunt all the feed we had
to fparc. As we were four in number, and by this time
all in 3;":Ml health, we feared not an hundred Indians,
lhould they venture to attack us : And while the corn;
was growing, 1 pitched upon fume trees lit to build
us a large wild in cafe the Spaniards came over;
which being marked, Iordered Friday and his father
to cut them down, appointing the Spaniard, who was
now my privy counfellor, to overlee and diret'l the
work. 1 like-wife increaled my flocks of goats, by
{hooting the wild dams, and bringing home their-
kids to my inclol'ure: Nor did I neglet'l the grape-
fealbn, but cured them as ufual, though I had fuch a
quantity now as would have filled eighty barrels with
railins. And thus all of us being employed, they in
working, and I in providing for them, till harvefl:
came, God Almighty blelTed the increafe ofit [0 much,
that from twenty-two barrels of barley, we threlhed
out two hundred and twenty, and the like quantit
of rice, fullicient to vietual a (hip, to carry me and all
the Spaniards to any part of America.

Thus the principal objeetion being anfwered by a
fuflicient flock of provilion, I fent my two ambafl'ag-
dors over to the main land, with a regal authority to
adminifler the oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and '

_ hare an inltrument fignod under their. hands, though.
I never aflted whether they had pen, ink, or paper;
when giving each othhem a mulket, eight charges
of powder and ball, and provilion enough for eight
days, they failed away with a fair gale, on a day when
the moon was at full.

Scarce a fortnight had pail'ed over my head, but im-
patient {or their return, I laid me down to ileep one
morning, when a (trange accident happened, which
was uihered in by my man's coming running to me,
and Calling aloud, flLgfler, mq/lcr, Livy are mine, thy
are come. Upon which, not dreaming of any danger,
out 1 jumps from my bed, puts on my clothes, and
hurries through my little grove; when looking towards
the (Ca, 1 perceived a boat about a league and a half
diltant, {landing in for the ihore, with the wind fair.
I beheld they did not come from the fide where the
land lay on, but from the fouthermoil; end of the
ifland; So thefe being none of the people we wanted, I
ordered Friday to lie iiill, till fuch time as 1 came down
from the mountain, which with my ladder I now af-
cended, in order to difeover more fully what they
were: And now, with the help of my perfpeflive glafs,
I plainly perceived an Englilh fliip, which 1 concluded
it to be by the fafhion of its long-boat, and which fill-
ed me with fueh uncommon tranfportspf joy, that
Icannot tell how to deferibe; and yet fome fecret
doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know not:
what caufe, as though I had reafon to be upon my

uard. And indeed I would have no man contemn the
gecret hints and intimations of danger, which very of.
ten are given, when he may imagine there is no poll-i-
bility of their being real ; for had I not been warned
by this Glent admonition, I had been in a worfe fitn-
ation than before, and perhaps inevitably ruined.

Not long it wasbefore I perceived the boatto approach.
the there, as though they looked for a place Where,
they mighteonveniently land ; and at 121?: they ran their:

boat on {here upon the beach, about half a mile's difsi
tance, which proved fo muchthe happier for me; fince
if they had come into the creek, they had landed jull:
at my door, and might not only have forced me out
of my cal'tle,but plundered me of allIhad in the world.
Now I was fully convinced they were all Englilhmen,
three of whom were unarmed and bound ; when im-
mediately the firfl four or five leaped 'on fhore, and
took thofe three out of the boat as prifoners ; one of
whom I could perceive ufed the molt pallionate gef-
tures of entreaty, afilietion, and defpair, while the 0--
thers,in a leffer degree, {howed abundance of concern.

Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much
aflonifhcd, and I beckoned to Friday (who was be-
low) to afcend the mountain, and likewife view this
fight. 0 Mtg/Jar, (lays he to me) you fee Englj/b man:
eatpriflmerr, a: well a: flzvage mam. And do you think
they will eat them, Friday .7 {aid 1. Tar, (faid Fri-~
day) tbry eat all up. No, no, (fa-id 1) Friday, I am much
more concerned lelt they murder them; but as for
eating them up, that I am fure they never will.

And now I nor only lamented my misfortune in
not having the Spaniard and favage with me, but.al-'
('0 that I could not come within that of them unper.
ceived, (the having no fire-arms amon r them} and
fave thefe three men, whom Ithoughtt ey were go~
ing to kill with their (words. But fome comfort it-
was to me, that I perceived thefy were {et at liberty
to go where they pleafed, the ra cally feamen fcatter-~
ing about as though they had a mind to fee the
place : And {0 long did they negligently ramble, that
the tide had ebhed fo low as to leave the boat a-5
ground. Nor were the two men that were in her
more circumfpefl, for having'dranlt a little too much
liquor, they fell fafl afleep; but one of them waking
before the other, and perceiving the boat too fall: a-
ground {on his firength to move it, he hallooed out
to, the melt, who made all poflible expedition to come

"to-him: But as Providence ordered it, all their force
was incEeftual relaunch her, when .1 could hear-
them {peak one to another, lV/By [at bar alone, jack, ~
can't ye, floe'd flan! next title ,- by which words I was
fully Convinced that they were my own countrymen.
All this while I lay very quiet, as being fufly fenlible,
it could be no lel's'lhan ten hours before the boat
would be afloat, and then it would be {0 dark, as that
they could not eafily perceive me, by which meansl
{hould be at more iiberty to hear their talk, and ob.
ferve all their motions: Not but that I prepared for
my defence; yet as] had now another fort of ene-

mies to combat with, I aaed with more caution. I
tool: two fufees on my lhoulders, and gave Friday
three mufkets; belides, my formidable goat-(kin coat,
and monltrous Cap, made me look as tieroe and ter-
rible as I'IerlllC'S of old, el'pecially when two pi:tols
were lluek in my belt, and my naked {word hanb-
ing by my fide.

It was my delign at firi't not to make any attempt.
till it was da- k ; but it being now two o'clock, in the
very heat of the (lay, the faiiors were all firaggling in.
to the woods, and undoubtedly were lain down to
fleep. The three p0or diltrefi'ed creatures, too anxi-
ous to get any repofe, were however feated under
the lhade of a great tree, about a quarter of a mile
from me: Upon which, without any more ado, I
approached towards them, with my man following
behind me, and before I was perceived, I called a-
loud to their. in Spaniih, W but are ye, Gent/(mm .9

At thefe words they (tarted up in great confufion,
and bellolding the ltrunge figure I made, they returned
no anzwer, but feemed as if they would fly from me.

but two pieces, (faid he) one of which is left in the
boat: He alfo told me there were two enormous vile
lains among them, that were the authors of this mu-

duce the tell to return to their obedience. Well,
-well, (faid I) let us retire farther under the covering

tions with him :

I. That while they {laid in the ifland, they {hould

formable to my orders, and return me the arms
which I {hould put into their hands. \

II. That, if the {hip was recovered, they {hould
anrd Friday and me our pali'age gratis to England.

\Vhen he had given me all the fatisfaelion I could
defirc, I gave each of them a gun, with powder and
ball fuflicient, advif'mg them to fire upon them asthey
lay. The captain modellly faid, That he was forry to
kill them, though on the other hand, to let thefe vil-
lains efcape, who were the authors of his mifery,

'might be the ruin of us all, {hould they bring the
ihip's company upon us. "7 ell, (faid he) do as you

others were alfo {lightly wounded, who at my ap--
proach cried out for mercy. This the captain grant.
ed, upon condition that they would {wear to be true
to him in recovering the (hip, which they folemnly
did ; however I obliged the captain to keep them
bound. After which I fent Friday and the captain's
mate to fecure the boat, and bring away the oars and
fails ; when at their return, three men coming back,
and feeing their late difirefl'ed captain, now their
conqueror, fubmitted to be bound alfo. And then it
was, that, having more liberty, I related the adven-
tures of my whole life, which he heard with a ferions
and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him
and his two men into my little fortified Caitle, fhowed
them all my conveniencies, and refrefhed them with
fuch provifions as I could afford. Vt'hen this was over,
we began to conlider about regaining the lhip. He faid
that there were :6 hands on board, who knowing
their lives were forfeited by-tlte law, for confpirncy
and mutiny, would grow fo very hardened, that it
would be dangerous for our {mall company to attack
them. This was a reafonable inference indeed ; but
[om 'thing we did refolve on, and immediately put in
execution : For we heaved the b0... upon the beach

mark, and broke a hole in her, not ealily to he flop-
ped; and lb all the lignals they gave for the boat to
come on hoard were in vain. This obliged them to
fend another boat afliore,_ with ten men armed,
whofe faces the captain plainly defcried, the boat.

three honefl: lads among them, who were forced into
the confpiracy. Hereupon I gave him frefh courage

while fecnring our prifoners, part in my caftle, over
whom Friday flood centinel; but two others we took
into our fervice, and then thought ourfelves flrong
enough to adventure a battle. When the failors land-
ed, and beheld their boat in that condition, the not
only hallooed, but fired for their companions to hear,
yet they received no anfwer. This llruck them with
torror and amazement, thinking their companions
were murdered; then they made as if they would re-
turn to the fhip. I could perceive the captain's coun.
tenance change at this, till of a {udden three men
were ordered to look after the boat, while the other
feven leaped on (hate, in order to fearch for their
companions: And indeed they came to the brow of
the hill, near my ancient callle, from whence they
could fee a great way into the woods, and there .
{boating and hallooing till tired and weary, at length
feared themfelves under a fpreading tree. My Opi-
nion was, that nothin could be done till night, when
I might ufc foine artifice to get them out of the boat:
But of a fudden they all liarted up, and made to the _
fea--lide : Hereupon I ordered Friday and the captain's
mate to go over the creck,~and halloo as loud as they
could, and f0, decaying them into the woods, come
round to me again. And this indeed had its effeet;
for they followed the noife, till coming wettward to
the creek, they called for their boat to carry them 0-
ver, taking one of the men out of her, and leaving
two to look after her, having faltened her to the
{lump of a little tree on more. Hereupon immediate-
ly the captain and our party palling the creek out of
their light, we furprifed them both, by the captain's
knocking down one, and ordering the other to fur-
render on pain of death, and who, being the honcft-
elt of them all, fincerely joined with us. By this
time it~ was retty late, when the reft returning to
their boat, w ich they found a-ground in the creek,
the tide out, and the men gone, they ran about,
wringing, their hands, crying it was. an enchanted -

illand, and thit they {hould be all murdered by {p1-
rits or devils. My men would willingly have fallen
upon them, but I would not agree to hazaid any of
our party. But to be more certain, Friday and the
captain crawled upon their hands and feet as near as
pollihle . And when the boatfwain approached in
light, foe eager was the captain, that he fired and kill-
(d him on the lpot. Irida) wounded the next man,
and the third ran away. Herenpon I advanced with
my whole army, and, it. being dark, I ordered the
men whom we had futprifed with the boat to call
them by t.: eir names, and to parley with them. Ac-
cordingly he called aloud, Tom Swirl). ' Tom Swill). '

of him, and bound him. However, he was ordered
to fubmit to the Governor's mercy, for fuch was I

I lent the captain, to treat with them, in the Cover-

him in recovering the lhip. Upon which they all pro-
miled to lland by him till the lalt dmp of their blood ;
and whoever acted treacheroully lhould be hanged in
chains upon the beach. They were all releal'ed on
thefe allitrances; and then the captain repaired the
other boat, making his pafletiger captain of her, with
four men well armed; while his mate ltinrfelf, and five
men more, went in the other. By midnight they _
came within call of the fhip, when the captain order-
ed Robinlbn to hale her, and tell them that, with great
difficulty, they had found the men at lalt. But while
they were difcourfing, the captain, his mate, and the
relt entered, and knocked down the fecond mate and
carpenter, fecured thofe that were upon deck, by put-
ting them under hatches, while the other boat's crew
entered and fecured the forecaftlc; they then broke into
the round-houfe, where the mate, after fome refill:-
anee, {hot the pirate captain through the head ; up-
on which all the reft yielded themfelves prifoners.
And thus the lhip being recovered, the joyful lignal
was fired, which I heard with the greatelt 'oy imagin-
able: Nor was it long before he brought the lhip
to an anchor at the creek's mouth, when coming to
me unawares, Thar, (fays he) my dearg/Z firimd and
deliver", were i: your/Lip, am] we are your flrwntr ,-
a comfort f0 unfpeakable, as made me fwoon in his
arms, while, with gratitude to Heaven, we were
tenderly embracing each other.
Nothingnowremained,buttoconfultwhatwefhould
do with the prifoners, whom he thought it was not
fafe to take on board. Hereupon, concerting with
the captain, I drefl'ed m felf in one of his fuits, and
[ending for them, told t rem, that as I was going to
leage the ifland with all my peeple, if they would tarry
there", their lives lhould be fpared; if not, they lhould
' lit-hinged at the firll port we came to. They agreed to

ifgfii'eiflfixcvpon ,I, told them my whole Rory, char-
ging them to be kind to the Spaniards that were ex-
peeted, gave them all my arms, and informing them of
every thing necefl'ary for their fublillence, I and my
man Friday went on board. But the next morning
two of the men came fwimming to the {hip's lide, de-
liring the captain to take them on board, though he
hanged them afterwards, complaining mightily how
barbaroully the others ufcd them. Upon which I
prevailed with the captain to take them in, and be-
ing feverely whipped and pickled, they proved more
honelt for the future. And fo 1 bid farewell to this
ifland, carrying along with me my money, parrot, um-
brella, and goat-"tin cap, fetting fail Dec. 12. 1686,
after twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen
days refidence, that fame day and month that I efcap-
ed from Sallce, landing in England June t r. 1687,
after thirty-five years abfence from my own country,
which rendered me altogether a (hanger there.
Here I found my lirlt captain's widow alive, who
had buried a fecond hulband, but in very mean cir--
cumltances, and whom I made mighty eal'y upon my
account. Soon after, I wentdown to Yorklhire, where
all my family were expired, except two filters, and
as many of one of my brother's children. lfound no
provilion had been made for me, they concluding I
had been long lince dead ; {0 that I was but in a very
{lender lituation. Indeed the captain did me a great
kindnefs, by his report to the owners, how I had dc-
livered their lhip on the del'olate ill-and; upon which
they made me a prefent of 2001. Sterling. I next went
to Lilbon, taking my man Friday with me, and ar-
riving there in April, I met the Portuguefe captain,
who took me on board on the African wall; but be-
ing ancient, he had left 011' the fea, and relighed all
his bulinels to his fon, who followed the Bralil trade.
So altered both of us were, that we did not know
each other at lirll, till I dil'covered myfelf more :ully
to him. After a few embraces, I began to inquire of
my concerns, and then the old gentleman told me, that. '
it was nine years fince he had been at Brafil, where
my partner was then living, but my trultees were
both dead ; that it was his belief I {hould have a
good account of the product of my lantation; that
the imagination of my being loll, tad 0in ed my
trultees to give an eltimate of my (hare to t e pro-
curator--fifcal, who, in cafe of my not returning, had
' given one third to the King, and the relt to the
monalicry of StAugulline; but if 1 put in my claim, or
any one -for me, it would be returned, except the year-
ly produfi, which was given to the poor. I then de-
fired him to tell me, what improvement he thought
had been made of my plantation; and whether he ima-
gined it was worth my while to look after it ? He an-
l'wered; he did not know how much it was improved,
but this he was certain of, that my partner was grown
v-aftly rich upon his half of it ; and that he had been
informed, that the King had 20o moidores per annum
for his third part. He added, that the furvivors of
my truflees were perfons of an ingenuous character ;
that my partner could witnefs my title, my name being
regillered in the country, b which means indifputably
I {hould recover conlideralile fums of money. But,
(anfwcred 1) how could my truflees difpofe of my ef.
fee'ts, when I made you only my bet ? This, (he taid)
Was true, but there being no allidavit made of my
death, he could not aei: as an executor. However, he
had ordered his fon (then at Bralil) to aet by pro-
curation upon my account,and he had taken pofl'cifion
of my fugar-houfe, having accounted himfelf for eight
years with my partner and trullees for the profits, of
Which he would give me a very good account.

And indeed this he performed very faithfully in a
few days, making himfelf indebted to me 470 moi-
dores of gold,over and above what had been loll at fea,
after 1 had left the lace. And then he recounted to me
what misfortunes e had gone through, which forced
my'money out of his hands, to buy part in a new (hip -:
but (fays he) you flux/1 not want, take (bit, and sober: my
fin returm, (wry fizrtlving flux/l Ire paid you. Upon
which he put into my hand a purfe of 150 moidores
in gold, as likewiv": the inllrument containing the
title to the {hip in which his fon was, and which he
ofi'ered as fecurity for the remainder. But really,
when I faw In much goodnefs, generofity, tendernefs,
and real honelly, I had not the heart to accept it, for
fear he {hould Ilraiten liiinfelf on my account. It it
true, (faid he) it may {Jet/5 ; 1m! 11': money 2'; you", not
mine, and you may lame t'lu' gl't'flff/I Drag/ion jbr it.
l-Iowever, I returned fifty of them, promiling to give
him the other hundred when I got my efl'eets in my
hands, faying l deligned to go myfelf for that purpofe.
But he told me he could fave me the trouble; and
f0 caufed me to enter my name with a public notary,
as likewife my allidavit, with a procuration allixed to
it; and he advifed me to (end it in a letter to one of
his acquaintance, a merchant at Bram; and indeed
nothing could be more faithfully and honourahly ob-
Icrved; for in {even months time I had a very faithful
account of all my effects, what fums of money were
railed, what expended, and what remained for my
ufe : In a word, I found myfelf worth $0001. Ster--
ling, and 10001. per annum. Nor was this all, for my
partner congratulated me upon my being alive, telling
me how much my plantation was improved, what ne-
gros were at work, and how many Are Marias he
had {aid to the Virgin hIary for my prefervation, dc-
firing me to accept kindly fome prefents he had fent
me, which I found fliowcd the greatefl generolity.
No lboner did the {hip arrive, but I rewarded my
faithful captain, by returning him the hundred moi-
dores ; and not only forgiving him all he owed me, I
allowed him yearly a hundred more, and fifty to his
fon, during their lives. And now being refolved to
go to England, Ircturned letters of thanks to the
Prior of St Augultine, and in particular to my old
partner, with very fuitable prefents. By the captain's
advice, I was pcrfuaded to go by land to Calais, and
there take paliiage for England : When, as it hapL
pened, I got a young Englilh gentleman, a merchant's
{on at Lifbon, to accompany me, together with two
Englifh and two Portuguefe gentlemen; fo that with
a Portuguefe fervant, an Engliih failor, and my man
Friday, there were nine of us in number.

Thus armed and equipped, we fet out, and came to
Madrid, when the fummer decaying, we halted to
Navarre, where we were informed that there was
fcarcely any pafling, by reafon of the prodigious quan-
tity of fnow; fo that we were obliged to abide near
twenty days at Pampeluna, and at lafl to take a guide
tocondue't us fafe towards'l'houloufe. And nowtwelve
other gentlemen joining with us, together with their
fervants, we had a very jolly company. Away our
guide led us by the frightful mountains, and through
f0 many intricate mazes and windings, that we in-
{enlibly palt them, which, as we travelled along,
uihered us into the profpee't of the fruitful and charm-
ing provinces of Langucdoc and Gafcogne.

But now came on two adventures, both tra 'ical'and
comical. Firft, Our guide was encountered y three
wolves and a bear, who fet upon him and his horfe,
and wounded him in three places: Upon which my
man riding up to his affiliance, {hot one of them dead,
on which the others ran into the woods. But the plea.
fantefl: adventure was, to fee my man attack the bear.
This creature, if let alone, will never meddle with
you, and this my man Friday very well knew, and
{o begging leave of me in broken Englilh, he told us,
He would maizegoad laugh. Why, you tilly fool, (laid I)
he'll eat you up at a mouthful. Eater me up! (replied
he) we mm Mm, and make mac/.2 good [nag/9.. 'Upb'n
which, pulling 06' his boots, he claps on his ' (Imps,
and running after the monitrous beai't, he cal edfo'u't
that he wanted to {peak with him; and then throwing;
(lanes on purpofe to incenfe him, the beait turns about
in a fury, and with prodigious firides, fliuffles after;
him. But though he could not keep pace with Friday,
who made up to us as it were for help, yet, being an-
gry, nu (lag, (faid I) immediately tal-e lmfl, and let at

me mill-e you mad) laugh And {0 he turned about,
making ligns to follow, while the bear ran after him,
till coming to a great oak, he afcended in a minute,
leaving his gun at the bottom of it. Nor did the bear
make any dilliculty of it, but, notwithllandin his
bulk, afeended like a cat. You mull think was
not a little amazed at the folly of my man, not per-
ceiving any thing to occalion our laughter, till we
rode up nearer, and beheld the beall mounted on the
oak, on the beginning of the fame branch to which
Friday clung at the farther end, where the bear durll:
not come. llc'rr'upml Friday cried out, New, Illa/hr,
me mah mar/n lung), me male (1e [tear o'nm'e. Upon
which he fell a lhaking the bough, which made the
creature look behind him to fee how he could retreat.

all hurll into laughter, el'pecially when we perceived
Friday drop like a {quirk-l upon the ground, leaving
the beall to make the hell of his way down the tree.
And now thinking it the moll convenient time to kill
him, Friday cried out, 0 dear, Jig/7", Ito/laser,- me

cordingly he was as good as his word, for the crea-
ture del'cending backwards from the tree very leil'urely,
before he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday
{hot him through the ear [lone-dead, and looking to
fee if we were pleated, burll out into a hearty laugh,
laying, So we 17']! [wear in my country; not wit/J gm),
l'ut marl? long anew. Thus ended our diverlion, to
our great fatisfaaion, el'pecially in a place where the
terrible howlings llruck us with continual terror. But-
the fnows now growing very deep, particularly on the
mountains, the ravenous creatures were ob iged to
feel: for fultenance in the villages, where coming by
furprife on the country people, they killed feveral of
them, belides a great number of their {beep and horfes.
Our guide told us, we had yet one more dangerous
place to pafs by; and if there were any more wolves
in the country, there we {hould find them. This was
a {mall plain, encompall'ed with woods, to get'thro'ugh
a long lane, to the village where we were to lodge."
\Vhen we entered the wood the fun was within half
an hour of fetting; and a little after it was flat, we came
into the plain, which was not above two furlongs over,
and then we {aw five great wolves crofs the read,
without taking notice of us, and {o fwift as though they"
were purfuing after their prey. Hereupon our guide;
believing there were more coming, delired us to'be"~
upon our uard. Accordingly our eyes were very'
eircuml'pe , till about a league farther we {aw a dead;
horfe, and near a dozen of wolves devouring its'carJ
cafe. My man Friday fain would hare fired at thifi,'
but I would not permit him : Nor had we gone'llalf'..
over the plain, till we heard dreadful"howlitigeffirt'fi"
wood on our left, when prefently we jaw an'hun'dr'ed' .
come up againlt us, as though they ,ha't'libeen 'aij'efiihfig
perienced army. This obliged us to form'o't'zrfelfie' :
in the belt manner: And then [ordered that everyother'
man {hould fire; that thofe who did not'mi'g'ht' be readyl
to give a fecond volley, {hould they advanceguponf't'rsf,'
and then every man to make u'l'e'of his pillols; '.;Buq'
there was no neceflity for this; for the cncrfij'bcingl
terrified, (topped at the mile of the fire; fourfithem'
were lhot dead, and feveral others being wounded:
went bleeding away, as we could very plainly/difCover;
by the fnow. And now remembering what'hadbeenf
often told me, that fuch was the ma'efty of a man's
voice, as to {trike terror even into t e fiercelt crea-

tures, I ordered all our companions to halloo as" loud
H a'{4 r;

172 Renmsox causes.

as pollible: And in this notion I was not altogether
milhken; for they immediately turned about upon ~
the firfl: halloo, and began to retire: Upon which,
ordering a fecond volley in their rear, they galloped
into the woods with great precipitation.

Thus we had Come {mall time to load out pieces
again, and then made alLthe halle we could on our
way 1 But we had not rode far before we were obliged
to put ourfelves in a pollute of defence as before,
being alarmed with a very dreadful noife in the fame
wood on our left hand, the fame way as we were to
pals, only that it was at fome diflance from us. By
this time the darkfotne clouds began to fpread over
the elements, and the night growing very dulky, made
it fo much the more to our difitdvantage: But the
noife f'till increaling, we were fully allined, that it
was the howling and yelling of thofe ravenous crea-
tures: When prel'etttly three troops of wolves, on our
front, appeared to our light, as though a great num-
ber of them had a delign to furround us, and de-
vour us in fpite of fate. But as they did not fall upon
us immediately, we proceeded on our journey in the

"lr'wil'teft manner the roads would permit ourihorfes,

which was only a large trot. It was in this manner
we travelled, till fuch time as we difcovered another
wood, and had the profpeel of its entrance, through
which we were to pafs at the farthell tide of the plain.
But furely none can erprefs the terror we were in,
when approaching the lane, we perceived a confufed
number of the fierceil: wolves Handing, and as it <<were
guarding its entrance. Nor were we long in this ao
mazement,before another occalion of horror pretens-
ed itfelf : For {uddenly we heard the report of a gun
at another opening into the wood ; and looking that
way, out ran a horfe, bridled and faddled, flying
with the greatefi fwiftnefs, and no lefs than fixteen
or feventeen wolves purl'uing him, in order to devour

the poor creature : And unqucflionably they did [0,
after the had run him down, not being able to hold
out that wiftnel's with which he at firlt efcaped them.

"Then we rode up to that entrance from whence
the horfe came forth, there lay the carcafes of two.
men and another horfe, mangled and torn by theft:
devouring wolves : And undoubtedly one of there = ,
men was the pcrfon who fired the gun which we had
heard, for the piece lay by him; but alas! molt of
the upper part of his body and his head were eni-
tombed in the bowels of thefe ravenous creatures. ,

What courfe to take, whether to proceed or retreat,
we could not tell; but it was not long before the
wolves themfelves made us come to a refolution: For
fuch numbers furrounded us, every one of whom ex-
pected their prey, that were our bodies to be divided
among them, there would not be half a mouthful 3-
piece. But happy, very happy, it was for us, that
but a little way from the entrance, there lay fame very
large timber trees, which] fuppofed had been cut
down and laid there for fale, among which I drew
my little tr00p, placing outfclves in a line behind
one long tree, which fervecl us for a break-workd'
when deliring them to alight, we ltood in a triangle,
or three fronts, incloling our horfes in the centre,
the only place where we could preferve them.

Never certainly was there a more furious charge than
what the wolves made upon us in this place; and the
fight of the horfes, which was the principal thing they
aimed at, provoked their hunger, and added to their
natural fiercenefs. T hcy came on us with a molt
dreadful noile, that made the woods ring again, and
beginning to mount our pieces of timber, I ordered
every other man to fire as before direeted; and indeed
[0 well did they take their aim, that they killed feveral
of the wolves at the firll: volley; but {till we Were o-
bliged to keep a continual firing, by reafon they came
on like devils, pulhing one ' thcr with the great.

on us : And though in four firings we killed feven-
teen or eighteen of them. lzlllllllg twice as many, yet
they came on feveral iill'c'S liteeciiively, as though
they valued not their lives for the fake of their prey.

Unwilling was 1 to l'pend our lall lhot too iitddenly:
And therefore called my other ll-rt-ant. and giving him
a l-nrn of powder, hid him lay a large train quite a-
long the timber, which he did, while Friday was char-
ging my finite and his own with the gt'eatell dexte-
rity. By this time the wolves coming up the tim-
ber, l fct tire to the train, by (napping a difcharged
pillnl e'ofe on the powder. This fo (bombed and ter-
rified them,- that {time fell down, and others jump-
e.' in among us with the l'rmtgth and terror of tilt:
flame; but thefe we immediately dil'patehed, when all
the tcti, trightened with the light. which the darkfome
night caui'ed to appear more dreadful, began at tcfih
to retire: Upon which, ordering our hut pillols to
be fired at once, giving at the fame time a great
fltout. the wolves were obliged to have recourfe to
their {wiftuefs and turned tail; and then we {allied
out upon twenty lame ones, cutting them in pieces
with our (words, which obliged them to howl lament-
ably, to the terror of their fellow devourers, who
refigncd to us the field as vie'toriotts conquerors.
And indeed, I queilion whether Alexander, King of
Macedon, in any of his conquel'ts, had more occalion
for, triumph than we had; for he was but attacked
by numerous armies of foldiers; whereas our little
army was obliged to combat a legion of devils, as it
were, worfe than cannibals, who, had they llain us,
would have faeriiiced us the fame moment, to Intif-
fy their voracious appetites.

Thus ended our bloody battle with the beafls, hav.
i ng killed threefeore of them, and fiwed our lives from

w',
their fury. We ltill had a league to go farther,
when, as we went, our ears were fainted with their
molt unwelcome hmvlings, expet'ting every moment
another attack. But, in an hour's time, we arrived
faferat the town where we were to lodge; and here
' we found the place lirietly guarded, and all in terrible
confulion, as well they might, for fear of the bears
and wolves breaking into the village, in order to prey
upon their cattle and people. The next morning
we were obliged to take a new guide, by real'on the
other fell very bad of his wounds which he had re-
ceived, as before-mentioned. After we had reached
T houloufe, we came into a warm, pleafant, and fruit-
ful country, not infelted with wolves, nor any fort
of ravenous creatures : And when we told our fiery
there, they much blamed our guide, for Conduaing
us through the foreft at the foot of the mountains,
and in fuch a fevere feafon, when the {now obliged
themto feel: for lhelter in the woods. When we

informed them in what manner we placed ourfelves,
and the horfes in the centre, then they exceedingly
reprehended us, and told us, it was an hundred to
one but we had all been deflroyed; for that it was
thelight of the horfes, their fo much delired prey,
made the wolves more ragingly furious than they
would have been ; which was evident, by their being
at other times really afraid of a gun; but then, being

exceedingly hungry, and furious upon that account,
their eagernefs to come at the horfes made them in-

fenlible of their danger ; and that if we had not by
a continual fire, and at lali by the cunning ltrat'ai
gem of the train of powder, got the power over them,
it had been great odds if their number had not over-
powered us: lielides, it was a great mercy we alight--
ed from our horfes, and fought them with that con-
mge and conduct, which, had we failed to do, every-
manof us, with our heads, had been devoured. And-
':ide'ed"this was nothing la" the truth; for never in>>
my life was 1 lo fenlible of danger, as when 300 devils
came roaring upon us; to {hurt whole unwelcome
company, il'l was fine to meet a dorm every week,
I would rather go a thoufand leagues by lea.

I think I have nothing uncommon in my pallitgc
through France to take notice of, lince other travel-
lers of greater learning and ingenuity have given a
more ample account than my penis able to fet forth.
From 'I'houloufe I travelled to Paris, front thence to
Calais, where I took lhipping, and landed at Dover
the 14th of January, in a very cold feafon.

Thus come to the end of my travels, I foon dif-
covered my new-found ellate, and all the bills of ex-
change I had brought were currently paid. The good
ancient widow, my only privy counfellor, thought
no pains or care too great to procure my advantage -,
nor had I ever oceaflon to blame her fidelity, which
drew from me an ample reward. I was for leaving
my effeels in her hands, intending to fet out for
Lilbon, and fo to the Brafils; but as in the defolate
ill-and I had fome doubts about the Romilh religion,
{0 I knew there was little encouragement to fettle
there, unlels Iwould apoilatife from the orthodox
faith, or live in continual fear of the inquilition.
Upon this account 1 refolved to fell my plantation,
and for that intent I wrote to my old friend at Lilbon,
who returned me an anfwer, to my great fatisfat'lion,
which was, that he could readily fell it there : How.
ever, if I thought it convenient to give him liberty
to oti'er it in my name to the two merchants, the fur-
vivors of my trullees, reliding at the Brafils, who con--
fequently underlined its intrinlie value, having lived
jull upon the (par, and who I was lenlible were very
rich, and therefore might be the more willing to put-
chafe it; he did not in the leail doubt,but I lltould make,
4000 or 5000 pieces of eight more of it, than Ilhould.
do if I difpoled of it in any other manner w'ltatfoevre..

You may be {me I could not but agree with thh; '
kind and ingenuous propol'al; and immediately I l'ent
him an order to offer it unto them, which he accord-
ingly did ; {0 that about eight months after, the {hip
being in that time returned, he gave me a fatisfae'tory
account that they not only willingly accepted the offer.
but that they had alfo remitted thirtyothree thoufand
pieces of eight to a correfpondent of their own at
Lilbon, in order to pay for the purchafe. ,
liereupon, in return, I figned the inllrument of '
(ale, according to form, which they had [cut from
Liflion, and returned it again to my old friend, he
having {cut me, for my eliate, bills of three hundred
twenty-eight thoufand pieces of eight, referving the
payment of one hundred moidores per annum, which
1 had allowed him during life, as alfo fifty to his {on
during life, according to my faithful promife, which
the plantation was to make good as rent-charge.
And thus having led my reader to the knowledge
of the firlt part of my life, f0 remarkable for the
many peculiar providences that attended it, floating
in an ocean of uncertainty and difappointment, of
adverfity and profperity, beginning foolilhly, and 'yet
ending happily ; methinks, now I am come to a afe
and pleafant haven, it is time to call; out my anchor,
and, laying up my vefi'el, bid (for a while) adieu to
foreign adventures. I had no- other concerns to look
after, but the care of my brorher's two fons, which,
with the good widow's perfuafions, obliged me to
continue at home (even years. One of thefe children
I bred up a gentleman, and the other an experienced
failor, remarkable for his courage and bravery. Be-
fides this, I married a virtuous young gentlewoman,
of a very good family, by whom I had two Cons and
one daughter. But my dear and tender wife leaving
this earthly ltage (as you will hear in the fecond part
of my life), which sending my foul as it were alimo-
der, my native country became as it were tirefome

to me ; And my nephew;i happening to come from,
. i 5
fen, tempted me to venture another voyage to the
Edit Indies, which I did in the year t694, at which
time I vilited my ifland, and informed myfelf of
every thing that happened lince in departure.

One might reafonably imagine, t at what I had fuf-
fered, together with an advanced age, and the fear
of loling not only what I had gotten, but my life nl~
f0, might have choked up all the feeds of youthful
ambition and euriotity, and put a laliing Eeriod to
my wandering inclinations. But as nothing ut death
can fully allay the aclive part of my life, no lel's re--
matkaile for the many various contingencies of it,
you will next perceive how I vilited tny little king.

ufed them very honourddy -, together with the won-
derlul and {tieeefixl'ul battles over the Indians, who
invaded, and thought to have conquered the illand,
but were repelled by their invincible. Courage and
bravery, having taken eleven men and live women

be overcome by a much llronger inclination. My late

Such endearing tendernefs, graced with the molt
innocent, and yet molt powerful charms, brought me.
infenfibly into my right nnderltanding: And when I
conlidered all the tranfaetions of my life, and parti-
cularly my new engagement; that I had two chil-
dren already born, and my. wife big of a third; and
that 1 had no occalion to feel; for more riches, who
already was blefled with fulficiency; with much {frug-
gling. I altered my refolutions at lali, refolving to ap-
ply myfelf to {ome bulinefs or other, which might put
a period to {uch wandering inclinations. Hereupon I
bought a little farm in the county of Redford, with a
relblation to move thither -. Upon this there was a
pretty convenient. houfe, furrounded>> with land, very
capable of improvement, which. fuited my temper,
as to planting, managing, and cultivating. Nor was I
long before I entered upon my new fettlement, havv-
ing bought ploughs, harrows, carts, waggons, horfes,
cows and flicep; to that 1 now led the life of a country
gentleman, and was as happy in my retirement as the
grearelt monarch in the world. And what made me
think my happinefs the greater was, that I was in
that middle llate of life which my father had fo often.
recommended, much rcfembling the felicity of a rural
retirement, which is elegantly dcl'cribed by the poet;
in thel'e lines :

Free from all vices, free from care,

Age has no pain, and youth no mare.
But in the midli of this my happinefs, I was fed-
denly plunged into the greatelt forrows that I could
pollibly endure: For, when I lealt expeeted it, my
dear and tender wife was forced to [ubmit to the ir-
relifiible power of death, leaving this tranlitory life
for a better. It is impoflible for me to exprel's the
beauties of her mind, or the lovelinefs of her perfon -,
~ neither canl too much lament her lofs, which my
lo telt breath {hall record. Her influence was reatetr .
over me than the powers of my own reafon, e, im-nontnsox census. 1 8:

portunities of friends, the inltruetions of a father, or
the melting tears of a tender and difconfolate mother:
In a- word, (he was the fpirit of all my afl'airs, and
the centre of my enterprifes. But now, fince the
cruel hand of death had clofed my dearef't's eyes, I
feemed in my thoughts a {hanger to the world; my
privy counfellor being gone, I was. like a (hip with-
out a pilot, that could only run before the wind.
And when I looked around me in this bufy world,
one part labouring for bread, and the other fquan.
dering away their cflates, this put me in mind how
I had lived in my little kingdom, where bath reafon
and religion dictated to me, that there was' {ome-
thing that certainly was the reafon and end of life,
which was far fuperior to what could be hoped for
on this fide the grave. My country delights were
now as infipid and dull, as mufic or fcience to thofe
who have neither talte nor ingenuity. In fhort, re-
folving to leave OE houfc-keeping, I left my farm,
and in a few months returned to London.

But neither could that great city, fo famous for
its variety of entertainment, afford me any agree-
able delight : A {late of idlenefs I found to be the
very dregs of life, and molt hurtful'to body .and
foul. It was now the beginning of the year 1694,
at which time my nephew (who, as I before obferved,
had been brought up to the fea, and advanced to be
captain of a fhip) was returned from a fhort voyage
to Bilboa, the firil he had made in that fiation. He
comes to me one morning, telling me, that form
merchants of his acquaintance had propofed to him
to go a voyage for them, to the Eafi Indies and Chic
na, in the manner of private traders : And now,
Uncle, (faid he) if you'll accompany me tbitber, I'll m.
gage to land you upon your old i/laml, to 1217;: tbeflate of
your little kingdom. .

to- get a patent, for its pofl'cflion, and then to fill it132 aonrasau cursor.

with inhabitants. After I had paufed a little while,
and looktd (tedfaftly on him, lV/mt devil, or fpirit,
(faid "fin! you qviilv tlvir "film-Kt} errand a" He ilartcd
at firft, but recovering himfelf, when he perceived
I was not offended, Sir, (replied he) what I have
propofed cannot, l hOpe, be {tyled unlucky, tince
certainly you mutt be delirous to fee your little. ter-
ritory, where you reigned with more content than
any of your brother kings in the univerfe. Nephew,
(faid I) if you will leave me there, and call for me
as you come back, I care not if I give my confent :
But he anfwered, that the merchants would not al~
low their vefl'el, loaden with an infinite value, to re-
turn there again, which was a month's fail out of the
way; befides, Sir, (faid he) if I fltoruld mit'earry, was
your requeft granted, why then you would be locked
up as before. This indeed carried a great deal of
reafon in it, but we found out a remedy, and that
was, to carry a framed (loop on board, ready to
be fet up in the ifland, by the alliitance of fume
carpenters, whom we thould carry with us, that
might be titted in a few days to go to fea. I was
not long in forming my refolution, which overfwayed
my good friend the widow's perfualions, and the na-
tural afl'eetion I bore to my oung children. 1 made
my will, and fettled my e ate in fuch a manner
that I was perfeeil fure that my poor infants would
have jufiice done t em. The good widow not only
undertook to make provifion for my voyage, but al-
fo took the charge of my domel-'tic ati'ans, and to
provide for my c iildrens education; and indeed no
mother could take more care, or underflood that of-
fice better; for which I lived to reward, and return
her my hearty thanks.

The beginning of January 1694.5, my nephew
being ready to fail, I and Frida went on board in
the Downs on the 8th, having, befide that floop',al-
ready mentioned, a very confiderab'le- cargo {cunt
new colony. Fig/l, I had fome fervants, whom I
propofed to leave there, as inhabitants, or to work
while 1 Raid there, as they (hould appear willing:
There were two carpenters, a fmith, and a very in-
genious fellow who was Jack of all trades; for he
was not only a cooper by trade, but alfo he was dex-
erous at making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn,
likewife a good turner, and a good pot-maker. I
alfo carried a tailor, who confented to {lay in my
plantation, and proved a molt necefl'ary fellow in the
iiland. As to my cargo, it conliiied of a fuflicient
quantity of linen, and Englilh (tuifs, for clothing
the Spaniards that I expected to find there; as like-
wife gloves, hats, lhoes, flockings; together with
beds, bedding, and houfehold fiull', efpecially kit-
chen utenfils, with pats, and kettles, pewter, brafs,
8w. alfo nails, tools of all forts, (taples, hooks,
hinges, and all other things neceiTary; all which, I
think, colt me about three hundred pounds. Nor
was this all; for I carried an hundred Tpare-arms,
mulkcts and f ufees, belides fome pil-tols, a confiderable
quantity of feveral forts of fhot, two brats cannon,
belides fwords, cutlafles, and the iron part for fame
pikes and halherts. 1 made my nephew take with
us twoei'mnli quarter-deck guns, more than he had
oceation for in his (hip, to leave behind, if there -
was a neceiiity'; that fo we might build a fort there,
and man it again"; all oppofers whatfoever. 4-,, '
\Vell, we put out to tea; and though I etiimot fay
this voyage was fo unproiperous as my others haul
been, yet contrary winds drove us fo far northward,
that we were obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland,
where we lay wind-hound two-and-twenry days. flare
indeed our provilions were very cheap, and we added
to our {hip's llores, by taking in feveral live hogs,
.'two cows and'calves, which I then refolved: to put
oathore in my'ifland, if our .nece'flities did not can

for them. Oath: gsthof February welffailedjrom
Ireland, with a very fair gale, which lafled for fome
days; and I think it was about the 20th of the fame
month, late in the evenin , when the mate informed
us, that he faw a flalh o lire, and heard a gun fired;
and when he was fpeaking. a boy came in, and told
us, that the boatfwain had heard another. Upon
which we all ran to the quarter-deck, from whence
in a few moments we perceived a terrible fire at a
diftance. \Ve had immediately recourfe to our reck-
onings, in which we were all of opinion, that there
could be no land that way, it appearing to be at N.
N. \V. Hercupon we concluded that fame {hip had
taken tire at fea, and that it could not be far off, by
the report of the guns which we had heard. We
made up diredly to it, and in half an hour's time,
the wind being fair, we could plainly perceive a great
"tip on lire in the middle of the fea. Touched with
this unhappy difaller, and contidering my former
circumtlances, when the I'ortuguefe captain took me
up, I immediately ordered live guns to be tired, that
the poor creatures, not fceing us, it being dark,
(thou vh we could perceive their flame) might be fen-
liblet me was deliverance at hand, and confequently
might endeavour to fave themfelves in their boat.
Nor was it long before the thip blew up in the air,
and the fire was extinguilhed in the ocean. But
fuppofing them all to be in their boats, we hung out
our lanterns, and kept firing till eight o'clock in the
morning; when, with our perfpeclives, we beheld
two boats, full of people, making towards us, though
the tide was againli them; then fpreading out our
ancient, and hanging out a waft, as a fignal for them
to come on board, in half an hour's time, we came
up to them, and took them all in, there being no
let's than fixtyJour men, women, and children. It
was a French merchant {hip of 300 tons, homeward
bound from Qiebec in the river of Canada. The
matter informed me how, by the negligencc of the
fleerfman, the lleerage was fet on fire; that, at his
outcry for help, the fire was, as the thought, to-
tally extinguilhed ; but that form: fpar 8 getting be--
tween the timber and within the ceiling, it proceed-
ed into the hold, where there was no refilling it;
that then they got into their boats, as creatures in
the lall extremity, with what provilions they had,
together with oars, fails, and a compal's, intending
to m back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing a:
S. ". and by E. though there were feveral chances
againll them, as llorms to overfet and founder them,
rains and colds to benumb and perifh their limbs,
and contrary winds to keep them back and (larve
them: But, (faid he) in this our great dillrefs, we
heard the welcome report of your guns, when, with
unfpeakablc joy, taking down our malls and fails,
we were refolved to lie by' till morning; but pet'-
ceiving your light, we fet our oars at work to keep
our boat a-head, the fooner to attain your fliip, the
happy inflrument of our deliverance.

Indeed no one can exprefs the joy of thefe poor.
creatures on this oeealion ; fear and grief are eafilyt
fet forth ', lighs and tears, with a few motions of the
hands and head, are all the demonflrations of thefe
pallions; but an excels of joy carries in it a thou-
{and exuavagancies; efpeeially, 1 think, amonglt the
French, whofe temper is allowed to be more volatile,
pallionate, fprightly, and gay, than that of other
nations. Some were weeping, tearing themfelves
in the greatcll agonies of forrow, and running llark
mad about the lliip; while the rell were llamping
with their feet, wringing their hands, finging, lau be
ing, fwooning away, vomiting, fainting, with 3 Fe":
returning hearty thanks to the Almighty, and croill
ing themfelves. 1 think, if I am not millakcn, our
furgeon was obliged to let thirty of them blood. But
among the pall'engers, there were two prielts, the
one an old, and the other a young man; but what a.-
mazed me more, was, that the oldelt was in the worn
plight ; for no fooner did he perceive himfclf freed
from danger, but he dropt down, as it were with-
out life, and, to CNN one't: appearance, quite dead,
but the lurgcon, dialling and rubbiur his arm, 0-
pcned a min, which at tirl't dropped, and then flow-
ing more freely, the old man begun to open his e es,
and in d quirter of an hour was "ell again. {lat
foon rememl n ting his happy change, the Joy of which
whirled his blood about fatter than the vellels could
Convey it, he became {o feverilh, as made him more
lit for bedltm than any other plate, but the l'urgeon
giving him a llee py dole, he is as perfeflly compofcd
the next morning.
Remarkable indeed was the behaviour of the
oung prielt. At his. entrance on board the lhip,
he tell on his face in the molt humble prottration to
the Ahnightv. I thought indeed he had fallen into
a lwoon, and fo ran to heln him up; but he tnodeltly
told me, he v. as riturnin:r his thanks to the Al-
mighty, deliring m: to leave him a few moments,
and that, next his Creator, he would return me thanks
:tllo. And indeed he did in, about three minute:
after, with great li-t'iouliiefs and atl'etiion, while the
tears flood in his eyes, which convinced me of the
gratitude of his foul. Nor did ht let's {how his piety
and wifdom, in :tppltiwr himlelf to his country
people, and lubourinv to compole them, by the molt
powerful )(dimls, arguments, and perfuafions. And
"hen, indeul, (hole people had taken their night's
repofe, in foclt lodgings as our {hip would allow,
in: found nothing but the belt of manners, and the
molt civil ucknmvledgments, for which the French
are eminently remarkable. The next day the cap-
tain, and one of the priefls, defired to {peak with
me, and my nephew, the commander. They told
us, that they hid lined fome money, and valuable
things out of the ruined whel , which were at our
fer-vice; only that they delired to be fet on fhore
fome where in our Way. At the lirlt my nephew
was for accepting the money; but I (who knew how
hard my cafe would have been, had the I'ortuguefe
captain ferved me fo) perfuaded him to the contrary;
and therefore told them, that as we had done no-
thing but what we were obliged to do, by nature
and humanity, and what we ourfelves might exlieet
from others in fuch calamity; fo we took them up to
fave them, not to plunder them, or leave them naked
Upon the land, to perith for want of fubliftence, and
therefore would not accept their money : But as to
landing them, that was a great dilliculty ; for, being
bound to the Ball Indies, it was impollible wilfully
to change our voyage upon their particular account;
nor could my nephew (who was under charter-party
to ffurfue it by way of i'mxiil) anfwer it to the freight-
ers. All that we could do, was to put ourfelves in
the way of meeting fome lhips homcward bound
from the Welt Indies, that if poflible they might
get a paflitge to France or Endand. Indeed they
were very thankful for our firft ikindnefs; but were
under great concern, efpecially the pafl'engers, at
their being carried to the Eztfl Indics. They beg-
ged therefore I would keep on the Banks of iNew>>
foundland, where probably they might meet with
form {hip or floop to carry them to Canada, whence
they came. As this was but a reafonable requelt,
l was inclined to grant it, fince it was no breach of
charter-patty, and that the laws of God and nature
obliged us to do what good we could to our fellow.
creatures; and befidcs, the danger we ourfelves
lhould be in for want of provifious; fo we coufent-
ed to carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and
weather would permit 5 if not, that we ihould carry
them to Martinico in the Welt Indies. But as it
happened, in a week's time, we mule the Banks of

Newfoundland, where the French people hired a
bark to carry them to France. But the. young prielt
being delirons to go to the Edi Indies, l readily a-
greed to it, beeaul'e I liked his convet'liition; and two
or three of the French l'ailors alfo entered theml'elves
on board our lhip.

Now, direfling our conrl'e for the "felt Indies,
lieering S. and S. by E. about twenty days with little
wind, another adventure happened to exercife our
humanity. In the. latitude of '27 degrees 5 min.
north, the 19th of March 1094-5, we crceived a
fail (our courfe S. E. and by S.) which lliore up to
us, and then lhe appeared to he a large vell'el, flav-
ing loll her main-top-tnalt, fore-malt, and bolt'l' 't;
when firing a gun as a lignal ofdilirtfs, wind N. ' . \ .
we foon came to fpcak with her. She was a lhip of
Brillol, bound home from Barbadoes, out of which
road (he had been forced by a hurricane to the well-
ward, in which they loft their malts.

They told us, their expectations were to fee the
Bahama illands, but were driven away by a ftmng
wind at N. N. \V. and having no fails to work the
lhip with, but the main conrl'e, and a kind of l'quare
{ail upon a jury foremalt, became they could not
Come near the land, were endeavouring to lland for
the Canaries; nay, what was worl'e, belides all their
fatigue, they were almoll: ltarved for want of pro.
vilion, having cat nothing for eleven days; all that
they had aboard was l'ugar, a barrel of frelh water,
and {even ealks of min. In this (hip were three
palli'ngt-rs, a youth, his mother, and a maid-fervant,
who were in a molt deplorable condition for want of
food. 11' 1 had not gone on board their (hip, the
knowledge of their mil'ery had been concealed from
me, and they would have inevitably perilhed, though
indeed their fecond mate (who was captain, by ten.
fon'the true captain was not on board when the hur-
ricane happened) had before informed me that there
were fuch per'tons on board, whom he fuppofedrtm
be dead, being afraid to inquire after them, becaufe
he had nothing to give them for relief. Hereupon
we refolved to let them have what we could fpare,
ordering the mate to bring fume of his men on board
us, which he did accmdingly; as he and they look-
ed like tkeletons, when meat was fet before them,
I ordered them to eat fparingly; but however they
foon fell ftclt, which obliged the furgeon to mix
fomething in their broth, which was to be to them
both food and phyiie. When they were fed, we
ordered our mate to carry them a fack of bread, and
four or five pieces of beef; but the furgeon charged
them to fee it boiled, and to keep a guard on the
cook-room, to prevent the: men from eating it raw,
and confequently killin themfelves with what was
defigned for their relic . But particularly I defxred
the mate to fee what condition the poor pafl'engers
were in, and the furgcon gave him a pitcher of the
fame broth which he had prepared for the men;
and being curious to fee this feene of mifery myfelf',

I took the captain (as we called the mate of the ihip)
in our boat, and failed after them.

Here was a fad fight indeed! fcarce were the
vieiuals half boiled in the pet, but they were ready
to break open the meltdown door. T o ltay their
itomachs, the mate gave them bifcuits, which were
dipped in, and foftened with the liquor of the meat,
which they called Bra/{7},- telling them it was for
their own fafety that he was obliged to give them
but a little at a time; and f0 feeding them gradually,
their bellies were comfortably filled, and the men
did very well again. But when they came to the
poor gentlewoman in the cabin, who for feveral
days had continued without food, giving what {he
had to her fon, they found her as it were in the
arms of death. She was fitting upon the floor of
the deck, with her back up againtt the tides, between
two chairs, which were laihed fail, and her head
{hrunki'between her lhoulders, like a {eufelcfs corpfe.
Nothing was wanting in my mate to revive and en-
courage her; opening her lips, and putting fame
broth into her mouth with a l'poon; but not having
llrength to (peak, the lifted up her head with much
difficulty, intimating that it was now too late! at
the fame time pointing to the youth her fan, as
though the delired him to do what he could to fave
the lad; and in a little after {he died.

The youth indeed was not [0 far gone, yet lay
firetched out in a cabin-bed, like one that had fcarce
any life. In his mouth was a piece of an old glove,
the tell: of which he had are up ; at lirlt he vomited
what the mate had given him, but at length began
{enlibly to revive, though in the greatelt concern
for the death of his tender mother. -

As to the poor maid, {he lay by her millrefs,
like one in the [all pangs of death ; her limbs were
dillorted, one of her hands was clal'ped round the
frame of a chair, which (he griped fo hard, that
it was with fome dilliculty we feparated her from it;
Her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay
both together let {all againlt the frame of the cabin
table ; not only being ltarvcd with hunger, but over-
Come with grief for the lofs of her miltrefs, whom
lhe loved moll: tenderly. It was a great while before
the furgeon could bring her to life, and a much
longer time before (he came to her fenfes.

After we had failed with them fome days, we
fent thein live barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogf-
heads of hifcuit, with pealie, flour, and other things,
taking three calks of fugar, fome rum, and fume pie-
ces of eight for fans-faction, we left them, but took
the youth and maid with us, with all their goods.
The lad was about l'cventeen years old, very hand-
fome, modell, fenlible, and well-bred, but mightily
concerned for the lots of his honoured mother, havo
ing loll his father at Barbadoes but a few months bea

2
fore. He befeeched the furgeon to intercede with
me to take him out of the fliip, for that the failors,
not {paring a {mall fullenance, had flarved his mother.
But hunger has no bounds, no right, and conl'equent-
ly is incapable of any compallion. When the furgeon
told him that our voyage might put him in bad cir.
cutnllances, and farther from his friends, he an-
{wered he did not care, {0 he was delivered from
that terrible crew; that as the captain emeaning me)
had faved him from death, {0 he was ure he would
do him no harm; and as for the maid, when (he
was rellored to her fenfes, {he would be no lefe
thankful, let us carr them where we would. And
indeed the furgeon o reprefented their cafe to me,
that I confented, and took them on board, with all
their goods, except eleven lingheads of fugar; but
the youth having a bill of lading, I made the com-
mander oblige himfelf to deliver a letter and the
deceafed widow's goods to Mr. ROgers, a merchant
in Brillol ; but I believe the lhip was loll: at fea, for
we could never hear what became of her afterwards.
\Ve were now in the latitude of 19 deg. 42 min.
having as yet a tolerable good voyage. But, palling
by fevcral little incidents relating to wind and wea.
ther,I [hall relate what is more remarkable concern-
ing my little kingdom, to which I was then drawing
near. I had great dillicnlt in finding it; for as I
came to, and went from it hefore, on the fouth and
call lide of the ifland, as coming from the Brafils; {0
now approaching between the main and the ifland,
not having any chart for the coalt, nor land-mark,
it obliged us to go on lhore on feveral ill-ands in the
mouth of the river Oroonoko, but to no .purpofc.
Thus I perceived, that what I thought was a con.
tinent before, was no fuch thing, but a long ifland,
or rather a ridge of fanda. On one of thefe iflands
I found fome Spaniards, but they belonged to the
we de Trinidad, who came hither in a floop to make
falt, and to try to find fome. pearl mufl'els. But at
length I came fair on the fouth lide of my illand,
and then I prefently knew the countenance of my
little kingdom, to we brought the {hip fafe to an an-
chor, broadlide within the little creek, where llood
my ancient and venerable caflle.

No fooner did I fee the place, but calling for Fri-
day, I alked him where he was? but when he look-
ed a little, he clapped his hands, crying, Ojoyr! 0
"302'! 0 yrs! 0 11m? .' pointing to our old abode,
and then fell a dancing and capering as if he was
mad, and I had much ado to keep him from 'ump.
ing into the fea, to fwim alhore. Friday, (llaid I)
what do you think, {hall we go fee your father? At
the mentimiing his father's name, the poor affection--
atc creature fell a weeping; No, no, (fays he) nit-fl:
lv'm no more, never fit- pcor father more! I>> long ago
die, div lung ago ,- be nmr/J old man. You don't know
that, Friday, (faid l) but lhall we fee any body elfe .'
He looks ahout, and pointing to the hill above my
houfe, cries out, IVr fie, twafer, were mm}: mm and
Ilsmu' which, though 1 could not perceive them with
my perfpective glafs, was true, by what the men
theml'clves told me the next day.

When the Englilh ancient was fpread, and three
guns fired as a lignal of friendthip, we perceived a
{make rife from the cretk; upon whith Iordered
the boat out, taking Frid: with me, and hanging
out a white llag of truce, went on lhore, accom-
panied alfo by the oung friar, m whom I had relat-
ed the hillory of MC firll part of my life; belides
we had lixteen men well armed, in cafe we had met
with any oppofition.

After we had rowed direeily into the creek, the
firlt man I fixed my eye upon was the Spaniard whofe
life I had faved, and whole face I perfet'lly well knew.
I ordered them all to (lay in the boat for a while;
but Friday, perceiving his father at a diftance, would

I
have jumped into the fea, had they not let the boat
go. No fooncr was he on lhore, but he llew like a
fwii't arrow out of a bow to embrace his aged fa-
ther. Certainly it would melt at man of the firmeit
refolution into the foftell: tears, to fee with what
uncommon tranf ports of joy he fainted him : He firii
killed him, then ltroaked tis face, took him in his
arms, laid him under a thady tree, fat down by him,
then looked as carnelt at him as one would do at a
picture, for a quarter of an hour to ether. After

this, he would lie upon the ground, l roak his legs,
and kifs them, then get up and flare at him, as though
he was bewitched : But the next day one could not
forbear laughter to fee his behaviour, for he would
walk feveral hours with his father along the lhore,
leading him by the hand, as though he was a lady;
while, every now and then he would run to the boat,
to get fomething for him, as a lump of fugar, dram,
bifcuit, or fomething or other that was good. His
frolies ran in another channel in the afternoon ; for
when he fet old Friday on the ground, he would

dance round him, making comical poitures and ge-
iiures : And all this while would be telling him one
flory or other of his travels and adventures.

It was on the roth of April, mm 1695, that I
fet my foot upon the illand a fecond time. When
my faithful Spaniard, accompanied by one more,
approached the boat, he little knew who I was, till
1 diicovered myfelf to him : Signior, (faid l) in Por-
tuguefe, do not you know me? He fpoke never a
word, but giving his muiket to his attendant, ex.
tended his arms, and faying {ometliing in Spaniih,
that I did not then underitand, he came forward
and embraced me, faying, he was inexcufable not
to know his deliverer, who, like an angel (exit from
heaven, had faved his life. lie then beckoned to
the man to call out his companions, alking me, if
I would walk to my own habitation, and take pofl'ef-

'- v .. --.-a
lion, where I lliould find fome mean improvements:
But indeed they were extraordinary ones; for they
had planted fo many trees fo clole together, that the
place was like a labyrinth, which none could find
out except themfelves, who knew its intricate wind-
ings. lalkcd him the meaning of all thefe fortifi-
cations; he told me he would give me a large ac-
count of what had pulled linee my departure to this
time, and how he fubdued fotne Englilh, who thought
to be their murderers, hoping I would not be dif-
plcafed, {inee necellity compelled them to it. As
I knew they were wicked villains, (0 I told him, that
I was not only far from finding fault with it, but
was rather heartily glad that they had fuhdued them.
W'hile we were thus talking, the man whom he had
fent returned, accompanied by eleven more, but in
fuch habits that it was impollible to tell what na-
tions they were of. He lirlt turned to me, and,
pointing to them, 'l'hele Sir, (laid he) are fome
of the gentlemen who owe their lives to your good--
nefs; then turning to them, and pointing to me, he
made them feniible who lwas: And then indeed
they falutcd me one by one; not as ordinary men,
but as though they had been ambafladors or noble-
men, and l a triumphant conqueror ; for their behavi--
our not only agreed with a manlike majeltic gravity,
but at the fame time was {0 ohliging and courteous
as made them admirable to the lalt degree.

Before I relate the hitlory of the tranfirc'tions of
my kingdom, as I had it from the Spaniard's own
month, I mull here infcrt what I omitted in my
former relation. The matter is this: jult before
we weighed anchor to let fail, there happened a
quarrel on board the lhip, which had like to have
occaiioncd a feeond mutiny, till fuch time as the
comageon.>> captain taking two of the molt refracto-
ry pritoners, laid them in irons, threatening, as they
were concerned in the former difordcrs, to have
them hanged in England for running away with the
(hip. This frightened fume of the roll, as thinking
the captain would fervc them in the fame manner,
though he feemed to give them good words for the
prefent. But the mate having intelligence of this,
made me acquainted with their fears; fo that, to
make them more eafy, and ourfelvcs more fafe from
their eonfpiraeies, I was obliged to go down, and pals
my honour's word for it, that, upon their good beha-
viour, all that was palk lhould be pardoned ; in telli-
mony of which I ordered the two mens 'irons to be
taken off, and themfelves forgiven. But as this had
brought us to an anchor that night,in which there was
a calm, the two men that had been in irons ilole each
of them a mulket, and fome other weapons, and tak-
ing the lhip's pinnace, not yet haled up, ran away to
their brother rogues. The next morning we fent
the long-boat, with men to purfue them; but all in
min: The mate, in revenge, would have demolilhed
my little callle, burnt its furniture, and deltroyed
their plantations; but having no orders for it, he did
not put it in execution. And thus there were five
'luglilhmen in the ill-and, which caufed great ditl'er-
ences, as my faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect ac-
count of in the following manner:

" You cannot, Sir, but remember the embafl'y you
fent me about, and what a difappointment we met
with by your abfence, at our return. There is but
little variety in the relation of our voyage, being
blefl'cd with calm weather. and a fmooth fea. Great
indeed was. the joy of my countrymen to fee me alive,
having ilfiCd as the principal man on board, the cap-
tain of the lhipwrecked vell'el dying before 5 nor was
their furprife lefs, as knowing I was taken prifoner by
the favages of another nation, they thought me long
lince entombed in their monltrous bowels. But when
I (hosted them the arms, ammunition, and provi.
Irons [had brou ht for them, they looked upon me
as ;a'fC/.cond,_J eph, adyancedzin Pharoah's court,

2
and immediately prepared to come along with me.
Indeed they were obliged to trefpafs upon their
friendly fax-ages, by borrowing two of their canoes,
under a pretext for lilhing: And they Came away
the' next morning, but without any provilions of
their own, except a few roots, which ferved them
inllead of bread. Alter three weeks ablettce, we
arrived at your habitation. Here we met with three
linghlh failors, who, Ieoniefs, gave us provilions,
and that letter of diree'tion you had left for us, which
informed us how to bring up tame goats, plant corn,
cure grapes, make pots, and in fhort, every thing
that was ncceflltry for our ul'e; as, in particular, I
knew your method hell, in takingr Friday's father to
allill me, we managed all the ali'airs', nor were the
refi of the Spaniards wanting in their kind oilices,
drelliug food for the Englilhmen, who did nothing
but ramble and divert themfelves in the woods, either
ihooting parrOts, or catching tortoifes. But we had
not been long alhore, before we were informed of
two more Englilhmen, unnaturally turned out of
their common place of relidence by the three others
above-mentioned : This made my Spaniards and me
(whom they now looked upon as their governor in
your abfenec) endeavour to perfuade them to take
them in, that we might be as one family; but all
entreaties were in vain, fo that the poor fellows,
finding nothing to be done without indullry, pitch-
ed their tents on the north lide of the ill-and, a little
inclining to the welt, for fear of favagcs. Here they
built two huts, one to lodge, and the other to lay
their ltores in; for my good-natured Spaniards gim-
ing them fome feeds, they dug and planted as I had
done, and began to live prettily. But while they
were thus comfortably going on, the three unnatural
brutes, their countrymen, in a mere bullying hu-
mour, infulted them, by laying, the governor (mean-
ing you) had given them pofl'efliou of the ifland, and
d--mn them, they lhould build no houfes upon their
ground without paying rent. The two honell: men
(for fo let me now diltinguilh them) thought their
three countrymen only jelted, and one of themin-
vited them in, to fee their fine habitations; while
the other facetioully told them, that linee they built
tenements, with great improvements, they fhould,
according to the cullom of landlords, give them a
longer leafe; at the fame time defiring them to fetch
a ferivener to draw the writings. One of the wretches,
{wearing he fhould pay for the jellz,_ fnatches up a
firebrand, and clapping it to the outline of their hut,
very fairly fet it on fire, which would foon have con-
fumed it, had not the honelt man thruit him away,
and trod it out with his feet. liereupon the fellow
returns with a pole, with which he would have end-
ed his days, had not the poor man avoided the blow;
when fetching his mulket, he knocked down the
villain that began the quarrel. The other two
coming to allill their fellow, obliged the honell man
to take his mufket alfo, and both of them prefenting
their pieces, bid the villains ltand off; and if they
did not lay down their arms, death lhould decide
the difpute one way or other. This brought them
to a parley, in which they agreed to take their
wounded man and be gone; but they were in the
wrong that they did not difarm them when they had
the power, and then make their complaint to me and
my Spaniards for jultiee, which might have prevent-
ed their farther deligns againlt them. And indeed
fo many trefpaflEs did they afterwards commit, by
treading down their corn, fhooting their young kids
and goats, and plaguing them night and day, that
they refolved to come to my cattle, challenge all the
three, and decide their right by one plain battle,
while the Spaniards flood by to fee fair play. One
day it happened, that two of my Spaniards (one of
whom underliood Englilh) being in the woods, were.

13
met by one of the honett men, who complained how
barbarous their countrymen had been in dellroving
their corn, killing their milk-goats, and three k'ds,
which deprived them of their l'ubtillence ; that if we
did not grant them relief, they until he inevitably
ilarved; and in they parted : But when my Spaniards
came home at night, and {upper being on the table,
one of them began to repreheud the Englifhmen,
but in a very mannerly way :, which they refenting,
replied, what butinefs had their countrymen there
without leave, when it was none of their ground?
Why, {aid mYASpnninrd, calmly, Ingleh', they mull
not iiarvc; but they replied, Let them flarve and be
d--mn'd, they (hould neither plant not build, and
d--mn them they {hould be their tenants, and work
for them, for the iilaud was theirs, and they would
burn all the huts they lhonld find in the land. By
this rule, faid my Spaniard, liniling, we {hall be your
it'llell'S too. Aye, by G~--d, and {9 you Ihall, re-
plied the imputient rafcal. Upon which, darting up,
Will Aitkius cries, Come Jack, let's have t'other
brulh with them, who dare. to build in our domi-
nions ? Thus leaving us fomething heated with jult
patlion, away they trooped, every man having a gun,
piilol, and l'word, muttering fome threatening Words,
that we could then but imperfect! under-Rand.
That night they defigned to murder their two com-
panions, and llept till midnight in the bower, think.
ing to fall upon them in their iieep: Nor were the
honell men lefs thoughtful concerning them ; for at
this june'ture they were coming to tind them out,
but in a much fairer way. As foot: as the viilains
came to the huts, and found no body there, they
concluded that I and my Spaniards had given them
t'lOliCt', and litt't'ci-Ot'c {wore it) in; YCYCHgt'ti on us,
Then they demolithed the poor mcns hahitations;
not by fire, as they attempted before, but pulled
do '11 their Loufes, limb from limb, not leaving (lick
nor (tone on the ground where they flood; broke
their houfehold llull' in pieces, tore up their trees,
fpoiled their inclol'ures, and, in lhort, quite ruined
them of every thing they had. Had thefe people
met together, no doubt but there would have been a
bloody battle; but Providence ordered it for the bet.
ter; for jnll as.the three were got thither, the two
were at our callle; and when they left us, the three
came back again, but in a great rage, feollingly tell-
ing us what they had done ; when one taking hold
of a Spaniard's hat, twirls it round, faying, And you,
Sciguior Jack Spaniard, flmll bave the firm: fame, if
you don't mam! your manmrr. My Spaniard, a grave,
but courageous man, knocked him down with one
blow of his tilt; at which another villain fired his
pillol, and narrowly milled his body, but wounded
him a little in the car. Hereat enraged, the Spa-
niard takes up the fellow's mulket whom he had
knocked down, and would have that him, if I and
the roll had not come out and taken their arms
from every one of them.

" The Englifhmen, perceiving they had made all
of us their enemies, began to cool; but notwith-
ltanding their better words, the Spaniards would
not return them their arms -again, telling them,
they would do them no manner of harm, if they
would live peaceably ; but if they offered any injury
to the plantation or callle, they would {hoot them as
they would do ravenous bealts. This made them (0
mad, that they went away raging like furies of hell.
They were no looner gone, but in came the two
honclt men, fired with the juflelt rage, if fuch can
be, having been mined as aforefaid. And indeed
it was very hard, that nineteen of us fhould be bul-
lied by three villains continually olfending with im.
punity.

" It was a great while, Sir, before we could perfuade
the two Englilhmen from purfuing, and undoubt-

14
cclly killing them with their lire. arms; but we pro-
miled them jullice lhould be done thetn, and in the
mean time they lhould relide with us in our habita-
tion. In about live days after, thefe three vagrants,
almoll llarved with hunger, drew near our grove,
and perceiving me, the governor, and two others,
Walking by the tide of the creek, they very {ubmif-
lively delired to be received into the family again.
\Ve told them of their great incivility to us, and of
their unnatural barbarity to their countrymen; but
et we would fee to what the rell agreed to, and in
half an hour's time would bring them word. After
fome debate, we called them in, where their two
countrymen laid a heavy charge agaiull them, for
not only ruining, but deligning to murder them,
which they could not deny. But here I was for-
ad to interpol'e as a mediator, by obliging the
two Englilhmen not to hurt them, being naked
and unarmed; and that the other three lhould
make them rcllitution, by building their two huts,
and fencing their ground in the fame manner as
it was before. \Vell, being in a'-milerablc con-
dition, they fubmitted to this at prefent, and lived
fume time regularly enough, except as to the work-
ing part, which they did not Care for; but the Spa-
niards would have dil'penfed with that, had they cou-
tinned eal'y and quiet. '1'heirarms being given them
again, they fearee had them a week when they be-
came as troublelome as ever; but an accident hap.
pening foon after obliged us to lay alidc private re-
lentments, and look to our common prefervation.

" One night, Sir, I went to bed, perfeelly well in
health, and yet by no means could I compote my-
feli' to lleep: Upon which being very uneal'y, I got
up, and looked out; but it being dark, I could per-
ceive nothing but the trees around our cattle. I went
to bed again, but it was all one, I could not llcep;
when one of my Spaniards hearing me walk about,
altetl who it was up? I anfwered, it is I. When 'I
told him the occalion, Sir, (faid he) fuch things are
not to be llighted; for certainly there is fome mif-
chief plotting near us. Where are the Englifhmen ?
{aid I. lie anfwered, in their huts; for they lay
feparate from us, Sir, lince the lalt mutiny. \Vell,
(faid l) fome kind fpirit gives this information for our
advantage. Come let us goabroad, and fee if any
thing oll'ers to jullify our fears. Upon which I and
ionic of my Spaniards went up the mountain, not.
by the ladder, but through the grove -, and then we-
were llruck with a panic fear on fceing a light, as
though it were a fire, at a very little diltanee, and
hearing the voice of (event! men. lIereupon we re-
treated immediately, and railing the tell of our
forces, made them fenlible of the impending dan-
ger: But, with all my authority,l could not make
them day where they were, ('0 came" were they to
fee how things went. Indeed the darknels of the
night gave them opportunity enough to view them
(by the light of their lire) undifcovered. As they
were in ditl'erent parties, and ltraggling over the lhore,
we were much afraid that they lhould find out our
habitations, and deltroy pur flocks of goats; to re.
vent which, we fent an 'Englillnnan and two gpa-
niards to drive the goats into the valley where the
cave lay; or, if there was occalion, into the cave it-
felf. As to onrfelves, refuming our native courage,
and prudent conduct, had we not been divided, we
durfl: venture to attack an hundred of them; but be-
fore it was yet light, we rcfolvetl to fend out Friday's
father as a fpy, who immediately (tripped himfelf
naked, gets among them undifcovered, and in two
hours time brings word, that they were two parties
of two different nations, who lately having a bloody
battle with one another, happened to land by mere
chance in the fame illand, to devour their miferable
prifoners; that they wei'e entirely ignorant of any
' 5
perfon's inhabiting here ; but rather being filled with"
rage and fury again"; one another, he believed that
as foon as daylight appeared, there would be a ter-
rible engagement. Old Friday had l'carce ended his
relation when we heard an uncommon noife, and
perceived that there was a horrid engagement between
the two armies.

" Such was the curiolity of our party, efpecially
the Englilhmen, that they would not lie clofe, though
Old Friday told them their fafety depended upon it;
and that if we had patience, we lhould behold the
favages kill one another. However, they ul'ed fome
caution by going further into the woods, and place-
rng themfelves in a convenient place to behold the
battle.

" Never could there be a more bloody engage-
ment, nor men of more invincible fpirits and prudent
condue't, according to their way and manner of fight.
ing. It lalted near two hours, till that party which
was nearel't to our came began to decline, and at
hill: to fly from their conquerors. We were undoubto
edly put into a great conl'temation on this account,
left they lhould run into our grove, and confequeut.
ly bring us into the like danger. Hereupon we re-
folved to kill the firlt that came, to prevent dilcor'eo
ry, and that too with our fwords, and the butt ends

of our mulkets, for fear the report of our guns lhould
be heard.

" And lo indeed, as we thought, it happened : For
three of the varquifhed army crofling the creek, ran
direetly to the plthe, as to a thick wood, for fhelter;
nor was it long before our fcout gave us notice of
it ; as alfo, that the vit'lors did nor think fit to pur-
fue them. Upon this I would not {offer them to be
flain, but had them furpriled and taken by our party:
And afterwards they proved very good fervants to
us, being flout young creatures, and able to do a
great deal of work. The remainder ofthe conquers.303mm}: emsoz. 203

ed favages flei to their canoes, and putout into the
ocean, while the conquerors joining together, (hour-
ed by way of triumph, and about three in the after-
noon they alfo embarked for their own nation. Thus
we were freed at once from thev'favages and our fears,
nor perceiving any of thefe creatures for fome confie
derable time after. We found two-and-thirtymen
dead in the field of battle; fame were flain with long
arrows, which we found flicking in their bodies; and
the rell: were killed with great unwicld wooden
f words, which denoted their val! ltrcngt , and of
which we found feventeen, befides bows and arrows ;
but we could not find one wounded creature among
them alive; for they either kill their enemies quite,
or carry thofe wounded away with them. ' i
" This terrible light tamed the Englilhmen for
fome time, contidering how unfortunate they might
have been, had they fallen into their hands, who,
would not only kill them as enemies, but alfo for
food, as we do cattle; and indeed fo much did this
naufeate their ftomachs, that it not only made then't'
very lick, but more tractable to the common neecfa-
fary bulincfs of theka fociet-y, planting, (owing,
and reaping with the greatelt figns of entity and
fricndihip; {0. that being now all good friends, we
beganto confider of circuml'tances:in- general; and
the firll: thing we thought of was, whether, as we
perceived the favagcs haunted that fideio'f' the ifland,
and there being more retired parts of :it, any! yetias
well fuited to our manner of living, and equalizer)
our advantage, we ought not rather. to move~ ourtplace

for the fecurity of our corn and carrier.>> ' L - r
" After a long debate on this head, it was refolved,
or.rather voted "amine confradicmte, 'not to remove
our ancient cattle, and that <<for this very-$0041 1631.0"; i.
that forne time -or other we expedited toohear from
our .fuprem: governor (meaning you Sir),,-whof<t
1.6-, '
mefl'engcrs not finding us there, might think the
place dcmolifhcd, and all his fubjeets deflroyed by
the favages.

" As to the next concern, relating to our com and
cattle, we confented to have them removed to the
valley where the cave was, that being molt proper
and fullicient for both. But yet, when we conti-
dercd further, we altered one part of our rcfolution;
which was, to remove part of our cattle hither, and
plant only part of our com there : So that in cafe
one part was dcllroyed, the other might be preferv-
ed. Another rcfolution we took, which really had
a great deal of prudence in it; and that was, in not
trulling the three {av-ages whom we had taken pri-
foncrs, with any knowledge of the plantations which
we had made in the valley, of what number of cat--
tle we had there, much lets of the cave, wherein we
kept fever-.11 arms, and two barrels of powder you
left for us at your departure from this illand. But
though we would not change our habitation, we re-
folvcd to make it more fortified and more fecret. To
this end, Sir, as you had planted trees at fome dif-
tance before the entrance of yOur palace ; (0 we, im-
itating your example, planted and filled up the whole
{pace of ground, even to the banks of the creek, nay,
into the very ooze, where the tide flowed, not leav-
ing a place tor landing, and among thofe I had plant-
ed, they had intermingled to many lhort ones, all of
which growing wonderfully fall and thick, a little
dog fcarccly could (ind a paflage through them. Nor
was this futlicient, as we thought; for we did the
fameto all the ground, to the right and left hand of
us, even to the top of the hill, without to much as
leaving a pall'age for ourfelves except by the ladder :
Whit}! being taken down, nothing but what had
win '43 or witchcraft could pretend to come near us.
And indeed this was exceedingly well contrived,

cfpaiady to fen-e that occafion for which we after.-
wards found it neccfl'ary.
" Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement,
having all this time not one vifit from the favages.
Indeed one morning we had an alarm, which put us
in fome amazement; for a few of my Spaniards be-
ing out very early, perceived no 1er than twenty ca.
noes, as it were coming on (hare; upon which, re.
turning home with great precipitation, they gave us
the alarm, which, obliged us to keep at home all that
day and the next. going out only in the night-time to
make our obfervation : But as good luck would have
it, they'were upon another defign, and did not land'
that time upon the ill-and.

" But now there happened another quarrel between
the three wicked Englillnnen, and fame of my Spa-
niards. The occalion was this : One of them being
enraged at one of the favages, whom he had taken
prifoner, for not being able to comprehend fome-
thing which he was {howing him, fnatched up a
hatchet in great fury, not to corret'l but to kill him ;
yet milling his head, gave him fuch a barbarous cut
in the thoulder, that he had like to have {truck of?
his arm ; at wh:ch one of my good-natured Spaniards
interpofed between the Englithman and favage, be-
feeching the. former not to murder the poor creature ;
but this kindnefs had like to have coll the Spaniard
his life, for the Englilhman {truck at him in the
fame manner, which he nimbly and wifely avoiding,
returned fuddenly upon him with his (hovel, (being
all at work upon their corn-land), and very fairly
knocked the brutith creature down. Hereupon ano-
ther Englithman, coming to his fellow's afliilance,
laid the good Spaniard on the earth ; when immedi-
ately two others coming to his relief, were attack.
ed by the third Englilhman, armed with an old cut-
lafs, who wounded them both. This uproar foon
reached our ears, when we ruihing out upon them,
took the three Englithmen prifoners ; and then out;
next quel'tion was, what thould be done to high mu-
tinous an} inpuilcnt fellows, fo furious, det'perate,
and idle, that they were mifchievous to the highefl:
degree, and confcquently not fafe for the fociety to
let them live among them.

" Now, Sir, as [was governor in your abfence, fo
Ialfo tool: the authority of a judge 3 and having them
brought before me, I told them, that if they had been
of my country, I would have hanged every mother's
{on of them; but lince it was an Englilhman (mean-
ing you, kind Sir), to whom we were indebted for
our prei'ervatimt and deliverance, I would in grati-
tude ul'e them with all poflihle mildnefs; but at the
fame time leaving them to the judgment of the two
other Engliihmen, who, I hoped, forgetting their re-
fentments, would deal impartially by them.

" Hereupon one of their countrymen flood up:
Sir, (faid he) leave it mt to w,fir you may defilyiele we
have rug/571 to/E'ntence tire>>: to Meg/111970; : Bg/ia/txr, Sir,
tbirfi'lbw, IV ill Atkim', and tbe twa otlJe'I'J', profit/Ed
to m, that we might murder you all in your/leap, which
we would not coiyiwt to ; but knowing their inability,
and your vigilance, we did not think fit to difiamr it be-

fire now.

" How Seignior, (faid I) do you hear what is alle-
ged againft you? What can you fay to jufiify fo horrid
an ac'lion, as to murder us in cold blood? So far,
Sir, was the wretch from denying it, that he fwore,
d--mn him but he would do it ftill. But what have
we done to you, Seignior Atkins, (faid I) or what
will you gain by killing us ? \Vhat {hall we do to pre-
vent you? Mull: we kill you, or you kill us? Why
will you, Seignior Atkins, (faid I, fmiling) put us to
fuch an unhappy dilemma, fuch a fatal neceflity ? But:
fo great a rage did my feofling, and yet {evere felt,
put him into, that he was going'to fly at me, and an.
doubtedly had attempted to kill me if he had been
pofl'efi'ed of weapons, and had not been prevented by

three Spaniards. This unparallelled' and villainous103121180}: Causes: 207

carriage made us ferioufly confider what was to be
done. The two Englifhmen and the Spaniard, who
had favedthe poor Indian's life, mightily petitioned
me to hang one of them, fOr an example to the
others, which lhould be him that had twice attempt-
ed to commit murder with his hatchet, it being at
that time thought impoflible the poor flave lhould-
recover. But they could never gain my confent to
put him to death, for the reafons above-mentioned,
time it was an Englifhman, (even yourfei'f) who was
my deliverer; and as merciful-counfels are molt pre-
vailing, when earnellly prefl'ed, {o I got them to be
of the fame opinion as to clemency. But to prevent
their doing as any further mifchief, we all agreed,
that they {hould have no weapons, as fword, gun,
powder, or (hot, but be expelled from the fociety, to
live as they pleafed by themfelves; that neither the
two Engliflimen, nor the rel-t of the Spaniards, {hould
have converfation with them upon any account what- ~
foever -, that they {hould be kept from coming with-
in a certain dillance of our callle ; and if they dared
to offer us any violence, either by l'poiling, burning,
killing, or deltroying any of the corn, plantings,
buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the fociet ,
we would {hoot them as freely as we would do heal a
of prey, in whatfoever places we {hould find them.
" This fentence feemed very jail to all but them-
felves; when like a merciful judge, I called out to
the two honed Englifhmen, faying, You mull-con;-
lider they ought not to be ll-arved neither; and fince
it will be fome time before they can raife corn and
cattle of their own, let us give them fome corn tolaft
them eight months, and~for feed to few, by which
time they will raifefome for theml'elves : Let us alfo
bellow upon them {ix milk-gents, four he--ones, and
fix kids, as well for their prefent l'upport, as for- a
further increafe 5 wlthtosls nesefl'ary for their Work,
as hatchets, an axe, faw, and other things convenient
to build them huts: All which were agreed to; but
before they took them in poll'eflion, l obliged them
folentnly to {we-at, never to attempt any thinragainlt
us or their countrymen for the future. Tius dif-
milling them from our fociety, they went away, ful-
len and refraelory, as though neither willing to go
not llay: l-lowever, feeing no remedy, they toolt what
provifion was given them, pro mling to chool'e a con-
venient place, where they might live by themfelves.

" About live days after, they came to thofe limits
appointed, in order for more vie'tuals, and fent me
Word by one of tny Spaniards, whom they called to,
where they pitched their tents, and marked them-
felves out an habitation and plantation, at the N. E.
and mull remote part of the ifland. And indeed
there they httilt thetnfelves two very haudfome cot-
tages, refembling our little callle, being under the
tide of a mountain, with {cute trees already growing
on three {ides of it, {0 that by planting a few more
it would be oblcured from light, unlefs particularly
fought for. \Vhen thefe huts were linilhed, we
gave them font-e dry goat-lkius for bedding and co-
vering; and upon their giving us fuller afl'urances
of their good behaviour for the future, we gave them
fome peafe, barley, and rice for towing, and what-
ever tools we could (pare.

" Six months did they live in this feparate condi-
tion, in which they got their firlt harvelt in, the
quantity of which was but (mall, becaufe they had
planted but little land : For indeed, all their plant-
ations being to form, made it the more difficult,
el' )ecially as it was a thing out of their element : And
when they were obliged to make their boards and
pots, Ste. they could make little or nothing of it.
But the rainy feafon coming on, put them into a.
greater perplexity for want of a cave to keep their

I
com dry, and prevent it from fpoiling; and {0 much
did this humble them, that they begged of my Spa-
niards to help them, to which the good-natured men
readily confented, and in {our days {pace worked a
great hole in the tide of the hill for them, large
enough for their purpofe, to fecure their corn and
other things from the rain, though not comparable
to ours, which had {everal additional apartments.

"But a new whim pofl'efl'ed thefe rogues about three
quarters of a year after, which had like to have ruin-
ed us and theml'elvcs too : For it feems, being tired
and weary of this fort of living, which made them
work for themfelves, without hopes of changing
their condition, nothing would ferve them, but they
would make a voyage to the continent, and try if
they could feize upon fome of the favagcs, and bring.
them over as flaves, to do their drudgery, while
they lived at cafe and pleal'ure.

" Indeed the projeet was not fo prepofierous,if they
had not gone farther ; but they neither did, nor pro-
pol'ed any thing, but what had mifchief in the dcfign,
or the event. One morning thefe three fellows came
down to the limited ltation, and humbly delired to
be admitted to talk with us ; which we readily
granted : They told us, in (iron, that being tired of
their manner of living, and the labour of their hands,
in fuch employmcnts, not being fuflicient to procure
the necefi'aries of life, they only defired one of the
canoes we came over in, with fome arms and ammu-
nition, for their defence, and the would feek their
fortunes abroad, and never trou le us any more.
To be fure, we were glad enough to get rid of fuch
wretched plagues; but yet honelty made usinge-
nuoufly reprefent to them, b what we ourfelves had
full'ered, the certain deltrueztion they were running
into, either of being {tarved to death, or murdered
by the favages. To this they very audacioufly replied,
that they neither could nor would work; and con-
fequently, that they might as Well he flarvcd abroad
as at home : And as to their falling into the hands
of the favages, why, if they were murdered, that
was nothing to us, there was an end of them, nei-
ther had they any wires or children to cry after
them, ' nav, fn intent 11 ere they upon their voyage,

that if the Spaniards had not gin-n them arms, to

they had hut the canoe, they would have gone
1111 tout them.

" lhough we could not well [pare our lire-arms,
rather than they thould go like naked men, we let
them have two 11111tkets, a pillul, a eutlafa, and three
hatehets, 11-l1iehu'ere thought very fullieicnt; we
gave them alti) goats tlcth, a great balket full of dried

and a large 1' 1.1101 tntlieient to 1' :my twenty men.

rather than harm. But while we were conlideri'ng
of the event, up came the three Englifltmen, whofe'
voices we quickly knew, and To all our admiration
of that nature ceafed at once. And our wonder
was l'ucceedcd by another fort of inquiry, which was,
what could be the occalionof their returning to quick-
ly to the illand, when we little expeeled, and much
left; defired their company ? But as this was better to
be related by theml'elves, I ordered them to be
brought in, when they gave me the following ac-
conntof their voyage :

" Aftertwo days litil,orfomething lefs, they reach-
cd land, where they found the people coming to give
them another fort of reception than what they ex-
peeted or defircd: For as the ravages were armed
with bows and arrows, they durft not venture on
lhore, but {iecred northward, fix or {even hours,
till they gained an opening, by which they plainly"
perceived, that the land that appeared from this place
was not the main land, but an ifland. At their en-
trance into the opening of the fea, they difcovered
another ifland, on the rightohand northward, and
l'everal more lying to the weliward; but being rea-
folved to go on there fomewhere or other, thefy put
over to one of the wei'tern illands. Here they ound
the natives very courteous to them, giving them fe-
veral roots and dried lilh; nay, even their women
too were as willing to fupply them with what thcy
could procure them to eat, bringing it a great way
to them upon their heads. Among thefe hofpitable
Indians they continued fome days inquiring by ligns
and tokens, \\ hat nations lay around them; and
were informed, that there were feveral fierce and ter-
rible people lived every way, accuflomed to eat man-
kind: But for thcmfclves, they never ufed fuch diet,
except thofe that were taken in battle, and of them
they made a folcmn fealt.
" The Englilltmen inquired how long it was (into
they had a feud of that kind? 'l'hey anfwered, about
two moons ago, pointing to the moon, and then to
two lingers; that, at this time, their king had two
hundred pritimers, which were fattening up for the
thin gliter. The linglithmen we re mi hty delirous of
{eeing the priloners, uhieh the ot ters millaking,
thought they wanted fame of them tor their own
fowl: Upon whith they heekontd to them, pointing
to the tiling, and then to the fettin ' oi the tun, mean-
ing, that by the time it appeared in the mil next
morning, they would bring them fume: And indeed
they were as good as their word; lor by that time
they brought eleven men and live women, jufl as to
many cows and oxen are brought to tea-port towns
to Vit'd ual a "lip. But as brutilh as thefe Englithmen
were, their llonuths ttnned at the ti rht. \Vlut to
do in this t .tle they tould not tell: an: refute the
priloners, would have been the higheli atlront otler-
ed to the Lungc gentry; and to ditpole of them,
they knew not in what manner: However, they re-
folved to accept them, and {o gave them in return
one of their hatehets, an old key, a knife, and list
or {even of thtit bullets- , tl inps whith though they
"ere wholly ignorant ol, yet teemcd entirely con.
tented with, and druggin the poor wretthes into
the boat, with their in tndsibound behind them, de-
livered them to the anlilhmen. But this obliged
them to put oil as foon as they had thefe ptefents,
lell the donors thould hove expet'letl two or three of
the m to be killed, and to be invited to dinner the
next day : And to taking leave with all poflible re-
fpee't and thanks, though neither of them underltood
what the other tiiid, they failed away back to the firll:
ill nut, and there t't-t eight of the prilouers at liberty.
In their roy; igc they endeavourtd to comfort, and
lune fume tonvertatiou with the poor captives; but.
it was impotliblc to make them {enfible of any thing i
and nothing they could fa , or give, or do for them,
could make them otlterwiie perl'uadcd, but that they
were unbound only to be devoured: If they gave
them any food, they thought it was only to fatten
them for the flaughtcr; or looked at any one more
particularly, the poor creature fuppofed itfelf to be
the lirlt facrilice : And even when we brou ht them
to our illand, and began to ufe them with t e great-
at humanity and kindnefs, yet they expet'led every
day that their new matters would devour them.

" And thus, Sir, did thefe three (trange wanderer:
conclude their unaccountable relation of their voyage,
which was both amazing and entertaining. Here.
upon I alked them, where their new family was?
They told me, they had put them into one of their
huts, and they came to beg fome viauals for them.
'l'his, indeed, made us all long to fee them; and {0
taking Friday's father with us, leaving only two at
our cattle, we came down to behold thefe poor crea-
tures.

" When we arrived at the hut (they being bound
again by the I'Inglilhmen, for fear of efcaping), we
found them liark nalted, expecting their fatal tra-
gedy : 'l'here were three lulty men,well lhaped, with
ltraight and fair limbs, between thirty and live-and-
thirty years old ~, and live women, two of them might_
be from thirty to forty, two more not above four-4
and-twenty; and the lalt a comely tall maiden of a.
hour feventeen. Indeed, all the women were very
agreeable, both in their proportion and features, ex-
vet" that they were tawny, which their modelt be-
haviour and Other graces made amends for, when
they afterwards came to be clothed.

" This naked appearance together with their mi-
fcrable circumltances, was no very comfortable fight
to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may ven-
turehSir, without flattery, to fay, are men of the
bell behaviour, calmelt tempers, and fweetelt nature,
that can pollibly be; for they immediately ordered
Friday's father to fee if he knew any of them, or
if he underllood what they could lay. No fooucr
did the old Indian appear, but he looked at them
with great ferioufitelS; yet, as they were not of his
nation, they were utter ttrangers to him, and none
eould undertland his t'peeeh or ligns, but one woman.
This was enough to ant'wer the detign, which was
to allure them they would not be killed, being fallen
into the hands of Chritlians, who abhorred fueh
barbarity. \Vhen they were fully fatislied of this,
they exprefled their joy, by t'ueh llrange getlures,
and uncommon tones, as it is not polhble for me.
to deferibe. But the woman, their interpreter, was
ordered next to inquire, whether they were eontent
to be (creams, and would work for the men who
had brought them hither to fave their lives? Here-
upon (being at this time unbound) they fell a ea-
pering and dancing, one taking,r this thing upon her
thonlders, and the other that, intimating, that
they were willing to do any thing for them. But
now, Sir, having women among,r us, and dreading
that it might oeeation tome tlril'e, if not blood, l

alked the three men what they would do, and how '
they intended to tile thefe creatures, whether as
tenants or women? One of them very portly and
readily anfwez-ed, they would ute them as both.
Gentlemen, (laid I) as you are your own matters, l
am not going to retlrain you from that; but, me-
thinks, for avoiding ditlention among you, 1 would
only defire you to engage, that none of you will
take more than one for a woman or a wife, and that
having taken this one, none elle thould prefumc to
touch her; for though we have not a prieftly au-
thority to marry you, yet it is reafonablc, that who-
ever thus takes a woman, thould be obliged, to main-
tain her, tinee nobody are has any thing todowith
her : And this indeed appeared to jultv'toall pr'cfent,

1
A
that it was unanimoully agreed to. The Engliflunen
then alkcd tny Spaniards, whether they deligncd to
take any of them ? but they all anl'wered, No; fome
declaring they had already wives in Spain; and others,
that they cared not to join with inlidels. On the
rcverfe, the Englithmen took each of them a tem-
porary wife, and fo {ct up a new method of living.
As to Friday's ather, the Spaniards, and the three
titvage fervants we had taken in the late battle, they
all lived with me in our ancient cattle; and indeed
we fupplied the main part of the illand with food,
as neccl'lity required. But the molt remarkable
part of the ltory is, how thefe Englifltmen, who had
been {0 much at variance, {hould agree about the
choice of thefe women; yet they took a way good
enough to prevent quarrelling among 'themfclves.
They fet the five women in one of their huts, and
going themfelves to the other, drew lots which
thould have the firtt choice. Now, he that had
the firtt lot went to the hot, and fetched out her he
chofe, and it is remarkable, that he took her that was
the molt homely and eldelt of thenumber,which made
the relt of the Englilhmcn exceeding merry. The
Spaniards thcmfelves could not but {mile at it: But
as it happened, the fellow had the bell: thought, in
choofing one fit for application and bulinel's; and in-
deed (he proved the belt wife of all the parcel.

" But when the poor creatureszpcrccived themfelves
placed in a row, and feparated one from one, they
were again feized with an unfpeakable terror, as now
thinking they were going to be llain in earnefl: : And
when the Englifhman came to take the fir-It, the refl:
let up a lamentable cry, clapped their arms around
her neck, and hanging about her, took their lalt fare-
well, as they thought, in fuch trembling agonies,
and afl'ee'tionatc embraces, as would have foftened
the hardel't heart in the world, and made the dryell:
eyes melt into tears 5 nor could they be perfuaded
but that they were going to die, till fueh time as
Friday's father made them l'cnlible. that the inglilh-

men had chofen them for their wives, which ended
all their terror and concern upon this oecalion.

" Well, after this, the Englillnnen went to work,
and being allilled by my good-natured S maniards, in
a few hours they eretled every one oft 1cm :1 new
but or tent. for their l'eparate lodging, linee thofc
they had already were filled with tools, houl'ehold-
llull', and provihon. They all continued on the north
lhore of the illand, but l'eparate as before ; the three
wicked ones pitching farther oil, and the two honell'.
men nearer our calile; fo that the illand fecmed to
he peopled in three places, three towns beginning
to he built for that purpol'e. And here I cannot but
remark, what is very common, that the two honelt
men had the worfl wives (I mean as to indullry,
eleanlinel's, and ingenuity), while the three repro-
batcs enjoyed women of quite. contrary qualities.

" But another oblhrvation I made was, in favour of
the two honell men, to lhow what difparity there
is between a diligent application to bulincls on the
one hand, and a llothful, negligent, and idle tcm-
per, on the other. Both of them had the fame par--
cel of ground laid out, and corn to low, litllicient
for them ; but both did not make the fame improve-
ments, either in their cultivation or in their planting.

" The two honell men had a multitude of young
trees planted about their habitations, ii) that when you
approached near them, nothing appeared but a wood,
very plealing and delightful. Every thing they did
prol'pered and llonrilhed; their grapes planted in
order, leetncd as though managed in a vineyard, and
were inlinitcly preferable to any of the others. Nor
were they wanting to find ottt a place of retreat,
but dug a cave in the molt retired part of a thick
wood, to leettre their wives and children, with their
provilion and chiefeli goods, furroundcd with" in-
ntnnerahle flakes, and havitt v a mull. fubtle entrance.
in cafe any mifehief lhould tappen either from their
fellow-countrymen, or the devouring favagos.

" As to the reprobates (though I mull own they
were much more civilized than before), inflead of a
delightful wood furrounding their dwelling, we found
the words of King Solomon too truly verilied; 1 quart
[iv Ilse vim'yard 9f t/Jcflotlgful, and it qua: all overgrown
will. lbw-m. In many places their crop was obleured
with weeds; the hedges having {everal gaps in them,
the wild goats had got in, and eaten up the corn,
and here and there was a dead built, to llo in tltol'e
gaps for the prefent, which was no more t an {hut-
ting the liable-door alter the Reed was llolen away.
But as to their wives, they (as I ohl'erved before)
were more diligent, and cleanly enough, elpeeiall .
in their vit'l uals, being lllflnlat'd by one ofthc honed

And very well it was ft); for as he cooked himfelf,
his companions and their families lived as well as
the idle hulhantls, who did nothin but loiter about,
l't-teh turtles eggs, Catch lilh and rims, and do any
thing but work, and lived accordingly, while the
diligent lived very handfomely and plentifully, in
the molt comfortable manner. And now, Sir, I
full": to lay before your eyes a l'eene quite dill'erent
from any thing that ever happened us before, and
pethaps ever hefel you in all the time of your reu
tidence on this illand. l lhall inform you of its ori-
ginal in the following manner:

" One morning, Sir, very early, there came five
or fix canoes of Indians on there, inditptttably upon
their old cuilotn of devouring their priforters. All
that we had to do upon fueh an oeealion, was to lie
concealed, that they, not having any notice of in.
habitauts, might depart quietly, after performing
their bloody execution : \Vhoever tirlt difcovered
the favages, was to give notice to all the three plant-

L
ations to keep within doors, and then a proper feout
was to he placed to rgivt' intelligence Oi. their. dc-
partttre. llut. notwithllattdittg thefe wife meal'urea,
an unhappy dit'aller dil'etwered us to the tavages,
whieh Was like to have earned the det'olation of the
whole illand: For after the t'avages gerc gone otl'
in their canoes, {time of my Spaniards and 1 looking
abroad. and heing inllamed with a euriolity to fee
what they had been doing, to our great amazement,
heheld three laragea {all atleep on the ground, who,
either heing purged, eotthl not awake when the
others went oil. or having wandered too far into
the woods, did not come hack in time.

" \Vhat to do with them at tittt we could not tell ;
as for il.t\'t':=, we had enough of them already, and
as to kill them, neither ('hritlianitv ttor humanity
Would full} r us to thed the Hood of perfons who
never did us wrong. \\"e pereeived they had no
hoat left them to trant'port them to their own nation;
and that liy letting them wander ahont, they might
dili'over its. and inform the lirll lavages that thouhl
happen to land ttpon the fame bloody oeealion, whit'h
illlttttt'.;\llt'll might entirely ruin its; and therefore
] eounlelled my Spaniards to l'eem'e them, and let
them ahottt tome work or other, till we could better
"NW" of them.

" llereupon we. all went haek, and making them
:tWale', took them priloners. It is impetlihle to ex-
prefs the horror they were in, el'peeially \\ hen bound,
as thinking they were going to he murdered and
eaten, but we foon ealied them of their fear as to
that point. \\"e lirll took them to the hower where
the ehief of ottr country-work lay, as keeping goats,
planting eorn, &e.; and then carried them to the
two linglilhmens hahitation, to help them in their
hulinet'a; but happy it was for us all we did not
carry them to our cattle, as by the fcqucl will ap-
pear. 'l'he linglithmen indeed found them work to
do ; but whether they did not guard thcm (trtelly,
or that they thought they could not better than-
t'elves, 1 cannot tell ; bttt certainly one of them ran
away into the woods. and they could not hear of
him for a long time after.

" Undoubtedly there was rcafon enough to fuppol'e
he got home in fume of the canoes, the lavage-s re-
turning in about four weeks time, and going ofl'in
the {pace of two days. You tnay be certain, Sir,
this thought Could not bttt terrify us exceedingly,
and make us jullly conclude that this fattage would
inform his countrymen of our abode itt the illatrl,
how few and weak we were in eomparilbu to their
numbers; and we expected it would not be long be-
fore. the Englillunen would be attacked itt their
habitations; but the favages had not feeu their
places of fafety in the woods, nor our calile, which
it was a great happinefs they did not know.

" Nor were we. millaken in our thoughts upon this
occalion ; for about eight months after this, lix ca-
noes, with about ten men in each canoe, came fail-
ing by the north tide of the illand, which they never
were. aceul'tomed to before, and landing about an
hour alter fun-rife. near a mile from the dwelling
of the two Raglihmeu, who, it feetns, had the good
tottuue to dit'cover them about a league off: So that
it was an hour before they could attain the lhore,
and fume longer time before they could come at:
them. And now being conlirmed in this opinion,
that they were certainly betrayed, they immediately
bound the two llaves which were left, eauling two
of the three men, whom they brought with the ""0-
tueu, and who proved very faithful, to lead them
with their wives, and other convenicucies, into their
retired cave in the wood, and there to bind the two
fellows hand and fem, till they had further orders.
They then Opened their fences, where they kept their
milk goats, and drove them all out, giving the goats
liberty to ramble in the woods, to make the (hinges

gone to defend their bower, corn, and cattle, in Gait:
the favages lhould have rambled fo far. There ac-
companied the fever: Spaniards, one of the three fa-
vages that had formerly been taken prifoners, and
with them alfo that very lndian whom the Englilh-
men had a little before left .under the tree; for it
feems they pall'ed by that way where the llaughter
Was made, and lo carried along with them that poor
wreteh that was left bound. But fo many prifoners
now becoming a burden to us, and fearing the dread-
ful confequenee of their efcaping, moll: of the Spa-
niards and Englilh urged the abfolute necellity there
was of killing them for our common prefervation :
But, Sir, the authority I bore as a governor overruled
that piece of cruelty ; and then I ordered them to be
fent pl'libllCT'S to the old cave in the valley, bound
hands and feet, with two Spaniards to guard them.

" So much encouraged were the Englilhmen at the
approacll of the Spantards, and fo great was their

fury againlt the l'avages, for deltroying their habita-
tions, that they had not patience to llay any longer;
but, taking live Spaniards along with them, armed
with four mulkets, a piltol, and a quarter-Ralf, a-
way they went in purl'uit of their enemies. As they
pall'ed by the place where the favages were llain, it
was very eal'y to be perceived that more of them had
been there, having attempted to carry off their dead
bodies, but found it impracticable. From a tiling
ground, our party had the mortilieation to fee the
linoke that proceeded from the ruins; when coming
farther in light of the lhore, they plainly perceived
that the fat-ages had embarked in their canoes, and
were putting out to l'ea. This they were ver forty
for, there being no coming at them to give tent a
parting l'alure; but, however, they were glad enough
to get clear of fueh unwelcome gnetts.

1111011 better fortune it was to attain their native
1hore, would inflame their nation to another ruinous

attempt, with a greater force, to carry all before
them. And indeed 1'0 it happened, for, about {1'-

monltrous dubs, bows and arrows, and fuch like

fpeedily they were to execute their refolution, having
only that night's time allowed them. They knew

little indeed ; and what was our groatefl: misfortune,
we had no arms fullicient for them. The account,

they died, to die with them. Seeing their refolution,
we gave them hatchets likewil'e; but what pleafed-

dexteroufly knew how to ufe) that the Indians had.

againli another. . t

" Over this army, which, though little, was of
great intrepidity, I was conliitutecl chief general and
commander; and knowing Will Atkins, though ex-
ceeding wicked, yet. a man of invincible courage, I
gave himthe power of commanding under me: Her
and fix men, with their muikets loaded, with fix or'
{even bullets a-piece, were planted jull: behind a {mall
thicket of bullies, as an advanced guard, having
orders to let the firft pals by; and then, when. he-

K 5
fired into the middle of them, make a nimble retreat-
round part of the wood, and {0 come to the rear
of the Spaniards, who were lhaded by the thicket
of trees; for though the favages came on with the
fit-rcenefs of lions, yet they wanted the fubtilty of
foxes, being out of all manner of order, and drag-
gling in heaps every way: And indeed when Will
Atkins, after fifty of the favages had. .pafi'ed by,had
ordered three of his men to give fire, {0 great was
their conllernation, to fee fo many men killed and.
wounded, and hear fueh a dreadful n'oife, and yet
not know whence it came, that they were frightened
to the highcll degree; and when the fecond volley
was given, they concluded no lefs but that their
companions were {lain by thunder and lightning from
heaven. In this notion they. would have continued,
had 'Will Atkins and his men retired as- foon as
they fired, according to order; or had the reft been
rear them, to pour in their {hot continually, there
might have been a complete vielory obtained ; but
flaying to load their pieces again, difcovered the
whole matter. They were perceived by fome of the
[battering favages at a dittance, who let fly their
arrows among them, wounded Atkins himfelf and
killed his fellow Englifhma'n, and one of the Indians
taken with the women. Our party did not fail to
anfwer them, and in their retreat killed about twenty
favages. Here I cannot but take n0tice of our
poor dying flare, who, though flopped from his re-
treat by a 'fatal arrow, yet with his flail" and hatchet
defpcrately and gallantly aflhiled the purfuers, and
killed five of the favages, before his life fubmitted
to a multiplicity of wounds. Nor is the cruelty or
malice of the Indians to be lefs re marked, in break-
ing the arms, legs, and heads of the two dead bodies
with their clubs and wooden fwords, after a mofl:
wretched manner. As Atkins retreated, our party
advanced, to interfol'e between him and the favagesL:
but after three volleys, we were obliged to retreat
alto: For they were {0 numerous and defperate, that
they came up to our very teeth, {hot their arrows
like a cloud, and their wounded men, enraged with
cruel pain, fought like madmen. They did not,
however, think lit to follow us, but drawing them-
felves up in a circle, they gave .two triumphant {houts
in token of vielory, though they had the grief to fee
feveral of their wounded men bleed to death before
them. ,

" After I had, Sir, drawn up our little army to-
gether upon a riling ground, Atkins, wounded as
he was, would have had us attack the whole ,body
of the favages at once. I was extremely well pleafed
with the gallantry of the man ; but upon coniidera--
tion I replied, You perceive, Seignior Atkins, bow their
wounded men fig/Jt ,- let them alone till morning, w/Jeu
they will befiiint,fl5f, (Hid/rife, and the>> eve/Zia]! [mug

firmer to combat wit/b. To which Will Atkins, fmiling;

replied, 5173-113" very true Seignior, and joflmll I 100;.-
and t/mt'r tbe rayon I gum/1d fig/J! tbem now I am
warm. We all anl'wcred, Seignior Atkins, for your
part, you have behaved very gallantly; and if you,
are not able to approach the enemy in the morning;
we will fight for you; till then we think it conve-
nient to wait; and 11) we tarried.

" By the brightnefs of the moon that night, we'
perceived the favages in great .dil'order about their:
dead and wounded men. This made us change our-
rel'olution, and refolve to fall upon them in the night,
if we could give them one volley undifcoverezl.
' l is we had a fair opportunity to do, by one of the.
two Engliflimen's leading us my ad, between the'
woods and the-fea-fide weflward, and turning {hort
fouth, came privately to a place where the thicken:
of them were. Unheard and unperceived, eight
of us fired among them, and did dreadful execution ;,
end in half a minute after, eight more of us let fly,

killing and wounding abundance of them ; and then
dividing ourl'elves into three bodies, eight perfons in
each body, we marched from among the trees to the
very teeth of the enemy, fending forth the greatell;
lhouts and acclamations. 'l'he favages hearing a dif-
ferent mile from three quarters at once, flood in the
txtnnnl eonl'ulion ; hut coming in light of us, let lly
a volley of arrows, which wounded poor Old Friday,
yet happily it did not prove. mortal. We did not
iowever give them a lireond opportunity, but rulhing
in among them, we. tired three l'everal ways, and then
fell to work with our fwords, llaves, hatchets, and
the butt-end of our mulltets, with a fury not to be
refilled ; to that, with the mall dil'mal fereaming
and howling, they had recourli: to their feet, to fave
their lives by a l'peedy flight. Nor mull we forget
the ralour of the two women; for they expoled
tliemlelves to the greatcll dangers, ltilled many with
their arrows, and valiantly dellroyed leveral more
with their hatehets.

" lu lighting thefe two battles, we were f0 much
tired, that we did not then trouble ourlelves to
purl'ne them to their canoes, in which we thought
they would prel'ently put to the ocean: But there
happening a dreadful ltonn at lea, which continuing
all that night, it not only prevented their voyage,
but dalhed feveral of their boats to pieces againl't
the beach, and drove the rell {0 high upon the
lhore, that it required inlinite pains to get them
olil After our men had taken {omc refrelhment and
a little icpol'c, they refolred early in the morning
to go towards the place of their landing, and fee
whether they were gone oil, or in what pollute
they remaii ed This necellarily. led them to the
place ol'hattle, where fevcral ol the lav-ages were
expiring; a light no way pleating to generous mmds,
to delight in their mil'ery, though obliged to conquer
them by the law of arms : But our own Indian Haves
put them out of their pain, by difpatching them
with their hatchets. At length, comin in view of
the remainder of their army, we found t em leaning
upon their knees, which were bended towards their
mouth, and the head between the two hands.
liereupon, coming within mulket-lhot of them, I
ordered two pieces to be fired without ball, in order
to alarm them, that we might plainly know whether
they had the courage to venture another battle, or
were utterly difpirited from {uch an attempt, that ('0
we might accordingly manage them. And indeed
the projeel; took very well; for no fooner did the
favages hear the firlt gun, and perceive the flafh of
the {econd, but they fuddenly {tarted upon their
feet, in the greatell: eonlternation; and when we
approached towards them, they ran yowling and
{creaming away up the hill into the country.

" We could rather, at firllz, have wilhed, that the
weather had permitted them to have gone off to the
(ca: But when we confidered that their efcape might
occafion the approach of multitudes, to our utter
ruin and difiolution, we were very well pleafed the
contrary happened : And Will Atkins (who, though
wounded, would not part from us all this while) adJ-
vil'ed us not to let llip this advantage, but clapping
between them and their boats, deprive them of the
capacity of ever returning to plague the ifland: I
blow (laid he), More it out one 051mm you am male,

HERF is no doubt to l'up pofe, but that the pre-
Ceding relation of my f'aithful Spaniard was
very agreeable, and no lel's l'urprifing to me, to the
young prieil, and to all who l1e.1rd' 1t: Nor were

thefc people leis plc afed with thofe neccfl'ary utenlils
that I brought them, fuch as the knives, feiffars,
fpades, lhovcls, and pick-axes, with which they now
adorn their habitations. So much had they addicted
themfelves to wicker-work, prompted by the inge-
nuity of the Indians, who allillcd them, that when I
viewed the Englilhmens colonies, they feemcd at a
dillancc as though they had lived like bees in a hive :
For Will Atkins, who was now' become a very in-
dullrious and fober man, had made himfelf a tent of
balket-work round the outlide -, the walls were work-
ed in as a bafket, in pannels or llrong fquares of
thirty-two in number, ltanding about feven feet high:
In the middle was another, not above twenty paces
round, but much (tronger built, being of an oetago-
nal form, and in the eight corners l'tood eight flrong
polls, round the top of which he laid llrong pieces,
pinned with wooden pins, from which he raifed a
pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I adore on,
and joined very well together with iron fpikes, w ich
he made himfelf ; for he had made him a forge, with
a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal for his work,
forming an anvil out of one of the iron-crows, to
work upon, and in this manner he would make him-
felf hooks, llaples fpikes, bolts, and hinges. After
he had pitched the roof of his innermofl: tent, he
made it to firm between the rafters with bafket-work,
thatching that over again with rice firaw, and over
that a large leaf of a tree, that his houfc was as dry
as if it had been tiled or flared. The outer circuit
was covered as a lean-to quite round this inner apart-
ment, laying long rafters from the thirty-two angles, '
to the top-potts of the inner houfe, about twenty
feet diltance; fo that there was a {pace like' a wall
betwixt the outer and inner wall, near twenty feet in
breadth. The inner place he partitioned, of? with
the fame wickerowork, dividing it into (ix neat apart-
ments, every one of which had a door, fitlt into the
entry of the main tent, and anorher into the fpace
and wall; that was round It, not oIIIy convcnicnt {or

Nor did his remarksend here; for making ob-
fervations upon my improvements, and on my con-
dition at lll'tl, inltnitely wot-{e than theirs, he told
me, that Englilhtnen had, in their tliltrel's,greatcr
pretence of mind than thofe of any other country
that he had met with; and that they and the Portu-
guefe were the worlt men in the world to ltrug it:
under misfortunes. When they landed among tie
l'avages, they found but little provilion, except they
would turn eannibals, there being but a few roots and
herbs, with little ftthtlanee in them, and of which
the natives gave them but very. fparingly. Many
were the ways they took to civilizc and teach the fa-
vages, but in vain: For they would not own them
to be their inllruelors, whole lives were owing to
their bounty. Their extremities were very great,
many days being entirely without ,food, the favagra
there being more indolent and left>> devouring than
tholl: who had better l'upplies. \Vhen they went out:
to battle, they were obliged to aftitt theft: people, in
one of which my faithful Spaniard being taken, had
like to have been devoured. They had loll their am-
munition, which rendered their lire-arms ufelefs;
nor could they ul'e the bows and arrows that were
given them, l'o that while the armies were at a difc
t. nee, they had no chance, but when clole, then
the could be of fervice with halberts and lharpened
flicks, put into the muzzles of their mulkets. They
made ll'lClhlt'chs targets of wood, covered with the
lkins of wild beails 5 and when one hapgened to be
knocked down, the tell: of the company tough: over
him till he recovered; and then (landing clofe in a
line, they would make their way through a thoul'and
favages. At the return of their friend, who they
thought had been entomhed in the bowels of their
enemies, their joy was inconceivable. Nor Were they
let's l'urpril'ed at the light of the loaves of breadl had
fent them, things they had not {ecn for fcvcral years,
at the fame time crolling and blelling it, as though
it was manna lent from Heaven: But when they
knew the errand, and perceived the boat which was
to carry them to the pertbn and place from whence
Inch relief came, this {truck them with fuch a fur-
pril'e of joy as made fume of them faint away, and
others burlt out into tears.

This was the fummary account that I had from
them. I [ha]! now inform the reader what I next
did for them, and in what condition I left them. As
we were all of opinion that the favages would {carce
trouble them any more, {'0 we had no apprehenlions
on that fcore. I told them I was come purely to e-
ftablilh, and not to remove them; -_and, upon that
occafion, had not only brought them necellitries for
convenience and defence, but alfo artificcrs, and o-
ther perfons, both for their neceli'ary employments,
and to add to their number. They were all together
when I thus talked to them; and before I delivered
to them the llores I had brought, I alkcd them one
by one, if they had entirely forgot their firll animo-
fities, would engage in the ltrit'lcfl friendfliip, and
{bake hands with one another? On this, Will At-
kins, with abundance of good humour, faid, they
had alilie'tions enough to make them all fober, and
enemies enough to make them all friends: As for
himfelf he would live and die among them, owning,
that what the Spaniards had done to him, his own
mad humour had made neceflitry for them to do:
Nor had the Spaniards occalion to juflify their pro-
ceeding to me; but they told me, that fince Will
Atkins had behaved himfelf f0 valiantly in fight, and.
at other times {bowed fuch a regard to the common
interell of them all, they had not only forgotten all
that was pafl, but thought he ought as much to be
united with arms and necetiaries as any of them,
which they tellified by making him next in com-
mand to the governor: And they moll: heartily em-
braced the occalion of giving me this folemn nfi'ur-

again as long as they lived.

After thefe kind declarations of friendihip, we
appointed all of us to dine together the next day;
upon this I caufed the {hip's' cook and his mate to
come on {hore for that purpofe, to aflilt in drefling
our dinner. We brought from the {hip {ix pieces
of beef, and four of pork, together with our punch-
bowl, and materials to fill it; and in particular, I
gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten of
Englifh beer, which was very acceptable to them.
The Spaniards added to our feal't five whole kids,
which being roalted, three of them were fent as
frelh meat to the failors on board, and the other
two we ate ourfelves. After our merry and inno--
cent feall: was over, I began to dillribute my cargo
among them. Firll, I gave them linen futlicient to
make every one of them {our fhirts, and, at the Spa-
niards rt-quelt, 'made them up fix. The thin Englifh
llul'r's I allotted to make every one a light coat like a.
frock, agreeable to the climate, and left them Inch 3,
quantity as to make more upon their decay, as alfo.
pumps, (hoes, hats, and Ilockings. It is not to be ex-'
prefied the pleating {atisfaelion which lat upon the
countenanees of theie poor men, when they perceiv-
ed what care I took of them, as if I had been a com-
mon father to them all ; and they all engaged never
to leave the ifland, till I gave my confent for their
departure. I then prefented to them the pe0ple I.
brought, viz. the tailor, fmith, and the two car-
penters; but my Jack of all trades was the molt ac-
ceptable prefent 1 could make them. My tailor fell

immediately to work, and made every one of them a
lhirt; after which, he. learned the women how to
few and lliteh, therehy to become the more helpful
to their hulhands. Neither were the carpenters lefs
nlel'nl, taking in pieces their L'lumfy things, inllead
of which they made convenient and handfome tahles,
llools, hL-dlleads, cupboards, lockers and lln'lves. But

and within, in a molt furpriling manner. '

But now 1 think it high time to {peak of the young
French prielt of the order of St. Benedifl, whofe ju-

of which dying at ({uebec, that voyage was fufpend-
ed: And laltlv,lhippi1;g himtelf tor Fiance, this
tall thip was deflroyed by fire, as before has been re.
latcd.

At this time we talked no farther; but another
morning he comes to me, jull; as [was going to
vil'it the Englilhmens colony, and tells me, that as
he knew the profperity of the ifland was my prin-
cipal dclire, he had fomething to communicate a-
greeable to my (lelign, by which perhaps he might
put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the
way of the benediction of Heaven. How, Sir? (faid
I, in a furprife) are we not yet in the way of God's
blelliag, after all thefe lignal providences and de-
liverances, of which you have had fuch an ample
relation? lie replied, I hope, Sir, you are in the
way, and that your good delign will profper; but
{till there are fome among you that are not equally
right in their aEURtions ;- and remember, I befeech you,
Sir, that At'han, by his crime, removed God's blef-
ling from the camp of the children of Ifrael; that
though fix-and-thirty were entirely innocent, yet
they became the-objeels of divine vengeance, and
bore the weight of the punilhment accordingly.

So fenlilrly was I touched with this difcourfe, and
{o fatisfied with that ardent piety that inflamed his
foul, that I delired him to accompany me to the
Engliihmens (plantations, which he was very glad of,
by reafon the e were the fubjeets of what he defign.
ed to difcourfe with me about; and while we walk-
ed on together, he began in the following manner:

Sir, (faid he) 1 mutt confefs it is a great unhappi.
nefs that we difagree in feveral doetrinal articles of
religion; but t'urcly both' of us acknowledge this,
that there is a God, who having given us {Ome {tat-
ed rules for our l'crvice and obedience, we ought not
willingly and knowingly to offend him, either by
:eglet'ling what he has commanded, or byvdoing
what he has forbidden us. This truth every Chrif-

L t
tian owns, that whenever any one prefumptuoufly
tins againl'; (lod's command, the Almighty then
withdraws his blelling from him; every good man
therefore ought certainly to prevent fuch negleet of,
or [in againlt God and his commands. I thanked
the young priclt for exprelling to great a concern
for us, and delired him to explain the particulars of
what he had obferved, that, according to the pa-
rable of Aehan, I might remove the aeeurfed thing
from among us. Why then, Sir, (faid he) in the
full: place, you have four Englilhmen, who have
taken lavage women to their wives, by whom they
have feveral children, though none of them are le-
gally married, as the law of God and man requires ;
they, I fay, Sir, are no let's than adulterers, and as
they llill live in adultery, are liable to the curfe of
God. I know, Sir, you may objefl the want of a
priell, or clergyman of any kind ; as alfo pen, inlt,
and paper, to write down a contratl of marriage,
and have it figned between them. But neither this,
nor what the Spanith governor has told you of their
eheoting by content, can be. reckoned a marriage,
nor any more than an agreement to keep them from
quarrellingr amormr thcmfelves; for, Sir, the clTCHCC
or t'aerament ot' matrimony (fo he called it) not only
eonlills in mutual confettt, but in the legal obligation
which compels them to own and acknowledge one
anorher, to abltain from other perform, the men to
provide for their wives and children, and the women
to do the fame in like conditions, mutatir murmzdir on
their lide ; whereas, Sir, thel'e men, upon their
own pleahxre, on any oceation, may forlaltc thofc
women, and marry others, and by difowning their
children, l'utl'et :htm utterly to perilh, Now, Sir,
(added he) can God be honoured in forth an unlawful
Iibt't'tv as this? how can a hlclling fuceeed the be"
endeawnrs, if men are allowed to live in {o licen-
tious a way? I was indeed "rack with the thing my-
2
l'elf, and thought that they were much to blame that
no formal contraet had been made, though it had
been but breaking a {tick between them, to engage
them to live as man and wife, never to feparate, but
love, cherilh, and comfort one another all their lives.
Yet, Sir, (find i) when they took thefe women, I was
not here; and if it is adultery, it is palt my remedy,
and I cannot help it. True, Sir, (anfwered the young
prielt) you cannot be cbarged wit/2 t/mt part of tbe crime
table/J qua: (lane in your ab/ence; but I be/Z'ecl) you don't
flatter your/Elf [bat you are under no obligation now to
put a period to it, qubic/J if you neg/cc? to (lo, guilt will
be entirely on you alone, fince it it certainly in nobody'r
power but your: to alter t/Jcir condition. I mull: con-
' t'el's I was {0 dull that I thought he meant I lhould
part them, and knowing that this would put the
whole illand in confulion, [ told him Icould not con-
lent to it upon any account whatt'o-Jver. Sir, (laid
he, in a great furpril'e) 1 do not mean tlmt you fbould fi.
parate, but marry tbem by a written contrafl, flgnerl by
bot/J man and woman, and by all [be qvftntfl'u' prtyl'nt,
wbicb all tlve European lawr decree to be of/igflicicnt efi.
racy. Amazed with fuch true piety and Gncertty,
and confitlering the validity of a written contract, I
acknowledged all that he laid to be very jail: and,
kind, and that I would difcourfe with the men
about it; neither could I fee what reafon they could
have not to let him marry them, whole authority in
that affair is owned to be as authentic as if they
were married by any of our clergyman in England.
The next complaint he had to make to me was
this, that though thefe Englilh fubjeas of mine had
lived with thofe women {even years, and though they
were of good underflanding, and capable of inflruc-
tion, having learned not only to fpeak, but to read
Englifh, yet all this while they never taught them
anything of the Chriltian religion, or the knowledge

of God, mud) lel's in what manner he ought to be

I could hold no longer, but embracing him, told
him, with a thoufand thanks, I would grant what-
ever he requel'ted, and dclired him to proceed in the
third article, which he did in the following manner:

Sir, (faid he) it lhould be a maxim among all Chri-
fiians, 7/:th Cluf/Yirm knowledge cugbt to be propagated
by all pgflib/v warm, and on m"! oral/5021:. Upon this
account our church feuds millionaries into Perlia,
India, and China, mm who are willing to die for
the fake of God and the Chtillian faith, in order to
bringr poor infidtls into the way of falvation. Now,
Sir, as here is an opportunity to convert {even-aud-
thirty poor images, I wonder how you can pafs by
fuch an occalion of doing good,which is really worth
the cxpencc of a man's whole life.

I mull confel}. I was in confounded at this dif.
courfe, that I could not tell how to anfwer him.
Sir, (laid he, feeing me in difin'der)1flmll [2e wry
forr)' if I have given you {fie/Ice. N0, Sir, (laid l)
I am rather confounded; an'd you know my circum-
flances, that being bound to the Ball Indies in a
merchant (hip, I cannot wrong the owners fo much
as to detain the {hip here, the men lying on vifiuals
and wages on their account. If I Pray above twelve
days, 1 mull pay 3!. Sterling prrdiem demurrage,
nor muft the {hip flay above eight days more; [0

1
that I am unable to engage in this work, unlest
would leave the (hip, and be reduced to my former
condition. The prielt, though he owned it was hard
upon me, yet he laid it to my confcience, whether
the blefling of faring feven-and-thirty fouls was not
worth venturing all that I had in the world? Sir,
(faid 1) it is very true ; but as on are an ecclefiaflic,
it naturally falls into your prozeflion ; why therefore
don't you rather offer to undertake it yourfelf, than
prefs me to it? Upon this he turned a out, making
a very low bow, I molt humbly thank God and you,
Sir, (faid he) for fo blelTed a call ; and molt willingly
undertake fo glorious an ollice, which will fufficient-
ly compenfate all the hazards and difficulties I have
gone through in a long and uncomfortable voyage.

While he was thus fpeaking, I could dil'COVCr a
rapture in his face, by his colour going and coming ',
at the fame time his eyes fparkled like fire, with all
the figns of the molt zealous tranfports. And when
l alked whether he was in earnelt; Sir, (t'aid be) it
was to preach to the Indians I confented to come
along with you; thel'e infidels, even in this little
illand, are infinitely of more worth than- my poor
life; if fo that I lhould prove the happy inlirument
of faving thefe poor creatures fouls, ,I care not if I
never fee my native country again. One thing I on-
ly beg of you more, is, that you would leave Friday
with me, to be my interpreter, without whole allil't-s
ance neither of us will underltand each other.

This requefl: very fenfibly troubled me, firfi, upon
Friday's being bred a proteftant, and fecondly, for.
the alfeetion I bore to him for his fidelity; but im-
mediately the remembrance of Friday's tather com-
ing into my head, I recommended him to him as
having learned Spanifh, which the prieft alfo under-
llzood,' and {0 was thoroughly fatisfied with him.

"Then we came to the Englilhmen, after I had told.
L. 3
them what neceflary things I had done for them, I
talked to them of the. feandalous life they led, told
them what notice the clergyman had taken of it,and
alked them if they were married men or bachelors?
'l'hey anl'wered, two of them were widowers, and
the other three tingle men. But (laid l) with what
eonl'eicnce can you call theft: vour wives, by whom
you have lb many children, and yet are not lawfully
married ? They all {aid that they took them before
the governor as fueh. having nobody elfe to marry
them, which they thought as legal as if they had had
a parfon. No doubt (faid I) but in the eye of God
you are lo; but unlefs I am aflitretl of your honelt
intention never to defett thefe poor creatures, I can
do nothing more for you, neither can you expect
God's blelling while you live in fuch an open courfc
of adultery. I'iCTt upon \Nill Atkins, who fpoke for
the wit, told me, that they believed their wives the
molt innocent and virtuous creatures in the world;
that they would never forfake them while they had
breath; and that if there was a clergyman in the
Ihip, they would be married to them with all their
heart. I told you before (faid I) that l have a mini-
fier with me, who {hall marry you to-morrow morn-
ing, if you are willing; fol would have you confult
to-night with the tell about it. I told him the cler-
gyman was a Frenchman, and knew not a word of
Engliih, but that I would aft as a clerk between
them. And indeed this hufinefs met with fut-h fpeedy
fuecefs, that they all told me, in a few minutes after,
that they were ready to he formally married as foon
as I pleated; with which informing the prieii, he
was exceedingly rejoiced.

Nothing now remained, but that the women ihould
be made fenlible of the meaning of the thing; with
which l'eing well fatislied, they with their huibauds
attended at my apartment the next morning: 'l'liere
was my l'l'itil, habited in a black veil, lomething
like a calToc, with a falh round it, much refembling
a minilter, and l was his interpreter. But the fe-
rioufnefs of his behaviour, and the fcruples he made
of marrying the women, who were not baptifed,
gave them an exceeding reverence for his perfon :
Nor indeed would he marry them at all, till he ob-
tained my liberty to difcourfe both with the men and
women ; and then he told them, that in the fight of
all indifferent men, and in the fenfe of the laws of
fociety, the had lived in open adultery, which no-
thing now but their confent to marry, or final fepa--
ration, could put an end to; and even here was a
dilliculty with refpeft to the laws of Chril'tian matri-
mony, in marrying a profefl'ed Chriltian to a heathen
idolator, unbaptiled ; but yet there was time enough
to make them profcfs the name of Chrilt, without
which nothing could be done: That belideshe be-
lieved themfelves very indifferent Chriflians, and
confcqttently had not difcourfed whh their wives up-
on that fubjett; and that unlefs they promifed him
to do ('0, he could not marry them, as being exprefs-
ly forbidden by the laws of God.

All this they heard attentively, and owned readily.
But, I/thl, Sir! (laid Will Atkins to me). bow/17011141

that her gods are idols, which can neither hear,
fpeak, nor underlland ; but that our God, who has
made, can dcflroy all things; that he rewards the
good, and punilhes the wicked, and at lalt will bring
us to judgment? Cannot you tell her thefe things ?
That's true, (laid Atkins) but then {he'll tell me it is
utterly falfe, lince I am not punifhed and fent to the
devil, who hath been fuch a wicked creature.~ Thefe

L4
words I interpreted to the prieli. O ! (laid he) tell
him his repentance will make him a very good mini-
fler to his (panic, and qualify him to preach on the
mercy and longl'ufl'ering of a triercitul Being, who
defires not the death of a firmer", and even defers
damnation to the lali judgment ; this will lead him
to the above doflrine, and will make him an excel-
lent preacher to his wife. I repeated this to Atkins,
who, being more than ordinarily alieeicd with it, re-
plied, ] know all this, Sir, and a great deal more;
but how can I have the impudence to talk thus to
my wife, when my confcience witnelTCS againli me ?
ALAS! faiil he (with tears in his eyes, and giving a
great ligh), as for repenting, that is for ever pali me.
Pall: you ! Atkins, (faid 1) what do you mean ? You
know well enough (faid he) what I mean ; 1 mean it
if too late.

\Vhen I told the priefl what he laid, the poor af-
feflionate man could not refrain from weeping ; but
recovering himfelf, Pray, Sir, (laid he) q/l' [film if be
it contented that it i: too late,- or it be concerned, and

Atkins, who replied in a palhon, How can I be erg/j,>>

There may indeed be a time when provoked merry will
no longer flriw, but never too late for men to repent in
tbi: world. I told Atkins every word the prieit had
faid, who then parted from us to talk to his wife,
while we difcourfed with the reli. But thefe were
ver ftupid in religious matters, yet all of them pro-
mixed to do their endeavours, to make their wives.
turn Chriflzians ; and upon which promifes the priefl:
married the three couple. But as Atkins was the
only {incere convert, and of more fcnfe than the relt',
my clergyman was earnefily inquiring after him:
Sir, (faid he) let u: walk out of this labyrinth, and I
Hare/21y tut/ballfind (bi: poor man preacbing to 122': swift
already. And indeed we found it true; for coming
to the edge of the wood, we perceived Atkins and
his lavage wife fitting under the fhade of a bulh, in
very earnelt difcourfe: He pointed to- the fun, to-
the quarters of the earth, to himfelf, to her, the
woods, and the trees. .Immediately we could per-
ceive him (tart upon his feet, fall down upon his
knees, and lift up both his hands; at which the tears-
ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our - great
misfortune was, we could not hear one word '.that
palTed between them. Another time he would em--
brace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, killingher
with the greatelt tranfports, and then both kneel
down for tome minutes together. Such ruptures of
joy did this occalion in my young priel't, that he
could fcarcely contain himfelf ; and a little after this,
we obferved by her mation, as frequently lifting up.
her hands, and laying them on her breaflz, that {he
was mightily affected with hisdifcourfe, and fol
they .withdrew from our light. '

When we came back, we found them-both Waits
ing to be called in ; upon which we agreed to exaa-
mine him alone, and fo I began thus to difcourfe'
him. Prithee, Will Atkins, (laid I) what education
had you ? What wasyour father 3' .

IV. A. A better man .thanever I {hall be; he was;

R. C. What, did you kill him with your hands?

7V. r'l. No, Sir, I cut not his throat, but broke his
heart, by the nioll: unnatural turn of difobedieucc to
the tenderell and bell of fathers.

R. C'. \Vell, I pray God grant you repentance; I
did not alk you to extort a confellion; but I alked
you, becanle I fee you have more knowledge of what
is good than your companions.

IV. A. O, Sir,whenevcr I look back upon my pal!
life, conl'cience upbraids me with my father; the fins
againll our parents make the deepell'. wounds, and
their weight lies the heavielt upon the mind.

R. (J. You talk, Will, too feelingly and fenlibly
for me ; I am not able to hear it.

IV. 1!. You bear it, Sir! you know nothing of it.

R. C. But yes, Atkins, I do: And every lhore,
valley, and tree in this illand, witnefs the anguilh
of my foul for my undutifulnefs to my kind father,

ance falls infinitely lhort of yours. But, Will, how
comes'the fenfe of this matter to touch you jult now?

IV. .4. Sir, the work you have fet me about has
occalioned it; for talking to my wife about God and
religion, {he has preached me fuch a fermon that I
(hall retain it in lalling remembrance.

R. C. No, no, it is your own moving pious argu-
ments to her has made conl'cience fling them back
upon you. But pray, Atkins, inform us what paired
between you and your wife, and in what manner did
you begin? '

W. 11. I talked to her of the laws of marriage,
the reafon of fueh compaets, whereby order and juf-
tice is maintained; without which men would run .
from their wives and children, to the difiblutioxi of
families or inheritances.

P. C. Well, and what did {he fay to all this P

Wg'fl. Did not you tell God tankee for that?

W. A. No, I' have neither thanked him for his.
mercy, nor feared him for his power;

W ifr. Then me not believe your God be good, not

W 1ft Mercy ! what do you call mercy ?

W. A He pities and {pares us; as he is our great
Creator, lb is he alfo our tender Father. '

71/172. So God never angry, never kill wicked ;.
then he no good, no great mighty.

71/. A. O my dear, don't fay [0, he is both ; and
many times he lhows terrible examples of his judg-
ment and vengeance.

W99. Then you makce de bargain with him; you.

IV. A. No indeed, my fins are all prefumptions

you give him no tankee neither.

W. A. It is true, I am an ungrateful, unthankful.

W. A. It is I alone that have deformed myfelf,.
and abufed his goodnefs.

Wffl. Pray, makec God know me, me no-makee

W'. A. You mean, my dear, that you delire 'I

Such furpriling account as this was, proved very
afl'eeling to us both, but particularly to the young
clergyman, who was mightily concerned he could
not talk to her himl'elf. Sir, (laid he) there is form:-
thing more to be done to this woman than to marry
her, I mean that lhe ought to be baptifed. To this
I pretently agreed: l'ray, (laid he again) alk her
hulhand, whether he has ever talked to her of Jefns
Chrill, the l'alvation of linners, the nature of faith,
and redemption in and by him, of the Holy Spirit,
the rc-furrec'lion, lall: judgment, and a future (late;
but the poor fellow melted into tears at this qneftion,
faying, that he had laid {omething to her of thefe
things, but his inability to talk of them made him a-
fraid lell her knowledge of them lliould rather make
her contemn religion than be benefited by it; but that
if I would difcourle with her, it would be very evi-
dent my labour would not be in vain. Accordingly
I called her in, and placing myfelf as interpreter be-
tween the religious priel't and the woman, I entreata
ed him to go on : But furely never was fuch a fer-
mon preached by any clergyman in there latter days,
with fo much zeal, knowledge, and linearity; in
ihort, he brought the woman to embrace the know~
ledge of' Chill, and of redemption by him, with) f0
furprifing a degree of underltanding, that lhc made'
it her own requell to be baptifed. '

He then pertormed his office in the facrament of
baptifin, lint, by faying fome words- over to himfelf
in Latin, and then alked me to give her a name, as
being her godfather, and pouring a- whole diflt full
of water upon the woman's head, he fai'd, MARY, r

'1aoamsou CttUS'OE. 2 5 5

haprife thee in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Gholt; fo that name: could
know of what religion he was. After this he-pro-
nounced the benedietiou in Latin. Thus the wo-
man. being made a Chril'tian, he married her to Will
Atkins; which being finilhedl, he afl'eetionately ex-
horted him to lead a holy life for the future; that
three the Almighty, by the convictions of his con-
fcience, had honoured him to be the inl'c'rument of
his wife's converlion, he {hould not dilhonour the
grace of God, that while the favage was converted,
the inflrument lhould be cafl: away. Thus ended a
ceremony, to me the molt pleafant and agreeaele I
ever pafled in my life.

The affairs of the illand being fettled, I was pre-
paring to go on board, when the young man (whole
mother was flawed) came to me, faying, that as he .
tmderlloodl had a clergyman with me, who had
married the Englilhmen with favages, .he had a
match to make between two Chriltian's, which he
dclired might be finilhed before I departed. Think-
ing that it was he himfelf that had courted his mo-
ther's maid, l perfuaded him not to do any thing
ralhly upon the account of his folitar circumflzances;
that the maid was an unequal mater for him, both
in- ret'peet to l'ubfiance and years; and that' it' was
very probable he would live to return to' his own'
country, where he might have a far better choice;
At thefc words, fmiling, be interrupted me,- thank.
ing me for my good advice 3 that as he had-nothing
to beg of me, but a fmall fettlement, with a~4fervant
or two, or fome few neccfl'aries, fo he hoped I would
not be'unmindful of him when I returned- to-Eng-
land, but give his letters to his friends; and that
when he was redeemed, the plantation and all its
improvements, however valuable, {hould'be return-

ed to me again. But as for the marriage he prod>>
pofed, that it was not himfelf, but that it was bed
tween my Jack of all trades, and the maid Sufan.

I was indeed agreeably furptifed at the mention-
ing this match, which feemed very fuitable, the one
being a very ingenious fellow, and the other an ex-
cellent, dcxterous, and fenlible houfewife, fit to be
governcfs of the whole ifland ; fo we married them
the fame day; and as I was her father, and gave her
away, {0 I gave her a handfome portion, appointing
her and her hufband a convenient large {pace of
ground for their plantation. The lharing out of the
land I left to Will Atkins, who really divided it
vetrjullly to every perfon's fatisfaeiion: They on-
ly defired one general writing under my hand for the
whole, which I caufed to be drawn up, ligned, and
fealed to them, {etting out their bounds, and giv-
ing them a right to the whole pofl'ellion of their re-
fpet'live plantations with their improvements, to them
and their heirs, referving all the relt of the ifland as
my own property, and a certain rent for every parti-
cular plantation after eleven years. As to their laws
and government, I exhorted them to love one an-
other: And as to the Indians who lived in a nook
by theml'elves, I allotted three or four of them plan-
tations, and the rel't willingly chofe to become fer-
vants to the other families, by which means they
were employed in ufeful labour, and fared much bet-
ter than they did before. Befides, the favages be-
ing thus mixed with the Chriflians, the work of
their converlion might be let on foot by the latter,
in the clergyman's abfence, toour equal fatisfaetion.
The young prieit, however, was a little anxious left
the Chriltians ihould not be willing to do their
parts in infirue'ting thol'e poor Indians: I therefore
told him, we ihould call them all together ; . that he
Ihonld fpeak to the Spaniards who were Papilts, and
I. to the Englifh who were Proteltants, and make
them promife they would never make any difiinefiom

m religion, but teach the general true knowledgf: 0'?
God, and his {on Jelus Chrilt, in order to' convert
the poor favages : And this indeed they all promifed
us accordingly. .
When I came to Will Atkins's houl'e, I found his
baptifed wife, and the young woman newly married
to my Jack of all trades, were become great inti-
mates, and difcourling of religion together. 0 Sir,
(lays \Vill Atkins) when God has finners to recon-
cile to himfelf, he never wants an inltrut'lor : I knew
lwas unworthy for [0 good a work, and therefore
this young woman has been fent hither as it were
from heaven, who is fufheient to convert a whole
ifland of favages. .The young woman blulhed', and
was going to rife; but I delired her to fit (till, and

bapcd that God would blefs her in {0 good a work: ,

And then pulling out a. Bible (which I brought on
purpofe in my pocket for him), Here, Atkins, (laid
I) here is an afiillant that perhaps you had not be-
. fore. So confounded was the poor man, that it was
fome time before he could fpeak; at lal't turning to
his wife, My dear, (he faid) did 1 not tell you that
God could hear what we fair! ? Here is the, book I
prayed for, when you and I kneeled under the bulb;
God then heard us, and now has fent it. T he'wo-
man was furprifcd, and thought really God had lent
that individual book from heaven; butI turned to
the young woman, and delired her to explain to the
new convert, that God may properly be faid to an-
fwer our petitions, when, in the courfe of his pro-
vidence, fuch particular things come to pafs as we
petitioned for. This the young woman did efl'eetu-
ally ; but furely Will Atkins's joy cannot be expreflL
ed, no man being more thankful for any thing in
the world, than he was for his Bible, nor defired it
from a better principle. .
'2-_MAfter feveral religious difeourfes, I defired the
young woman to give me an account of the anguifh
the felt when (he was Rarving to death for hunger,
to which {be readily confented, and began in the
following manner :

" Sir, (fetid (he) all our viflunls being gone, af-
ter I had fluted one day, my fiomach was very {ick-
ilh, -.~-~.d at the approach of night I was inclined to
yawning, and lleepy. \thn l llcpt upon the couch
three hours, I awaked a little refrelhed: Three hours
after my ltomaeh being more and more fiekifh, I lay
down again, but could not (leep, being very faint
and ill. Thus I pallbd the feeond day with a lirange
variety, {irlt hunger, then fiek again, with reaching:
to vomit: That night I dreamed I was at Barbudoes,
buying plenty of provifions, and dined heartily. But
when I awaked, my l'pirits were exceedingly funk>>,
to find niyfelf in the extremity of famine. There
was but one glafs of wine, which being mixed with
fugar, I drank up; but for want of l'ubllanee to di-
geit upon, the fumes of it got into my head, and
made me {cnl'elels for fome time. The third day I
was {0 ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten
a little child if it had come in my way; during which
time I was as mad as any creature in bedlam. In
one of there his I fell down, and ilruck my face a-
gainll the corner of a pallet bed, where my miltreis'
lay: The blood guihed out of my note, but b my
exceflive bleeding, both the violence of the rever,
and the ravenous part of the hunger abated. After
this Igrew lick again, "mm: to vomit, but could
not; then bleeding J. fecond time, I fwooucd away
its-dead; when learns to myl'clz' I had a dreadful
gnawing pain in my llomach, which went off towards
night, with a longing delire for food. I took a- draught
of water and liigur, but it came up again; then I
drank water nithout liigar, 23nd thzu llaid with me.
I laid me down on the bed, p"n}'l'.l,'; God would take
me away; after I had llumbtrcd, I thought myiclf
aodying. herti'vrc recommended my foul to God,
and willied ibmehody would throw me into the fea.
All this while my departing miftrcfs lay by me; the
laft bit of bread {he had, {he gave it to her dear
child, my young mailer. The morning after, I fell
into a violent pallion of crying, and after that into
hunger. I efpied the blood that came from my nof'e
in a bafon, which 1 immediately fwallowed up. At
night I had the ul'ual variations, as pain in the {to-
mach, lick, fleepy, and ravenous; and I had no
thought but that I fhould die before morning. In
the morning came on terrible gripings in my bowels.
At this time I heard my young mafler's lamentations,
by which I underfloor! his mother was dead : Soon
after the failors cried, Aflril, ajizil, hallooing as if
they were diltraEtcd, for joy of that relief, which af-
terwards we received from your hands."

Surely never was a more dilhne't account of Raw-
ing to death than this. But to return to the dif-
pofition of things among my people, I did not take
any norice to them of the (loop that I had framed,
neither would I leave them the two pieces of brafs
cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns that I had
on board, left, upon any difguft, they {hould have
feparated, or turned pirates, and {u made the illand
a den of thieves, inltead of a plantation of fober
pious people: But leaving them in a {lourifhing con-
dition, with a promife to fend them further relief
from Bram, as theep, hogs, and-cows (being obli-
ged to kill the lam-r nth-.1, having no hay to feed
them), I went on board the {hip again, the firfi of
May 1695, after having been twenty days among
them: And next morning, giving them a falute of
five guns at parting, we let fail for the Brafils. The
third day, towards evening, there happening a calm,
and the current being very flrong, we were drove
to the N. N. E. towards the land. Some hours
after we perceived the tea covered as- it were with
{omething very black, not eatily at firit to be dif-
covered: Upon which our chief mate afcending the

C
ihrouds a little way, and taking a view with a per-
l'pee'tive glafs, he cries out, An army l--An army,
you fool, (laid I) what do you mean? Nay, Sir, (faid
he) don't be angry, I allure you it is not only an
.army, but a fleet too; for I believe there are a thou-

{and canoes paddling along, and making with great
halle towards us.

Indeed esteey--one--eli-uswwere furprifed--at--rlris--re- --
lation: And my nephew the captain could not tell
what to think of it, but thought we. lhould all be
devoured. Nor was I free from concern, when!
confidered how much we were becalmed, and what
a llrong current fet towards the fhore: However,
Iencouraged him not to be afraid, but bring the
{hip to an anchor, as foon as we were certain that
we mull engage them. Accordingly we did fo, and
furled all our fails: As to the favages, we feared
nothing, but only that they might let the {hip on
fire; to prevent which I ordered them to et their
boats out, and fallen them, one clofe by t e head,
and the other by the item, well manned, with {heets
and buckets to cxtinguilh the flames, lhould it fo
happen. The favages foon came up with us, but
there were not {0 many as the mate had laid; for
inflead of a thoufand canoes, there were only one
hundred and twenty: Too many indeed for us, fe-
veral of their canoes containing about fixteen or
fetheen men.

As they approached us, they feemed to be in the
grcatcll amazement, not knowing what to make of
us. '1' hey rowed round-the fliip, which occalioned
us to call to the men in the boats not to fufl'er them
to come near them. l-Iereupon they beckoned to
the favages to keep back, which the accordingly
did; but at their retreat they let fly about fifty ar.
rows among us, and very much wounded one of -
our men in the long-boat. I called to them not to
fire upon any account, but handing them down fomet
dealboards, the carpenters made them a kind of aK
fence to {hieid them from the arrows. In half an
hour after they came ['0 near aftern of us, that we
had a perfeel: light of them ; then they rowed a
little farther out, till they came direfily alonglide of
us, and then approached fo near us, as they could
hear us fpeak: This made me order all our men to
keep clofe, and get their guns ready. In the mean
time-I ordered Friday to go out upon deck, and all:
them in his language what they meant. No fooner
did he do [0, but fix of the favages, who were in the
foremof't canoe, {looping down, {bowed us their
naked backfides, as much as to fay in Engliih, by}
our . But Friday quickly knew what this meant,
by immediately crying out they were going to (boot;
unfortunately for him, poor creature! who fell un-
der the cloud of three hundred arrows, not le'fa than
{even piercing through his body, killing one of the
bell: fervants, and faithfullefi of companions in all
my folitudes and afilifiions. .

So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, that
the guns, which before were charged with only pow-
der, to frighten them, I ordered to>> be loaded with
{mall fhm; nor did thegunners fail in their aim,
but at this broadlide fplit and overfet thirteen or
fourteen of their canoes, which killed numbers-of ~
them, and fet the ref]: a-fwimming: The Others,
frightened out of their wits, little regarding their
fellows drowning, fcoured away as fall as they could.
One poor wretch our people took up, fwimrning for
his life, an hour after. He was very fullen at firflz,
{0 that he would neither eat nor {peak : But I took
a way to cure him, by ordering them to throw him
into the fea, which they did, and then he came
fwimming back like a cork, calling in his tongue, as
I fuppofe, to fave him. So we took him on board,
but it was a long time before we could make him

{peak or underitand Englifh 5 yet when we had
taught him, he told us, they were going with their
kings to fight a great battle: And when we alked
him, what made them come up to us ? (he faid) to
nmh'e dd great wonder [col : \Vhere it is to be noted,
that thol'e natives, and thefe of Africa, always add
two e's at the end of Englilh words, as malw, takee,
and the like, from which it is a very difficult thing
to make them break off.

Being now under fail, we took our lall: farewell of
poor honelt Friday, and interred him with all pof-
i'ible decency and folemnity, putting him into a collin,
and committing him to the deep, at the fame time
caulingxlcven guns to be fired for him. Thus end-
ed the life of one of the molt grateful, faithful,
honeft, and alleaionate fervants, that ever any man
was blefl'ed with in the world.

Having now a fair wind for the Bralils, in about
twelve days time we made land in the latitude of five
degrees fonth of the line. Four days we kept on S.
by E. in light of fhore, when we made Cape St. Auguf-
tine, and in three days we came to an anchor off the
Bay of All Saints. I had great difficulty here to get
leave to hold correl'pondence on (bore; for neither the
figure of my partner, my two merchant truflees, nor
the fame of my wonderful prefervation in the ifland,
could procure me the favour, till fuch time as the
prior of the monaftery of the Augullines (to whom I
had given 500 moidores) obtained leave from the
governor, for me perfonally, with the captain and
one more, together with eight failors, to come on
ihore, upon this condition, that we lhould not
land any goods out of the fliip, or carry any perfon
away without licence: 1 found means however to
get on lhore three bales of Englifh goods, fuch as
fine broad cloths, Ruth, and fame linen, which I
brought as a prefent for my partner, who had fent
me on board a prefent of frefh provilions, wine, and
fweetmcats, worth above thirty moidores, including
fome tobacco, and three or four fine gold medals.
Here I delivered my partner in goods to the va-
lue of tool. Sterling, and obliged him to lit up the
floop I bought, for the ufe of my ifland, in order to
fend them refrelhments: And 'fo active was he in
this matter, that he had the vell'el finifhed in a few
days, to the mailer of which I gave particular in.
ltruelions to find the place. I foon loaded him with
a {mall cargo; and one of our failors offered to fettle
there, upon my letter to the Spanifh governor, if I
would allot him tools and a plantation. This I will.
ingly granted, and gave him the favage we had tak.
en prifoner to be his flave. All things being ready
for the voyage, my old partner told me, there was
an acquaintance of his, .a Brafil planter, who havin
fallen under the difpleafure of the church, and in
fear of the' Inquifition, which obliged him to be con--
cealed, would be glad of fuch an Opportunity to make
his efcape, with his wife and two daughters; and if
I would allot them a plantation in my ill-and, he would
give them a (mall flock to begin with, for that the
officers had already feized his efl'eets and eftate, and
left him nothing but a little houfehold fiufi', and two
flares. This requefl; I prefently granted, concealing
him and his family on board our lhip till fuch time
as the floop (where all the effects were) was gone
out of the bay, and then we put them on board, who
carried fome materials, and plants for planting fugar-
canes, along with them. By this floop, among other
things, I [cut my fubjefis three milk cows and five

From the Brafils we made diret'lly over the At-
lantic Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope, having a
tolerable good voyage, fleeting for the molt part SS.
E. We were on a trading voyage, and had a fuper--
Cargo on board, who was to diret'l all the {hip's mo.
tions after {he arrived at the Cape; only being limit-
ed to a certain number of days, or flay, by charter-
party, at the feveral ports {he was to go to. At the
Cape we only took in frefh water, and then failed
for the coaft of Coromandel: We were there inform-
ed, that a French man of war of 50 guns, and two
large merchant fliips, were failed for the Indies, but
we heard no more of them. '

In our paflitge we touched at the ifland of Mada-
gafcar, whereythough the inhabitants are naturally
fierce and treacherous, and go conl'tantly armed with
bows and lances, yet for fome time they treated us
civilly enough ; and, in exchange for knives, fcilTars,
and other trifles, they brought us eleven good fat
bullocks, which we took partly for prefent freih vic-
tuals, and the remainder to falt for the fhip's'ufe.

So curious was I to view every corner of the world
where I came to, that I went on {hore as often as I
could. One evening, when on ihore, we obferved
numbers of the peOple {landing gazing at us at a dif-
tance. \Ve thought ourfelves in no danger, as they
had hitherto ufed us kindly. However, we cut three
boughs out of a tree, l'ticking them at a dii'cance
from us. which, it feems, in that country, is not
only a token of truce and amity, but when poles or
boughs are fet up on the other fide, it is a ng the
truce is accepted. In thefe treaties, however, there
is one principal thing to be regarded, that-neither
party come beyond one another's three' polesi-or
boughs; fo that the middle {pace is not 'IOnly'i'e-
cure, but is alfo allowed as a market for traffic and
commerce: When the truce is thus accepied, they
flick up their javelins and lances at the 'fitft'pole's",
and come on unarmed; but if any 'violen'c'e is can:
ed, away'they run to their'poles, take up'thein-we'a}
pons, and then the truce is at an end. 'I'hiwven'
ing it happened that a greater number of people than
ufual, both men and 'women, traded among usfo'i'
fuch toys as we had, with fuch great civility, that
we made us 'a little tent of' large boughs of trees',
fome of the men refol'ving to lie on fhore'ail? night";
But,'for my part, I and ~l'orne others todk'orir 'lod.
ging in the boat, with boughs of trees fpi'eed over it',
having a fail fpread at the bortom to he upon. A-
bout two o'clock in the morning, we were awakened. -
by the firing of mufkets, and our men crying out":
for help, or elfe they would all be murdered. Scared:
had we time to get the boat afhore, when our men.
came plunging themfelves into the water, with a.
bout four hundred of the iflanders at their heels:
We'took up {even of the men, three of them very
much wounded, and one left behind killed, while _
the enemy poured their arrows {0 thick among us,
that we were forced to make a barricade, with boards
lying at the fide of the boat, to fhield us from dan-
ger: And having got ready our fire-arms, we re:- .
turned them a- volley which wounded feveral of
them, as we could hear by their cries, In this con-
dition we lay till break of day, and then making
fignals of diftrefs to the (hip, which my'n'ephew the
captain heard and underflood, he weighed anchor '
'and flood ~as 'near the (here as poflible, and then
{ent'ano't'h'er boat with ten hands in her to ailifi us ;
but we called to them 'not to come near, informing

M
them of our unhappy condition. However, they
ventured; when one of the men taking the end of a
tow-line in his one hand, and keeping our boat be-
tween him and our adverfaries, [want on board us,
and made fall our line to the boat; upon this, flip-
ping our cables, they towed us out of the reach of
their arrows, and quickly after, a broadfide was gi-
ven them from the (hip, which made a mofl; dread-
ful havoc among them. When we got on board, we
examined into the oecafion of this fray; the men
who fled informed us, that an old woman, who fold
milk within the poles, had brought a young woman
with her, who carried roots or herbs, the fight of
whom fo much tempted our men, that they offered
rudenefs to the maid, at which the old woman fet up
a great cry 5 nor would the failors part with the
prize, but carried her among the trees, while the
old woman went and brought a whole army down
upon them. At the beginning of the attack one of
our men was killed with a lance, and the fellow, who
began the mifehief, paid dear enough for his mif--
trel's, though as yet we did not know what had become
of him; the reit luckily efeaped. The third night
after the aflion, being curious to underfland how
affairs flood, I took the fupercargo, and twenty flout
fellows with me, and landed about two hours before
midnight, at the fame place where thol'e Indians
flood the night before, and there we divided our
men into two bodies, the boutfwain commanding
one, and I another. It was {0 dark that we could
fee nobody, neither did we hear any voice near us:
But by and by the boatfwain fallingr over a dead body,
we agreed to halt till the moon iltould rife, which
we knew would be in an hour after. We perceived
here no fewer titan two-and-thirty bodies upon the
ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Satif-
lice with this difeovery,l was for. going on board
again; but the boatfwain and the rei told me, they
would make a vilit to the Indian town, where thefe
dogs (fo they called them) refided, alking me at
the fame time to go along with them; for they did
not doubt, befides etting a good booty, but they
lhould find Tom effery there, for that was the
unhappy man we milled. But I utterly refufed to
go, and commanded them back, being unwilling to
hazard their lives, as the fafety of the {hip wholly
depended upon them. Notwithltanding all I could
fay to them, they~ all left me but one, and the fu-
percargo: So we three came back to the boat, where
a boy was left, relOlving to (lay till they returned.
At parting I told them I l'uppofed molt of them
would run the fame fate with Tom Jeffery. To
this they replied, Come boys, come along, we'll war-s
mat we'll come {if filfi mougb .- And lb away they
went, notwithltanding all my admonitions, either
Concerning their own l'afety, or the. prefervation of
the (hip. Indeed they were gallantly armed, every
man havin a mulket, bayonet, and a piltol, befides
cutlafl'es, angers, pole-axes, and hand-granades.
They came. to a few Indian houfes at firlt, which
not being the town they expefled, they went far-
ther, and finding a cow tied to a tree, they conclud-
ed that {he would be a. fuflicient guide, and {0 it
proved ; for after they untied her, {he led them di-
reetly to the town, which confided of above two
hundred houfes, fevcral families living in fame of
the huts to ether. At their arrival, all being in a
profound eep, the {ailors agreed to divide them-
lclves into three bodies, and let three parts of the
town on fire at once; to kill thol'e that were el'caping,
and plunder the relt of the houfes. Thus defpcrate-g
ly refolved they went to work; but the firfi: party
had not gone far, before they called out tothe refr,
that they had found Tom Jelfery; whereupon they
all ran up to the place, and found the poorjfellow
Indeed hanging up nakeg'I by one arm, and hisdhtoat
2
Cut almoll from ear to ear. In a 'houfe that was
hard by the tree'they found lixteen or feventeen In-
dians, who had been concerned in the fray, two or
three of them being wounded, who were not gone
to fleep; this houfe they 'fet on fire firfl, and in a
few minutes after, five or fix places more in the
town appeared in flames. The conflragation fpread
like wildfire, their houfes being all of wood, and
covered with flags or rnfhes. The poor afl'righted
inhabitants endeavoured to run out to fave their
lives, but they were driven back into the flames by
the failors, and killed without mercy._ At the firfl:
houfe ah'ove mentioned, after the boatfwain had flain
two with his pole-axe, he threw a hand granad'e
into the houfe, which burfling, made a terrible ha-
voc, Riding and wounding molt of them; and
their king and molt of his train, who were then in
that houfe, fell vielims to their fury, every crea-
ture of th'cm being either fmothercd or burnt. All
this while they never fired a gun, lell the people
ihould awaken faller then they could overpower
them. But the fire awakened them fall enough,
which obliged our fellows to keep together in bodies.
By this time the whole town was in a flame, yet
their fury rather increafed, calling out to one an-
other to remember Tom Jeli'er'y. The terrible light
of this conllragation made me very uneafy, and
roufed my nephew the captain, and the rell of his
men, who knew nothing of the matter. When he

perceived the dreadful finoke, and'hcard the guns
go ofli, he readily concluded his men were in danger;
he therefore takes another boat, and comes alhore
himfelf, with thirteen men well armed. He was
greatly furprifed to fee me and only two men in the
boat, but more to when I told him the l'tory'; but
though I argued with him, as I did with his men,
about the danger of the voyage, the inrerefls of "the
merchants and owners, and the fafety of the lbip,
yet my nephew, like the refi, declared, that he
would rather lofe the (hip, his voyage, his life and
all, than his men fhould be loft for want of help;
and fo away he went. For my part, feeing him re-
folvcd to go, I. had not power to Pray behind. He
ordered the pinnace back again for twelve men more,
and then we marched directly as the flame guided
us. But furely never was fuch a fcene of horror be-
held, or more difmal cries heard, except when 0-
liver Cromwell took DrOgheda in Ireland, where he
neither fpared man, woman, nor child.

The firfl: objeet, I think, we met with, was the
ruins of one of their habitations, before which lay
four men and three women killed, and two more burnt
to death among the fire, which was now decaying.
Nothing could appear more barbarous-than this re-
venge ; none more cruel than the authors of it. As
we went on, the fire increafed, and the cry proceed-
ed in proportion. We had not gone much farther,
when we beheld three naked women, followed b
fixteen or feventeen men, flying with the greate
fwiftnefs from our men, who {hot one of them in
our fight. When they perceived us, whom they flip,-
pofed a-lfo their murderers, they fet up a molt dread,-
ful fliriek, and both of them, fwooned aWayiin the
fright. This was a light which might have foftened
the hardelt heart; and in pity we took fome ways
to let them know we would not. hurt them, while
the poor creatures, with bended knees and lift-up
hands, made piteous lamentations to fave their lives. -
I ordered our men not to hurt any of the poor crea-
tures whatfoever; but being willing to underftand
the occafion of all this, I went among thefe unhap-
py wretches, who neither underltood me nor the
good I meant them. However, being refolved to
put- an end to this barbarity, I ordered the men to
follow me. We had not gone fifty yards before we

.came up with the boatfwain, with'four' of our men
M 3.
at his heels, all of them covered with blood and duff,
and in fearch of more people to fatiate their ven-
geance. As foon as we {aw them, we called out, and
made them underltand who we were; upon which
they came up to us, fetting up a halloo of triumph, in
token that more help was come. Noble Captain, (faid
he to my nephew) Iam glad you are come: We
have not half done with thefe villanous hellohound
dogs; we will root out the very nation of them from
the earth, and kill more than poor Tom has hairs
upon his head : And thus he went on till I interrupt-
ed him. Blood~thirflty dog ! (faid I) will your cruelty
never end ? I charge you to touch not one creature
more ; f'top your hands, and find (till, or you are a
dead man this moment. Why, Sir, (faid he) you
neither know who you are proteeting, nor what they
have done; but pray come hither, and behold an
inftance of compafiion, if fuch can merit your cle-
mency; and with that he fhowed me the poor fel-
low with his throat cut, hanging upon the tree.
Indeed here was enough to fill their breal'ts with
rage, which however I thought had gone too far, a-
greeable to thefe words of Jacob to his fons Simeon
and Levi : Cur/2d be tlm'r anger, for it Izvarfierre ; and
tbeir wrat/a, for it war cruel. But this fight made my
nephew and the rel't as bad as they; nay, my ne--
phew declared, his concern was only for his men;
as for the people, not a foul of them ought to live.
Upon this the boatfwain and eight more direetly turn-
ed about, and went to finilh the intended tragedy ;
which being out of my power to prevent, I returned
back both from the difmal fight, and the piteous
cries of thofe unfortunate creatures, who were made
vietims to their fury. Indeed it was an egregious
piece of folly in me to return to the boat with but
one attendant; and I had very near paid for it, hav-
ing narrowly efcaped forty armed Indians, who had
been alarmed by the confiagration; but hay-Eng gratified
the place where they flood, I got to the boat accom-
panied with the fupercargo, and [0 went on board,
fending the pinnace back again, to aflift the men
in what might happen. When I had got to the boat,
the fire was almol't extinguilhed, and the noife was
abated ; but I had fearce been half an hour on board
the (hip, when I heard another volley given by our
fztilors, and a great fmoke, which, as I afterwards
found, was our men falling upon thofe houfes and
perfons that flood between them and the fea; but
here they {pared the wives and children, and killed
about fixteen or feventeen men. And [0 they came
{trolling down to the pinnace, which at that time
was gotten on fhore to receive them. Not a man
of them had received the leafi hurt, except two, one
of whom fprained his foot, and the Other burnt his
hand a little, having met with no refiltance, the poor
Indians being unprepared, amazed, and confounded.
Indeed I was extremely angry with every one of
them, but particularly the captain, who, inflead of
cooling the rage of the men, had prompted them on
to farther mifchief: Nor could he make any other
excufe, but that, as he was a man, he could not ma-
{ter his pallions at the light of one of his men [0
cruelly murdered. As for the refi, knowing they
were not under my command, they took no notice of
my anger, but rather boalted of their revenge; and,
according to all their accounts, they killed or del'troyed ,
about 150 men, women, and children, belides burn-
ing the town to afhes. They took their companion
Tom Jeffery from the tree, covered him with-font:
of the ruins, and fo left~him. But, however jufiifi-
able this aetion of our men might feem. to them-
felves, yet I always openly condemned it, with the
appellation of the mall'acre of Madagal'car :. For
though they had flair: this lefiery, yet he was cera
tainly the firit aggreli'or, by attempting to violate the
thattity of a young innocent woman, who ventured

M4
down to them on the faith of the public capitulation,
which was fo treacheroufly broken.

We were new under fail, when the boatfwain
would defend this bloody aflicn, by fztying, That the
Indians had broke the truce the night before, by
fhonting one of our men without jufl provocation :
And what if the poor fellow had taken a little liber--
ty with the wrench ! he t light not to have been mur-
dered in ft>> villanous a manner; and that they had
aeltd nothing but what the divine laws commifiion-
ed to be done to fuel:- hornit-ides. However, I was in
the fame mind as before, teliing. them that they were
nz-urt'crers, and bid lim depend upon it, that God
would Hall their voyage for fo unparallelled a piece
of barbarity.

VK'Len we came into the Gulf of Perfta, five of our
men, who ventured-on how, were either killed, or
made flaves by the Arabians, the tell of them hav-
ing fcarce time to efcape to their boat. This made
me upbraid them afrefh with the 'ult retribution of
Heaven for fuch aaions : Upon w ich the boatfwain
very warmly alked me, whether thofe men on whom
the tower of Siloam fell were greater finners than
the reft of the Galileans? And belides, Sir, (faid he)
none of thefe five poor men that are lolt, were
with us at the maffacre of Madagafcar, as you call
it, and therefore your reprehenlion is very unjuft,
and your application improperly applied. Befides,
(added be) you are continually uling the men very
ill upon this account, and being but a pafl'enger your-
felf, we are not obliged to bear it: nor can we tell
what ill defigns you may have to bring us to judg-
ment for it in England ; and therefore, if you do not

leave this difcourfe, and not concern yourfelf with
any of our affairs, I will leave the (hip, and not fail
in fuch dangerous company. .
All this I heard very patiently, till at length I
told him what concern I had on board was none of
his bufinefs; that, however, I was a confiderable
owner of the fliip, and therefore had a right to
fpeak in common, and that I was no way accountable
to him, nor to any body elfe. As no more pafl'ed'
for fame time after, I thought all had been over.
At this time we were in the road of Bengal, where,
going on {hore with the fupercargo, one day, in the
evening, as I was preparing to go on board, one of
the men came to me, and told me, I need not trouble
myfelf to come to the boat, for that the cockfwain
and otliers had ordered him not to carry me on
board any more. This infolent mefl'age much fur-
prifed me ; yet I gave him no anfwer to it, but went
direetly and acquainted the fupercargo, entreating'
him to go on board, and by acquainting the captain
with it, prevent the mutiny whichI perceived would
happen. But beforeI had fpoken this, the matter
was efi'eCted on board : For no fooner was he gone
off in the boat, but the b'oatfwain, gunner, carpenter,.
and all the inferior oflicers, came to the quarter-
deck, defiring to {peak with the captain ; and there
the boatfwain made a long harangue, exclaiming a-
gainft me, as before mentioned; that if'l had not
gone afhore peaceably for my own diverfion, they
by violence would have compelled me for their ("ads-
fafiion; that as they had {hipped with the captain,
f0 they would faithfully .ferve him 3 but if I did not
quit the fhip, or the captain oblige me to it, they
would leave the {hip immediately; hereupon, turn-

ing his face about by way of lignal, they all cried out,
ONE and ALL, ONE and ALL. ~

You may be fure, that though my nephew' was
a man of great courage, yet he could not but be fur.-
prifed at their fuddcn and unexpee'ted behaviour':
And though he talked f'toutly to them, and after-
wards expol'tulated with them, that in common juf-.
tice'to me, who was a confidenbiemvner in the .ihip,
they could not turn me, as it Were, out of my own.

Ms
houfe, which might bring their lives in danger, {hould
they ever be taken in England ; nay, though he in-
vited the boatfwain on {bore to accommodate mat-
ters with me, yet all this, I fay, fignified nothing :
They would have nothing to do with me, and they
were refolved to go on fhore, if I came on board.
\Vell, (faid my nephew) if you are fo refolved, per-
mit me to talk with him, and then I have done:
And fo he came to me, giving me an account of
their refolution, how one and all defigned to forfake
the {hip when 1 came on board, for which he was
mightily concerned. I am glad to fee you, nephew,
(laid I) and rejoice it is no worl'e, fince they have
not rebelled againfl: you: I only delire you to fend
my necefl'ary things on fhore, with a fullicient {um
of money, and I will find my way to England as
well as I can. Though this grieved my nephew
to the heart, yet there was no remedy but compli-
ance ; in lhort, all my neceflarics were fem me, and

{0 this matter was over in a few hours. a

I think I was now near a thoufand leagues farther
of? England by fea than at my little kingdom, except
this difference, that I might travel by land over the
Great Mogul's country to Surat, from thence up to
Baffora, by fea up the Perlian Gulf, then take the
way of the caravans over the Arabian Defert to Alep-
po and Scanderoon, there take {hipping to Italy, and
{0 travel by land into France, and tom thence crofs

the fea to England.

My nephew left me two perfons to attend me;
one of them was his fervant, and the other: clerk to
the purfer, who engaged to be mine. I took lodg-
ings in an Englifh woman's houfe, where feveral
French, one Englifh, and two Italian merchants re-
fided. The handfome entertainment I met with
here occafioned me to flay nine months, confide:-
ing what courfe I {hould take. SomeEngliih goods
I had with me of great value, belides a' thoul'and
pieces of eight, and a letter of credence for more,
if there was any fuch neceflity. The goods I foon
difpofed of to advantage, and bought here feveraIL
good diamonds, which I could eafily carry about
with me. One morning theEnglifh merchant came
to me, as being very intimate together; Counttyman,
(faid he) I have a projefl to communicate to you, which,
I nope, will fuit to both our advanta . To be film,
Sir, we are both in a remote part of t world fiom our
rountry, but, yet in a place where men of big/inefi' may get
a great deal of money. N'ow, ff)?" will put a flame/and
pound: to my tbozg/Zmdpoundr, we will bire 0/51) to our
fail: aflion ; you fiall be captain, I will be merchant,
an we'll go a trading voyage to Cbina ,- for wbyflmeld.
we lie flill like droner, wbile the wbole world i: in a'
continual motion .9
This propofal foon got my confent, being very a-
greeable to my rambling genius ; and the more f0,
becaufe I looked upon my countryman to be a very
fmcere perfon. It required fome time before we
could get a vefiel to our mind, and failors to man it
accordingly 3 at length we bought a (hip, and got an
Englifh mate, boatfwain, and gunner, a Dutch car-
penter, and three Portuguefe foremafi-men'; and,
for want of Others made fhift with Indian feamen.
We firit failed to Achin, in the ifland of Sumatra,
and then to Siam, where we battered our wares for
fome arrack and opium, the lafl of which bore a
great price among the Chinefe; in a. word, we went
up to Suikan, making a very great voyage; and,
after eight months time, I returned to Bengal, very
well fatisfied with this adventure, having not only
got a fuflicient quantity of money, but an infight of
getting a great deal' more.
The next voyage my friend propofed to me, was
' to go among the fpice iflands, and bring home a
load of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts,
.iilands belonging partlyiu to Spain, .but where the
.6 .
Dutch trade very confiderably. We were not long
preparing for this voyage, which we made no lefs
fuccefsful than the hit, touching at Borneo, and fe-
veral other places which l-do not perfeetly remem-
ber, and returning home in about five months time.
We foon fold our fpices, which were chiefly cloves,
and fome nutmegs, to the Perlian merchants, who .
carried them away for the gulf ; and, in ihort, mak-
ing five to one advantage, we were loaded with
money.

Not long after my friend and I had made up our
accounts, to our entire fatisfaflion, there came in a
Dutch coafler from Batavia, of about two hundred
tons. The crew of this velTel pretended themfelves
fo fickly, that there were not hands fuflicient to un-
dertake a voyage, and the captain having given out
that he intended to go to Europe, public n0tice was
given that the thip was to be fold. No fooner did
this come to our ears, but we bought the fhip, paid
the matter, and took poffeflion. We would alfo
have very willingly entertained fome of the men :
But they having received their {hare of booty, were
not to be found, being altogether fled to Agra, the
great city of the Mogul's relidcnce; and from thence
were to travel to Surat, and {o by fea to the l'crlian
Gulf. And indeed they had reafon to fly in this
manner : For the truth of it was, the pretended cap-
tain was the gunner only, and not the commander:
That having been on a trading voyage, they were
attacked on fhore by the Malayans, who killed three
men and the c..ptain: After whofe death the other
eleven men run away with the {hip to the Bay of
Bengal, and left the mate and other five men more
on {hore-, but of this affair we {hall have occalion to
{peak at more length hereafter. ,

However they came by the fhip, we thought we
bought it honeltly ; neither did we fufpeft any thing
of the matter; when the man [bowed us abilL'xif
fale for the {hip (undoubtedly forged) to one Ema-
nuel Clol'tcrlhoven, which name he went by. And -

fo without any more to do, we picked up fome Dutch
and Englilh feamen, refolving for another voyage
for cloves among the Philippine and Malacca iflands.
In fliort, we continued thus five or fix years, trading
from port to port with extraordinary fuccefs ; in the
feventh year- we undertook a voyage to China, defign-
ing to touch at Siam, and buy fome rice by the way.
In this voyage, contrary winds beat us up and'down
for a confiderable time among the illincls in the
Straits of Malacca. No fooner were we clear of
thofe rugged fcas but we perceived our {hip had
{prong a-leak, which obliged us to put into the river
Cambodia, which lies northward of the gulf, and
goes up to Siam. . -

One day as I was on fhore refrelhing myfelf, there
comes to me an Englilhman, who Was a gunner's
mate on board an Engliih EalbInaia (hip, riding up
the river, near the 'city of Cambodia; Sir, (laid he)
you may wonder at my bu/imfr, barring rzwerflen me
in your 1% ; but tbougb 1 am a flmuger, I loam/ome-
zbmg to tell you tbat very nearly concern: you ,- and in-
deed it i: the imminent danger you are in bar moved me
to give to you Ibis timely notice. Danger! (faid I) what
danger ? I know of none, except my (hip being leaky,
for which I defign to have run her aground'to-mor-
row morning. Sir, {laid he) I bope you will be better
employed, <<wben you/ball bear wbat 1 have toflwy to you.
You know the town of Cambodia 2': about 15 league: up
Ibis river : About {loree league: on (bio/[do ofit, tbere
lie two Duteb and tbree Euglg/b/bzpr. And would you

So reafonable did this every way appear, that I
immediately confented, and we went directly on
board. As loan as we came on board, my partner
calls joyfully out, That they had flopped the leak !
Well, thank God, (faid I) but pray let us weigh
anchor forthwith. 'Weighl (faid he) what is the
meaning of this hurry ? Pray all: no quefiions, (faid
I) but all hands to work, without loling a moment's
time: Upon which, in great furprife, the captain
was called, who immediately ordered the anchor to
be got up; and though the tide was not quite down,
yet being allif'ted with a little land breeze, we Rood
out to fea. 1 then called my partner into the cabin,
and related the Rory at large, which was confirmed,
and more amplified by the two men I had brought
on board. Scarce had we finifhed our difcourfe
upon this head, but a failor came to the cabin-door,
with a mefl'age from the captain, that we were chaced
by five floops full of armed men. Very well, (faid I)
it is plain now there is fomething in it. And [0 go.
ing upon deck, I told all the men there was a defign
for feizing the fliip, and of executing us for pirates ;
and aflced them, whether they would faithfully [land
by us, and by one another ? To which they unani.
moufly replied, that they would fight to their laft
drop. of blood. I then allied the captain, which
way he thought belt for us to manage the battle?
Sir, (faid he) tbe only metlaod i: to keep tbem o witb
our greatflJot a: long a: we are able, and than Jd'UE re-
:owye to eta-final] arm: : And when bat/3 tbefl fin] at,
tben retire to ole/2' quartz", <<when per/zap: t/Je enemy,
wanting materialt, can 'mif/Jer break open our bulk beach,
nor get in upon at. Meantime the gunner was order-
ed to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of the
fieerage, and to load them with mulket bullets, and
{mall pieces of old iron ; and the deck being cleared,
we prepared for the engagement, ltill however keep-
ing out at fen. The boats followed us with all the
fail they could make, and we could perceive the two
foremofl: Were Englilh, which outfailed the rel't by
two leagues, and which we found would come up
with us: Hereupon we fired a gun without bail,
intimating that they fliould bring to, and we put
out a flag of truce, as a fignal for patley ; but find-
ing them crowding after us, till they came with-
in fliot, we took in our white, and hanging out the
red flag, immediately fired at them with. ball: We
then called to them with a {peaking trumpet, bidding
them at their peril keep off.

But all this lignified nothing; for depending upon
the ltrength that foliowed .them, they were relblute-
1y bent for mifehief : l-icreupun I ordered them to
bring the {hip to, by which means, they lying upon-our
broadlide, we let fly at them at once; one of our fliot
carried away the ltern of the hindetmoft boat, and
obliged them not only to take down their fail, but
made them all run to the head of the boat, to keep
them from linking; and fo the lay by, having enough
oftit. In the mean time we prepared to welcome
the foremofl boat in the fame manner. While we
were doing this, one of the three hindermoll: boats
came up to the relief of that which was dil'abled, and;
took the men out of her. We again called to parley

with them 5 but inflead of an anfwer,.one of the bpat's
2
came clofe under our flern ; whereupon. our gunner
let fly his two chafe-guns, but milling, the men in
the boat lhouted, and waving their caps, came on
with greater fury. To repair this feeming difgrace,
the gunner foon got ready, and firing the fecond
time, did a great deal of mifchief among the enemy.
We waved again, and bringing our quarter to bear
upon them, fired three guns more, when we found
the boat a-linking, and feveral men already in the
fea; hereupon, manning our pinnace, I gave orders
to fave as many as they could, and inllantly to come
on'hoard, becaufe the reit of their boats were ap-
proaching: ~Accordingly they did fo, and took up
three of them, one of whom was almoi't paft recove-
ry; and then crowding all the fail we could, after
our men came on board, we flood out farther to lea,
fo that the other three boats gave over their chace,
when they came up to the firf't two. Thus deliver-
ed frorn imminent danger, we changed our courl'e to
the eai'tward, quite out of the way of all Eur0pean
(hips. .

Being now at fea, and inquiring more particularly
of the two feamen the meaning of all this, the
Dutchman, at once, let us' into the fecret.' He'told
us that the fellow who fold us the (hip, was an ar-
rant thief, who had run - away with her; that the
captain was treacheroufly murdered on the coait of
Malacca by the natives there, with three of his men;
that he, the Dutchman, and four more, being oblip
ged to have recourfe to the woods for their fafety,
at length efcaped by means of a Dutch {hip, in its"
way to China, which had fent their boat on fhore
for frefh water : That, after this he went to Batavia,
where two of the feamen belonging to the {hip (who
had deferred the tell. in their travels) arrived, and
there gave an account that the fellow who ran away

:with the (hip had fold her at Bengal. to a for of pi-
rates, who went a-cruifing, and had already taken
one Englifh and two Dutch {hips richly laden.
Now, though this was abl'olutely falfe, yet con-
cerning us directly, my partner truly faid, that our
deliverance was to be efteemed {0 much the more,
by reafon had we fallen into their hands, we could
have expeeied nothing from them but immediate
death, confidering our accufers would have been our
judges: And therefore his opinion was, to return
directly to Bengal, where being known, we could
prove how honellly we came by the fhip, of whom
we bought her, and the like, and where we were
fure of fomc jultice ; at lealt would not be hanged
firli, and judged afterwards. I was at firfl of my
partner's opinion; but when I had more ferioufly
confidered of the matter, I told him we ran a great
hazard in attempting to return, being on the wrong
fide of the Straits of Malacca, and that if, upon a-
larm given, v.ve {hould be taken by the Dutch of? Ba-
tavia, or Engliflr ell'evr here, our running away would
be a l'utiicient evidence to condemn us. This dan-
ger indeed {hurled not only my partner, but likewife
all the {lnp's company; fo we changed our former
refolution, and relolved to go to the coafl of Ton-
quit), and lo to that of China, u here purfuing our
firfl: defign as to trade, we might likewife havc'an
opportunity to difp'vfe of the {hip fome way or other,
and to return to Bengal in any country vellel we
could procure. This being agreed to, we fteercd
away N. N. E. about fifty leagues off the ufual courfe
to the call, which put us to l'ome inconveniencies.
As the wind blew Readily againft us, our voyage be-
came very tedious, and we began to be afraid of
want of provilion; and what was (till worfe, we ap-
p-'ehended, that as tliofe fliips, from whole boats we
had efcaped, were bound to China, they might get
before us and have given freih information, which
might create'another vigorous purfuit. Indeed I
could not help being grieved, whenI confidered that
I, who had never wronged or defrauded any perfon
in my life, was now purfued like a common thief, .
and, if taken, to run the greatell: danger of being
executed as fuch , and, though innocent, I found
myfelf under the neceflirv of flying for my fafety,
and thereby efcape being Brought to fhamc, of which
I was even more afraid than of death irfelf. It was
eaty to read my dej eetion 1n my countenance. My
mind was oppreffed, like thofe unhappy innocent
perfons, who, being overpowered by blafp'nemous
and perjured evidences, wickedly rcfolved to take
away their lives, or ruin their reputation, have no
other recourfe in this world, to cafe their forrow,
but lighs, prayers, and tears. My partner feeing me
[0 concerned, encouraged me as well as he could ;
and, after defcri'ning to me the feveral ports of that
coafi, he told me, he would either put in 011 the wall:
of Cochinchina, or elfe in the bay of T onquin, from
whence we might go to Macao, a town once pofl'ef-
fed by the Portuguefe, and where iii'l many Euro-
pean families refide.

To this place we fieered, and early next morning
came in fight of the coal}; but thought it advifable.
to put/into a {mall river, where we could, either
over-land or by the {hi '3 pinnace, know what vef-
iels were in any ports 1 ereabouts. This happy flep
proved our deli1eranee , for next morning there
came to the bay of Tonquin two Dutch thips, and
a third without any colours, and, in the evening
two Englifh {hips fieered the fame courfe. The river
where we were was but fma'l, and run but a few
leagues 11p the country northward: The c2011 my was
wild and barbarous, and the people 1% ieves, having
no correfpondence with any 0 h r nation, dealin r on-

ly in fifh, oil, and {uch grols commodities, and one
barbarous cuf'tom they ltili retair ed, th at when any
vefl'el was unhappily {hipwrecked upon their coali,
they make the men prifoners or flaves; {0 that now
we might fairly fay we were furrounded by enemies
both by {ea and land. .

As the fhip had been leakv, we took the Oppor-
tunity, in this place, to fearch her, and to flop up
the places which let in the water. We accordingly
lightened her, and bringing our guns and Other
moveable things to one fide, we eiTay'ed to bring her
down, than we might come at her bottom : But, upon
fecond confideration, we did not think it fafe to let
her lie on dry ground, neither indeed was the place
convenient for it. The inhabitants, not ufed to fuch
a fight as to fee a {hip lie down on one fide, and
heel it towards the (bore, not perceiving her men,
who were at work on her bottom, with ftages and
boats on the off-Ede, prefently imagined the {hip had
been call away, and lay fail on the ground. Agree-
able to this fuppofition they furrounded us with ten
or twelve large boats, with a refolution, undoubtedly,
to plunder the ihip, and to Carry away thofe they
found alive for fl-wes to their king. But when they
perceived our men hard at work on the fhip's bot-
tom and tide, u-afhing, graying, and (topping her, it
filled them all with {uch furprife, that they l'tqod gar
zing, as though they were confounded. Nor could we
imagine what their defign was ; however, for fear of
danger, we handed down arms and ammunition to
thol'e at work, in order to defend themfelves; and
indeed this precaution was abfolutely necefl'ary ; for,
in a quarter of an hour after, the natives, conclud-
ing it was really a flaipwreck, and that we were fav-
ing our lives and goods, which they thought he-
longed to them, came down upon our men, as
though it had been in a line of battle. We lay at
prefent but in a very unfit pofiure to fight; and be-
fore the ftages could be got down, or the men in the
boat come on board as they were ordered, the Co-
ehinchinefes were upon them, and two of their boats
boarding our long-boat, they began 'to lay hold 'of
our men as-prifoners. The firfl: theyifeized wasa'
{tout Engliih failor, who never'fir'cd his mulket, like
a fool, as I imagined, but laid it down in the boat;
but he knew whathe was-doing; for by main force
he dragged the Pagan out of the boat into- ours, by
the two cars, and knocked his brains out againlt- the
boat's gunnel: A Dutchmen that was next him
fnatched up the -mufltet, and" knocked down five
morewith the butt end of it; however, this was doing
very little to theirln'urnber; but a {trange unexpect-
ed accident, which rather merits laughter than any
thing elfe, gave our men a complete ~viEURtory over
them. . ,
It feems-th'e carpenter, 'who was-preparing to grave
the outlide of the (hip, as .well "as to pay the feams,
where he caulk'ed, to flop the leaks, had gotten
two kettles jufi let down in the boat, onefille'd with
boiling pitch, and the other with rolin, 'tallow,' oil,
and fuch {tufl' as the {hipwrights ufe; The carpen-
ter's man had 'a great- iron iladdle with which he
ufed to {apply the workmen'Twith'hot find, and as
two of the'enemies entered the boat where the fe'ln
low flood, he faluted them with a fulltla'ddle-of the 3
hot boiling liquor, which, the poor creatures being
half naked, made them roar out and jump into the
fea. Well done, Jack, (fays the carpenter) give them
the other doze: and {o ftepping forward .himfelf,
takes a mop, and dipping: it into the pitch-pot, he
and his man f0 plentifully Hang it among them, as -
that none efca'ped being fealded': Upon which they
all made the belt of their way, crying and homing
in fuch afrightful manner, that in all my adventures
I never heard the like. -And indeed never was I bet-
ter pleafed with any conqueft than'I was with this,-
there being {0 little bloodlhed, and having" an averg
fio'n to killing fuch favagc wretches (more than was
necefi'ary), as knowing they came on errands which
their laws and cultoms made them think were jufl:
and equitable. By this time, all things being in or-
der, and the {hip fwimming, they found their mif-
take, f0 they did not venture a fecond attack: Thus
ended our merry fight; and having got fome rice,
bread, roots, and fixteen good hogs on board the
day before, we fet fail, not daring to go into the
bay of Tonquin, but fieered N. E. towards the ifle
of Formofa, or as though we would go to the Manil-
las, or Philippine iflands, for fear of meeting with
any European fhips. When we anchored at the
ifle Formofa, the inhabitants not only courteoufly
fupplied us with provifions and frefn water, but ,dealt
very fairly and honeltiy with us in their bargains and
agreements. From this place we fieered north, keep-
ing {till off the coaft of China, till we were beyond
all its ports where European {hips ufually come; and
at length being come to the latitude, of thirty de--
grees, we refolved to put into the firlt trading port
we {hould come at; and {landing for the lhore, a
boat came off two leagues to us with an old Portu-
guefe pilot on board, who offered his fervice; we
very gladly accepted him, and fent the boat back
again. And now, having the old man on board, I -
talked to him of going to Nanquin, the molt north-
ward part of the coaft of China. \Vhat will you do
there r (faid he fmiling.) I told him we would fell
our cargo, and purchafe calicoes, raw and wrought
(ides, tea, &c. and {0 return the fame way back.
0, (faid he) you had better put in at Macao, where
you may buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin,
and fell your opium at a greater advance. But, (faid
l) we are gentlemen as well as merchants, and de-
{ign t0 fee the great city of Pekin, and the magnificent
court Of the Monarch of China. \Vhy, then, (faid
be) you {hould go to Ningpo, where there is a nag
vigablc river that goes through the heart of that

2
vafl: empire, two hundred and feventy leagues from.
the (ca, which crofl'es all the rivers, panes confider-
able hills, by the help of the fluices and gates, and
goes even u to the city of Pekin. You may go to
Nanquin, ifp you pleafe, and travel to Pekin, and

there is a Dutch or Englifh {hip jufl: before bound
that way. At the name of a Dutch or Englilh {hip
I was [truck with confulion; they being as great a
terror to me in this vefl'el, as an Algerine man of war
is to them in the Mediterranean. The old man'find--
ing me troubled, Sir, (faid he) I hope the Dutch are
not now at war with your nation? No, (faid I) but,
God knows what liberty they may take when out of
the reach of the law. Why, (fays he) what'occafion
is there for peaceable merchants to fear? for, be-
lieve me, they never meddle with any but Pirates.
At the mentioning of the word pirates, my coung
tenance turned to that of fcarlet; nor was it pollible
for me to conceal it from the old pilot ; who taking
norice of it, Sir, (faid he) take what caurfe you play},
I'll do you all Ilse/Evoke I can. Signor, (faid I) I am
a little concerned at your mentioning pirater; I hope
there are none fuch in thefe feas, beeaufe you fee
in what a weak condition we are to defend ourfelves.
" 0, Sir, (laid he) if that's all, don't be concern-
ed, I don't remember one in thefe feas thefe fifteen-
years, except about a month ago one was feen in the
bay of Siam, but {he is gone to the fouthward ; nei-
ther was Lire built for a privateer, but was run away
with b a reprobate captain, and fome of his men,
the rig 1t captain having been murdered by the Ma-

layans."
What! (laid I, as though ignorant of What had

happened), did they kill the captain? " No, (faid
hc) it is generally thought the Malayans murdered
him; but perhaps they might procure them to do
it, and therefore they juflly deferve hanging. The
rogues werelately' dileovered in the bay of Siam,
in the river of Cambodia, by fome Dutchmen who
belonged to the (hip, and had much- ado to efcape
the five boats that purfued them, but they have all
given fuch an. exaet defcription of the (hip, that
wherever they find her, they will be fure to know
her, and they have folemnly {wore to give no quarter
to the captain or the feamen, but hang them every
one up at the yard-arm, without any formal bufinefs I
of bringing them to a court of judicature."

Being fenfible, that, having the old man on board,
he was incapable of doingme any mifchief, Well,
Signor, (faid I) it is for this very reafon I would
' have you carry us up to Nanquin, where neither

Englilh nor Dutch {hips come: And I mutt tell you
their captains are a parcel of rafh, proud, infolcnt
rafcals, that neither know what belongs to juflice,
nor how to behave themfelves as the laws of God
or nature direet; fellows that would prove mur-
derers to punifh robbers, and take upon them to ad-
judge innocent men to death, without any proof to
prove them guilty; but perhaps I may live to call
them to an account for it, in a place where they may
be taught how juftice is to be executed. And [0 I
told him all the {tory of buying the (hip, and how
we were faved by the means of two men: That the
murder of the captain by the Malayans, as alfo the
running away with the (hip, I believed to be true;
but that we, who bought it, were'turned pirates, was a
mere fiction, to cover their cowardice and fooliih be-
haviour, when they attacked us, and the blood of thofe
men we killed in our own jufl: defence lay to their
door, who fent to attack us by furprife.

" Sir, (faid the old man, amazed) you have taken
the right courfe to {leer to the north, and, if I might
advife you, I would have you fell your {hip in China,
and buy or build another in that country; and I'll
procure peOple to buy the one and fell the other."
Well, but Signor, (faid I) if Ifell the {hip in this
manner, I may bring Tome innocent perfons into the
fame danger as 'I have gone through, perhaps worfe,So

even death itfe'lf, whereby I {hould be as guilty of
their murder as villanous executioners. " That
need not trouble you (fays the old man); I'll find a
way to prevent that; for thefe commanders you talk
of I know them very well, will inform them rightly
of the matter as you have related, and I am per-
fuaded they will not only believe me, but aet more
cautioufly for the future." .And will you deliver one
mefl'age from me to them? " Yes, (faid he) if you
will give it under your hand, that] may prove it is not
my own produelion." Hereup'on I wrote a large ac-
count of their attacking me in their long-boat; the
pretended reafon and unjul't delign of it; that they
had done what they might be alhamed of, and could
not anfwer for at any tribunal in England. But this
letter was written in vain : Providence ordered things
another way. \Ve failed direetly for Nanquin, and
in about thirteen days fail, came to an anchor at the
fouth-well point .'of the great gulf of that place,
where we learned that two Dutch {hips were gone
the length before us, and that we {hould certainly fall
into their hands. W'e were all at a great lofs in this
exigency, and would very gladly have been 0n lhore
alfnol't any where; but our old pilot told me, that
if I would fail to the {outhward about two-and-for-
ty leagues, there was a little port called Qinchange,
where no European {hips ever came, and where we
might contider what was further to be done. Ac-
cordingly we weighed anchor the next day, calling
only twice on (here by the way to get frelh water.
The country people very courteoully fold us roots,
tea, rice, fowis, and other proviiions. After five days
fail we came to the port, and landed with unfpeak-
able joy. \Ve refolved to difpofe of ourfelves and-
efl'eets in any other way pollible, than enter on board
that ilLfated vchel more; for no (late can be more
miferable than acontinued fear, which is a life of

death, a confounder of our underftandings, that {era

I
the imagination at work to form a thohfand frightful
things that may never happen. And we fcarce flept
one night, without dreaming of halters, yard-arms,
or gibbets; of fighting, being taken, and being kill-
ed; nay, fo violent were our apprehenfions, that we
would bruife our hands and heads againl't the tides of
the cabin, as though'aelually engaged. The llory of
the Dutch cruelty at Ampona often came .into our
thoughts when awake ; and, for my part, I thought
my condition very hard, that, after {0 many dil'h'CuL
ties, and fuch fignal deliverances, I {hould be hanged
in my old age, though innocent of any crime that
deferved {uch punilhment; but then religion would
feem to reprefent to me, as though the voice of it had
faid, Confider, 0 man, what fins you have been for-
merly guilty of, which now thou art called to an ac-

count for, to expiate with thy blood ! And as to thy
innocence, what art thou more innocent than thy
blelled rcdeemcr dlefus Chriit, who quered for thy
offences, and to whole providence you ought to {ub-
mit, let what u ill happen. After this, natural cou-
rage would infpire me to refill: to the lafl' drop of
blood, and fooner die man l'uli'cr myfelf to be taken
by boorifh, rah-ally Dutchmen, who had arts to tor-
ment beyond death itfeif.

But now, thank kind Heaven, being afhore, our
old pilot procured us a lodging and a warehoufe for
our goods; it was a little hut ,with a large warehonfe
joining to it, all built with canes, and pallifadoed
round with large ones, to keep out pilfering thieves,
who are very numerpus in that country. The ma-
gilh'atcs allowed us a little guard during the night,
and we employed a centinel, with a kind of halbert,
for threcpence a-day. The fair, or mart, we found
had been over for fome time; however, there re-
mained in the river four junks and two Japan fliips,
the merchants of the latter being on lhore. In the
firfl; place, our old pilot brought us acquainted with
the millionary Roman prielts, who were converting
the people to Chriftianity: Two of them were re-
ferved, rigid, and aullere, applying themfelves to.
the work they came about with great earneltnefs;

but the third, who was a. Frenchman, called Father
Simon, was of a freer cOnverfation, not feemingly
fo ferious and grave, yet no worfe Chriltian than the

other two, one of whom was a Portuguefe, and the
other a Genoefe. Father Simon, it feems, was ap-
pointed to go to Pekin, the royal feat of the Em e.
ror of the Chinefe ; and he only waited for ano er
priel't, who was ordered from Macao to accompany
him. We never met together but he was prompt-
ing me to keep him company in his journey: Sir,
(faid he) I will {how you the lorious things of this
mighty empire, and a city, the city of Pekin, far
exceeding London or Paris, put them both together.
One day, in particular, being at dinner with him,
I {howed fome inclination to go, which made him
prefs the more upon me and my partner, to gain our
perfect confent. But, Father Simon, (faid my part-
ner) what fixtirfaflian can you bave in our company,
whom you g/Ieem a: heretics, and coffequently oly'efl: not
worthy your regard? Oh! (faid he) you may be as
good Catholics in time as thofe I hope to convert to
our religion. And fa, (laid I) we flail ba-ve you
preaching to u: all the way, irg/Iead of play/Eng m wit/3
a defcrzption of the country. Sir, (faid be) however
our religion may be vilified by fome people, it is very
certain it neither divefls us of good manners or Chri-
fiian charity ; and as we are gentlemen, as fuch we
may converfe together, without making one another
uneafy. '

But we {hall leave him a while, to coufidcr our
lhip, and the merchandife which we had to difpofe
of. There'was but very little trade in the .place
where we were; and fo I was once refolved to ven-

ture to fail to the river Kila'rlnx, and {o to the city of
2
Nanquin, but Providence ordered it otherwiie, by
our old pilot's bringing a Japan merchant to us to
fee what goods we had. He immediately bought
our opium, for which he gave us a very good price
in gold by weight, forne wedges of which were about
ten or eleven ounces. It came into my head that
perhaps he might buy the {hip too; and I ordered
his interpreter to propofe it to him. He {aid no-
thing then, but {hruuk up his lhoulders; yet in a few
days afterhc came,accompanied bya mil'fionary priefl',
who was his interpreter, with this propofal, That a:

on this we aiked the captain and his men, if they
were willing to go to Japan; to which they unani-
moufly agreed. \Vhile this was in agitation, the
young man my nephew left to attend me, told me,
That a: I did m! (are [0 aa'c'pt z'lvir prqA-'brfl of advan-
tage, /:e even/d manage itfir me a: I plea/Pd, and rm-
a'er mt afaz'tljitl account 9f [:1': flute/3, 'w/Jic/Jflmu/d lie
wise/1y mine. Indeed I was very unwilling to part
with him; but confidering it might be for the young
man's .good, I difcourfed my partner about it, who,
of his own generoiity, gave hiu'. his {hare of the vef-
{ehfo that! could do no otherwife than give him mint;
but however, we let him have but the property of
liaif of it, and referred a power, that " hen we met in
England, if he had obtained fuccei's, he {hould ac-
count to us for one half of the profits of the {hip's
freight, and the other flsould be his own. Thus hav-
ing taken a writing under his hand, away he failed
to Japan, where the merchant dealt very honeltly
by him, got him a licence to come on fliore, fent
him loaded to the Philippines with a Japanefe {upw-
car-m, from whence he came back again loaded with \
liuroPean goods, cloves, and other fpiceries. By
this voyage he cleared a confiderable {um of money,
which determined him not to fell his (hip, but to
trade on his own account: 30 he returned to the
Manillas, where getting acquaintance, he made his
{hip free, was hired by the governor privately to go
to Acapulco, in America, on the Mexican coaft, with
a licence to travel to the great city of Mexico. This
trailie turned out greatly to account, and my friend
finding means to get to Jamaica, returned nine years
after exceeding rich into England.

In parting with the ihip, it comes in math: to
confider of thofe men who had faved our lives when
in the river of Cambodia; and though, by the way,
they were a couple of rogues, who thought to turn
pirates themfelves, yet we paid them what they had
before demanded, and gave each oPS them a {mall {um
of money, making the Englilhman a gunner, and
the Dutchman a boatfwain, with which they were
very well contented.

We were now above 1000 leagues farther from
home than when at Bengal. All the comfort we
could expeel: was, that there being another fair to
be 'kept in a month's time, we might not only pur-
chafe all forts of that country's manufaelures, but ve-
ry polhbly find fome Chinefe junks, or vcffels from
Tonquin, to be fold, which would carry us and our
goods wherefoever we pleafed. Upon thefe hopes,
we refolved to continue; and to divert ourfelves, we
took feveral little journeys in the country. ,About
ten days after we parted with our fhip, we travelled
to fee the city of Nanquin. This city lies in latitude
30 deg. north of the line ; it is regularly built, and
theftreets are exafily firaight, and crofs one another-
in direel: lines, which fets it out to'the greatell'. ad.-
vantage. At our return, we found the prieft was
game from Macao that was to accompany Father.-

N3
Simon to Pekin. That father earneftly folicited me
to accompany him, and I referred him to my part-
ner. In fiiort, we both agreed, and prepared ac-
cordingiy 5 and we were {'0 lucky as to have liberty
to travel among the retinne of one of their Manda-
rines, who is a principal magiitmtc, and much re-
vcrrnced by the people.

Vie: were five-andtzrent}: (lags travelling through
this miferable country, infinitely pepulons, but as
intiii'hrcr :Yy etniivami; and yet their pride is infi-
nitcl'y gnatcr tlLll their poverty, infomuch that the
prieltt them elvv derided them. As we pafl'ed by
the hint.- of one of their country gentlemen, two
ieagucs (H Nanqnin, we had the honour, forfooth,
to ride \1'i1 !. the Chinefe {quire about two miles. Ne-
vcr was Don (Qixote to exactly imitated, never fuch
a compound of pomp and poverty feen before!

His habit, made of calico, was dirty, greafy, and
very prOper for a Merry Andrew or Scaramouch,
with all its tawdry trappings, and hanging fleevcs,
tafi'els, &c. though torn and rent in almol't every
part: His vef't underneath it was no lefs dirty, but
more greafy, refembling the molt exquifite floven,
or greafy butcher. His horfc (worfe than Roti-
nante, or the famous Reed of the doughty Hudibras)
was a poor fiarved decrepit thing, that would not
fell for thirty {billings in England: And yet this
piece of worfhipful pomp was attended with ten or
twelve flaves, who guarded their matter to his coun-
try-feat. We flopped at a little village for rein-{h-
ment: And when we came by the country-feat of
this great man, we found him fitting under a tree
before his door, eating a mefs of boiled rice, with a
great piece of garlic in the middle, and a bag filled
with green pepper by him, and another plant like
ginger, together with a piece of lean mutton in it;
this was his W'orfhip's repaft : But pray obferve the
flare of the fool ! two women flaves brought him his
food; which being laid before him, two others ap-
peared, to perform their refpee'tive oil-ices; one fed
him with a fpoon, while the other fcraped off what
fell upon his beard and taffety veflz, and gave it to a
particular favourite to eat. And thus we left the
wretch pleafed with the conceit of our admiring his
magnificence,which rather merited our [com and de-
teftation.

At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin,
accompanied by two fervants, and the old Portuguefe
pilot,whofe charges we bore, and who ferved us as an
interpreter by the way. We had {carce been a" week
at Pekin, but he comes laughing to us, Ab! Signior
Ingli/e, (faid he) mefomet/zing tell you make your beart
glad, but make mejorry; for you bring me [were twenty-
five dayrjourney, and now you leave me go back alone ,-
and rabid: way jlwll I malee my port after, wit/Bout dc
flip, wit/rout do bar/2', without pecune? {0 he called
money in his broken Latin. He then informed me,
that t ere was a great caravan of Mufcovite and Poliih
merchants in the city, who were preparing to fet out
for Mufcovy by land within fix weeks; and that he
was certain we would take this opportunity, and con-
fequently that he mull: go home by himfelf. Indeed
this news infinitely {urprifed and pleafcd me. Are you
certain of this? (laid I.) for, Sir, (faid he) me flare it':
true. And {0 he told me, tbat [waving met an old ac-
quaintance of lair, an Armenian, in tbeflreet, 'wlio war
among them, and who bad come from Aflracan, wit/3 a
de/Ign to go to Tonquin, but fir- certain reg/on: loaning
altered bi: refilution, be war now refolued to go witb
the caravan, and to return by tbe river W alga to Aflra-
can. Well, Signior, (faid I) don't be difcontented
about your returning alone ; and if by this means I
can find a pafl'age to England, it will be your own
fault if you return to Macao at all.. And lo confulting
with my partner what was bell: to be done, he re-

ferred it to me 2151 pleafed, having our atTairs fo well
N 4
fettled at Bengal, that if we could convert the good"
voyage we had made in China lilks, wrought-raw,
he would be fatisfied-vto go to England, andfo're-
turn to Bengal in the company's {hips. Thus refolv.
ed,we agreed, that if our pilot would go with us, we
would bear his charges either to Mufcow or England ;
and to give him in a prefent the firm of 1701. Ster-
ling. Hereupon we called him in, and told him the '
caufe of his complaint {hould be removed, if he
would accompany us with the caravan ; and'therea
fore we delired to know his mind. At this he flrtmk'
his head, Great long journey, (faid he) me no pecune,
carry me to Alli/Ema, or keep me tbere. But we. foon
put him out of that concern, by making him fenfible
of what we would give him here to lay out to the
heft advantage; and as for his charges, we would
fet him fafe on fliore, God willing, either in Mufco-
vy or England, as he pleafed, at our own charge, ex-
cept the carriage of his goods. At this propofal' he
was like a man tranfported, telling us he would go
with us all the world over; and we made prepara~
tions for our journey ; but>> it was near four months
before all the merchants were ready.

In the mean time, my partner and the pilot went
exprefs tothe port where we firlt put in, to difpol'e
of what goods had been left there, while I accom-
panied a Chinefe merchant, who was going to Nan-
quin, and there bought 29 pieces of damaflr, with a-
bout 300 more of other fine Elks; and by the time
my partner returned to Pekin, I had them all car-
ried thither: Our cargo in filks amounted to 4 5001.
Sterling, which, together with tea, fine calicoes,
nutmegs and cloves, loaded 18 camels for our ihare,
belides what we rode upon, with two or three {pare t
horfes, and two more loaded with provilions: The
company now was very great, making abdut 400
horfe, and about 120 men,well armed and provided.-
We were of feveral nations, among whom were five,
Scots merchants inhabiting in Mufcow, and well ex-

perienced in trade. '
We fet' out from Pekin the beginning of Eebrua; j ,
our fiyle'; and in two days more, we pafi'ed~_throug ,
the gate of the great China wall, which was erected
as a" fortification againi't the Tartars,. being toREng- '
liih miles long. We then entered a country not near
{0 populous, chiefly under the power of plundering
Tartars, feveral companies of whom we perceived.
riding on poor {tarved horfes, contemptible' as them;-~
felves, without order or difcipline. One time, our
leader for the day gave us leave to go ach'untingcz.
But what do you. think we hunted "P. only a parcel of
_theep, which indeed exceeded any in the world for-
wildnefs and fwiftnefs : But while we were purfuing.
this game, it was our chance to meet with about
forty Tartars, who no fooner. perceived.us, but one
of them blew ahorn, at the found of. which there
foon appeared a troop of forty or fifty more, at about
a mile's difiance. Hereupon one of the Scots met-A
chants (who knew. their way) ordered us' to advance-
towards them, and attack. them. immediately. Ann
we advanced, they let fly a volley of, arrows, which. .
happily fellalittle fhort of us :. This made us halt a.
little, to return the compliment with bullets; and
then being led up by the bold- Scot, we fired our'
.piftols in their faces, ' and drew out our- fwords; but.
there was no occalion ;,for they flew like timorous-
fheep, and only three of them remained, beckoning:
to the tell; to come back. But our brave commander
gallops up' to themby-himfelf, {hot one dead, knocks
; anotheroflihis horfe, .while the third ran away: And
-thus ended ours battle withthe Tartars.. , i
. _We travelled a month more through the Empe-
- ror of China's dominions ; ,and at length comingto
' ~ cone 'of their towns. about 3-day. and a-half'sjourm
.. grey. ; from the city of Naum, I. wanted to buy a
' ' :gamel. The'perfon I'fp'oke' to would havebrought
' gmet'one,' but, like .a fool, 1emnlt go along with him,,
- about two miles from the village. My old pilot and
I walked on foot, forfooth, for fame variety, when
coming to the place where the camels were kept as
in a park guarded by Chinefe foldiers, we there a-
greed and bought one, which the Chinefe man that
came with me led along the road. But we had not
gone far, before we were attacked by five Tartars,
mounted on horfcback, two of whom feized the
man, took the camel from him, and rode away,
while the other three approached us, the firll; of
whom fuddenly feized me as I .was drawing my
fword, the fecond knocked me down; but my old
trulty Portuguefc, taking a pil'tol out of his pocket,
which I knew norhing of, and coming up to the
fellow that {truck me, he, with one hand, pulled
him of? his horfe, and then {hot him dead upon
the fpot ; then taking his feymitar, he {truck at the
man that ltopt us, but milling him, cut of one of
his horl'e's ears, the pain of which made him throw
his rider to the ground. The poor Chinefe, who
had led the camel, feeing the Tartar down, runs to
'him, and fcizing upon his pole-axe, wrenched it from
his hands, and knocked his brains out. But there
was another 'l'artar to deal with, who feeming neither
inclined to fight, nor to fly, and my old man hav-
ing begun to charge his piltol, the very light of it
firuck fuch a terror into the wretch, that away he
feoured, leaving my old pilot, rather my champion
and defender, an ahfolute vietory.

By this time, being awakened from my trance, I
began to open my eyes, wondering where I was, hav-
ing quite forgot all that paii'ed; but my feufes re-
turning, and feeling a great pain in my head, and,
feeing the blood was running over my clothes, l-in--.
{iantly jumped upon my feet, and graiped my {word
in my hand, with a rcfolution to take revenge ; bdt
no enemies now remained, except the dead Tartar,

with his horfe fiauding by him. The old man fee.
ing me recovered, whom he thought flain, ran to-
wards me, and embraced me with the greatefl: tender-
nefs, at the fame time examining into my wound,--
which was far from being mortal. When we returned
to the village, the man demanded payment for his .
camel, which I refuling, we brought the caufe'be-
fore a Chinel'e judge, who afied with great impar-
tiality: Having heard both (ides, he aflted the Chi-
nefe man that went with me, whole fervant he was?
Sir, (faid he) I am nobody's, but went with the
firanger, at his requel't : Why then, (laid the judge)-
you were the liranger's fervant for the time, and the
camel being delivered to his fervant, it is the fame-
as though delivered to himfelf, and accordingly he
mul't pay for it. Indeed the cafe was fo fairly fiated,
that I had nothing to object to it: So having paid
for that I was robbed of, I [em for another, but 'did.
not go myfelf to fetch it, as I had enough of that
{port before. I

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinefe em-
pire, f0 fortified, as fome will tell you, that millions.
of T artars cannot batter down their walls; by which
certainly one might think one of our cannons would
do more execution than all their legions.

.When we were within a day's march of that city,
we had information that the governorhad fent mef-
fengers to every part of the road, to inform the tra-
vellers and_caravans to halt, till a guard mas fent to
proteet them from the numerous bodies of Tartars
that lately appeared about the city. This news put _
us into great confiernation; but, obeying the orders,
we (tent, and two days after, there came two hun-
dred foldiers from a garrifon of the Chinefe, and
three hundred more from Naum : Thus guarded ,

both in the front and rear, with our men on the
flanks, _we: boldly advanced, thinking we were able.

Early next morning, in our march from a little
well lituated town called Changn, after having palli-
ed a river, and entered upon a defert of about 15
or 16 miles over, we foon beheld, by a cloud of dult
tht" was railed, that the enemy was approaching.
This much difpirited the Chinefe. My old pilot took
notice of it, and called out, Signor Inglcfe, thofe
fellows mul't be encouraged, or they will ruin us all;
and I am afraid, if the 'l'artars attack us, they will
all run away. \Vhy, Signor, (laid 1) what {hall be
done in this cafe 3 Done l (lays he) why, let fifty of
our men advance, and flank them on each wing. I
know the fellows will light well enough in company.
\Ve accordingly took his advice, and marched fifty
to the right wing, and the fame number to the left,
and with the relt made a line of referve, leaving the
lili; two hundred men to guard the camels, or to af-
fill us as occafion required.

Thus prepared, a p irty of the enemy came for-
ward, viewing our pollute, and traverling the ground
on the front of our line. l-lereupon we ordered the
two wings to move on, and give them a falute with
their fllot, which accordingly was done. This put
a flop to their proceedings; for immediately wheel-
ing oll' to their left, they all marched away, and we
law no more of them. They had undoubtedly given
an account to their companions of what reception
they might expefi, which made them {0 ealily give
over their enterprife.

When we came to the city of Naum, we returned
the governor hearty thanks, and difperfed a hundred
crowns among the foldiers that guarded us. We
relied there one day, and then proceeded on our
travels, palling feveral great rivers and deferts; and
on the 13th of April, we came to the frontiers of
Mufcovy, the firll town of which was called Argun.

This happy occalion, as I thought, of coming in-
to a Chtil'tian country, made me congratulate the.
Scots merchant upon it: He fmiled at that, telling
me not to rejoice too foon; for, (faid he) except the
Ruffian foldiers in garrifon, and a few inhabitants
of the cities upon the road, all the tell: of this coun-
try, for above a thoufand miles, is inhabited by the
molt ignorant and barbarous Pagans.

We advanced from the river Arguna by moderate
journeys, and found convenient garrifons on the road,
filled with Chriflzian foldiers, for the fecurity of com-
merce, and for the convenient lodgings of travellers;
but the inhabitants of the country were mere Pagans,
worfliipping the moon, fun, and liars. We parti-
cularly obferved this idolatry near the river Arguna,
at a city inhabited by Tartars and Ruflians, called
Nerifinkey. Being curious to fee their way of living,
while the caravan continued to tell themfelves in this
city, I went to one of their villages, where there was
to be one of their folemn facrifices. There I beheld,
upon the {lump of an old tree, an idol of wood, more
ugly than the reprefentation of the devil himfelf: Its
head refembled no living creature: Its ears were as
big and as high as a goat's horns, a crooked nofe, four
cornered mouth, and horrible teeth: It was clothed
in lheeps lltins, had a great Tartar bonnet, with two
horns growing through it, and was eight feet high,
without feet, legs, or proportion. Before this idol
there lay fixteen or feventeen people, who brought
their offerings, and were making their prayers, while
at a difiance flood three men, and one bullock, as
vielims to this ugly monfier.

Such fiupendous facrilege as this, in robbing the
true God of his honour, filled me with the greatell;
aflonifhment and refleEURtion -, which foon turning to

rage and fury, I rode up to the image, and cut in
.pieces the bonnet that was upon his head with my
fword, {0 that it hung down by one of the horns,
while one of my men that was with me, pulled at it
.by his iheep-flrin garment. Immediately an hideous
howling and outcry ran through the village; and two
or three hundred people coming about Our ears, we
were obliged to fly for it.

But I had not done with the monl'ter ; for them--
ravan being to tell: three nights in the town, I told-
the Scots merchant what I had-fcen, and that I was
refolved to take four or five men well armed with
me, in order to defiroy the idol, and {how the pe0ple
how little reafon they had to trufl: in a god who could
not fave himfelf. At firlt he laughed at me, repre-
fenting the danger of it, and when it was defiroyed,
what time had we to preach to them better things,
whofe zeal and ignorance was in the highel't degree,
and both unparallelled; that if I {hould be taken by
them, I fliould be fervcd as a poor Rullian, who con-
temned their worfhip; that is, to be {tripped naked,
and tied to the rep of the idol, there the: at with
their arrows till my body was full of them, and then
burnt a facrifice to the monfler: But, Sir, (faid he)
fince your zeal carries you fo far, rather than you
{hould be alone, I will accompany you, and bring a
flout fellow equal to yourfelf, if you will, to affilt
you in this defign : And accordingly he brought one
Captain Richardfon, who hearing the Rory, readily
confented; but my partner declined it, being alto~
gether out of his way: And fo we three, and my
manJervant, refolved to execute this exploit about
midnight ; but upon fecond thoughts we deferred it
to next night, by reafon that the caravan being to
go from thence next morning, we lhould be out of
the governor's power. The better to efi'ee'tuate my
delign, I procured a Tartar's {beep-{kin robe, a bon-
net, with a bow and arrows, and every one of us
got.the like habits. The firft night we fpent in mix-
ing combufiible matter with aquavitae, gun-powder,
fire. having a good quantity of tar in a little pot; next
night we came up to the idol about eleven o'clock,
the moon being up; we found none guarding it,
but we perceived a light in the houfe, where we hackenonmson 0311503. 303

feen the priefl before. One of our men was for fi- ing
the hut, another for killing the people, and a'th'ird
for making them p'r'ifoners, while the idol was de-
ftroying. We agreed to the latter; fo knocking at
the doo'r, we feized the firlt that opened it, and (top-
ping his mouth, and tying his feet, we left him. We
ferved the other two in the like manner ; and then
the Scots' merchant {et fire to the compolition,
which frightened them to much, that we brought
them all away prifoners to their wooden god. There
we fell to work with him, daubing him all over with
tar mixed with tallow and brimllone, lloppedhis eyes,
ears, and mouth full of gun-powder, With a great
piece of wild fire in his bonnet, and enviroued it with
dry forage. All this being done, we unloofed and
ungagged the prifoners, and fer the idol on fire,~
which the gun-powder blowing up, the {hape of it
was deformed, rent, and fplit, which the forage ut-
terly confumed ; for we {laid to. fee its deltruetion,
left the ignorant idolatrous peeple {hould have thrown
themfelves into the flames. And thus we came a-
way undifcovered, the morning appearing as bufy
among our fellow-travellers, as nobody could have
fufpeeted any Other but that we had been in our beds
. all night. '_

Next morning we fet out, and had gone but a
fmall diltance from the city, when there came a
multitude of the peOple of the country to the gates
of the city, demanding fatisfae'tion of the Ruflian
governor for infulting their priel'ts, and bdrn'in'g
their great'Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the
fun, and no mortal would violate his, image'but
fome Chrifiian mifcreants; and being already do lefs
than thirty thdufand firong, they announced war a-
gaini't him and all his Chriitians. ' "

The governor afl'ured them he was ignorant of the
'matter, and'that none of his garrifon had. been'a-
"broad 5' that indeed there was a'c'aravan that" weave-l
way'that morning, and that he would fend after
them to inquire into it; and whoever were the of.
fenders, fhould be delivered into their hands. This
fatislied them for the prefent, but the governor fent
to inform us, that if any of us had done it, we
ihould make all the halte away pollible, while he
kept them in play as long as he could. Upon this
we marched two days and two nights, flopping but
very little, till at lal't we arrived at a village call-
ed Plothus, and halted to Jarawena, another of the
Czar's colonies. On the third day, having entered
the defert, and pall'ed the lake called Shaks Ofer,
we beheld at numerous body of horfe on the other
tide of it to the north, who fuppofed we had paired
on that lide of the lake; but having either found
their miltake, or being certainly informed of the
way we took, they came upon us towards the dufk
of the evening, juft as we had pitched our camp be-
tween two little but very thick woods, with a little
river running before our front, and fome felled trees,
with which we covered our rear; a precaution we
always took, and which we had jull: finifhed when
the enemy came up. They did not fall on us im-
mediately, but fent three mell'engers, demanding
the men who had infulted their priells, and burnt
their god Cham Chi-Thaungu, that they might be
burnt with fire; that if this was complied with, they
would peaceably depart; but if not, they would de-
ltroy one and all of us. Our men flared at one an-
other on receipt of this med-age, but Nobody was the
word, as indeed nobody knew it, but he who did
it. Upon which the leader of the caravan returned
for anfwer, that they were pcaceable merchants,
who meddled with none of their prielts and gods;
and therefore delired them not to dil'turb us, and
put us to the neceliity of defending ourfelves. But
fo far was this from fatisfying them, that the next

morning, coming to our right, they let fly a Yolk!
of arrows among us, which happily did not hurt any,
becaufe we theltered ourfelves behind our baggage.
W'e expeeted, however, to come to a clofer engage-
ment ; but were happily {aved by a cunning fellow,
a CotTack, "ho obtaining leave of the leader to go
out, mounts his horl'e, rides direetly from our rear,
and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tartars, as
though he had been fent exprefs, and tells them a
formal flory, that the wretches who had burnt the
Cham Chi-'l'haungu, were gone to Siheilka, with
a refolution to burn the god'Shal lfar, belonging to
the Tonguefes. Upon which, believing this cun-
ning Tartar, who was fervant to our Mufcovites, a-
way they drove to Siheilka, and in lefs than three
minutes were out of our light, nor did we ever hear
of them more. '

When we came to the city of Jarawena, we reit-
ed five days, and then entered into a frightful de~
ferr, which held us twenty-three days march, in-
feficd with feveral {mall companies of robbers, or
h'Iogul Tartars, who never had the courage to at-
tack us. After we had pafl'ed over this defert, we
found feveral garrifons to defend the caravans from
the violence of the Tartars. In particular, the go-
vernor of Adinfkoy offered us a guard of fifty men
to the next fiation, if we apprehended any danger.
The people here retained the fame paganifm and bar-
barity, only they were not fo dangerous, being con-
quered by the Mufcovites. The clothing, both of
men and women, is of the {kins of beafis, living un-
der the ground in vaults and caves, which have a
communication with one another. They have idols
almof't in every family; befidcs, they adore the fun
and (tars, water and thaw; and the leafi: uncom-
mon thing that happens in the elements, alarms them
as much as' thunder and lightning does the unbe-
lieving Jews. _

Nething remarkable occurred in our march throng
this country. Vt hen we had got through the de-
ferr, after two days further travel, we came to Je-
nezo, a Mufeovite city, on the great river to call-
ed, which, we were told, parted Europe front Alia.
The inhabitants here were very little better, thou'b h
intermixed with the M ufcoxites; but the w0111.er
will ceafe, \1he11I inform my reader of what was
obferved to me, that the Czar rather converts the
Tartars with foltliers than clergymen, and is more
proud to make them faithful fubjce'ts than good
Ch1illians.
From this city to the river Oby', we travelled over
a pleafant, fruitful, but very uncultivated country,
for want of good management and peop ple, and thofe
few are moftly Pagans? Ihis is the place where the
Mufcovite criminals are banifhed to, if they are not
put to death. The next city we came to, was the
:c1pital city of Siberia, called fobolfki, when, ha ving
been almoll: leven months 011 our journey, and winter
drawing on apaee, my partner and I confulted about
our particular affairs, in what manner we {hould dif-
pofe of ourfelves. \Ve had been told of fled gee and
min deer to carry us over the fnow in theg winter
feafon, the fnow beintr frozen fo hard, that the
fledges can run upon the furtace without any danger
of going dow r1. As I was bound to England, I now
beho1ed either to go with the caravan to Jeroilaw,
ftom thence wefl to Nana, and the Gulf of Finland,
and fo by land or {ea to Denmark; or elfe Imult
leate the carav .n at a little town on the Dwina, and
ft) to Archangel, where l was certain of fhipping
either to Englan 1], Holland, or Hamburgh. One
night I happened to g at into the company of an il-
luflrious but bani {hed prince, 11 nofe company and
virtues were fuch as made me propofe to him a me-
thod how he might obtain his liberty. My dear
friend, (faid h c) a: I 'am [we happily free'fi'om'my

eitian, avarice, and luxury,- if I flwu/a' efi'ape from 1171':

fuement, fir I am baffle/Zr, a mere man, wit pafliam
and aflfl'iom a: flab: 0 be not myfi'imd and tempter
too! Struck dumb with furprife, I ttood filent'a while,
nor was he in lefs diforder ; by which perceiving he
' wanted to give vent to his mind, I defired him to con-
fider of it, and fo withdrew. But about two hours
after he came to my apartment: Dear fiiend, (faid
he) tbaagb I cannot calf/feat to accompany yea, I flux/l barre
tbirflztfifaflion in parting: t/Jat you leave me an bang/i
man flill; [mt a: a tg/Iimony of my afi'flian to you, be
plea/9d to accept flu} prefiwt 974121". - _'

In return for this c0mpliment, I [cut my fervant
next morning to his Lordfhip, with 'a {mall prefent
of tea, two pieces of China damalk, and four little
wedges of gold -, but he only accepted the tea, one
piece of damalk, and a piece of gold, for the curiofity
of the Japan {lamp that was upon it. Not long after,
he [cut for me, and told me, that what he had re-
fufed himfelf, he heped upon his account I would
grant to another, whom he ihould name; in lhort; it
was his only fon, who was about 200 miles diltance
from him, on the other fide of the Oby, whom he
laid he would fend for, if I gave my confent. This
I foon complied with; upon which he fent his fer-
vants next day for his fon, who returned in twenty
days time, bringing {even horfes loaded with valuable
furs. At night the young lord was conducted in-
cognito into our apartment, where his father prel'ent-
ed him to me. We then concerted the belt ways
for travelling, and after having bought a confiderable
quantity of fables, black fox (kins, fine ermines,
Sec. (whichl fold at Archangel at a good price), we
fet out from this city the beginning of June, makinc

;

a {mall caravan, being about thirty~two horfes an
camels, of which I reprefented the head. My young
lord had with him a very faithful Siberian fervant,
well acquainted with the roads. We. {hunned the
principal towns and cities, as Tumcn, Soli Kamtdkoi,
and feveral otlers, by real'ou of their firie'tnefs in
examining travellers, leil: any of the banilhed perfons
of diitinetion fliould efcape. Having pzifi'ed the ri-
ver Kama, we came to a city on the European tide,
called Soloy Kamolkoi, where we found the peeple
moltly Pagans as before. We then pali'ed a defer:
of about two hundred miles over, but in other
places it is near {even hundred. In pulling this wild
place, we were befet by a troop of men on horfe-
back, and about five-and-forty men armed with bows
and arrows. At firlt they looked earnellly on us,
and then placed thcmfelves in our way. We were
above fixteen men, and drew up a little line before
our camels. My young lord fent out his Siberian
fervant to know who they were; but when he ap-
proached them, he neither knew a word they faid,
nor would they admit him to come near them at his
peril, but prepared to {hoot him. At his return he
told us he believed them to be Calmuc Tartars, and
that he thought there were more of them upon the
detert. This was but a {mall comfort to us; yet
{ceing a little grove about a quarter of a mile's di-
ilanee, we moved to it, by the old Portuguefe pilot's
advice, without meeting with any oppofition. Here
we found a marfhy piece of ground, and a fpring of
water running into a little brook on one fide, which
joined another like it a little farther OE, and thefe
two formed the head of the river called 'Writflta.
As foon as we arrived, we went to work, cutting
down great arms off the trees, and laying them hang-
ing (not quite oil') from one tree to another. In this
fituation we waited the motions of the enemy, with-
out perceiving any advancement they made towards
:3. About two hours before night, being joined by,
flame Others, in all about fourfcore horfe, among
whom we fancied were fome women, they came up-
on us with great fury. We fired without ball, call-
ing to them in the Ruffian tongue to know their
bulinefs; but they, either not knowing, or feeming
not to under-Rand us, came diretTtly to the wood-tide,
not confidering that we were fo fortified as that they
could not break in. Our old pilot the Portuguefe,
proved both our captain and engineer, and defired
us not to fire till they came within piftol-ihot; and
when he gave the word of command, then to take
the [melt aim : But he did not bid us give fire, till
they were within two pikes length of us, and then
we killed fourteen of them, wounded feveral, as alfo
their horfes, having every one of us loaded our
pieces with two or three bullets at leaf}. So much
were they furprifed at our undauntednefs, that they
retired about a hundred roods of us. In the mean
while, we loaded our pieces again, and fallying out,
{ccured four or five of their horfes, whofe riders we
found were killed, and perceived them to be Tar-
tars. About an hour after, they made another at-
tempt, to fee where they might break in ; but find.
ing us ready to receive them, they retired.

All that night we wrought hard, in firengthen-
ing our fituation, and barricading the entrances in-
to the woods; but when day-light came, we had a
very unwelcome difcovery; for the enemy being en-
couraged by their afliftance, had fet up eleven or
twelve tents in form of a camp, about three quarters
of a mile from us. I mutt confel's I was never more
concerned in my life, giving myfelf and all that I had
over for loft; and my partner declared, that as the
lofs of his goods would be his ruin, before they {honld
be taken from him, he would fight to the lalt drop
of his blood. As we could not pretend to force our
way, we had recourfe to a l'tratagem ; we kindled a
large fire which burnt all night; and no fooner was

1
it dark, but we purfued our journey towards the
pole, or north flat, and travelling all night, by fix
o'clock in the morning we came to a Rullian village
called Kertza, and from thence came to a large town
named Ozonoys, where we heard that feveral troops
of Calmuc Tartars had been abroad upon the de-
fert, but that we were palt all danger. In five days
after we came to Veuflima, upon the river W'itzedga ;
from thence we came to Lawrenfkoy, on the third of
July, where providing ourfelves with two luggage
boats and a convenient bark, we embarked the fe-
venth, and arrived at Archangel the eighteenth, af-
ter a year 'five months and three days journey, in-
cluding the eight months and odd days at T obollki.
We came from Archangel the twentieth of Augufl:
in the finne year, and arrived at Hamburgh the thir-
tieth of September. Here my partner and I made
a very good {ale of our goods, both thofe of China
and Siberia; when, dividing our efl'eets, my {bare
came to 3475]. 17s. 3d. after all the lofTes we had
fultained, and charges we had been at. llcre the
young lord took his leave of me, in order to go to
the court of Vienna, not only to feel: ptotefiion, but
to correfpond with his father's friends. After we
had fiaid four months in Hamburgh, I went from
thence over land'to the Hague, where, embarking in
the packet,l arrived in London the tenth of January
1 705, after ten years and nine months abfence from,
England.

Chap. I. OP SOLITUDE.

HOWEVER 'folitude is'looked 'upon as a reftraint
to the pleafures of the'world, in company and
converfation, yet it is a happy ftate of exemption
from a feat of trouble, an inundation of vanity and
vexation, of confufion and d'ifap'poi'ntment. While
we enjoy ourfelves, neither the joy nor forrow of
other men afl'eel: us : We are then ,at liberty, with
the voice of our foul, to {peak to God. By this
we Ihun fueh frequent trivial difcourfe, aseven be-
comes an obftruelzion to virtue; and how often do
we find, that we had reafon to wifh we had not been
in company, or faid nothing when we were there?
for either we offend God by the impiety of our dif-
courfe, or lay ourfelves open to the violence of de-
figning people by our unguarded expreflions', 'and fre-
quently feel the coldnefs and treachery of pretended
friends, when once involved in trouble and afii'i&ion;
of fuch unfaithful intirnates (I fllOllld fay enemies)
who rather by falfe inuendos' would accumulate
miferies upon us, than honefily aflift us when fuflr'er-
ing under the hard hand of adverfity. But in a
flare of folitude, when our tongues cannot be heard,
except by the great Majefty of heaven, how happy
are we in the blefl'ed enjoyment of converfing with
our Maker! It is then we make him our friend,
which fets us above the envy and contempt of wick-
ed men. When a man converfes with himfelf, he
is fure that he does 'not converfe with an enemy.
Our rttreat {hould be 'to good company, and good
books. I mean not by folitude, that a'man {hould
"retire 'into a cell, a defert, or a mon'af'tery; which

wOuld be aItOgether an ufclefs and unprofitable re-
a
firaint; for as men are formed for focicty, and have
an abfolute neceflity and dependence "upon- one arm.
ther, {0 there is a retirement of the foul with which
it converfes in heaven, even in the midlt of 'men;
and indeed no man is more fit to {peak freely than
he who can, without any violence to himfelf, refrain
his tongue, or keep .filence altogether. As to religion,
it is by this the foul .gcts acquainted with the hidden
mylleries of the holy writings; here {he finds thofe
floods of tears, inwhich good. men walh themfelves
day and night, and, only makes a vilit to God and his
holy angels. In. this converfation the truelt peace
and molt folid joy are to be found; it is a continual
feal'c of contentment on earth, and the means of at-
taining everlafiing happizicfs in heaven.

Chap. II. Or Homesrv.

HONESTY is a virtue beloved by good men, and
pretended to by all perfons. In this there are feve-
ral degrees; to pay every man his own is the com-
mon law of honelty; but to do good to all mankind is
the Chancery law of homily; and this Chancery-court
is in every man's brealt,where his confcience is 3 lord
chancellor. Hence it is that a mifer, though he
pays every body their own, cannot be an honel't man,
when he does not difeharge the good offices that are
incumbent on a friendly, kind, and generous perfon:
for faith the prephet Ifaiah, chap. xxxii. ver. 7, 8.

[llh'l'a/ thing, and by liberal tbiflgrflmll lxflafid. It is
certainly honelty to do every thing the law requires;
but {hould we throw every poor debtor in prifon till
he has paid the utmofl farthing, hang every malefac-
tor without mercy, exael: the penalty of every bond,
and the forfeiture of every indenture, this would be
downright cruelty, and not honellzy; and it is con-
trary to that general rule, To do to another tbat avoid:
you would have done unto you. Sometimes neccflity
makes an honeli; man a knave; and a rich man an
honeft man, becaufe he has no occalion to be a knave.
The trial of honelty is this : Did you ever want bread,
and had your neighbour's loaf in keeping, and would
fiarve rather than eat it? \Vere you ever arrelied
having in your cul'tody another man's cafh, and would
rather go to jail, than break it? If fo, this indeed
may be reckoned honelty: For king Solomon tells
us, that a good name i: better than {if}, and i: a pre.

Chap. ~III. 0f/ifiring4flifliom.

AFFLICTIONS are common to all mankind ;- and
whether they proceed from lofl'es, difappointments,
or the malice of men, they often bring their ad-
vantages along with them : For this {hows man the
vanity and deceitfulnefs of this life, and is an occa-
lion of rceiil'ying our meafures, and bringing us to
a more modell opinion of ourl'elves: It tells us how
necefl'ary the allil'tance of divine grace is unto us,
when life itfelt' becomes a burden, .md death even
delirable : But when the greatefl. pppiellion Comes
upon us, We mull: have recourl'e to patience, begging
of God to give us that virtue; and the more com-
pofed we are under any trouble, the more commend-
able is our wifdom, and the larger will be our re-
compence. Let the provocation be what it will,
whether from a goodonatured and confeientious, Or
a wicked. perverfe, and vexatious man, all this 'we
{hould take as from the over-ruling hand of God,
as a punifhment for our fins. .Many times. injured
innocence may be abufed by t'alfe oaths. or the power

find it, like the palm, rife the higher the more it

remarkable in puniihing thofe, one way or other,
who delire to endeavour to procure the downfal of
an innocent man : Nor does God fail comforting an
afilieted perfon, who with tears and prayers folicits
the throne of Heaven for deliverance and protee'tion.

afflietions made him eminently remarkable, as par-
ticularly when purfued by King Saul, and hunted as
a partridge over the mountains. But one thing
-which {lands by innocence, is the love of God ; for
were we to fufi'er dif grace, nay, an ignominious death
itfelf, what confolation does our innocence procure
at our lateit conflie't, our lait moments .!

Chap. IV. 0f the Immorality of Conwr/Zztion, and
the vulgar Error: of Behaviour.

As converfation is a great part of human happi-
nefs, {o it is a pleafant light to behold a {weer-
tempered man, who is always fit fof it; to fee an
air of humour and pleafantnefs fit ever upon his
brow, and even fomething angelic in his very coun-
tenance: \Vhereas, if we oblerve a defigning man
we {hall find a mark of involuntary fadnefs break in
upon his joy, and a certain irifurreetion in the foul,
the natural concomitant of profligate principles.

They err very much, who think religion, or a
firie't morality, difcompofes the mind, and renders
it unfit for converfation 5 for it rather infpires us to
innocent mirth, without Inch a counterfeit joy as
vitious men appear with; and indeed wit is as con-
fifizent with religion, as religion is with good man-
ners ; nor is there any thing in the limitation of vir-
tue and reli ion that {hould abate the pleafnres of
this world, at on the contrary, rather ferves to in-

creafe them.110312480X 0.3111501}. 315

On the Other hand, many men, by their own vice
and intemperance, difquilify themfelves for conver-
Cation. Com mutton is immoral, where the difcourfe
is indecent, immodeit, fcandalous, flanderoiis, and
abufive. How great is their folly, and how much
do they expofe iiiemfelves, when they afiidnt their
belt friend, even God himfelf, who laughs at the
fool 'wbm fiiJ'fear tometb .9 _

The great fcandal atheiilical and immoral di'fcourfe
gives to virtue ought, methinks, to be punifhed by
all good. magif'trates . Make a man once ceafe to be-
lieve a god, and he has nothing left to limit his foul.
How incongruous is it to government, that a man
{hall be p1111i1'l1ed for d1unkennefs, and yet have l1-
berty to alfront, and even deny the Majetlzy of hei-
v.e11 When if, even among men, one gives the lie
to a gentleman in comp 11'v, or perhaps {peaks an
ailiont <<01d, a quarrel will enfue, and a comb 1t,
and e111 .ps murder he the confequence: At the
leait, phe will profecute him at law with the utmofl:
virulence and opprcflion.

The next thing to be refrained, is obfcene dif-
courfe, which 15 the language only of proficients in
debaucher y, who never repent but 1n a gaol or hof-

pital ; and whole car'caies relifh no better than their
difcourfe, till the body becomes too naflty for the
foul to {lay any longer 1n it.

Nor is falle talking to be lefs avoided, for lying

word, it is 11111111111; darling fin, and the devil's
diliinguiflzing charaeicr. Some add lies to lies, till
it not bonly comes to be improbable, but even im-
pollible too: Others lie for gain, to deceive, delude,
1nd betray: And a third lies for (port, or for fun.
lhcre are other liars, who are perfonal and mali-

02
cious, who foment differences, and carry tales from
one houfe to another, in order to gratify their own

envious tempers, without any regard to reverence or
truth.

Chap. V. 0f 21': pre'Z-nt flat: 9;" Religion in the

tum-Id.

I DOUBT, indeed, there is much more devotion
than religion in the world, more adoration than fup-
plication, and more hypocrify than fineerity: And
it is very melancholy to confider, what numbers of
people there are furnifhed with the powers of reafon
and gifts of nature, and yet abandoned to the grollizlt
ignorance and depravity. But it would be unchari-
table for us to imagine (as [cute Papitts abounding
with too much ill-nature, the only {caudal to religion,
do) that they will certainly be in the {tare of damna-
tion after this life; for how can we think it con-
fiflent with the mercy and goodnefs of an infinite
Being, to damn thofe crcatures, when he has not
furnilhed them with the lights of his gofpcl ? or how
Can fuch proud, conceited, and cruel bigots, pre-
fcribe rules to the juitiee and mercy of God ?

We are told by fume people, that the great image
which King Nebuchadnezzar fet up to be adored by
his pe0ple, held the reprefentation of the fun in its
right hand, as the principal objeet of adoration.
But to wave this difcourfe of heath-ens, how many
felf-contradieting principles are there held among
Chrifkians! And how do we doom one another to
the devil, while all profile to worfhip the fame Deity,
and do expeet the fa .te falvntlonl

W'hen Iwas at Portugal, there was held at that
'time the court of juftice of the Inquilition. Allthe
criminals were carried in proceflion to the great
.church, where eight of them were habitcd in gowns
and caps of canvas, whereon the torments of hell
were difplayeri, Juii they were condemned and burnt:-
for crimes agnmzt the catholic faith and Blefl'ed Vita.
tn. -- ' -
g 1 am forty to make any refleetion upon Chriliians ;~
but indeed in Italy the Roman religion feems the
Inuit cruel and mercenary upon earth : And avery jug
dicions perfon, who travelled through Italy from Tur-
key, tells us, " That there is only the face and out-
ward pomp of religion there ; that the church pro-
tetls murderers and afihflins, and then delivers the
civil magtltrates over to Satan for doing, jullzice ; im-
terdxt'fts whole kingdoms, and lhnts up the churches
for want of paying a few ecclefialtical dues, and f0
puts a [top to religion for want of their money; that
the court of Inquilition burnt two men for [peaking
dilhonourably of the Blefl'ed Virgin: And the mif-
Gonaries of Lhina tolerated the worlhipping the de-
vil by their new converts : That Italy was the theatre,
where religion was the grand opera ;. and that the
Popilh clergy were no other than the ltage-playcrst"

As to religion in Poland, they. deny Ch'rilt to be
the Melliah, or that the Meili-ah has come in the flelh.
And as to their Protellants, they are the followers
of Laelins Socinus, who denied our Savioar's divi-
nity ; and have no concern about the divine infpira-
tion of the Holy Ghoih .

In Mufcovy their churches are-built of wood, and
indeed they have but: wooden priellzs, though ol? the
Greek church to They pray as much to St. Nicholas,
as Papilts do to the Virgin Mary, for proteetion in
all their difficulties and afiiietions. ~

As to Lutherans, they only difl'er from the R0-
mans in believing confubftantiation, iui'tead of tran-
fubitantiation; but, like them, they are much pleaf-
ed with the external gallantry and pomp, more than
the true and real praclice of it. -

In France I found a world of prielts, the fireets

every where crowded with them, and the churches
0 3
full of women ; but furely never was a nation {0 fu 1'
of blind guides, {o ignorant of religion, and even as
void of morals, as thol'e people who confels their fins
to them.

Does it not feem firange, that while all men own
the. Divine Being, their {hould be {0 many differ-
ent opinions as to the manner of paying him obedi--
ence in the Chrifiian church ? I know not what rea-
fon to aflign for this, except it be their different ca-

pacities and faculties.

And indeed, upon this account, we have perceiv-
'ed in all Chril'tian countries what mortal feuds have
been about religion : What wars and bloodihed have
molelted EurOpe, till the general pacification of the
German troubles at the treaty of Weflphalia; and;
fince thofe times, what perfecution in the fame coun-
try among the churches of the Lutherans: And fhould
I take a profpce't' at home, what unhappy divifions
are between Chrifiians in this'kingdom, about epif-
copacy and prdbytery, the church of England men.
and the diiTenters; Oppoling one another like St. Paul

and St. Peter, even to the face; that is, they carry
on the difpute to the utmol't extremity.

It might be a queflion, why there are fuch diffe-
rences in religious points, and why thefe breaches
{hould be more hot and irreconcilable ? All the an-
fwer I can give to this, is, that we inquire more c011-
cerning the truth of religion than any other nation
in the world ; and the anxious concern we have a--
bout it, makes us jealous of every opinion, and tena-
cious of our own: And this is not becaufe we are

more furious and ralh than other people; but the
truth is, we are more concerned about them, and
being fenfible that the fcripture is the great rule of
faith, the fiandard for life and doCtrine, we have re-
courfe to it ourfelves, without fubmitting to any pre-
tended infallible judge upon earth.

There is another quefiion, pertinent to the for--
mer, and that is, what remedy can we apply to this
malady ? And to this I mutt negatively anfwer, Not
to be lefs reli ious, that we may differ the lefs. This
is [hiking at t 1C very root of all religions differences;
for certainly, were they to be carried on with a peace-
able fpirit, willing to be informed, our variety of o-
pinions would not have the name of dili'erences; nor
ihould we feparate in communion of charity, though
we did not agree in {everal articles of religion.

Nor is there a let's ufeful quellion to fiart, namel ,
where will our unhappy religious differences end ? 0
which, I hope, I may anfwer, in Heaven; there all
unchriltian and unbrotherly differences. will find a
period; there we {hall embrace many a firmer, that
here we think it a dilhonour to converfe with; and
perceive many a heart we have broken here with
cenfures, reproaching, and revilings, made whole a-
gain by the balm of the fame Redeemer's blood Here
we {hall perceive there have been other flocks than
thofe of our fold; that thofe we have excommunicat-
ed, have- been taken into that fuperior communion:
And, in a word, that thofe contradieting notions and
principles, which we thought inconfiitent with true
religion, wefhall then find reconcilable to themfelves,
to one another, and to the fountain of truth. If any
man aik me, why our differences cannot be ended
upon- earth ? I anfwer, were we all thoroughly con-
vinced that then they would be reconciled, we would
put an end to them before ; but this is impofiible to
be done: For as mens certain convictions of truth
are not equal to one another, or to the weight or
fignificancy of fuch veracity ; fo neither can a gene-
ral eti'ee't of this affair be expected on this tide of the
grave. \
Before I conclude this chapter, I {hall beg leave
to difcourfe a little of the wonderful excellency of

negative religion and negative virtue. The latter fets
out like the Pharifee, with, God, I thank thee 33:
. 0'4 '
a piece of religious pageantry, the hypocrite's hope;
and, in a word, it is politive vice; for it is either
a mall: to deceive Others, or a mitt to deceive our-
feivcs. A man that is clothed with negatives thus
argues: I am not Inch 3 drunkard as my landlord,
{uch a thief as my tenant, luch a {wearer as his
neighbour; neither am I a cheat, an atheifl, a In.
ltilh feleow, or a highwayman: No; I live a fober,
reg-.zlxr. retired life : Iam a good man, Igo to church;
God, I thmk thee. Now, though a man l~oalts of
his virtue in contradiction to the vices mentioned,
yr: .: perfcn had l'etter have them altogether than
thy man himfelf', for he is fo full of himfeif, to pet'-
ii. 1?. d that he i: good and religious enough already,
2' . t he has no thoughts of am thing, except it. be to
{all of? his hat t-t God Almighty now and then, and
thank him that he has no OCCtzfiUn for him ; and has
the vanirv to think that his neighbours malt imagine
Well cf him too.

The negative man, though he is no drunkard, is
yet intoxicated with the pride. of his own worth; a
good ntighbour and peace-maker in other families,
but a tyrant in his own; appears in church for a
ihow, but never fails upon his knees in his clofet;
does all his alas before men, to be feen of them;
eager in the duties of the fecond table, but regard-
lcfs of the firlt; appears religious, to be taken no-
tice of by men, but without intercourfe or commu-
nication between God and his own foul. Pray what
is the man? or what comfort is there of the life he
lives? He is infenfible of faith; repentance, and a
Chrifiian mortified life; in a word, he is perfeetly
a {hanger to the efl'ential part of religion.

Let us for a while enter into the private and re-
tired part of his converfation : What notions has he
of his mifpent hours, and of the progrefs of time to
the great centre and gulf of life, eternity? Does he

know to put a right value on time, or efieem the
life-blood of his foul as it really is, and 36': in all
the moments of it as one that mull account- for
them? If then you can form an equality between
what he can do and what he {hall receive, lefs [can
it be founded upon hisrnegative-zvirtue,' or} what-r he
has forborne to do; and if neither his negative not!
politive piety can be equal to the reward, and to the
eternity that reward is to hit for, what then is to
becomeof- the Pharifee, when he is to be judged by-
lincerity. of his repentance, and rewarded, according
to the. infinite grace of God, with a' [late of bleli'ed-
net's to an endlefs eternity ?

When the negative than converfes with: the invi-
liblc world, he is filled with as much'dreajd and hor-
ror as F t'lix, when St. Paul reafoned to him of tem-
perance, righteoul'nefs, and of judgment to. come;
for Felix, though a great philofbphe-r, of great power
anti reverence, was a negative man; and he was
made fenfihle by the Apoltle, that as a life of virtue
and temperance was its own reward, by_ giving a
healthy body, a clear head, and a compofed life, fo
eternal happinefs mull: proceed:- from another .fpring,
namely, the infinite unbounded: grace Of. a provoked
God, who, having erected a righteous tribunal, Jelus
Chrill: would feparate fuch as by faith and repent-
ance he had brought home and united to himfelf. by
the grace of adoption, and on the-foot of hishavingl
laid down his life as a ranfom for them, had ap.
pointed them to falvation, when all the philofophy,
temperance, and righteoufnefs in the world befides
had been ineffectual. And this, I fay, it Was that
made Felix, this negative man, tremble. ~;. . , . .

Chap. VI. 0f {wetting to {be voice of Providence; '

THE magnificent and wife King Solomon-bids us
cry after" knowledge, and lift up our voice for-lander.
(landing; by which is meant religious knowledge,
for it follows, Tim: flmlt t/mc underfland the fiar of
tbe Lord, and find tbe knowledge of God. By which"
undoubtedly he meant, to inquire after every thing
that he has permitted us to know, and not to fearch
into thofe ways that are unfearehable, and are efi'ec--
tually locked up fromour knowledge. Now, a: 197m-
ing to tbe voice 0 Providence is my prefent fubjeei, I
intend, in the rlt place, to write to thofe who own,
I. That there is a God, a firl't great moving caufe
of all things, an eternal power, prior, and confe-
quently fuperior to all created power or being. 2.
That this eternal power, which is God, is the fo-
vereign creator and governor of heaven: and earth.
To avoid all needlefs diflinaions, what perfons
in the Godhead exercife the creating, and what the
governing power, I offer that glorious text, Pfal.
xxxiii. 6. where the whole Trinity is entitled to the
whole creating work ; and therefore, in. the next
place, I lhall lay down thefe two propofitions:.

I. Tim! t/ze- eternal ' God guide: by bit providence t6e

wise/e univer/e, which was created by H: power.

H. 772a: 1171': providence manife : a particular care
over, and concern in tlwe governing and. direfling
man, tbe mo/l noble creature upon earth.

It is plain, that natural religion proves the firfi,
by intimating the necefiity of a Providence guiding
and governing the world, from the confequence of
the wifdom, juflice, prefcience, and goodnefs of the
Almighty Creator: For otherwife it would be ab-
furd to think, that God fhould create a world, with-
out any care or providence over it, in guiding the
operations of nature, fo as to preferve the order of
his creation.

Revealed reli ion gives us a light into the care
and concern 0 his Providence, by the climate's
being made habitable, the creatures fubjeeted and
made nourilhing, and all vegetative life medicinal;aomnson armor; _ 32 3

and all this for the fake of man, who is made vice-
roy to the King of the earth. The {hortl defeription
I {hall give of Providence is this : That it is that ope-
ration of the power, of the wifdom, jufiice, and
goodnefs of God, by which he influences, governs,
and direeis, not only. the means, but the events of
all things which concern. us in. this fublunary world;
the fovereignty of which we might always to reve-
rence, obey its motions, obferve its dietates, and lif-
teu to its voice. The prudent man forefeeth the
evil, and hideth himfelf 3 that is, as I take it, there
is a fecret Providence intimates to us that fame dan-

ger threatens, if we {trive not to {bun it.

The fame day that Sir John Hot-harn- lrept out
Hull againii the royal martyr King Charles I. the
fame day Sir John Hotham was put to death by the
parliament for that very aeiion; the fame day that
the king himfelf figned the warrant for the execu-
tion of the Earl of Stafi'ord, the fame day of the
month was he barbaroufly murdered by the blood-
thirfty Oliverian crew; and the fame day that King
James II. came to the crown againft the bill of
exclufion, the fame day he was voted abdicated by
the parliament, and the throne filled with King
William and (keen Mary.

The voice of fignal deliverance from fudden dan-
gers is not only a jufi call to. repentance, but a can-
tion againft falling into the like danger; but fuch
who are utterly carelefs of themfelves after, {how a
lethargy of the WOW: nature, which feems to me to
be a kind of praetical atheifrn, or at leafl: a living in
a contempt of, Heaven, when he receives good at the
hand of his Maker, but is unconcerned from whence
it comes, or to thank the bountiful hand that gave
it; neither when he receives evil, does it alter his,
manner of life,or bring him toany fiate of humiliation.

We have a remarkable fiery. of two foldiers being
condemned to death in Flanders. The general be-
ing prevailed upon to {pare one of them, ordexed
them to call dice upon the drum-head for their lives;
the firi't having thrown two fixes, the feeond 'el; 21
wringing his hands, having {0 poor a chuce to
efcape; however, having thrown, he was Iurprited
when he alfo threw other two fixes. The officer ap-
pointed to fee the execution ordered them to throw
again ; they aled fo, and each of them threw two
fives : At which the foldiers that ftood round, fhonted
and faid neither of them was to die. Upon this the
officer acqutirted the council of war, who ordered
them to throw a third time, wh:n they threw two
fvurs; the general being made acquainted with it,
fa; for the men, and pardoned them: I love, fays
he, in fnch extraordinary cafes, to litter: to the voice
of Providence.

"We read in the holy writings, how God {peaks
to men, by appearance of angels, or by dreams and
vilions of the night. As God appeared to Abraham,
'Lot, and Jacob; fo angels have appeared to many
in other cafes, as to Manoah and his wife, Zacha-
riah, the Virgin Mary, and to the Apofiles; others
have been warned in a dream, as king Abimelech,
the falfe pmphet Balaam', and manyothers.

It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, what
we {hall be after this life ? for there is fcarce-a doubt,
that there is a place referved for the reception of our
fouls after death : For'if we are to be, we mull have
a where, which the fcriptures afl'ert by the examples
of Dives and Lazarus. The dofirine of fpirits was
long believed before our Saviour's time; for when
the difciples of the blefi'ed Jefus perceived our Savi-
our walking on the (ca, they were much furptifed,
as though they had feen a fpirit. Nay, in thofe ages
of the world, it was believed that fpirits intermeddled
in the affairs of mankind; and throughout the Old
Tef'tament I do not find any thing that in the leall:
contradicts it. All the pains and labour that fome
learned men have taken, to confute the fiory of the
witch of Endor, and the appearance of an old man
perfonating Samuel, cannot make fuch apparitions
ineonfilient with nature or religion : And _it is plain
that it was either a good or a bad fpitit that prophe-
tically told the unfortunate king what, flhould hapg
pen the next day ; for, {aid the fpirit, 3172: Lord will
deliver {bee into tbe band of tbe Pbilgfline: ,- and to.
marrow/bait tbou and tbyfom be witb me.

Abundance of ltrange notions pofi'efl'ed me when
I was in the defolate ifland, efpecially on a moon-
flrine night, when every bulh feemed a man, and
every tree a man on horfeback; When. I crept in--
to the difmal cave, where the old goat .lay expiring,
whofe articulate groans even refembled thofe of a
man, how was I furprifed ! my blood chilled in my
veins, :1 cold {weary dew {at on my forehead, my
hair flood upright, and my joints, like Belfhazzar's
knees, {truck againft one another: And indeed,
though I afterwards found what it was, the remains
of this futpril'e did not wear of? for a great while;
and I had frequent returns of thofe vapours on dif-
ferent occafions, and fometimes without any occa-
fion at all.

One night, after having feen fome appearance in
the air, as I had jul't lain down in my bed, one of
my feet pained me; after that came a numbnefs,
fuccceded with a tinkling in my blood; when on a
{udden I thought fomething alive lay upon me, from
my knee to above half my leg. Upon this I flung
myfelf out of the bed where I thought the creature
lay; but finding nothing, Lard deliver me flom ,an
wilflirir! (laid I) liwbat can this be .9 When I light-
ed a candle, I could perceive no living creature in
the place with me but the poor parrot, who being
frightened, cried out, Hold your tongue! and, -Wbat'.~r '
the matter with you .9 which words I taught him, by
laying fo to him, when he made fuch fereaming
noifes as I did not like. Lard! (faid I aloud) fare/y
zbeodem'l I>>: been ~here. Hold your tongue (fays Poll.)
I was then mad at the bird, and putting on my
clothes, cried, I am terribly frightened. W bat'r the
matter will: you .9 (fays Poll.) You toad, (laid I) I'll
knock your brains out. Hold your tongue, (cried he
again) and {o fell a-chattering, and calling Robinfon
Crufoe, as he did before. But after I had compofed
myl'elf, and went to bed again, I began plainly to
fee it was a dil'temper that affefied my nerves, and
fo my terrors vanilhed at once.

How intelligences are given or received we do
not know; nor are we fenfible how they are con--
veyed from fpirits unemhodied to ours that are in
life, or on the contrary from us to them : The latter
certainly is done without the help of the organsrand
the former is conveyed by the underf'tanding and the

retired faculties of the foul. -
The fpirits, without the help of voices, converfe;

and the more particular difcoveries of the converfe
of fpirits feem to me as follow, to wit, dreams,
voices, noifes, impulfes, hints, apprehenfions, invo-
luntary fadnefs, Scc.

Dreams of old were the ways by which God him-
felf was pleafed to warn men what fervices to per-
form, and what to fhun. Jofeph was directed of
God in a dream to go into Egypt; and fo were the
wife men warned in a dream to depart into their own
country another way, to avoid the fury of Herod.

I was once prefent at a difpute between a layman
and a clergyman upon the fubjeet of" dreams. The
firii: thought no regard {hould be given unto them;
that their communication from the invifible to the
vilible world was a mere chimera, without any folid
foundation; for, t. (faid he) If dreams were from
the agency of any prefcient being, the motives would
be more direet, and the difcoveries more plain, and
not by allegories and emblematic fancies, exprelling
things imperfect and obfcure. 2. Since, with the no-
tice of evil, there was not a power given to avoid it,
his not likely to proceed from a fpirit, but merely
fortuitous. 3. That the inconftancy of fuch notices,
in cafes equally important, <<proves they did; not pro.
'ceed from an .{uch agent. 4. -That as our molt dill,
tinet dreams ad nothing in them of any .li'gnificancy,
it would be irrational arid vain to think that they>>;
came from heaven. And, 5. That as men were not
always thus warned or fupplied with notice of good
or evil, ('0 all men are not alike in plied with them ;
and what reafon could we give, w y one man or one
woman {hould not have the fame hints as another.
To all this the clergyman gave anfwer 5' 1.,That

as to the fignification of drear'ns, and the objections
againit them as being dark and doubtful, they are
exprefled generally by hieroglyphical reprefentations,
fimilies, allufions, and figurative emblematic ways,
by which means, for want of interpretation, the
thing was not underflood, and confeqnently the evil
not {hunned. 2. That we charge God foolilhly, to .
fay, that he has given the [notice of; evil, without the
'power to avoid it 3 for if any one had not pewer to
avoid the evil, it was no notice to him ; audit was
want of giving due head to that notice, that firftmen
neglee'ted themfelves, and then charged the Judge of
all the earth with injui'tice. 3. That werpught not
to find fault with the inconfiancy of vthefe-notices,
but rather with our weak underl'tandings, by pretend.
ing dreams were not to be regarded, and negligent
when the voice really {poke to us forour: good. It
is'a' miftake to fay dreams have no~ importat all:
Wernight with more reafon have laid, none that we
could perceive the reafgn of, owing to. our blindnefs
and'fnpine negligence, too {come at onetime, and 100,
much alarmed'at another; 'fotthat the. fpirit, which
we might be'faid to beizconver'ling' with in; aidr'eam',

that were given. And, 5. To anfwer the la& que-
fiion, why people are not equally fupplied? This
feemed to be no queltion, for Providence itfelf mi ht
have fome {hate in the direetion of it, 'and then fiat
providence might be limited by a fu'pei'ior direEtion:
That as to the converfe of fpirits, he could not call
- it a l'tated convetfe; fuch a thing there Was, but why
there was ['0 much of it, and no more, was none of
his bufinefs, and that no fuch difcovery had ever
yet been made to mankind. Nor were we to ima-
gine lefs of waking dreams, trances, vilions, noifes,
hints, impulfes, and all the waking teflimonie's' of
an invilible world, and of the communicatiOn that
there is between us and them, which commonly en-
tertain us with our eyes open.

A gentleman. of my acquaintance being about {e-
ven miles diltant from London, a friend that came
to dine with him, {elicited him to go to the city.
What, (faid the entleman) is there any occafion for
me ? No, Sir, ( aid the other) nothing at all, except
the enjoyment of your good company ; and {0 gave

they all'faid, it waseimpofllhle thatpgnyjthingjmuld

both [ides to do the like. Thus far they did well :
But had {he obeyed the hint which prefl'ed upon her
firangely, not to go to bed, {he had done much bet-
ter; for the fire was aftually kindled at that very
time, though not broken out. About an hour after '
the whole family was in bed, the houf: jult over the
way, direetly Oppofite, was all in flames, and the
wind, which was very high, blowing the flame upon
the houfe this gentlewoman lived in, fo filled it with
fmoke and fire, in a few minutes, the flreet being
narrow, that they had not air to breathe, or time
to do any thing but jump out of. their beds, and fave
their lives. Had {he obeyed the hint given, and not
gone to bed {he might have faved feveral things; but
the few moments {he had {pared to her, were but jufi
fulficient to leap out of bed, put lbme clothes on, and
get down fiairs, for the h'oufe was on fire in half a
quarter of an hour.
I remember about 14 or 15 years ago (as to time
I cannot be very pofitive) there was a young clergy-'-
man in the city of Dublin in Ireland, who dreamed
* a very uncommon dream, That a gentleman had
killed his wife, a relation of his, by ltabbing her in fee-
veral places; the fright of this awaked him, but find.-
ing it a dream, he compofed himfelf again to fleep,
when he dreamed a fecond time the fame dream.
This made him a little uneafy; but thinking it pro-
ceeded from the impreflion made on his mind by
.the former, he went to fleep again and dreamed the
fame dream a third time alfo. So troubled was he
.at this, that he arofe, and knocked at his mother's
chamber, told his concern, and his apprehenlions
that all was not right at his relation's houfe. Dear
fon, fays the good old gentlewoman, do not mind
thefe foolifh dreams: And I very much wonder, that
you, being a perfon in holy orders, {hould have re- .
,gard to fuch illufions. Upon this he went to bed
again, fell fleep, and dreamed a fourth time asbefore.
And then indeed he put on his night-gown, and went
to Smithfield, the place where his relation dwelt.
Here it was, alas! be perceived his dream too fadly
fulfilled, by feeing his relation, the young lady, big
with child, who was a Proteflant, {tabbed in {even
places, by her barbarous hnfband Mr. Eufiace, a vio-
lent Papift, only for fome difcourfes of religion that
happened the day before. After the wretch had
{tabbed her in three places, he .went to make his e-
cape out at a window 5 but {he cried out, My dear!
don't leave me, come back, and I flmll be, well again.
At which he returned in a hellifh ta 6, and gave '
her four wounds more, when even in t is condition
.riiing from her bed, [be wrapped herfelf in her night-
gown, and went to the Lord Biihop of Rapho's cham-
ber-door, (the Bilhop lodging at that" time in the
houfe). [My Lord, (faid the) 0 my Lord, ,male lag/I:
unto me,- but as foon as his Lordfhip came, {he ex-
pired in his arms, refigning her precious foul into
the hands (if Almighty God. The cruel wretch her
hufband was {hot by the purfuers; too good a death
for one who deferved the gibbet ; and the lady was
univerfally lamented by all tender and religious peo-
ple. And this tragical relation Ihave memioned
upon the account of that impulfe or dream that the
clergyman had at the fatal time of the bloody aetiotl.

It might be expeeted I {hould enter upon the
fubjeet of apparitions, and difcourfe concerning the
reality of them, and whether they can revilit the
place of their former exifience, and refurne thofe
faculties of fpeech and fhape as they had' when living;
but, as thefe are very doubtful matters, I {hall only
make a few obl'ervations upon them.

-I- once heard of a man that would allow the reali-
ty of apparitions, but" laid'it all upon the devil, think-
ing that the fouls of men departed, or good men,
did never appear. To this very man fomething-'did
appear: He faid, he {aw the thape of an; ancient

he confulted feveral friends,who advifed. him to take
the advice. But after all, it was not an apparition, but-
a grave and pious gentleman, who met him by mere:
accident, and had been fenli'ole of his-wickednef33;
and who never undeceived him, left it fhould hinder
his reformation.

Some pe0ple make avery ill ufe of the general no-
tion, that there are no apparitions nor fpirits at all 5
which is worfe than thofe who fancy they lee them
upon every occafion; for thofe carry their notions.

thing about him; neither of one kind or- Other: The
next flep they come to is, to conclude 375317: 2': no
God, and fo atheifm takes its rife in the fame limit
with a carelefliiefs about futurity. But there is no
occafion to enter upon an argument to prove the be-
ing of the Almighty, or to illufirate his power by
words,who has fo many undeniable teiiimonies in the.>>
breafis of every rational being to prove his exii'tence;
and we have fullicient proofs, enough to convince
us of the great fupcrintendency of divine Providence
in the minutefi affairs of this world -,,the manifefi.
exil'tence of the invifible world; the reality of {pi-
rits,and intelligence between us and them. What-
I. have faid, I'hope, will not miflead any perfon, or
