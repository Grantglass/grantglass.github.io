CHAPTER I.

THE CITY--GUILDHALL--MANSIOX HOUSE--ROYAL EXCHANGE--BANK.

AM a citizen of no mean eity.' So said St. Paul, when the
rabble of Jerusalem were following him with the cry, 'Away
with him,' and he thought it best to put the chief captain right
as to his standing and position in life. And the young people
V who live in this great London of ours may well adopt the
apostle's phrase and say, ' We are citizens of no mean city.'
Certainly the London of to-day is not acity to be ashamed of. It ie,
I believe, by fan- the largest and most populous city in the world. Its trade.
and connnercc put into the shade all the other busy hires of men. Many are

its sights, and many the buildings which claim a pilgrimage on account of
their antiquity or their historical associations; and as the years pass on,
London, instead of falling into deeayand mouldy unsightliness, casts off her
dingier and dirtier streets and alleys, and arrays herself in a fresher and
cleaner dress; so that she bids fair to take her place amongst the brightest
and handsomest of all large cities.

Let us take our walks abroad and look at a few of the ;notable features of
the great city. And first we will make our way along the busy streets to the
very centre of it. We must be careful how we cross the streets, with their
lines of onmibuses and cabs and carts and vans. Happily there is a good
strong policeman stationed here and there, at the worst crossings, who will
kindly giro as his help, if we need it, to traverse these bewildering streams of
life and motion. When we reach the side we want, we must be careful to
keep our eyes well in front, and not to screw our heads round every few
moments to gaze at some attraction in a window we have just passed, or we
shall be brought back to our senses by an awkward bumping from the shoulders
or elbows of some bustling clerk or merchant who is rushing along at full
walking speed, and who expects every one to be as sharp of sight and quick
of movement as he himself is. So, voyagiug carefully along Cheapside, in
the very heart of busy London, we arrive at

G UILDHALL.

As we go down King Street, the venerable Hall faces us, with its open yard
in front, and its throng of sleek and knowing pigeons, amongst which, as they
busily feed, we must carefully pick our way. Though the building itself is
of great antiquity, the front is comparatively modern, tracing its birth back
only to the earlier half of the last century, while the body to which it is the
stony face had its first birthday about 4-70 years ago. The modern face has a
peculiar appearance, which is not easily forgotten. It might almost be compared
to a piece of petrified gingerbread; its Gothic composition presenting an
odd mixture of church and castle styles of architecture; while at the top
the City arms are prominent--two gritfins watching over the shield, which is
surmounted by the ' cap of maintenance,' and has below it the ulotto, Domino,
(Iii-{ye nos, ' Lord, direct us.'

As we enter the fine old porch, we notice its arch within arch, its
panelled walls, the pillars on the stone seat, and the gilt bosses with which the-. Ham Entrance by lilocuiu Light. 3. Banqueting Hail. 4. Libmry. 5. CUP!-
arches are profusely studded. From this we emerge into the grand banqueting
hall. This is the place in which the new Lord Mayor, each 9th of November,
presides over the feasting of a thousand guests or more, amid a blaze of
light and a brilliant display of dress and ornament. We may imagine the
buzz of a thousand tongues, on such an occasion, in the intervals of feasting
and speechifying. But now the grand old hall has a dill'erent influence upon
the mind. Its sounds are few and subdued; its light is of the 'dim religions'
kind which we associate with the aisles of an ancient cathedral or abbey; and
the sudden transition from the bustle of Cheapside into its scmi-darlmess is
at first a little depressing. However, we gaze around and find plenty to
interest and delight as. The glorious mass of colour in the large windows, the
arched roof of oak, and the two giants, Gog and )Iagog, keeping watch and
ward, will bear looking at again and again; while the monuments to the
great Chatham, and his son, William Pitt, to Nelson, \Vellington, and other
worthies, serve to stimulate us to high purpose and steady action. At. the
western end we find a memorial window to Prince Albert, and a clock--which
warns us to pass on to other sights.

This old hall has witnessed many a stirring scene since its first erection.
Here, in 151-6, the noble-minded Anne Askew was tried and condemned for so--
'ealled 'heresy.' And here, a few years later, in Mary's reign of bloodshed,
Sir Nicholas 'l'hrockmorton was tried for high treason, and by his wonderful
eloquence and courageous spirit so influenced the jury that they were bold
enough to pronounce him 'not guilty,' and for this daring act were themselves
punished with imprisonment and heavy fines. At the time of parliamentary
elections, Guildhall has heard many a loud harangue, and many speeches have
been rendered inaudible by the hubbub amongst the crowd, that might have
listened, but would not.

Going up a flight of stairs, we come to the room known as the Com-t of
Aldermen, where those gentlemen hold their meetings and transact much
business of importance. The ceiling of this room is divided into compartments,
some of which have been ornamented with paintings from the brush of Sir
James Thornhill; while its cornice consists of the carved and painted arms of
all the mayors since 1780. Near this is the Council Chamber, in which we
shall find some good historical paintings and sculpture.

The crypt or vault under Guildhall is a fine example of old architecture,
with its clustered pillars and grained arches; and now, having had a geod
brush up and clearance from the dust and rubbish with which it long was
choked, it serves a useful purpose as the armoury of the London Rifle Volunteer
Brigade. At the eastern side of Guildhall we find the Library--a nice light room,
fitted up with handsome oak bookcases, which contain many thousand volumes.
Here we can sit down and improve our minds by reading, without having to
pay a penny to anybody; and this is a great boon for those who have neither
books to read, nor a quiet corner at home to read them in: but, for our part,
we much prefer reading at home. Why, books have twice the charm at home,
and yield as twice the enjoyment there, that they would at any less favoured place.

Beneath the Library is the City Museum, which contains many interesting
relics of old London, and where we may see coins, and shells, and horns, and
glass, and red Roman pottery, which have been discovered in making various
excavations.

Now we must refer our readers to the picture, in which our artist has
skilfully presented Guildhall by day and by night, inside and outside, with its two
burly guardians, and the feathered favourites that throng its yard and make
themselves at home on roof and facade.

So, farewell, ye peaceful pigeons ; farewell, Gog and Magog, best-behaved
of giants. We leave your quiet quarters, and mix once more in the bustle of
Cheapside, and resign ourselves to be hustled along eastward, till we arrive at
that large opening which our continental friends would dub with the name of
Place or Plats, Piazza or Plaza, as being a fine space for a neat review or a small
revolution, but which to the bewildered eyes of our country cousins presents a .'
of people and cabs and 'bussesand carts, which it is hopeless to attempt to cross.

On our right hand is the )vasiox llotsrz,the otlieial residence ofthe Lord
Mayor. Facing us is the Horn. l-lxcnaxcE,1he headquarters for our mer-
chants and shipper'. On our left. is that gloomy-looking building, the BASH
0r Esau-mo, resembling the gold, of which it contains such store, in being

' Hard and dull and heavy and cold.'
At least so the poet calls that precious metal: perhaps he had not set eyes on
it for some time. To most of us it has a bright, cheerful look when coined into
sovereigns, however 'dull' it may look in its native uneleaused state.

The Maxslox HOUSE, as you see, has six large columns in front, and its
pedunent--thc triangular piece which surmounts the columns--is ornamented6 T 1112' zlL-INSI 0.1V H 0 (/55.

with a group of figures. It contains a large number of rooms, some of which
are used as domestic apartments, whilst others are grand state rooms, in which
the Lord Mayor's many friends and visitors are received and hospitably enter-
tained. The chief room, called 'thc Egyptian Hall,' is chiefly devoted to the
eutertaimuent of strangers and friends, and will seat 400 guests. It is a large
and lofty hall, and has on each side a range of grand pillars with gilded capitals;
and, with its panelled roof and brilliant chandeliers, it furnishes a fitting frame
for .the statesmen and orators and civic grandces who sit down to banquets,
which include, we trust, not only the best of cheer, but
' The feast of reason and the flow of soul,'

while his lordship presides over the gathering from his throne at the head of the
table. It is also sometimes used for public meetings with charitable objects;
and one of the Lord Mayor's numerous duties during his busy year of office is
to promote the relief of all who are sufi'ering from sudden calamities, and to open
special funds for that purpose. Now he is the almoner for the famine-stricken
people of Ireland or of the East Indies; then come sad tidings of a great eolliery
explosion, and money has to be gathered to feed the poor widows and orphans
of the men who are killed. Then follow floods in Hungary, earthquakes in
South Italy, hurricanes in Jamaica; and all these calls find his lordship ready
to give time and money and influence to help the unfortunate, whether their
skin be black, brown, or white, and without asking- them whether they love us
Englishmen or not. .

The Mansion House is comparatively a modern institution. '1 he building
was completed in 1753. Previously to that time the citizens, while requiring
their Mayor to keep up a princely court, and to have a sword-bearer, sergeant-
at--arms, sergeant carver, sergeants ot' the chamber, esquircs, bailifl's, and
' young men,' had expected him to find his own lodgings ; and so his lordship
had to cram all his grandeur into his own private house, or to borrow the hall
of the Company to which he might belong. But at length this omission was
repaired, and now the Lord Mayor resides, during his year of office, at this
palace in the heart of the city he governs; is surrounded at every turn by its
handsome fittings; and has to bring into play, on special occasions, its splendid
service of plate, valued at more than PS20,000. Of course, with his large
retinue, and with the many banquets which he is expected to give, his expenses
are very heavy; but towards these he is allowed PS10,000, and generally
spends beyond this two or three thousand pounds out of his own pocket.huge.

Royal Ext8 T 1115 R 01".4L EXCHANGE.

We will pass on, as well as we can, to the Horn. Excuaxoa. There it,
is, facing us, its fine portico showing up well by reason of the ample space in
front of it. On the pediment above the eight pillars is a group of sculpture,
consisting of eleven allegorical figures. In the centre of the group we find
Commerce leaning against the prow of a ship, with a cornucopia and a beehive
at her side--emblems of plenty and industry; while, on her right and left,
English merchants are talking and bargaining with foreign traders. Under-
neath runs the beautiful motto which the Prince Consort chose from the
Bible: ' The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.'

Let us run up the broad flight of steps, and, turning our backs for a minute
on the Royal Exchange, let us gaze on the remarkable scene in front. A
wide stretch of pavement lies before us, and near the edge of this is a statue
of the Duke of Wellington,cast from the metal of guns taken from the French
in those old fighting days when the Duke was in his prime; while around
its base several poor women are sitting, engaged in the peaceful occupation of'
arranging flowers into little bunches for gentlemen's buttonholes. And beyond
this is the great panorama of human heads, and 'busses, and cabs, aml vehicles
of all sorts, moving--always moving, likea swarm of busy bees in a glass hive,
or like a stream of active ants, intent on their small but very particular
business. It is a living picture which, once seen, will not soon be forgotten.
The spectator becomes fascinated in tracking the hardy voyager as he travels
from shore to shore of this perilous ocean; but, while he listens to the noise
and buzz, the words of Sir Richard Steele, hearkening from an elevated position
to a similar hubbub more than a century and a half ago, may occur to his
mind : ' What nonsense is all the hurry of this world [0 those who are above it ! '

When we step into the Exchange, passing through the portico and
vestibule, we find a large open court, with a marble statue of the Queen, by
Lough, in the centre. This court is surrounded by an ambulatory, or walk,
formed by arcades; but the centre, round the statue, is the chief spot on
which the merchants throng at the time of 'high 'change,' that is, between
three and four o'clock. Now is the time and here is the place to conclude
a bargain which shall bring a few thousand pounds into your pocket, or, on
the other hand, take just as much out of your pocket, supposing it to be there
already.

The first stone of the Royal Exchange was laid by Prince Albert on
January 17th, 1812; aml the building was opened by the Queen in state onTHE ROYAL EXCHANGE. 9.

October 28th, 1814. Let us hope that it may not share the fate of its pre-
decessors, both of which were destroyed by fire.

The first Exchange was due to the public spirit of Sir Thomas Gresham,
who, having seen the advantages which the merchants of Antwerp enjoyed
in having a magnificent Bom'sc in which to conduct their business, resolved
to provide alike building for the convenience of his fellow-citizens. Previously
the merchants and traders, as old Stow tells us, had had to transact their
business in the open street, meeting usually twice every day, at noon and in
the evenin". 'But these meetings were unpleasant and troublesome, by
reas .1 of walking and talking in an open narrow street . . . being there eon-
strained either to endure all extremes of weather, 1:13., heat and cold, snow
and rain ; or else to shelter themselves in shops.' Gresham offered to erect a.
Bourse, or Exchange, if the citizens provided the site. The generous other was
accepted; a spot in Cornhill and the neighbourhood was chosen, bought, and
cleared; the foundation stone was laid June 7th, 1566, and the building was
completed in November, 1567. It consisted of two portions, an upper and
alower; the upper portion beiuglaid out in shops to thenumber of one hundred,
the lower in walks and rooms for the merchants, with a. rim of shops outside.
For two or three years the shops remained almost empty, to the great dis-
appointment of the founder, who had expected a fine revenue from that
source. But Sir Thomas was not the man to let a noble undertaking die out
for want of pluck and perseverance. Having ar'angcd with some shop-
keepers to occupy and light up as many shops as they could, on condition of
having them rent-free that year, he entertained the Queen--the active and
popular Elizabeth--at dinner at his house in Bishopsgate Street--yes, in
plebeian Bishopsgate Street l--and after dimlercomhleted her majesty through
Coruhill to his ' Bnrse,' which was gaily set out with 'all sorts of the finest
wares in the City.' Queen Bess was so delighted with what she saw, that
she christened the 'Burse' with a new name, and by herald and trumpet
proclaimed it The Royal Exchange, 'so to be called from thenccforth, and not
otherwise.'

This building was made good use of by the merchants and traders of
those days, and became a favourite place of promenade for the citizens on
Sundays and holidays. It was scarcely a hundred years old when it was
destroyed in the Great Fire of London.

It was in September, 1666, that the flmnes of that conflagratiou brolac into THE BANK OF ENGLAND.

upon Cornhill, and, quickly seizing the 'trains of wood' which had been pulled
down from the houses to prevent the fire spreading, and had been carelessly
left in the middle of the street, rushed along with a dreadful roar, consumed
the fine old buildings on each side, and fastened with fury on the Royal
Exchange. Down came most of the noble building which Gresham had founded
with so much care and pains; but while the statues of the kings fell forward on
their faces, his statue alone remained erect.

A second Exchange was built on the site of the old one, which it greatly
resembled, but was larger and more magnificent. It was opened in September,
1669, and lasted till January 10th, 1838, when it also was burnt down. The
tire began about half-past ten o'clock on a bitterly cold night; and at twelve the
flames were leaping round the clock-tower, which contained a peal of bells that
played set tunes at, every third hour. So now from the midst of the fire came
ringing out, to the astonishment of the immense crowd, the old familiar tulle,
' There's nae luck aboot the hoose ; ' and as the shrill silvery-tones floated out
on the midnight air, the bells, one by one, fell clashing and clanging into the
burning mass below.

But we must turn our backs upon the Exchange and look at that sombre
building on our right hand. It is the Bash" or Exemxn, the greatest bank in
the world. The original building was first opened for business on June 5th,
173%. Since that date, large additions have been made to it, some parts ot'it
have been rebuilt, and it now covers an irregular space of four acres. The
design of the present building, which we do not. admire, is due to Sir John
Soaue, who was appointed architect in 1788. The interior is far more light-
some and pleasant than one might suppose from the heavy outside. It consists
of nine open courts, a Rotunda, committee rooms, apartments for otliccrs and
servants, and rooms appropriated to business. The principal rooms : 'e on the
ground floor, and, having no apartments over them, get light from above by
lantern windows and domes. Below the surface are a still larger number of
rooms, and here are the vaults in which the Bank treasure is kept secure.

This national Bank was originated by a lnn'd-headed Scotchman, )Ir.
\Villium Paterson, who saw the need which existed for such an appliance, and
did not rest till he got an Act passed for the incorporation of the Governor and
Company of the Bank of England.

Let us walk into this famous Bank, and watch the cashiers shovclling out
the gold coins as if they were so many I) 'ass buttons. The amount of silver
and gold brought to the Bank, in coin and in bars, is something marvellous.
It is stored away in the bullion room, until sent to the Mint to be coined. A
single bar of gold weighs about sixteen pounds, and is worth about eight
hundred pounds. In the weighing-room there is a. wonderful little machine for
weighing the sovereigns. It does not require any one to hold it, but seems of
its own accord, and always without a mistake, to detect the light coins. it
sends the correct ones down one tube, to he passed into the Bank; and the
light ones down another, to be slit across in the clipping machine. These are
then sent to the hot furnaces of the Mint to he rccoined. Thus within one
minute thirty--three sovereigns are weighed in the balances and pronounced
good or bad. And never a light one will that sensible machine pass with the
good, nor a good one with the bad. What a lesson it teaches us! We too
shall be 'weighed in the balances' at that last great day. There will he no
possibility of mistake in that just judgment, and we shall be either passed or
rejected, rewarded or punished, according to our lives. Let us seek by God's
grace so to live that we shall not be ' found wantinfl.'

Amongst other curiosities are the remarkable bank-notes signed by illus-
trious persons; and a hank-note for twenty-five pounds that has been out in
circulation for 111 years. When a note is cashed at the Bank, a. corneris tnrn
oii', and, after its number is entered in a book, it is put away in the bank-note
lihrai unongst millions of others, until at the end of ten years it is brought
out with allthose that were shut up with itin the same month, and all are burned
in a large furnace kept for that purpose. In our peaceful days it is only
necessary to have a small body of foot soldiers to guard the Bank at night
time. But there have been times in its history, times of riotous discontent,
when both foot and horse soldiers have had to mass in large numbers, and
have even found it neee. y to charge and lire upon the excited mob to pro-
tect it from their violence.OLD SAIKT PAUL S.

PAUL'S CATHEDRAL--THE THAMES E1!BASIUIEST--WESTEHXSTER ABBEY.

 

{3' W I want you to pay a visit with me to ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.
E- .~\s we walk through the streets, we continually catch glimpses of
thcnoble building. But though no good general Viewot' it can be
,0 obtained from the ground, we will go nearer, and see how old
Father Time has been employed on its surface. We gaze up at it,
noting its weather-worn appearance: the stains of dark grey, the rich touches
of black, and the lighter greys mixed irregularly together, add to its beauty
and grandeur. We notice at the top of the granite steps the noble portlco of
twelve columns, with eight, in pairs, above them. Inside the pediinent, or
triangular space above the columns, is a representation of St. Paul's con-
version. In the centre, at the top of the pedilnent, is a statue of St. Paul:
one of St. Peter stands on his right, and St. James on his left. Around the
towers are figures of the other apostles. The let't tower contains a fine pen!
of bells, and the right tower the clock.SAINT PA (12' S. , l3

We walk round and come to the south door, over which we notice the
motto, ' REsURGAM.' This motto was suggested to Sir Christopher Wren
under peculiar circumstances. Wanting to mark the exact spot over which
the centre of the dome should rise, he called to a. workman fora piece of stone.
A piece of an old tombstone was brought, on which was engraved thisZone word
of Latin. Taking its meaning, ' I shall rise again,' he thought the word most
appropriate for the motto of the cathedral church which was to rise grandly
from the ruins of burnt London.

Old St. Paul's was the idol of Londoners; but,like the temple in the time
of our Saviour, it had become a meeting-place and lounge for the citizens.
Wickedness of all kinds abounded within its walls; and, during the civil war,
horses were stabled inside, and so much injury was done that it was found neces-
sary to thoroughly restore it. In 1666 the Great Fire laid the old clmrch low,
and left it a. mere mass of ruins. The task of rebuilding it was committed to
that grand architect, Dr.--afterwards Sir--Christopher Wren, to whom the
City of London owes so much. During thirty-five years the noble cathedral
which we now see was in course of erection. The first stone was laid in J une,
1675; and though the building was sufficiently advanced for service to be held in
it in December, 1697, it was not till 1710--t'orty-four years after the destruction
of its predecessor--that the topstone was placed over the cnpola, and the
great church completed. During these long years Wren's annual salary was
only PS200. But he enjoyed an artist's best reward in seeing his noble con-
ceptions carried into lasting shape; and it was his delight, to_the very close
of his life, to be taken once a year to revisit his grand work.

We will now enter the building. As the door closes behind us, it shuts
out all the rush and noise of the city; and though there are many people here,
yet the silence is very solemn. The service has just connnenced ; so we seat
ourselves to listen to the shrill and harmonious voices of the choir as their
singing mingles with the grand tones of the organ, filling the building with its
nmsie, and leading our thoughts to the time when, we hope, we and all our
young readers will join in the music of the skies. After the service we take a
peep at the choir. The organ, which used to stand over the entrance, is now
divided into three parts: the swell and choir organ on the south; the solo and
great organ on the north ; and the pedal organ under one of the arches. Some
of the finest earrings in the world adorn this part of the building. At the end
01' the choir are three stained windows, representing the Crucifixion, the Agony,[4. SAINT I'A l/L'S.

and the Ascension. At the south entrance to the choir is the first statue
placed in the cathedral. It is that of the noble and great philanthropist, John
Howard. Dr. Johnson's statue is at the north entrance to the choir. Amongst
the numerous monuments we more particularly notice those of Sir Henry
Lawrence, Turner, Lord Nelson, Sir Astley Cooper, and Sir John Moore, the
brass tablets in memory of the officers and seamen of H.M.S. Captain, and the
statue of Sir Joshua Reynolds.

We now go down to the crypt, and, of course, the first thing we want to
see is the tomb of Sir C. Wren. It is a plain slab, bearing this inscription :

Near his tomb lie the remains of some of our most celebrated artists--Reynolds,
Barry, Opie, \Vest, Landseer, and Foley. And in the enclosed portion of the
crypt we fmd the tombs of the Duke of Wellington and Lord Nelson. Tile
funeral car, on which the body of the Duke of Wellington was carried to the
cathedral, is next shown to us. It was cast from guns taken in his various
battles.

After visiting the library, the clock, and the whispering gallery--from
which we get a good view of the paintings in the dome--we grope our way up
the circular stairs, and at length emerge into the light. We are at the top of
the cupola, with the ball and the cross above us, and London is spread out
before us. Let us look for places of interest. Yonder is the Crystal Palace,
glittering in the sunlight. There are St. Thomas's Hospital, the Houses of
Parliament, the Embankment, the Strand, Fleet Street, the Post Office, the
Royal Exchange; and there we can just see a small portion of City Road
Chapel. The Thames towards Greenwich is hidden by the mist that has settled
upon it just beyond the Tower. A dull, buzzing sound reaches us as we watch
the busy multitudes in the streets. See how quickly that boy with the parcel
under his arm is making his way down the street. And there is our well-known
blind friend, using his stick as he slowly creeps along. We could almost fancy
we hear his well-known cry, ' Buy the boot-laces.' Yes, there they go, old and(I. Mun-4hr)! smue.

young, rich and poor, strong and weak. How many, we wonder, amidst their
business, are laying up for themselves 'treasure in heaven ? '

\Ve linger awhile gazing on the view around us, and then descend. Passing
towards the front doors, we stop to look at the rent and torn flags of the
Household Cavalry and the Coldstreaui Guards. The names of Waterloo,
Inkermauu, and Sebastopol, cause us to think of the many desperate struggles
that have taken place around them. Yes! we are proud of the bravery of our
soldiers, and we delight to have their pierced flags and their monuments in our
public places. But we are none the less proud of our peaceful heroes. We
hope the great monument of Sir Christopher Wren will stand for ages, teach-
ing by its motto, Resm'gam, that we, too, ' shall rise again.'_

Leaving this grand old building, let us weud our way down Ludgate Hill,
and, turning round towards Blackfriars Bridge, make for the Enmxxnssr.
This fine promenade alongside old Father Thames is one of London's most
modern improvements. The greatest city in the world was, until some few
years ago, so much occupied in amassing riches, that very little was done to
make it beautiful. Its river's banks, although presenting an animated appear-
ance with the unladiug of ship's cargoes, had been spoken of as an 'eyesore.'
When the tide was low, large and unhealthy muddy reaches were left exposed.
These became not only the sporting ground of the ' mudlark,' but the hotbed
of pestilence and fever; and were at last superseded by the beautiful promenade
which you see in our picture.

The idea of an Embanlnnent is no new one. As far back as 1666, after
the Great Fire of London, Sir Christopher Wren proposed to raise a spacious
embankment to the river. But unfortunately, when the best opportunity
presented itself, while London was a heap of ruins and had to be rebuilt, the
idea was not adopted. Since that time, until Mr. Bazalgette, the engineer,
came forward with his plans, not one of the numerous schemes for this sorely
needed improvement had been carried out.

To construct an Elnhanluucut such as we now have was a. work of no little
dilliculty: for some distance the river had to be dammed, while the works
were in progress; the mud had to be dredged out, excavations made, and a
granite wall built on a foundation of Portland cement concrete, thirty-two and
a half feet below high-water mark, or fourteen feet below low-water mark.
A low-level sewer, a. subway, and the District Railway, were also built under-4.3mm"

ground. To go further into details would not interest many of you, but I
will jot down a few of the quantities of material used, for those who would
like to know. Of granite there were 650,000 cubic feet; briclmork, 80,000
cubic yards; concrete, 140,000 cubic yards ; timber, 500,000 cubic feet; York
paving, 125,000 superficial feet.

The Emlmnkment is divided into three parts. ' 'he. first, extending from
"'cstminster to Vauxhall Bridge, is named the Albert, and was opened
in November, 1869 ; the Victoria, from Blackfriars to ""estminster, was
opened in July, 1870; and the Chelsea, from Chelsea to Batten-sea, in 1874:.

The Victoria, of which alone we shall speak here, forms a. very graceful
curved front to this noblest of English rivers, as well as a wide prmnenade
and carriage--way. The road is sixty-four feet wide; the foot-path on the land
side is sixteen feet, and that on the river side twenty feet wide. It is a mile
and a quarter in length, and is planted with trees on each side. The wall is
very simple, but. strong. On its river side are placed bronze lions' heads,
carrying mooring rings. At intervals massive granite piers rise from the
wall around the spaces where are placed the landing-stages, and at other
places are steps projecting into the river.

Here we may often see those faithful animals, the dogs, taking their
daily bath, or swimming out into the river after sticks thrown by their owners.
But how quickly the little crowd of admirers scatters when Carlo or Topsy
shakes the water in showers over them!

On one of the landing-stagesis placed the Thames l'oliee-Sitation. These
water policemen are evidently fond of the beautiful things created byGod. If
we keep our eyes and ears open as we pass in the boat, we shall notice the
flowers they cultivate, and hear the music of the songsters they care for.
The other day, while walking on the Embanlunent, I saw a. loaf of bread on
the roof of the station, which, I suppose, had been placed there by these men
forthe sparrows. And what a. feast these little birds were having! bursting
forth every new and then with the pretty twitterings which form their way of
saying ' Thank you.'

And here is Cleopatra's Needle, which, some three thousand years ago, stood
before the Temple of the Sun in Ilcliopolis, then was taken to adorn Alexandria,
and now has become one of the most, conspicuous and attractive ornaments of
London. In the gardensnear it is placed the statue of a man whose name every
Samlay-school girl and boy should know, Robert llaikes; be who, one hundredWL'S I'd/[NS T E If ABBEY. [9

years ago, first set a-going the great work of teaching the young in
Sunday Schools. These blessed institutions abound not only in England ;
wherever the name of Jesus is carried by Missionaries, a Sunday School is
soon established, where girls and boys are taught about Him Who said, ' Snfl'cr
the little children to come unto Me.'

The old, nuuldy margin of the river has gone, and in its place this noble
quay stands with its gardens, a boon to the cooped up children of Central
London; and its hush and quiet atl'ord sweet rest from the rush of busy life
to those engaged in the City.

At night, too, as we go homewards across one of the bridges, when the
cold, pale light of the moon is on the water, and the lights on the shore are
reflected into its depths, we think of those poor, outcast little ones who perhaps
find some place here for their homeless rest.

Beautiful, grand, and noble as is this waterside street, yet there is one
for better and brighter, where we may all walk with its Builder and Maker, if
we will give llim our heart's lore.

Stepping away from the river side, we come to the chief temple of the
West of London, the venerable and beautiful \Vi--zS'rmxs'rER ABBEY. Where
this grand building now stands, there once was a marsh covered with briers
and brushwood, and surroumled by a branch of the river Thames so as to form
an island, which from its rough nature was named ' Thorney Island.' On this
solitary and dreary spot--for the nearest part of Old London was that perhaps
where the old Lad-Gate afterwards stood--Sebert, King of the East Saxons,
built a church. It was replaced by a monastery named "'03! Minster, to dis-
tinguish it from East Minster, as St. Paul's was formerly called. Many
fabulous stories were circulated by the old monks, who had a. happy knack of
drawing attention to their church, and obtaining for their own benefit the
gifts of the people. They told of miraculous visits of St. Peter, and holy
angels, accompanied with heavenly music; and so succeeded in working upon
the minds of a superstitious people, that for many years the fishermen of
the Thames, in accordance with a command given in one of these legends,
sent presents of fish for the use of the authorities in the Abbey.

When the Danes invaded England, the little convent was destroyed ; but
being restored soon afterwards by King Edgar, it dragged on a languishing
existence until the time of Edward the Confessor. This good king built the20 WE S .T [IIINS T E R A BEE 1'.

first Abbey of which we have any certain account, a part of which still remains.
He personally superintended the work, hastening it on as he felt the approach
of a severe illness, which proved fatal a few days after the grand opening
ceremony.

\Vestminster was now no longer a marshy, deserted island, but a. beautiful
suburb where the royal palace and other noble buildings stood. To mulie a.
nobler and more stately Abbey, Henry III. pulled down the greater portion
of the Confessor's building and erected one, the principal parts of which form
the larger portion ofthe existing Abbey. Edward I., II., III., and Richard III.
improved the building; and Henry VII. during his reign added the richly
decorated and magnificent chapel known by his name. Thus you see, much of this
building is over six hundred years old, and, if only for its great. age, should be
regarded with esteem. Sir Christopher W'ren restored it from the ruinous
state to which, through neglect and the ravages of war, it had been brought ;
besides this, he built the two towers at the western eml.

The interior, especially the view obtained from the western doors, greatly
impresses us with its grandeur, as we gaze at the long and lofty aisles, the
elegant pillars, and the beautiful harmony of its ribbed vault, all so graceful
and delicate, and so venerable. Wethink, too, ot'the kings and others through
whose enterprise and ability the noble structure was raised. Turning, we notice
the statuary crowded aronndthe base. What a contrast ! From the dim light
of the upper part and the dull grey of the time-worn stonework, our eyes are
somewhat; dazzled by the glaring white of the marbles, some massive, others
crowding one upon another, each storied with men's praises, and each seeming
to thrust itself upon us as most worthy our attention. They do not all add
to the beauty of the building; but they have been placed here in honour of
great and good men, chictlyto the memory of heroes whose fame has been
achieved by noble, peaceful deeds, and by the use of the pen rather than the
sword.

In our walks around, we stop before the monuments, amt look interestedly
at the features of Wilberforce, Granville Sharp, anton, and others of that
gallant little band who devoted all their energies to abolish the slave trade;
and who, fighting against almost overwhelming opposition, finally obtained
freedom for nearly 800,000 slaves in the British dominions. There is a spot
in the floor of the nave, not very conspicuous, but marked by a black marble
slab, which becomes very dear to us as we stand and read the inscription, com-1. Poet's Corner. 2. Thu Colomfion Chair. 3. Wesley-5' Monummt. I. Handel Monument. 5. Wflhorfomc a

Ot'scientifie heroes we find here Sir Isaac Newton, the great astronomer; James
Watt, the engineer; and Sir llmnphry Davy, whose lamp is such a safe--
guard to miners.

Another monument must not be passed without notice. It is that erected
in honour of the Wesley's, the founders of the great body of Methodists,
whose influence is now felt in all parts of the world. With kindly feeling
the late Dean Stanley permitted this monument to be placed in the Abbey.
It is of white marble, aml on it are carved the profiles of the two brothers,
and a representation of John W'esley preaching on his father's tombstone in
Epworth churchyard; with this inscription:

' The best of all is, God is with us.'
' I look upon all the world as my parish.'
' God buries His workmen, but carries on His work.'

In the l'oets' Corner, amongst a number of monuments are those of
Chaucer, Milton, Shakespeare, Gray, Thomson, Goldsmith, Ben Jonson, and
Handel. Here also is the grave of Charles Dickens.

The Abbey was formerly the burial-place ot' the Sovereigns of England.
There are reposing within these venerable walls the remains of Sebert,
Edward the Confessor, llcnry 111., Edward 1., Edward 111., Richard 11.,
Henry V'., Edward V'., 11cnry VIL, Edward V1,, Mary 1., Elizabeth, James 1.,
Charles 11., William 111. and Mary, Anne, and George II.

We will now visit the 'chapels.' In these, many persons of distinction
are interred, and have monuments raised to their memories. But the chapel
that most interests us is that built by Henry VII. To reach it we ascend the
black marble steps, pass through the opcll brass gates, aml then meet such
a sight as will be remembered for a. lifetime. From the gloomy porch we
suddenly emerge into a blaze of light and decoration. Our eyes are instantlyWESTMINSTER ABBEY. 23

directed upwards to the richly carved ceiling. All this stonework was wrought
oy men who lived nearly four hundred years ago. So skilfully have they employed
their tools, that their work defies description. On either side of the chapel
are the stalls ol' the Knights of the Order of the Bath, and above are placed
their banners, swords, and helmets. At the end stands the magnificent tomb
of Henry \'II. and his Queen. In the south aisle of the chapel, we linger
round the fine monument erected to Mary Queen of Scots; and in the north
aisle a very similar one is placed to Queen Elizabeth, who, with her sister
Mary, is buried beneath.

Next, passing to the Chapel of St. Edward, we come to the renowned
shrine of Edward the Confessor. 'I'he tomb of this good king is a mere
wreck of what it once was; but in one or two places we see a little of the
minute and delicate colour-work with which it was decorated. The shrine
was built at the connnand of Henry III., to receive the treasured remains
of the Confessor, and was most gorgeously decorated with paintings, jewels,
and gold. Close by is the tomb of Henry III., which originally was also very
richly decorated. What a contrast is the tomb of the bold warrior, Edward 1.!
It is in a rough, unpolished structure of five slabs of grey marble, without
the least decoration, that his remains lie. Above the tomb of Henry V. are
the saddle, helmet, and shield that he evidently used so well at the battle of
Agincouvt.

We now come to the Coronation Chairs, one of which was made for Mary,
Queen of William III. The one now before us was placed here by Edward 1.,
and has let into it in front, just. beneath the seat, the celebrated stone from
Scone, which was brought here amongst the regalia from Scotland by Edward.
It used to be asserted that this stone is the same which Jacob had for
a pillow at llethel; but, of course, this is an absurd tradition. In this
chair all the reigning sovereigns have been crowned since Edward I., the last.

CHAPTER III.

THE TOWER OF LONDON.

   

YIZIGI'IT in the East of London stands the Ton , a mighty fortress,
which is a favourite resort for sight-secrs, and is full of interest
for those who have to stay at home. It cells ts of many ancient
lmildings--towcrs, and gates, and chapels; and in its centre the
White Tower--a large, massive, quad 'angnlar edifice, with a
turret at each eorner--forms a striking object to the spectator who looks down
the busy river from London Bridge.

Let us pay a visit to this grim old Tower, and try to imagine ourselves in
the place'of the people who once lived there. For eight hundred years it has been
famous in history, and has pleasanter associations clinging to it than those which
belong to an ordinary prison. The Norman kings used to live in the part
known as Caesar's Tower. The gay gentlemen and ladies who danced and
feasted there had little idea. of the grim, gloomy future that awaited it.
Flemish and Italian traders came thither with their curious handicraft for
sale ; and all round there were gardens and archery grounds, as well as what
you would have liked less, the Courts of King's Bench and of Common Pleas.

If Gundulf the Weeper, who, in the latter half of the eleventh century,
designed the chief parts of the Tower, had known how all that gaiety would
pass away, while the rack and the block, and bolts and bars, should have their
day, we could not have wondered at the tears he shed. By the time that Henry
VII. came to the throne, many illustrious people had been imprisoned in the
Tower, some executed, and others murdered ; but he kept his royal state there,
and fitcd his bride, the Lady Elizabeth of York.

I do not think that any part of the Tower can be more interesting to us
than that called the Bloody Tower, because the two young princes, sons of
Edward IV., were there put to death by order of their uncle Richard. This
building overlooks the Thames, and joins the gateway to the Inner Ward,
which contained the keep, the jewel-house, the wardrobe, queen's garden, &e.
It is quite possible that the poor little prisoners had many an hour of happy
play together before the dismal night when Forrest and Dighton stole upon
them in their innocent sleep. From their windows they could see the wharf,
the river, and the bridge. Then there was a. garden for them to play in, and a
pleasant walk upon the wall.

The governor, Sir John Braekenbury, was no doubt kind to them; but
often must they have longed to see again their poor mother, Elizabeth Wood-
ville, from whose arms the youngest had been torn, and who was living in
retirement at the house of the Abbot of Westminster. She was a very pretty
lady, with bright, rosy cheeks, and a quantity of golden hair. But not for
beautiful face and pretty hair do children love their mothers. Ah, think how
you would feel were you carried away from yours, and locked up among fine
rooms and gardens where she might not come! When Sir John Brackeubury
received orders from their uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, that he was to
murder the little boys, he was very much shocked, and refused to do it. The
cruel uncle wanted the crown for himself, but the governor refused to do his
bidding. So Sir James Tyrrel was sent, with orders to take the keys from
him, but only till the morrow. He took with him two men, Dighton aml
Forrest, who could in the dead of the night enter the chamber of the sleeping
boys and do the dark deed. One of the murderers afterwards confessed his
share in the transaction, and it is from his evidence, which we have only too
much reason to believe true, that the facts are taken. It is said that the
elder boy hml the New

to believe that these were the bones of Edward V. and his brother, King
Charles II. ordered their removal to ""estminster Abbey, our great burying-
place of kings. There they were laid in the chapel built by Henry VI].

The Bcauchamp Tower is so called from Thomas Beanchamp, Earl of
Warwick, who was imprisoned in it towards the end of the fourteenth century.
Another Earl of Warwick, John Dudley, with several members of his family,
was continued in the same place more than 1-50 years later. One of the sons
was Lord Gnilt'ord Dudley, the husband of Lady Jane Grey, whose sorrowful
story is, I have no doubt, well known to us all.

The great offence of Earl Beauchamp was--that he had given sound
advice to a young king who did not like advice. This young king was Richard
11., and no sooner had he attained his majority than he sent away a governor
of whom he had long been weary. Bcauehmnp went to his own castle at
Warwick, and was no doubt a great deal happier improving his estates, design-
ing churches, and planting trees, than he was in trying to train into order a
perverse sprig of royalty. But, years after, the king made him a prisoner in
the Tower, on the pretext that he had exceeded the power delegated to him in
the days of the minority, and had caused to be tried and exccntcd a favourite
of the king's, named Simon Barley. This was quite true, but Beauchamp had
acted in accordance with what was thought best in those sanguinary days.
The Londoners were very indignant at his imprisonment, as he had before
received pardon for the act umler the great seal. He was sentenced to be
hanged, drawn, and quartered, and his property confiscated. The king did not
dare to have this cruel sentence carried out. He let him remain for some time
in the Tower; and then, finding how everybody sympathized with him, he sent
him away to the Isle of Man. But the Tower proved to be the safest place for
him after all, and he was_brought back to it, till, on the accession of Henry V., he
was set atliberty, and restored to the wealth and honours of which he had been
so unjustly deprived. lie is buried at "'arwiek, ill the church which he built
during his retirement from court life.

The first St. Peter's Church, or Chapel, and the White Tower, and the Jewel
House, were among the works of Gundult' the Weeper. Henry III.gave the
chapel a nmsical chime of bells, and to St. John's Chapel in the "'hite Tower
sculptured images of saints.

St. Peter's Chapel was rebuilt in the reign of Edward I. Just opposite
the door is the Tower (ircen, an open space behind all the buildings named,
but near the White and Bean-
' champ Towers. It: was used
as the place of execution.

Here, on the spot marked by
an oral figure, Anne Boleyn,
Catherine Howard, and Lady
Jane (trey were beheaded. Very

. near it they were buried, as
were also Dudley, Duke of
Northumberland, the Protector,
Dulce of Somerset, Sir Thomas
More, the Countess ot'Shrews-
bury, the unfortunate Duke of
Monmouth, and some Jacobite
lords.

The Bloody Tower was the
prison to which Charles I. com-
mitted Sir John Eliot, a patriot
who contended nobly for the
rin'hts of Englishmen. De-

with turf and shrubs. l'rison- '
ers of State were brought in '
here, passing under the gloomy ' I
archway of St. Thomas's Tower, which, in compliment to them, was called
Traitor's Gate. But they were by no means all traitors who passed under it.

'l'raitor's Gate was built by Henry 111., and bears evidence of his rich taste.
It is said to be one of the finest arches in the world. It is not likely that the
unfortunate prisoners who were drawn up to it, and who saw the Bloody Tower
looming above it, were much impressed with its beauty. To Elizabeth Tudor,
Queen Mary's half-sister, the place looked so dismal through a soaking rain,
that she shrank from landing, and asked if she might not remain in her barge.

It was Palm Sunday, but none of the gladness of that holy day breathed
through the heavy March air. No children's clear hosannas, no swelling
anthem, no silver chime of bells. The chief constable and his guards, all
dressed in armour, waited on the wharf to receive their royal charge. One
can imagine the curl upon the young girl's lips as she asked,

' Are all these harnessed men for me? '

' No, Madam,' said Sir John Gage.

' Yes, but I know it is so,' and she sprang on shore.

Then, on the very stones where her mother, Aline Boleyn, had knelt and
called on God as witness of her innocence, did Elizabeth stand and proclaim
herself a true subject, though an imprisoned one.

Sir John proved a hard warder, never allowing her the least indulgence.
He thought of that when she was queen, being afraid of her resentment; but
the queen only showed it by telling him that if ever she had a prisoner
whom she wished to be treated with more than ordinary severity, she would
be sure to commit him to his care.

Ah! many breaking hearts have passed through Traitor's Gate, many
whose sorrow was the sad fruit of their sin; but there have been many also
whose wounds God has bound up, whose tears He has for ever wiped away.
These have witnessed, as we all hope to do, that

' Christ leads us through no darker rooms
Than He went through before}

The \t'liite Tower is that part of the Tower known as Caesar's, where
Norman and Plantagenet kings held their court, where foreign traders came to
lay out their fancy bazaars, and where also were kept the royal robes and jewels.

This tower, ninety feet high, is laid out in four stories--the vaults, the
main floor, the banqueting floor, and the State floor. Each floor contains
three rooms, besides the
vaults, and those dark,
close dungeons to which
rebels, pirates, and Jews
were mercilessly confined.
A chamber called Little
Case runs across, still
darker and damper. It is
believed that Guy Fawkes
was put into Little Ease.
I do not know whether
the idea of this chamber
was taken from the Inqui-
sition. Little Ease, in the
Inquisition, was a room too
:<<mall for the prisoner to
be comfortable in any po-
sition. He could not stand
upright nor lie down.

One might think it alnmst as hard to get into the White Tower
as out of it, the stair-ways are so narrow and winding. .\ Bishop of Durham,
Ralph Flambard, who was imprisoned there, accomplished the latter t'eat. lle
gave a banquet to his wardens, chaplains, and servants, professedly because
he was not kept close and hard like other prisoners, but was allowed to enjoy
himself in almost any way that was agreeable to him.

At this banquet he pretended to drink with the rest, but it was only
pretence; for, when he had thoroughly umnanned them all and sent them
asleep, he tool: a long rope out of a jar, tied it to a wimlow-shat't, and let
himself down sixty-five feet to the ground. Prince (iritlin, knowing what
Flaminird had done and how well he had succeeded, tried to let himself down
from the leads, but broke his neck in the attempt.

The place where the rack stood is so gloomy and dark that there are
not many of our young companions who would lilac to venture in alone. It
must have been a dreadful thing to have been led there--the instrument of
torture awaiting one. From a fae-simile ol' (iuy Fawkes's handwriting, both.
before and after he was laid on the rack, we can see its power over even a.
strong, firm man; aml need not wonder that recantation and false witness
have been wrung from the victims, which they would gladly have recalled
afterward.

The thumb-screw and the rack were seldom applied to any person of
rank ; but sturdy knights and barons must have trembled when they thought
ol' the test awaiting the fortitude of their loyal serritors.

When Felton, the assassin ot' the Duke of Buckingham, was on trial for
the crime, Archbishop Laud told him that he must confess or go upon the
rack. ' It' I am racked, my lord,' was his reply, 'I may happen in my agony
to accuse your lordship.' That was a consequence the archbishop had not
thought of. However, it was decided that, according to English law, theTHE '10 WER OF L 0ND 0.1'. 33

torture could not be used; and happin it was abandoned, and the instruments
of it are only kept on exhibition! as relies.

In the "'akelield or llerord 'l'ower were preserved the records of the
kingdom, from the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII. or earlier; and in
the Martin or Jewel Tower were long kept the crown and Sceptre, globe and
stafl'; in fact, all thejewels worn by the English kings. 'I'heknight in charge

THE REGALIA.
Edwards, deputy keeper of the crown jewels. He was eighty years of age
when a very clever plot was laid to take away his treasure, and the poor old
man was nearly beaten to death by the rutlians in his attempt to give the
alarm. The conspirators had made off with the Regalia, but were hardly
outside tlze Tower when they were overtaken. Then there was such a scuffle
that. the crown of England was rolled in the mud, and some of the gems
fell out. A street-sweeper picked up the pearl, and an apprentice the diamond,
but some of the gems were never recovered. The man who carried off the
globe was stepped, and turned out to be a notorious rebel. Of course they
were all taken back to the Tower as prisoners, instead of the pleasant
curious visitors they had pretended to be. You will be surprised to hear that
King Charles pardoned them all; but he had reasons for that, which you
may learn when you are older.

These treasures are now kept in the new Jewel House, a small stone
building, erected in 1841--2, and presenting a dwarfed imitation of a gate-
way to some old castle or abbey. This is always a centre of attraction; for
who does not like to see crowns, sceptres, and jewels? Peeping through the
railings which surround the glass case which contains these rarities, we shall
find five crowns, known as St. Edward's, the Crown of State, the Queen's
Circlct of Gold, the Queen's Crown, and the Queen's rich Crown; of which
the first and the fourth are the proper coronation crowns. The crown of
state is adorned with threejewcls of almost inestimable value : a ruby, a pearl,
considered the finest in the world, and an emerald seven inches in cir-
cumference. Then there are the Orb, an emblem of anthorityover all the
world, the Eagle of Gold, the Sword of Mercy aml the two Swords of
Justice, St. Edward's Staff--a sceptre of gold four feet seven and ahalf inches
long--four other sceptres of gold and precious stones; bracelets, spurs, salt-
cellar; sacramental plate, of beautiful worlnnanship and the most precious
metal; gold tankards, dishes, spoons, 8:0. All these objects are pleasant to
look at, and each has its little history to interest as when we can spare time
to listen to it. Their chief use is to figure at coronation ceremonies and
banquets; but their brillianey and good looks also serve the purpose of
refreshing the eyes of many a visitor when wearied with the dull miles of
brick and mortar outside the Tower precincts.

Walking round the White Tower, we find a long low building attached
to its southern side. This is the Armoury, and we will step into it and explore
its wonders. \Ve enter a long room, down the centre of which stand along
range of mounted warriors, with lance, sword, battle-axe, or mace in hand,
and banner flying overhead. They are clad in suits of armour, and represent
kings, princes, nobles, and knights, arrayed in the fashion of various ages. In
front of them we see a number of men-at-arms, bowmen, pikemcn, &c., with
a great variety of weapons and armour; while behind is tastefully arranged an
interesting collection of armour, belonging chiefly to the fifteenth, sixteenth,
and seventeenth centuries. Though the old warder, or " beef-cater," does not
allow us much time for contemplation or examination, we still have time to he
struck with the beauty of the picture which this long, storied room presents,
with its foemeu, grim or brilliant, its pointed arches, its ingenious ceiling
made up of weapons, and the orange light shed by the stained glass on the
nearest figures.

Passing through the wall of the White Tower into Queen Elizabeth's
Armoury, once the prison of Sir Walter Raleigh, we find a. vast variety of
interesting objects--suits of armour, helmets, breastplates, battle-axes, pikes,
swords, old pistols and linstocks, ancient pieces of artillery, &e.: and we mark
especially a cannon that sank with The Royal George,

now lishcd up and mounted on a piece of the timber of the ill-fated old man-of-
war. Glancing at Tippoo Saih's helmet, belt, and swords, at Chinese dresses,
Mahratta weapons, Indian armour; and shuddering at the horrid instruments
of torture to which our worthy forefathers were subjected, and at the axe
and block which finished the career of some, we gain the upper end of the
room, and pay our respects to Queen Bess, arrayed in all her glory, and
mounted on horseback, attired, we are assured, as she was when she went
to return thanks at St. Paul's for her and the nation's deliverance from the
Spanish Armada. And so, for the present, we bid farewell to the Tower,
with the feeling that it is a place well worth visiting and revisiting.CITY ROAD CHAPEL.

CHAPTER IV

S'l'A'l'CES AND )lONUMEXTS--ROYAL ALBERT HALL--CITY ROAD CHAPEL.

  
 
 

MN rambling about the great city we meet with some tine statues
/ _ and monuments, intended to commemorate important events, or
to keep bright the fame of men who have devoted their lives to
their country's service, or have performed some grand and bene-

lieial work. Years may have rolled away since these worthies
lived, yet it is still interesting to gaze on their features as preserved in stone
or metal by the skill of the sculptor, and to recall the noble deeds for which
they were distinguished.

()t'the many monmnents with which London is adorned, let us first notice
that to the memory of the hero ot"l'ral'algar, Horatio Lord Nelson (No. 1 in our
illustration on p. 39). The figure of this lighting seamau stands on a column
177 feet high, opposite the National Gallery. The four protruding corners at the
base hare massive lions--the work of Sir Edward Landscer--upon them; and
the four tablets depict Nelson at the battles of Copenhagen, the Nile, St. Vin-STA TUES AND M ONUMEIV TS . 3 7

cent, and his death at Trafalgar. He was born September 29th, 1758, at
Burnham Thorpe, in Norfolk, of which place his father was rector. When a
boy he was feeblc and sickly; and throughout his life his small, slender body
seemed a great contrast to the daring spirit which filled it and led him on to
so many great victories. He commenced his naval career at the age of thirteen,
and was not long in proving himself to be an expert seaman. When the war
broke out with France, his growing fame reached its height by a series of
amazing victories, in the lustre of which all other naval glory appears insigni-
ficant. Burning with the love of conquest, his name alone became a terror to
his enemies. Longing to engage in conflict with the French navy, be, after
chasing them for some time, upon arriving at the Bay of Trafalgar saw the
navies of both France and Spain moving to meet him. And there, on the 21st
of October, 1805, he gained his greatest triumph, and England lost her greatest
warrior of the sea: for Nelson received awound in the breast, from which,
amidst the roar of battle and shouts of victory, he died. He is buried in
our cathedral of St. Paul's.

Another hero is--or rather, was till rccently--commemoratcd by a monu-
ment (No. 2) at Hyde Park. England's greatest general, Arthur, Duke of
Wellington, was born May 1st, 1769, at Dangan Castle, in Ireland. He entered
the army, as an Ensign of the :ilst Regiment, in 1787; and in Holland seven
years afterwards engaged for the first time in active service. His life is one
long record of brilliant actions and well-earned victories. la the Netherlands,
India, Spain, Portugal, and France, wherever he led his army, the Iron Duke
scattered his enemies. His brightest laurels were gained in delivering Spain
from the power of France, and principally at the battles of the Douro, Badajos,
and Salamanca. But it was on the 18th of Julie, 1815, at the great battle 0t
\Vnterloo, that his crowning triumph was won, when he completely crushed the
power of Napoleon. lIe devoted himself very much to the service of his
Sovereign and country, and was esteemed an honourable and upright man.
He was kind to those who served under him ; and, when engaged in lighting
his country's battles, was careful for the lives of his men. But when safety
lay in daring, he was bold indeed. He died at Walmer Castle, on September
14th, 1852, and was buried in St. Paul's.

England may well be proud of the soldier whose monument (No. 4) stands
at Traliilgar Square. Major-General Sir Henry Havelock was born April 5th,
1795, at Bishep-Wear-mouth, in Durham. Joining the army :1 little while38 S T A TUES A ND 111 OrVUJIE NT S .

after the battle of Waterloo, he went to India, and distinguishedhimself in the
Afghan and Sikh wars. At the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny he and a gallant
little army pushed to the relief of the British at Cawnpore and Lucknow,
fighting almost every inch of the way, and gaining victory upon victory along
this march of tire. At length, terribly thinned and weakened by fatigue and
sickness, the victorious little army fought their way into Lucknow, but only
to be themselves shut in, until Sir Colin Campbell forced his way to their rescue.
IIarelock was a Christian soldier, and set to work as a missionary in his own
regiment. And when his ' Ironsides' were engaged in fighting, they soon
proved that good soldiers of Christ were none the worse men in battle. Just
before his death he said to Sir James Outram, ' For more than forty years I
have so ruled my life, that when death came I might face it without fear.'

Another soldiers' monument is the Guards Memorial (N0 5) in \Vaterloo
Place, erected to the honour of those who fought in the Crimea. Herc Victory
is represented crowning the soldiers.

Near to this last monument is one (No. 6) to a hero whose life was laid
down in the peaceful conquests of discovery. Rear-Admiral Sir John Franklin
was born April 6th, 1786, at Spilsby, in Lincolnshire. In 1800 he entered the
Royal Navy as nlidshipman. lle commenced his discoveries in the Arctic Seas
in 1819; and in his first expedition, lasting three and a half years, he travelled
5,550 miles under circumstances of the greatest hardship and privatiou,to which
more than halfhis comrades succumbed. These valuable explorations engaged
him till 1827. In May, 1815, this grand old sailor, then in his sixtieth year,
but hale and hearty, started on his last and ill-fated voyage to the Arctic Seas.
In July of that year the vessels were last seen; and then, as time went by and
no news of the explorers came from the cold, dark, and cruel Arctic circle,
Europeans and Americans vied with each other in their efforts to penetrate to
the relief of the sutl'erers. M'Cliutoek, in 1859, found out that Franklin had
died June 11th, 18", fortunately before he could witness the awful sufferings of
his men, as one by one they dropped exhausted, perishing ill the checrless realm
of the Ice King. Franklin was a true Christian and a teetotaller, and was
one of the boldest explorers that ever left the shores of Great Britain.

The history of George Stephenson, whose statue is in Euston Railway
Station (No. 7), is very instructive. He was born J unc 9th, 1781, amidst great
poverty. His first employment was as cowherd, at twopcuce per day; then he
advanced to hoeing turnips, at fourpcncc. At eighteen he could neither read

nor write, and his life--especially the earlier part--was a long contest between;
determined industry and poverty; but slowly, inch by inch, we find him rising
from his poverty, perfecting colliery engines, inventing the 'Gcordie' safety
lamp, and introducing that great means of progress--the 'ailway engine.

The statue of our good, noble, Christian Prince Consort given in our
picture (No. 8) stands on Holboru Viaduct. That to Sir Hugh Myddelton
(No. 9), who used all his money in making the canal called the New River,
thirty-eight miles long, to supply London with water, is at Islington Green.

The Monument (No. 2}), 202 feet high, commemo 'ating the Great Fire of
London, is placed very near the spot where that tire commenced in Pudding
Lane.

The grandest of all our London momuueuts to departed worth is the
Memorial erected at Kensington in memory ot'l'rince Albert. Noble in its plan
and dimensions, built of varied and valuable material, and enriched with
appropriate statuary, it is at once an adornment to the great city, and_a
national memento of a good and wise man. Most of our public monuments have
been erected to men of the sword, and commemorate the achievements in arms
of our naval heroes :md military chiefs. The Albert Memorial is reared to one
who won fame in the 'anks of peace, and whose glory it was that he used his
exalted position for the highest ends, upholding good morality by his example
and influence, and furthering the progress of the nation in every ray. This
Memorial to him is well worth a visit, and a leisurely examination of its artistic
beauties.

The base ot'the monument is formed by three qluulraugularflights of steps,
ur 'angcd like part of a wide-spreading py 'amid ; at the four corners are large
masses of curved granite, on which stand groups of marble statuary, gigantic
in proportions, and representing Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. Above the
steps rises the pedestal ot' the Memorial, elaborately adorned with nearly 200
figures in high relief and of life size. These are full-length portraits, or statues,
of Celeb 'ated painters and sculptors, poets and other writers, men of science,
&e. ; and you will be much interested if you can spend a few minutes in trying
to identify these worthics. At the four corners of this podium, or pedestal,
we find some more groups of allegorical statuary; representing Counnerce,
Manufactures, Agriculture, and Engineering. Then comes the gigantic
statue of Prince Albert, richly gilt, and resting on a pedestal fifteen feet high.
He is sitting on a chair of state, and robed as a Knight ol'the Garter. Over4 2 STA TL'JL'S AND M ONE-115 (VT S .

him is a richly decorated Gothic canopy, about thirty feet square, supported by
groups of polished granite columns, and surmounted bya beautiful spire, highly
'ornamented up to the very top, where a cross completes this marvellous piece
of art workmanship. The total height of the Memorial is 176 feet.

Close by, we find a magnificent building, which may be taken as another
monument to the memory of the much lamented prince. It had been 'his
intention to erect a large ball which might be used in promotion of the arts
, and sciences, and for the display of works of industry, Sze. But he did not live
to carry out his design; am! after his death it was determined to realize the
idea. in a. memorial building at Kensington. Hence arose the ROYAL ALBERT
"ALL, which, however, was not completed till the year 1871. It is :m immense
building, of fine proportions; and some notion of its vast size maybe gathered
from the fact that 70,000 blocks of terra-cotta were used in its construction.
Round the frieze we find an inscription, in large letters, which reads thus:
' This "all was erected for the advancement of the arts aml sciences, and for
the works of industry of all nations, in fulfilment of the intentions of Albert,
Prince Consort. The site was purchased by the proceeds of the great Exhibi-
tion of the year 1851. The first stone of the Hall was laid by Iler Majesty
Queen Victoria, on the 20th day of May, 1867, am] it was opened by Her
Majesty the Queen on the illith (lay of March, in the year 1871.' Above the
frieze run these words, in letters a foot high: 'Thine, O Lord, is the greatness,
and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty : for all that is
in the heaven and in the earth is Thine. The wise and their works are in
the hand of God. Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace.'

The interior of this vast lmilding is arranged as an amphitheatre, and will
seat between 6,000 and 7,000 persons; while about 2,000 more can be com-
fortably placed on a sloping staging in the picture gallery which surrounds the
Hall. It contains a noble organ; in fact, it is said to be the largest in the
world, having about 8,000 pipes, which are distributed over four manuals and
a pedal organ. Verily, the organist ought to be able to make atremendous
and highly varied noise in the world! I hope you will not be frightened to go
near the organ, whenI add that the motive power is supplied by two steam
engines I

But, high as Prince Albert stands in our estimation, we Londoners can
show you a monument to a man still higher and greater. True, he was only
a tinker, but, whatever his craft, his soul was one of the largest, and his creative

And here let us note that Bunhill Fields contain the dust of many great

lighted by three windows, and has its right and left walls covered with tablets
in memory of the Wesley's, Fletcher, Clarke, Benson, and Coke, while in the
centre we can read the Lord's Prayer, the Connnandments, and the Creed.
A deep gallery runs round three sides of the chapel ; numerous tablets on the
lower walls commemorate the names and the worth of schml Clllillt'nt

It was here that the brave John Rogers, the first martyr in the persecution
for which the bigoted Queen Mary is notorious, suffered death at the stake,
because he preferred the pure doctrines of the Reformation to the corruptions
of the Rmnish Church. Constant to the truth, he cheerfully for it gave his
body to be burned, and bathed his hands in the flames, thus showing that. the
pain of burning had no terror for his stout heart and steadfast soul. The light
which he and his fellow martyrs kindled in England, by God's grace, will never
die out. Let us do our part to keep it alive.

    

5m: or xoanns' autumn.ON THE RIVER.

HAT would London be without :1 river 2' Probably, if it existed at
all, it would be a quiet old place, visited chiefly out of curiosity by
antiquaries, bent on seeing its Roman and early British rel sand
remains. The Thames has been the higlnray of its couunerce
long before railways were invented, and still is as busy and

crowded as ever. But useful as it is and llasbeen for trade and travel, it separates

the City and the West End from an immense population in Sontlnvark and

Lalnbetli and \':|uxll:1ll and Battersea; and it is therefore necessary to haveRRIDGES OVER THE THAMES. 5r

8 good number of large bridges across it, as boats would not answer the purpose,
and could not keep the traffic going. So now we will have a peep at some of
these appliances.

Old Father Thames, at London, from the tune of the Saxons downwards
for very nearly 800 years, could boast only one bridge over his rushing torrent.
And each successive bridge built on that spot, but more especially the old
stone one, became the pride of all London. We almost wonder that there
were then found men skilful enough to begin such a difficult task, when every-
thing had to be done by hand, and with very rough and peculiar tools.

London Bridge was once a favourite resort of the citizens for witnessing
the tilting jousts and other rough and noisy sports on the water. Later on,
it became the scene of fierce conflicts with rebels, triumphal entries of con-
querors, and gorgeous pageants. Fierce flames and wild storms beat upon
and battered it; but the old stone bridge stood firm and long.

The first London Bridge was a low wooden one, built some eight or nine
hundred years ago, but did not remain long in its position. It was blown
down and washed away during a fierce storm. Then William Rufus, seeing
the necessity of a bridge across the river, imposed a heavy tax on wool, as a
means of getting the money to build another. From this incident we get the
saying, ' London Bridge was built upon woolsacks.'

The first stone bridge was built from the design of Peter of Colcehnrch, a
priest. It was connnenced in 1176, and took thirty-three years for its com-
pletion. In the centre, a chapel dedicated to Thomas :1 Becket was one of the
most conspicuous buildings. It may seem strange to us to read of houses
built on bridges ; but, I suppose, the latter were not considered finished until
they had almost a little town upon them. This bridge had houses from end to
end, with a street, which afterwards became amarket-place, between them.
It also had gates with towers, and adrawbridge in one of the arches, which was
raised when vessels had to pass. One singular house attracted a great deal
of attention. It was called 'Nonsuch House,' and was made entirely of wood
in Holland, and brought over in pieces, when it was set up without mortar or
nails, wooden pegs only being used to hold it together. It is the first house
with six towers shown in our picture of Old London Bridge.

But old Time and other more violent visitants were leaving very visible
traces of destruction behind them; and what with patching and mending, there
was scarcely a stone of the original bridge left, when it was taken down in5 2 BRIDGES 0 V15)? 7' H1." Til/111155.

1823--4. Again and again did the hungry llames of tire sweep across the
ancient bridge, reducing the buildings to ashes, and weakening the stonework
by their heat. Neglected atter one of these great fires, it was allowed to get,
into a. very ruinous state, and a winter's severe frost and ice loosened and
carried away live ot'its nineteen arches. This dis ster is commemorated in the
old song, ' London Bridge is broken down.' Some time after, another portion
i'ell, carrying with it the south stone gate and tower. And once again, in 1757,
a portion was discovered in such a rickety state, that Mr. John Smeaton, the
great engineer, was sent for to advise what it was best to do. The stonesot'
the old city gates, which had just, been taken down, were lying at Moot-fields.
These were thrown in to support the tottering pier. Besides these disasters,
the bridge was getting infirm and old, and it was only by-repeated tinkering
and patching and propping that it w: kept in a serviceable condition.

The old city, which had co sidered Peter Colechurch's bridge its pride and
glory, at last found the narrow street insufficient for its traliic: and so the
houses were cleared away. That was satisfactory t'o' a time; but while the
bridge had been growing old and crazy, London had increased very much in
extent and population, :md had become mighty in the eyes of all the world.
And a bridge which satisfied Londoners in earlier times, was not thought to be
equal to the great and increasing industry of modern London. So, notwith-
standing the reluctance of the people to give up repairing their old bridge, it
was condemned to be pulled down. In June, 1825, the foundation stone of the
new bridge was laid amidst great pomp; and the linished bridge was opened
by King William I\'., on August 1st, 1831.

This present bridge, built by Rennie, is regarded as one of the finest granite
bridges in the world. It is very simple, but bold in design; and, spanning the
river with its five vast arches, is a far more magnificent and massively strong
one than the old. lts cost. was not much less than PS2,000,000.

What a countless number of busy, lmrr '11:; feet pace throngingly over this
great thoroughtiire! Almost as ceasele' ly as the ebb and flow of the river
itself, an nnresting tide ot' human beings, day after day, crosses and rccrosses
this g 'and bridge. As many as 170,000 persons and 20,000 vehicles have
been counted t 'aversing this bridge during one day.

The Thames, at London, is also crossed by bridges in the following order;
they are all seen to advantage by going up the river in a. steamboat. The first
we pass, after leaving London Bridge, is the South-Eastern Railway Bridge.mu m- a. W "2mm"! Such" c-f'mm

Then comes the iron Southwark Bridge built by Rennie, which has three grand
arches that are perhaps unrivalled; the centre one spanning 240 feet. 5,780
tons of iron were used in its construction; and the bridge altogether cost
PS800,000. The London, Chathani, and Dover Railway crosses the river at
Blackfriars. Close to its bridge is the New Blackfriars Bridge, which was
built by Mr. Cubitt, and opened by the Queen on November 6th,1869. It
has cast metal ornaments, polished red granite piers, massive iron arches, the
centre one spanning 185 feet, and is one of the cheapest Thames bridges, its
cost having been a little less than PS400,000.

The next bridge before us is Waterloo, which competent judges have
declared to be the fiiiest bridge in Europe. Rennie, who built it, has made it
flat from end to end. Nine beautiful arches cross the water, but there are
others running some distance under-ground on either side of the river. It
cost PS1,000,000. The name, as you will guess, was given it to commemorate
the famous battle of Waterloo; and on the seeoml anniversary of that battle,
June 18th, 1817, it was opened by the Prince Regent, accompanied by the
Duke of Wellington and a brilliant stall' of oilieers who were present at that
great victory.

The Charing Cross Railway and Foot Bridge stands where formerly stood
Brunel's Suspension Bridge, then known as Hungerford Bridge. The latter
has been removed to Clifton, and passengers on the Great "'esteru Railway
have a fine view of it as they pass Bristol.

Westminster Bridge occupies the place of the second bridge built in London.
The old one was opened in 1750, and the turrets, or alcoves, that were on it
may now be seen in Victoria Park, where they serve as arbours. The new
bridge is an iron one resting on granite piers, and was opened in 1862. Then
follow Lanibeth, Vauxhall, l'iinlieo Railway, Chelsea Suspension, Cadogan or
Albert, Battersea, West London Railway, Putney, and Hammersmitli Bridges.

With such an array of noble, well-built bridges Londoners should be well
satisfied. The river that rushes beneath them made the task of laying a.
sure foundation a most difficult one. But the great skill of our time has
successfully accomplished it. And we have reason to believe that some of
these bridges may last as long, aml may have as interesting a history to tell
future generations, as Old London Bridge.

Before Old Lomlon Bridge was removed to make way for the present
structure. the river Thames was several times frozen over; owing to the factFROST FAIRS ON THE RIVER. 55

that the heavy arches of the old bridge prevented the escape of the great
masses of floating ice, which, fanning themselves into chains of glaciers, soon
became a solid surface. There are many memorable records of frosts on the
Thames. The earliest of which there is any account took place in 1281, at
Christmas. When the thaw came, five arches of London Bridge were carried
away by the force of the floating ice. In 1434-, another severe frost occurred,
of nearly three months' duration; the river being frozen over from London to
Gravescnd. In December, 1607, a frost set in, lasting until February, 1608;
and during it tents and booths were for the first time erected on the Thames.
and the scene took all the semblance of a. fair.

 

 

Our first picture, copied from an old print, gives it good idea of the great
fair held on this icy plain in the winter of 1683. The ice was then so lirm
that streets of booths were built on it, and a large number of shops: opened
by enterprising tradesmen. The carriages yousce belonged to the gentry,
who came daily for drives, the snow no doubt making,r the surface rough
enough for horses to walk on. The king, Charles 11., paid a visit to this
fair, and had his name printed at one of the numerous printing-presses there.
The thaw began on February Alth, and the fun of the fair came to an end.

The Thames was again frozen over in 1789, when another fair was held
on it, at which a pig was roasted and a bear hunted on the ice. The thaw
came so suddenly this time as to cause much alarm to those on the river, who
rushed to the shore in order to save their lives; and booths and shops floated
away, much to the consternatiml of their owners.

 

 

One of the most remarkable frosts known in England was that of the
only months of 1814. Of this we have a more detailed account by a writer of
the time, than of any previous one. It was preceded by a. dense fog, lasting five
(lays, and the falls of snow u'ere unprecedented.

The river was frozen over from Blackfriars Bridge to London Bridge.
This thoroughfare was named the City Road, and thousands of persons
promenaded up and down it. A sheep was roasted on the ice, which spectacle
could be viewed by paying Sixpence. When cooked, the meat was sold at a.
shilling a slice, under the name of ' Lapland mutton.' Printing-presses were
erected, and pieces in commemoration of the frost issued. The following
is a. specimen:

' Behold, the river Thames is frozen o'er,
\Vhich lately ships of mighty burden bore;
New, different arts and pastimes here you see,
But printing claims superiority.

You that walk here. and do design to tell
Your children's children what this year bcfell,

Come buy this print, and it will then be seen
That such a year as this has seldom been.'

The Lord's Prayer was also issued from this icy printing office. Books
labelled ' Bought on the Thames '--indeed, all sorts of things--were sold at
double and treble their real worth, because of the novelty of the thin". The
picture given on the opposite page represents the scene as the ice began to
melt, lit up by a great fire which occurred at the time. Then the waves of the
old river flowed on again in calm majesty, not soon to be disturbed by such a.
frost as that year witnessed.Till-1 OLD BULL AND MOUTH INS.

THE ozxamn rosr OFFICE--THE ros'rniix.

"0 has not heard with pleasure the sharp, loud, firm ' rut-tat ' of

footsteps and other sounds. Yes, here is little Tommy Toddles, who has
managed to scramble up three stairs, crying, ' Me hab 'cm.' Well, Polly
does not mind, am] so little Tommy marches into the room quite delighted
to be the bearer of, perhaps, good news.

But I wonder whether my readers ever think of the care and trouble taken
to deliver their letters as quickly as possible. We can write to our cousins in
the country one afternoon, and the next morning the letters will be waiting
for them to read at tlle breakfast-table. How different it was when our grand-
fathers and their grandfathers were young! Before railways were started,
when the roads were wretchedly bad, the post was very slow. What would
my young friends in Glasgow say, if their letters from Edinburgh were more
than a. week on the journey; or our boys and girls in Cornwall, if they had to
wait nine or ten days before they could possibly get an answer from London ?

The Post is a very ancient institution. We read in the Bible, in several
places, of letters being sent by 'posts.' Men were kept specially trained as
runners, and sometimes camels and dromedaries were used.

Posting in England, about the time of the Tudors, and for some long tnne
afterwards, was carried on by riders on horseback. These persons, who were
generally young lads, were termed Post-boys. Their only livery was a scarlet
jacket and waistcoat, given to them on the birthday of the reigning sovereign.
They might often be seen loitering on the way, and rarely travelled quicker
than three miles an hour; or, if sent on express business, managed to
accomplish four miles in that time. Campbell writes:

' Near Inverary we regained a spot of comparative civilization, and came
up with the pOstboy, wlwse horse was quietly grazing at some distance, whilst
redjacket himself was immersed in play with other lads.

'" You rascal!" I said to him, "are you the post-boy, and thus spending
your time ? "

' " Na, na, Sir," he answered, " I 'm no the post, I 'm only an express! " '

But these postboys became the special prey of the highway robbers, who
often stopped them and ransacked their bags. In February, 1779, an advertise-
ment appeared, stating that the boy carrying the mail for Liverpool, Manchester,
Chester, and thirty other towns, besides the Irish mail, had been robbed of the
whole.

Our forefathers at length began to get tired of having their letters and
money turned into other people's hands ; so the Mail Coach was started.
This was an improvement, though the pace of the coach was slow, and frequently
the passengers had to get out and walk. It was a still further advance when,
in 1825, they managed to get the coach along at the rate of eight miles the
hour. A well-armed guard went with each coach, and passengers were charged
a little more than sixpencc per mile.

We smile when we read that there were gentlemen who, when further
improvements in the coaches were suggested, said that the postal service was
almost as perfect as it could he made, and that new methods would lling the
whole correspondence of the country into confusion. I wonder if those very
positive gentlemen have lived to see our postal service.

When George Stephenson began his railway scheme, the people were so
frightened that they kept away from his strange-looking, pulling engine, and
crowded into the coaches. But when travelling by rail was found to be
quicker and easier than by coach, they began to take their seats as 'ailway
passengers.

Soon the Post Olliec authorities sent their letters by rail : and then they
found it necessary to build special carriages for the conveyance of the letters
and the Post Ollice servants in charge, so that sorting might he carried on
during the journeys. Thus the 'travelling post office ' was introduced on our
railways.

Let us take a peep at one as it is to-day. Inside, we see,it is well lighted.
Along one side are tiers of boxes, or pigeon-holes, for the letters, &e.; while
on the other side bags are hanging, with the names of different post towns
on them. "'hile the train is rushing along at forty miles an hour, the sorters
are very husy here, arranging the lette ' and putting them in the bags. As
the train approaches any place, its letter- mg is tied up and sealed, and is then
put on an iron arm close to the door, ready to he caught away by a net spread
near the ground for that purpose. And the net fixed to the side of the
carriage is let down to catch the bag that is hung from an iron post fixed
in the ground. In an instant, as the train shot by, the bags have heen
exchanged. And now the sorters are busy again, sorting, tying up, and
scaling; getting ready for the next post town. The bag in the ground-net
will soon he fetched away by the country postman or mail cart.

Formerly letter writing was a. luxury almost confined to the rich. The
cost of postage varied according to distance and the number of written pages;
the charge was collected from the receiver. A short letter from London to- . . . .. .. . ~. J. mr "IIIIJII-l Ill".

Edinburgh cost one shilling and three halfpenee; if two sheets, two shillings
and threepencc. Rowland Hill set to work to obtain a. cheaper rate of postage,
and after much opposition and with very little encouragement, except from
private friends, he succeeded, on January 10th, 1840, in introducing an uniform
'l'enny Post.'

In 1810 only 4,028 places in the United Kingdom were open for receiving
letters; but in March, 1880, 26,753 pillar-boxes and offices could be counted.
In 1840, 168,000,000 letters were posted, and in 1880 the number amounted to
1,127,997,500 !

In 1829 the General Post Oilicc, St. Martin's-le-Grand, was completed and
occupied. But the work increased so much, that when the telegraph service
was taken in hand, it was found necessary to build the new General Post Oilice
opposite. This handsome building, containing nearly 200 rooms, was opened
in 1874.

If we were to look into the General Post ()llice while the mail-bags were
being made up, what should we see? A very busy scene. After the letters
are all taken out of the many boxes, they are emptied on to a large table,
where they have to he ' faced,' that is, arranged tidily with the stamped face
of the envelope uppermost. Then the 'taxers' take them, whose business it
is to see that the letters are not over weight. Then comes the stamping,
which is a very curious process, done by a. machine that looks like the upper
part of a sewing-machine; only at the end of the arm, where the needle should
be, is the stamp which is pressed down with a handle on each letter, and makes
the post-mark on the Queen's head which prevents the stamp on the letter
from being used again as a new one.

Now they are ready for sorting, and are carried into another room, down
which run long rows of tables with shelves and little compartments or ' pigeon-
holes.' These rows are called ' roads.' All the letters for the places on the
Great Western line are put into one road, for the (treat Northern into another,
and so on. When the letters are sorted, they are ready for the mail vans or
'accclerators,' which you see in the picture, waiting to receive them. They
are quickly driven to the station and put into the mail train; and, after travel-
ling to their destination, are again sorted, and each postman takes these for
the houses in his district.

But the pOstmen's work is not over when they have delivered the morning
letters; they have, at regular hours, to empty the pillar-boxes. Perhaps you
have sometimes seen the postman unlock the little door in the middle of the
pillar, take the letters out, put them in his bag, and carry them of? to the
post office. Then, in most places, there are two or three deliveries in a day.
111 London there are so many that the postman seems to be on his feet all day.
But in London and afew other towns the postmen have one great advantage--
there is no Sunday delivery, so that the postman has that day for rest, and can
go with his family to the house of God. This ought to be the case all over
England. The poor men who work so hard all the week should have their
Sundays free. Some good people are doing their best to increase the number
of places which give the postman a weekly rest. A little boy like you cannot
do much to help them, for you neither write nor receive many letters; but
you need never write one that would have to be delivered on Sunday; and
if your papa has his letters brought to him on that day, you might perhaps
persuade him to give up this arrangement, for ' every little helps.'

Of course all persons are not good writers, and it often happens that
letters come with very strange addresses. One came with this, ' Obern Yenen ;'
another, ' Ann 31--, Olleywhite.' These are taken to the ' Blind' man, who
is so named, not because he cannot see, but because he is sharp enough to find
out things that baffle or blind other people; his clear sight and sharp "its
soon solie the puzzle. 'Obern Y'enen he made out to be Holborn Union.

among which were 1,141 containing cash and bank-notes to the amount of

be living amongst us, to be sure! But fancy the feelings of the postmen
who found frogs, lizards, and spiders hopping and crawling about! 4,500 letters
and packets were stopped for containing such objectionable things.

ET us take our walk down Fleet Street, and see--not TEMPLE BAR,
but the spot where that famous gate formerly stood. By its
destruction London has Iost one of its notable features. Here
was the boundary line between the City of London and the Liberty
of Westminster; and at first this line was marked by a chain andTEJII'LE BA R. 6 7

Queen Victoria, when,
in 187:2, she went to St.
Paul's to return thanks "up" "I"
for the Prince of Wales' recovery from dangerous illness, had to observe
just the same ceremonies in paSsing through Temple Bar as Queen Elizabeth
did when the Spanish Armada had been destroyed.

The Temple Bar which till lately stood \vheren'e are standing, just by the
New Law Courts, and which our picture commemorates as it appeared in the
eighteenth century, was built in 1672, under Sir Christopher "'ren's superin-63 THE '1' E IlIPLE.

tendence. It was ornamented by four statues--two, representing Charles I.
and Charles II., on its western side; and two, figuring Elizabeth and James
I., on its eastern or City side.

Fourteen years after its completion the Bar received the first of those
ghastly decorations by which it was to be so frequently Sin-mounted. The
body of Sir Thomas Armstrong, who had been executed for his share in the
iyc House Plot, having been quartered, according to the horrible custom of
the times, was exposed here on spikes specially intended for this barbarous
purpose. During the next sixty years, the passenger, gazing up at Temple
Bar, rarely failed to see, shaken by winter's storms or scorched by summer's
sun, the mutilated remains of some traitor to the State. The last heads
exposed there were those of ten Jacobite leaders in the rebellion of 1745'. But
the Bar has been chosen as a. tit place for exhibiting to public exeeration
the living as well as the dead. In front of it stood the infamous Titus Oates,
enduring the tortures of the pillory amidst the exultations of an indignant mob.

It is a relief to turn from these revolting memories to the pieasanter
associations of the eighteenth century, when the literati of London were wont
to spend so large a portion of their time in the immediate neighboln-hood of
Temple Bar. How often must Johnson, Boswell, Addison, Steele, Fielding, and
Goldsmith have passed under its shadow, on their way to and from those 'tavern
homes of mighty wits' with which old Fleet Street abounded! Crowds of
literary men of lesser note haunted the Bar between the hours of eleven and
four, when, according to Dr. Johnson, every sixth man was an author. ' The)r
are seldom to be seen,' he writes, ' very early in the morning or late in the
evening; but about dinner-time they are all in motion, and have one uniform
eagerness in their faces, which gives little opportunity of discovering their
hopes or fears, their pleasures or their pains. But in the afternoon, when they
have all dined, or composed themselves to pass the day without a dinner, their
passions have full play, and I can perceive one man wondering at the stupidity
of the public, by which his new book has been totally neglected; . . . another
perusing, as he walks, his publisher's bill ; another nun-muring at an unanswer-
able criticism ; another determining to write no more to a generation of
barbarians; and another wishing to try once again whether he cannot awaken
a drowsy world to a sense of his merit}.

But Dr. Johnson is gone, and we shall not see his burly form passing-'I'HE TEJII'LE. 69

along in front of the Bar. And now the Bar is gone also 5 so we will not stand
lamenting over it, but will pass through this ' gate-house; which stands on the
south side of Fleet Street, and pay a visit to THE TEMPLE, the famous abode
of lawyers and literary men. This gate-house is itself an antiquity, with its
heavy red-brick front dressed with stone. It was built in 1681- ; so is just 200
years old. The two Temples, the Inner and the Middle, occupy a large space
of ground between Fleet Street and the river, and compri' a great number
of houses, let off in 'chambers ' or floors, and occupied by barristers students,
writers, Sze. They derive their name from the Knights Templars, an Order
established in 1118 by Baldwin, King of Jerusalem, to protect pilgrims on their
road to the ' holy city.' These knights visited onrland in 1128, and took up their
abode, for fifty-six years, in Holboru; and then removed to this Fleet Street
neighbourhood, where they had their quarters till the abolition of their Order
by Pope Clement V. in 1:512. Since then the Temple has been the dwelling-
place chiefly of lawyers, and we shall meet not a few of them as we saunter
about their premises.

 

Let us peep into the Middle Temple 11:11], the roof of which is said to be
the finest specimen of Elizabethan architecture in London. The Hall was
erected in 15722, and the beautiful screen u'hich yell there see, in the Renais-
sance style, was put up in 1575. The Inner Temple Hall is also a fine building,
but quite modern, and stands on the site of the refeetory, or refreshment.
room, of the old knights. But the chief attraction is the beautiful Temple
Chlu'ch----the finest of the four round churches still left in l-Ingland. It was
built in 1185--700 years ago. The Knights Tomplars usually built round towers
to their churches, in imitation of the Temple at Jerusalem. 0n the pavement
in the 'Round' we find two groups of eil'ig'ies of knights in armour, with legs
crossed in token that they had been Crusaders; and there are several other
monuments of nmch interest and of great antiquity. The organ, built by a famous
Organ-maker, ' Father' Smith, in the reign of Charles 11., is one ofthe tinest
and sweetest that can he heard anywhere; and the Sunday services are always
remarkable for the beauty of the music.

Now let us sally forth, through I-'ountain Court, into the Temple Gardens;
passing themodest Fountain, of which L. 1'}. L. sang:

' The fountain's low singing is heard on the wind.
Like a melody, bringing sweet fancies to mind--"0 THE TEMPLE.

Some to grlcve, some to gladden: around them they cast
The hopes of the marrow, the dreams of the past.

Away in the distance is heard the vast sound

From the streets of the city that compass it round,

Like the echo of fountains, or ocean's deep call ;

Yet that fountain's low singing is heard over all.'

Tlle Temple Gardens present a nice breathing place for the children, and
older persons too, who have to live ill tlle noisy, bustling City. Here they can
run about, and admire the flowers, or sit and enjoy the breeze from the river-
Il'ifty years or so ago the garden was famous for its red and white roses; and
so it appears to have been in Shakespeare's time; for the roses seem to have
caught his observant eye, and he takes this garden as the scene ill which
Plantagenet plucked the white rose, and Somerset the red, as symbols of their
respective parties--flowers which became of such fatal meaning ill the Wars of
the Roses. ' Since,' cries Plantagenet--

' Since you are tongue-tied, and so lotll to speak,
In dumb significance proclaim your thoughts.
Let him that is a true-born gentleman,
And stands upon the honour of his birth,
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
From oif this bricr pluck a white rose with me.'

Alld Somerset, ill reply to the challenge, cries:

' Let him that is no coward nor no flattcrcl',
But dare maintain the party of the truth,
Pluck a red rose from off this them with me.'

Well, there are plenty of flowers still ill the Temple Gardens ; bllt yell and
I will neither pluck them, nor indulge in strife with tongue or hand.

We must not leave the halls and lanes and courts without noticing the
sun-dials which still remain as relics of the olden time. No doubt they were
very useful ill the days when watches were scarce--that is, supposing that the
sun shone every day ill those times. Most of them have mottoes. One in
Essex Court has the appropriate Latin words: Vexll'gia, nulla retrorsum ,- which
may be translated, very freely, as meaning that if once you enter llpon a law-
suit, you cannot retrace your steps; there is no backing out of it. Thanks
for the warning! In Brick Court, where Oliver Goldsmith lived and died,
there is a dial with a lllotto which, one may suppose, must often have caught the
eye of that erratic genius, and perhaps relllillded hilu of work unfinished: ' Timenu: xxw Luv comm.72 THE NE W LA W COURTS.

and tide wait for no man.' On a dial in Pump Court appears the appropriate
sentiment: ' Shadows we are and like shadows depart.' But perhaps the
most striking motto was one which adorned the dial on an old house at the
east end of Inner Temple Terrace, now pulled down], to this effect: ' Begonc
about your business : ' words which we might suppose to have been addressed
to a client who had paid his fees, but which are said to have been shouted by
an old ' bencher ' to a tiresome lad who had come from the dial-maker's for a
motto, and who thought he had here got what he wanted.

From the quiet of the Temple we will emerge into the noise of Fleet
Street, and, by taking a few careful steps, arrive at Tm: New LAW COURTS.

This splendid building, which we find on our right hand as we go westward
from the City, forms an irregular square; its front towards the Strand being
four hundred and eighty-four feet in length, while the depth from the
Strand to Carey Street is four hundred and seventy feet. The southern,
northern, and western fronts are of Portland stone, but the eastern has red
bricks interspersed with the stone, as also have the interior courts and
quadrangles. Each front is relieved by dwarf towers, arches, and other
features; and there are two high towers, one at the south-east angle, and one
at the eastern end of Carey Street, the former of which is one hundred aml
seventy feet in height, or nearly four times the height of old Temple Bar.

The general height of this great building is about ninety-five feet; and
above its main or western block towers the large Central Hall, which from
its base to the top of its roof measures one hundred and forty feet. The
architect's plan has given accommodation to no less than eighteen distinct
courts of law, each with its own entrance and staircase, and separate approaches
and doors for the judges, the jury, the witnesses, the bar, and the public,
together with rooms for clerks, secretaries, and registrars; and also waiting-
rooms. These last, I should think, are really necdfnl apartments ; for we most
of us know what a very tedious ail'air a lawsuit generally is.

The first brick of this National Palace of Justice was laid, on the last
day of April, 1874, at the junction of Bell Yard and Corey Street; and the
complete buildings were opened by Her Majesty on December 4th, 1882. It was
a grand sight. Every house in the Strand was gaily decorated; and as the
Queen and her retinne passed along, the bells of the churches rang merrily,
and the crowd of spectators cheered long and lustily. When Her MajestyT111: 110 USES 01" I'ARLIAJIIL'NT. 7 3

arrived at the Central Hall, a procession was formed; and first went the
builders, Messrs. Edward and Henry Bull, and the architect, Mr. Street;
next came the Attorney General and the Solicitor General, in their best wigs-
aud gowns; then the Judges, the Lord Chancellor being the hiudmost; next
various oilicials and Mr. Gladstone; and then the Queen, followed by her sons
and daughters; the royal attendants bringing up the rear. ller Majesty
proceeded to the throne which had been placed on a dais, or raised iloor; and,
after the key of the building had been presented to her, and then transferred
to the keeping of the Lord Chancellor, she read a short address, in which she
expressed her trust that the uniting together of the various branches of
judicatnre in this the supreme court would eonduee to the more etlicient and
speedy discharge of justice to her subjects; and that the learning and inde-
pendence of her judges would prove in the future, as in time past, the chief
security of the rights of her crown and the liberties of her people. The
Lord Chancellor replied ; the Archbishop of York oil'ercd up a special prayer;
and then Sir William Harcourt, by the Queen's direction, declared the building
opened, and the state trumpetcrs gave a flourish of trumpets to mark the
event.

Well, it is a line palace, and there are generally plenty of clever men
speechifying in its various courts; but I think you will agree with me that it is
best to have as little to do with lawsuits as possible, however grand _the apart-
ments in which they may be heard.

Leaving the New Law Courts, and making our way once more towards "'est-
minster Bridge, we come to the grand pile of buildings which contains the two
HOUSES 0F PARLIAMENT and all their belongings, and which, when seen from
the river or the bridge, presents a very striking appearance. The buildings,
though no longer new, are quite modern, and replace the old and inconvenient
rooms in which the Lords and Commons used to sit and debate. It was on the
evening of October 16th, 1834-, that sheets of ilame were seen to rise just
behind Westminster Hall, and the news soon spread all over London that
the Houses of Parliament were on fire. I scarcely need tell you that an
immense crowd speedily assembled at Westminster. The bridge was all alive
with spectators, some of whom even ventured to stand on the narrow ledge
outside the parapets and next the water. Quickly the engines arrived, and
water began to combat tire. The battle raged for many hours, and it was74 THE HOUSES 0F PARLIAMENT.

feared that Westminster Hall, so venerable and so rich in historic memories,
would l'all a victim to the audacious flames. But as morning dawned, the

ancient Hall was found still standing. The old House of Conunons--'St.
Stephen's ('lmpvl'--'rns utterly destroyed, whilst the old House of Lords,
alliuinin; it. n 2:! "m u spared.

What was (1) he done? The members of Parliament must haw:- mtnr
place to meet in. So the Lords were put for a time into another ancient,
room--the Painted Chamber--and their House was assigned to the Commons,
till a new palace for both of them should be built. Accordingly Sir Charles
Barry was emphn'cd to design and build the ueedfnl Houses; and after the
lapse of several years this noble structure was completed. The front towards
the river and that towards the land are splendid pieces of architecture; and
the Victoria Tower, rising high above the southern end of the land front,
seems like the main shaft o.' some gigantic cathedral built by the mighty men
of old; whilst at the northern end, next the bridge, rises the lofty Clock Tower ;
to which we will presently pay a visit.

This immense pile of buildings is so well proportioned in its various details
that we do not at first realize how great its bulk really is. It actually covers
nearlv eight acres of ground. It has alarm hmulrenl rooms, one hundred
stain ~ s, and more than three miles of corridors, or pas' ges! Its river
front is nine hundred feet long, and is decorated with the statues and arms
of the kings and queens of England from the Conquest to our own days.
The Victoria. Tower is seventy-live feet square, and rises to the height of
three hundred and forty feet.

These new IIouscs take into their precincts old Westminster Hall, and
the crypt of St. Stephen's Chapel--an ancient collar, or vault, which has been
brightened and decorated, and is fitted up as a chapel, for the use of mem-
bers of Parliament. Passing through the line old Hall, with its marvellous
roof, we come to the Central Octagon Hall--a grand apartment, eighty feet
high--from which the right hand passage will take us to the 'Lords,' and the
tell: to the 'Connnons.' The House of Peers is a noble room, magnificently
fitted up, having eighteen niches for statues of the Magna Charta barons,
and twelve windows of stained glass, which at night are lighted from the
outside. Amongst the notable things in this apartment are, the throne on
which the Queen sits when she opens Parliament, the chair for the Prince of
Wales, and the 'woolsack' for the Lord Cliaiiccllor; the large frescoes, or
pictures painted on the walls themselves; and the Reporters' and Strangers'
Galleries The House of Commons is not so highly adorned as the Lords',
but it is also very beautiful. Its windows are of stained glass, and its walls
are lined with carved oak.

'lnr roval entrance is under the Victoria Tower, and leads to the .'(o'unan
Porch 2 then on the right hand is the Queen's Rolling Room, ornamented with
frescoes representing (imaginary) scenes in the life of King Arthur. Thence
we pass along a grand room, lofty, wide, and long--the Victoria Gallery, the
ceiling of which is richly gilt and emblazoned, while its windows are of stained
glass, and its walls are decorated with frescoes depicting scenes in English
history. One of the largest shows us the meeting of Wellington and Blucher
after (he battle of Waterloo ,- and on the opposite side is a painting of the death
of Nelson: both pictures of intense interest, and not easily forgotten

We will now pass on to one of the most remarkable portions of this
wonderful block of grand buildings. The CLOCK Town: was, as its name
imports, mainly built for the purpose of supporting the great clock and its
monster set of bells; and since the machinery for measuring time was first
invented, no clock-case so large and elaborate has yet been contrived. Its
whole height is divided into nine storeys, exclusive of the clock-room, bell-
chambcr, and lantern. Each of these floors is divided into at least four, and
sometimes many more apartments, which run parallel with each of the four
faces of the :towcr. The inside of the tower (within these rooms) is twenty-
eight feet square, and is occupied first by an air-shaft, eight feet wide, for
ventilating the whole of the Houses of Parliament, and which rises to the
very top 5 and secondly, by the clock-shaft, a small inner tower of brickwork.
This latter is the shaft on which the great clock stands, and down which its
weights descend. It is one hundred and sixty feet high, eleven feet long by
eight feet six inches wide, and its wall is twenty inches thick. This space was
only just enough to admit of ' Big Ben' getting to the top of the tower : he
had to go up sideways, for he is nine and a half feet ill diameter and seven
feet ten inches high. The lower floors of the tower are ordinary offices.

Access to the upper parts of the tower is gained by a spiral staircase,
which is of a great length. For the first hundred steps or so, the way is
lit with gas, and the air is close and oppressive. With the next hundred you
emerge into the dim daylight, which now and then one of the sixty-eight
windows that adorn the tower throws across the staircase. A hundred steps
more, and the way is dark again, and you instinctively feel you have attained
a great height, and walk with nervous caution, or look shudderingly over the
rails down the well-stairs, which seem to end in a faint. bluish light, dimly
seen far beneath. Another eti'ort, and sorely out of breath--for you have
climbed three hundred and thirty steps in all--you are in the clock-room.
It is a lofty, dark ehainber--twenty-eight feet by nineteen, and some twenty-
five feet high.

If the whole apparatus of the great clock were made to be wound by
hand, it would require four or five hours' continuous whaling each day; and
even then would cause such hard labour as would be too much almost forMEETING OF WELLINGTON AND BLUCHER.78 THE CLOCK TOWER.

convicts; the handle would have to be turned some four or five thousand times.
and weights of many tons drawn up to a height of one hundred and fifty-six
feet. It is, therefore, wound up by water, by means of a self-acting machine.
Every dial-frame--and there are four of them--weighs four tons, and is
twenty-two feet six inches in diameter. The space between each minute-mark
on the face is one foot two inches; the figures are upwards of two feet high,
and nearly six feet apart. The Ininnte-lnunl is sixteen feet long, and notwith-
standing that it is made of copper beaten out as thin as is consistent with its
length and strength, it still weighs two hundredweight. The hour-hand is
nine feet long, and is fastened with the minute-hand to the centre of the dial
by a huge gilt rose, (part of the arms of 'Westminster,) which is about the
size of a small table. All the spaces between the figures and work on the
clock-face are glazed with enamelled glass, sous to present the appearance
of a white dial in the day, and allow it to he illuminated during the night.
Each dial is lit with sixty gas jets, which are turned on and oil' by a peculiar
adaptation of the clock-work. The cost of the gas for this is PS500 per annual.
The single-dial clock at Mechlin, in Belgium, is larger than these dials, but
for a. tour-dialled clock there is none in the world with such large faces. St.
Paul's clock has only two seventeen feet dials, and is wound up every day; and
next to this, the largest clock in the United Kingdom is that of Shandozi
Church, at Cork, which has four dials, each sixteen feet in diameter.

Leaving the dial--rooms, we again ascend that wearisome staircase, till at
last it terminates in the bright.sunlight,more than two hundred feet. above the
streets, amid light handsome arches, with the outside Gothic work of hannnered
iron, all richly gilded. This is the hell-chamber, where the iron tongues of
the clock below are placed. The mechanism by which ' Big Ben' and his
chiming smaller bells are suspended is simple, yet beautifully adapted to its
purpose. The whole apparatus only weighs some fourteen tons; yet. it is no
exaggeration to say that it is alumst strong enough to hear the whole tower.
The actual weight of the five bells it supports, with their hammers, is upwards
of thirty tons. ' Big Ben' hangs in the centre of a beam called the 'collar,'
and weighs sixteen tons. His thundering note is E natural. The hammer
and lever which strike the note weigh together one ton.

So much for the bell-chamber and its hard, gloomy inmates. They are
fixed in their places, and can never ring a joyful pea], but only mark the passage
of the fleeting hours, or be tolled slowly for some great calamity, which shall
how our heads in mourning. From the bell-chamber the works go higher
still, but the stairs cease, and the lofty points beyond are only to he gained
by mounting ladders, which are raised from one perilous scaffolding to another.
Slowly the visitor climbs, creeping from ladder to ladder, catching through
small openings now and then a dizzy glimpse of roofs and tops of lofty
buildings, with the mighty city, half hidden in its smoke, spread like a map

far down beneath him. A short ladder leads from this place to the lantern
gallery, where you seem suddenly to enter fairy-hind, and are dazzled with the
brillianey of gold and colour around. You are now high over the clock, and
beneath the pointed roof. The work which from below seemed such light
tracery and network of golden lines, is suddenly transformed to heams, shields,
and flying arches, so massive in themselves as almost to form another tower,80 ST. THOR/ASS HOSPITAL.

and so thickly gilded that they seem as if wrought from the solid precious
metal. Higher than this lantern-gallery the visitor cannot go, though the
pointed roof is still one hundred feet above him, and, light and graceful as it
appears from the ground, yet it nevertheless actually contains four hundred
tons of iron!

Once again upon the ground, the great Clock Tower seems to us more
lofty and magnificent than ever. It is merely one ornamental portion of our
Houses of Parliament, but it' it stood alone it would still bca grand monument
of taste and skill.

0n the Opposite side of the Thames, the Embankment is continued on the
Surrey shore up the river, as far as Vauxhall Bridge, giving a Parisian aspect
to the whole scene. 'But what are these? ' a stranger is sure to ask, as he
points to a number of new buildings, extending from the Surrey end of \Vest-
minster Bridge for several hundred yards along the Emlmulnnent, and directly
facing the Houses of Parliament. These buildings, I reply, are the new 81'.
Tnonas's HOSPITAL; and here one of the oldest medical charities of London,
after having been dislodged from its ancient: residence near London Bridge,
has found a new and costly home.

The hospitals of London form an important part of its benevolent institu-
tions. Some of them--as St. Luke's and Bethlehem (better known as Bedlam)
--are for the insane. Others are for aged pensioners who have served their
country in the army or navy. At that of Chelsea many an old soldier still
'shouldcrs his crutch, and shows how fields were won.' But at Greenwich
the venerable Jack 'l'ars, who spun long yarns by the banks of the Thames,
have been 'improved' out ofthe place. The largernumber of London hospitals,
however, are for the sick and hurt. In addition to the smaller ones, supported
mainly by voluntary contributions, such as Charing Cross, King's College, and
University College Hospitals, there are the large institutions of this kind with
considerable endowments belonging to them. As deserving of special notice
may be mentioned St. Bartholomen"s Hospital, which was founded by Rahere,
the king's niinx-trel, in the year [102, and re-tounded by Henry VIII. in 1546;
Guy's Hospital, founded by Thomas Guy, :1 London bookseller, in 17:21; and
St. 'l'honias's Hospital, which is the subject of this sketch.

The date given for the foundation of this noble charity for the reception
of the necessitous sick and injured is AJ). 1553. It was in that year that King
I-ldward V1. incorporated a society of persons for its government. Still it had
an existence before it received a. royal charter. It had its origin really as
early as the year 1215, when Peter de Rnpibns, Bishop of Winchester, erected
a building, as a kind of hospital, dedicated it to St. Thomas the Apostle, and
endowed it with certain lands, in connection with a priory in Southwark. In
1428 one of the abbots granted the fonmlation lands to Nicholas Bnckland,
master of the hospital; and so they remained until ' Blufl' llarry turned the
eowls adrift' at the dissolution of the monasteries. During the reign of his
son Edward VI. the corporation of London purchased the manor of Sonthwark
from the King, St. 'i'homas's Hospital being part of the purchase. The city
immediately repaired and enlarged it, and the young King granted the cllarter
of incorporation already referred to.

Since its foundation, St. Thomas's Hospital has had its vicissitudes. By
the great [ire of London, nmch of its house property was destroyed, :md the
charity would have been completely ruined, only that the governors and citizens
came to the rescue with large and liberal contributions. In consequence of
the help thus afforded, the hospital was considerably enlarged in the reign of
\Villiam III. The last great change is that which has removed the locale of
the institution from the old site near London Bridge, which it occupied for
several centuries, to the new buildings near \Vestminster Bridge. The change
was not altogether the result of choice on the part of the governors, but has
been necessitated by the exigencies of this railway age. The plain story is
this :--Thc directors of the South-Eastern Railway Company wished to carry
their line across the Thames to Cannon Street. In order to this, they required
apart of the hospital premises; but the directors, judging that giving up a
part would spoil the remainder, compelled the company to take the whole.
With the purchase money, which amounted to nearly PS400,000, they have
erected the new buildings. In the interim, between the pulling down of the
old hospital and the opening of the new, the institution took refuge in the
Surrey Music Ilall.

St. Thomas's Hospital has had its share of royal favour. Edward VI.
is recognised as the founder; and now Queen Victoria appears as its patroness
and friend in connection with the new buildings. 0n the 13th of September,
1868, Her Majesty, accompanied by the Prince of \Vales, and other members
of the royal family, laid the foundation-stone at Stangate, Lambeth, with a
golden trowel. It was, therefore, only in harmony with all this that the noble

7
chain of buildings known as ' the new St. Thomas's Hospital' was opened for
the reception of patients by England's Queen in 1871, and received at its in-
augural ceremonial the benediction of English Christianity.

Nearly half of the site of this noble hospital has been reclaimed from the
mud of the river. Its buildings have a frontage of about seventeen hundred
feet, and are about two hundred and fifty feet in depth. They consist of no
less than eight large blocks, or ' pavilions,' and are joined together hya double
corridor. The entrance hall, facing Lambeth Palace Road, contains a statue
of the Queen, represented as seated on a chair of state, in her full robes.
The hospital can make up no less than six hundred and fifty beds for patients;
and you will have some idea of its immense size, when I tell you that, including
wards, houses, out-offices, kitchens, sculleries, stores, and cellars, it contains
nearly a thousand distinct compartments !~ 4-111113%}:31'11"

Till-Z unxrlsn MUSEUM--Tl": xw'noxu. GALLERY.

"5 [ill next walk shall be to [he lllu'rlsn Museum, a building which
' our young friends may truly say belongs to them. For though
you are young and small, you are members of the great British
nation, that. owns this wonderful Museum. The. Museum owes
.. its origin to the fact that Sir Hans Sloane, who (luring his lifev
time had gathered together a very large and valuable collection of natural
history specimens and works of art, besides a considerable library of books,
which had cost him in all fifty thousand pounds, ofl'ered these, in the terms of34 71-115 BRITISH zllUSEl/iil.

his will, to the Government, on condition that twenty thousand pounds should
be paid to his family. This offer was accepted; and the whole, with the books
and manuscripts of Sir John Cotton and Robert Harley, were arranged
together in Montague House. The new institution, thenccforth called 'the
British Musemn,' was opened in 1759.

From that time purchases and gifts succeeded each other rapidly; and
riches poured in from all quarters, gradually filling up all the space. On
receipt of the magnificent gift from George IV. of his father's extensive library,
the authorities decided to pull down old Montague House and erect one much
larger--the present building, which was completed in 184-7.

The appearance of the front is very imposing, impressing one with the
idea that the architect, Sir Robert Smirke, meant the structure to last for
many generations.

The rooms on the ground floor to our right are the Grenville Library,
Manuscript Room, and King's Library. To our left are the Sculpture Galleries,
Roman, Grmco-Roman, Greek, Mausoleum, Elgin, Hellenic, Kouyunjik, Nim-
road, Assyrian, and Egyptian rooms. Ascending the principal staircase, the
rooms in front of us are the Southern, Eastern, and Northern Zoological
galleries--now to be appropriated to other purposes--the Egyptian, Vase,
Bronze, British and I\Iedi:eval, Ornament, and Ethnographical rooms.

Now, I think, you will agree with me, that with the contents of so many
rooms to look at, one visit is not enough. Any one who only gives this Museum
a hasty visit, in which he tries to see the whole, will most likely go away with a
terrible mixture of statues and stuffed monkeys, birds' nests and mummies, &c.,
in his mind, and without a clear idea of any one object. '

We will begin with the Library department. Here is a fine large circular-
reading-room, containing nearly a million and a half of books. A copy of the
best edition of every book published in the United Kingdom is sent to this
library, but, of course, only a comparatively small number can be exposed to
view. Multitude: of volumes are stowed away in the cellars. Passing through
the door on the right of the Entrance Hall, we enter the Grenville Library.
What rare old books are kept here! Look at those in the cases around the
wall. In the table cases we see the ' Block-books,' or books printed from wood~
blocks, which were used before the invention of printing with movable metal type.

How very interesting is this next room! for here are stored the hand-
writings of many of our kings and celebrated persons of whom we read in05in! annex,

history. There is one specimen which I want you to look at particulan'ly. It
was written by William, Duke of Cumberland, when he was only six years old.
I think you will say it is excellent. Here we see the handwriting of Edward
VI., Elizabeth, Anne Boleyn, Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Jane Grey; and in
another case, autographs of Milton, Locke, Johnson, Burns, and Scott. Ilow
interesting to boys is this sketch plan of the battle of Aboukir, d 'awn by Lord
Nelson! In another case, amongst the letters of eminent men, we linger over
these of Luther, Wolsey, Cranmer, Raleigh, Wren, Wilkic, llandel, and Charles
Dickens. Here, too, is the unfinished letter written by Nelson on the eve of
the battle of T 'ai'algar. A complete set of impressions of the Great Seals of
English sovereigns, from Edward the Confessor to Queen Victoria, is kept in
this room.

Satisfying ourselves with these peeps into past ages, we pass on to the
King's Library, a special room built to contain the books which belonged to
George III. The whole space above and below the gallery is occupied by book-
'ases. Here we come face to face with the first efforts of that wonderful
power, the printing-press, and can gaze on the earliest complete printed
book known, the Mazarin Bible, so called because the copy which tirst attracted
attention was found in the library of Cardinal Mazarin. Early specimens of
printing from Germany, Italy, l'V 'ance, and England are here; and amongst the
latte ' are books printed by \Villiam Caxton, the first English printer. On the
screens are views of old and new London; and in cases are various medals.

Turning to the left, we enter the Roman Gallery of Sculptures. The pieces
of tesselatcd pavement which we see here were long ages ago trodden by the
Roman conquerors ol' the Britons, and were discovered in London and else-
where. These sculptures are more generally known as the 'l'ownley Marbles,
and are the work of men who lived many centuries ago. As we pass through
the galleries, we shall notice groups of students engaged in carefully copying
seine of the statues. In the thirdGraeco--Roman room our attention is at once
att acted to the remains of the famous Mausoleum, which so greatly excelled
all other sepulcln'al monuments in size, beauty of design, and richness of
decoration, that it was reckoned one ofthe seven wonders of the ancient world.
The fragments of the colossal horses, lions, and other sculptures, giro some
idea of its immense size.

I" sing on to the Assyrian antiquities, we come to remains frmn Kouyun-
jik, which is supposed to be built on the spot where Nineveh once stood.THE BR] T ISII MUSE UM. 87

Many of the slabs, &c., were taken from the palace of Sennaeherib, and some
were found split and shattered by fire, the palace having been burnt, probably
at the destruction of Nineveh. All my young friends who study their Bibles
will be much interested in the fragments of tablets giving accounts of the
Creation, Deluge, and Tower of Babel; and in the seals and engraved stones
bearing the names ofNebucliadnezzar, Sennacherib, and one with the words, ' I
am Darius, the Great King.' In the Egyptian rooms, we are struck with
wonder in gazing at the gigantic heads of their gods and heroes. What an
amount of time and patience must have been expended on them; and on this
enormous dark granite sacred beetle, and the sarcophagi and mummy tombs,
each covered with hieroglyphics ! The key to the language of the inscriptions
was furnished by the Rosetta Stone, which is here--a thick black slab, with
three inscriptions cut into its smooth upper surface; one in Egyptian hiero-
glyphic-s, one in the ancient spoken. language of Egpt, and one in Greek.
Many of these remains date from a period as far back as 2000 years 3.0., and
fell into the hands of the British army at the capitulation of Alexandria. But
we have seen enough for one visit.

Taking our way to the north-west corner, where we finished our last visit,
we will now ascend the staircase, and half-way up we shall obtain a good view
of the monster head of Rameses II. \Ve will turn into the rooms on our right,
where are placed the smaller Egyptian remains. Here are the cmbahncd
bodies of their sacred cats, birds, fish, and reptiles; small figures of bronze,
silver, and gold; personal ornaments and articles of dress, implements for
domestic use: all showing the high civilization and luxury to which this people
had attained. Here, too, we are struck with wonder at the sight of mummies
who were alive as far back as the time when Moses and the Israelites were
in Egypt.

What a splendid collection of glass is in the next room! We linger over
it, delighted with the patterns and brilliant colours. As we proceed, we notice
the vases, terra--cottas, mural paintings, and bronzes, of Greek and Roman
workmanship. The stone celts, daggers, swords, and pottery carry our
thoughts back to the rough inhabitants of the British Isles before the Roman
invasion. Personal ornaments and drinking cups represent the Anglo-Saxon
period. In a separate room, amongst a collection of ancient and modern
jewellery, is the noted Portland Vase.SS THE BRITISH fill/'SEL'J .

The. next room is crowded with curiosities: the quunnaux'. T's-cw
Zealander, and other foreigners are represented by implements of labour,
warlike weapons, and instruments of music. Bow and a 'rows, canoes,
harpooas, and tomahawks are ranged around. Here is a feather head-dress,
asnit of armour made of cocoa-nut fibre, a Chinese bronze bell, an inlaid
Indian cabinet. In the centre of the room, in a case, are objects illustrative
of Arctic Expeditions, giving us some idea of the enormous dillieulties which
the brave fellows have to fight- against in the extreme North.

We will now --for the last time in this building--the Zoological
Galleries, which we. reach by mounting the grand staircase. The rhinoceros
here must. hare had a fierce battle for his life,judging' by the number of bullet-
holes in his thick skin. Yonder is a fine walrus. Whilst gazing about, we
catch sight of the small-eyed, formidable hippopotanms, the graceful deer and
antelope, and the gentle, soft blue-eyed gazelle. In the next room : -e the
eland, llama, and that bulky but useful elk. Our friends from the Isle. of
Wight will be glad to see the magnificent basking-shark which was caught.
near Shanklin in 1875. And here is amusk-ox, killed (luring~ the last Arctic
expedition ; and there the armadillo, covered with coated mail. Look at. this
skeleton of the whale, and at the lmrwhal,whose tusk was very highly valued for
its ivory, and in former times was believed to be the horn of the unicorn. Here
are monk s of all kinds, hymnas, bears, and lions, and an array of others that.
would take no little time to enumerate. There 'also a fine collection of corals.

Our next turn brings us to the magnificent collection of birds, shells, aml
eggs. Stuffed birds of all sizes, colours, and qualities; sweet singing, harsh
screeching, perching, climbing, slender and hard-beaked birds; birds of prey;
birds incapable of flying, but noted for their powers of running; and the
web-footed tinnily. Amongst: them we recognise many fanniliar friends, and
are pleased to make acquaintance with those that are strangers. They are 2:.
goodly company, and a line feast for your eyes when you visit them. ""0 turn
to the. table-cases to see their eggs, and then from one path of beauty pass on
to another. The shells lilll attention. Ah! we could linger around these
~ases, admiring their exquisite contents. The shells ditl'er as much in size as
in colour, and in shape as in size.

In the northern gallery we see the turtles and tortoises, toads and frogs,
lizards and crocodiles, snakes and serpents, sea eggs and starfish, butterflies
and moths, wasps alld their nests, beetles and spiders, fishes and crabs, and.TIIE NATIONAL GALLERY. 89

the ingenious nests of the tailor-birds. Nor must we omit to look at the
giant land tortoise at the entrance to this gallery, which is known to have
been eighty years of age, and weighed eight hundred and seventy pounds.

We will now s v 'good-bye ' to this beautiful collection of objects of natural
history; promising ourselves the pleasure of seeing it all again, rc-arrmigcd
amt with plenty of room, in its new house at South Kensington.

And so we come out of this wonderful building into the open air again,
thankful toharc seen so many marvellous illustrations ofGod's creative power,
aml of man's skill and ingenuity.

Very few buildings occupy such a fine position as this NATIONAL GALLERY
of paintings. It faces the north side of Trafal r Square, which, with its
noble Nelson's monument and sparkling fountains, forms a pretty, open
frontispicce from which to View the buildin". The style of the architecture
does not satisfy everybody, and seine one has lnunorously given the name of
'peppcr-castcrs' to the three domes which rise from it. It has, however, a
noble portico in the centre.

A Mr. Angersteiu, who was a very rich gentleman and also a passionate
admirer of art, during his lifetime bought with an uuspariug hand the paintings
of the great masters. These pictures after his death were purchased by the
British Government, and thus the foundation of the National Gallery of
pictures was laid. Liberal gifts from generous donors, amongst whom we.
may especially mention Mr. Vernon, together with purchases by Government,
have swelled the Gallery to its now splendid condition.

I am now opposite a picture (No. 1) by that great friend of animals, Sir
Edwin Landseer. The scene is inside a smithy; the smith is engaged in
shoeing a valuable bay mare. Judging by the expression of the animal's eye,
the process must be a painful one; but the farricr, we hope, is a skilful
workman, and will not hurt. more than is necessary the horse's tender hoof.
The horse's head is not held, and the story goes that this horse, which was
lent to the artist when he was in weak health and reeonnncmlcd horse exercise,
would only consent to be shod if accompanied by two personal friends, a donkey
. and a dog, and then his head was allowed to remain loose. Inthc next picture
(No. 2) Landseer had in his mind's eye the well known anecdote of the visit
of Alexander the (treat to the philosopher Diogenes; when the great.
conqueror opened conversation! with, '1 am Alexander the Great,' to which
the other replied, '.-\nd 1 am Diogenes the Cynie.' When asked in what way
Alexander could best serve him, Diogenes 'ejoined, ' You can stand out of my
sunshine.' So this dog seems to say to the haughty one standing in front of
his tub: 'Yon can best serve me by standing out of the sunshine.' No. 3 is

Jesus longed to teach and save the people, but they hated liim, and sought to
destroy llim. Seeing the city in all its glory, His soul poured out its longing
in pitying words: '0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, . . . how often would I have
gathered thy children together! ' 0 l I hope Jesus will not have to say ot'yon
as He did of those people, ' And ye would not! '

We are now looking at the ' Watering l'laee' (No. 15), by Gainsborough.
It is evening, the sun has sunk behind the hills, and twilight is coming on
apacc. A solemn stillness has settled over the scene, broken only by the lowing
ot' the cattle and the splashing ot' the water as they enjoy the coolingdraught.
The smoke is rising from some cottage chimney in the distance, where doubt-
less the good housewife is preparing the evening meal for the young people
who are watching the cattle.

Last, but not least, amongst the paintings are those of Turner; what
grand, noble pictures they are! The objects depicted seem to move. Stand in
front of one, and the express train rushing acressthe viaduct looks as though
it would rush amongst us. Look at the ' Mail Boat in a Storm.' we almost.
expect to see it glide swiftly into the hollow between the two waves. Get
opposite "l'he Fighting Temeraire' (No 16), and we can very well fancy we
hear the snorting of the little tug as she takes the great ninety-eight gunner
to her last berth. No.17, by the same artist, is an illustration of Byron's
Childc Harold's Pilgrimage.

knowledge was only small, but. little by little it grew to great knowledge.
Once the canvas had only what appeared frightful smears on it, but little
brushes and big, little bits of paint and large, little gmins of knowledge, have
by degrees made finished works. Now you are small, one of the little people.
Little heads cannot think great thoughts, nor little hands do great things.

Yet. I think little heads and hands and hearts are able to do some good works.

CHAPTER IX.

VIALKS IS THE 'ZOO.'

' HO has not heard of the 'Zoo'? as those wonderful Gardens in
" Regent's Park are called, because they contain the living property
' '1' ofthe Zoological Society of London. Almost all parents of London
children who can afford to do so take their families to see the

' Zoo ' ; and there visitors from the country must go, or they will
miss one of the best sights of the metropolis. Here, too, the foreigner betakes
himself, fearless of the cries from the animals, for he does not now tread the
dangerous paths of the jungle, but the well-kept gardens in which the terrors
of his native country are securely caged. And so it is we fiml the African
calmly gazing into the eyes of the lion, and the Hindoo fearlessly regarding
the fierce tiger, the sight of which, or the sound of whose voice, in his native
land, would have filled his breast with alarm.

In my early (lays, when my schoolmaster once took his boys to the ' Zoo,'
I remember being extremely pleased because we were allowed to pay om-
respccts to his majesty the lion before we visited any of the other animals.
"'e were all eager to see a real, live lion; but I rather fancy some of us had
been associating size with grandeur and might, and were expecting to see
something larger, and were not a little disappointed when we were in the
presence of this monarch of beasts. He looked harmless and unimportant,
and only lay sleepily blinking at as. .\h! he is caged. There is no open
desert here, or he would be able to show his power by bounding in pm" at of
prey, and, with one stroke of that softvlookingpaw, bringing down a massive ox.
Returning later in the day to see him fed, we were rather glad to see him
hungrily and impatiently pacing up and down his cage, occasionally springing
from side to side, and beating against the partition. lIow amazed we were--
though I fancy some of us were a wee bit frightened--when he opened his
mouth slightly and made the sound of his roar roll around the building! Pre-
sently the keeper came along with his barrow of meat, and told him to lift one
of the bars that the keeper had uut'asteued, so that. his dinner might be put
in. And weren't. we boys delighted to see him do it, and then snatch the meat
into his cage, and lie down with it under his paws, growling, asnmeh as to say
to the keeper, who made pretence to take it away again, 'Yon touch it, it'
you dare !'

The lion is found principally in Africa, and in some parts of Asia, as Arabia
and India. 'King ofthe Forest,' he is :ometimes named, but he likes to keep
away from deep forests, and live in the open plains, in which the shelter of
occasional bushes, thickets, and rocks may be foam]. When fully grown, his
colour is that linown as tawny, or yellowish-browu, which diminishes gradually
to pale yellow on the under parts. The hair of his shaggy mane deepens to
very dark brown at the ends; and his tail ends in a tuft of dark hair. He will
sometimes grow till his body alone measures about eight feet, and then beyond
that have a tail nearly four feet loner. He is extremely unlscular, and con-
sequcntly very powerful; so that when seen in his natural state he must
be a formidable-looking fellow indeed. His wife is nulch smaller, and a. little
lighter in colour than his lordship, and does not possess amane. Of course the
lion and his family must eat, and it happens that he has a. particular fondness
for the flesh of the deer and antelope. And Mrs. Lion, when she has a family
of little ones who need some dainty morsel for their tender gums, treats them
to a nice piece of lamb, which she steals from the nearest fiu-mym'd.

In the barbarous sports of the ancient Romans, many noble Christian men
and women have been placed in the arena to be killed and devoured by the
hungry lions. But their souls have passed to the gates of heaven, to dwell
with the Lion of the tribe of Jmlah.

But we must not give all on - attention to the lion. A native of the jungle
and deep forests, through which a path or road of some sort passes, now is
neighbour to the lion at the ' Zoo.' The Tiger is a fine bright, tawny fellow,
beautifully marked with black stripes. He is not equal, perhaps, to the lion
in size and strength, but is much more graceful and active. Through the
tangled gia ' ot' the jungle and entwined undergrowth of the forest he winds
his way with great case, running swiftly and leaping immense distances.
During the day he hides in the closely grown wood, and at. night waits near
some piece of water amongst the tall grass for those animals who may come
to drink; and from these he cheeses his meal. He makes his lair a short
distance from some frequented pathway, and lies in wait for his prey.

And what do you think he is most delighted to see come across his path?
Nothing would make him lick his lips with greater pleasure than if some man,
woman, or (:l ild, would come along that way. For this he is often named
' the man-eater.' Should he not get enough of this sort of food near his home,
he will prowl around a village, snatching otl' the first chubby boy or girl he can
see. How thankful we should be that we do not live amidst such dangers!

The Leopard is little more than halfthe size of the tiger, and is the most
cunning of all those animals who live on the flesh of others. The colour of its
skin is yellow, becoming very pale on the lower parts. Each of its spots is
composed of tire or six small spots, arranged in a circle. It lives in woody
places, generally near some village, and is a great annoyance to the inhabitants.
He is a determined fellow, and when he descends on a farm he won't leave it
without some living thing; pig or poultry, sheep or dog, all are alike acceptable.
He has as many cunning tricks as a fox for enticing his prey, and is an excellent.
climber of trees, on which he crouchcs amongst the foliage, ready to spring
down on any unsuspecting victim that may pass. The leopard is found in
Africa, and in India and other parts of A.

The Jagu-vr's home is amongst the woods that surround the lakes and
rivers of America. It is much larger than the leopard, and the body is thicker.
it is the most powerful of American beasts of prey. The colour is usually a
rich yellow, with large spotted rings, each ring having a small black spotin the
centre. Itealso lurks amongst the branches of trees, and will even capture
the monkeys for his food.

   

 

 

S
Ilow wonderfully these animals are adapted for their natural habits ! The
lion prowls about the sandy desert for its food, and is coloured like the soil; so
that it is able to approach near the deer selected for its meal. The tiger is
striped, and amongst the tall jungle grass cannot be quickly discovered, and is
able to surprise its victims. The habits of the leopard and jaguar lead them
to climb the trees for food or for safety, and amongst the foliage the markings
of their fur resemble spots of sunshine glancing through the leaves. God is
their Maker ; God the Artist \Vho so wisely and beautifully marked them.
' 0 Lord, how manifold are Thy works! '

From the four-footed ferocious fellows, we will now cross the Gardens to
a house which contains a great number of a family whose name is Qltrulrumana.
What a hard word for you! It is used to point out animals having four hands.
This family is best known to us by the name ' Monkey.

At one of the gates to the park, there stands a stall kept. by an old man,
who seems to have a particular liking for these animals. I don't know if he
really imagines the monkeys to be the best part ofthe 'Zoo,' or whether he wishes
to clear out his stock-in-trade, but erery passer-by is asked to take some nuts
for the monkeys; and he often does what is known as a. ' roaring trade.'

' Let me give you a pcnuyworth,' he says, as we stop near his stall. So we
open our pockets and receive the contents of his well-tilled measure. And
what a lot of fun we may have with these nuts! Why, I don't believe there's
a boy in the kingdom who would not give some of his pence to have his pockets
stocked with a plentiful supply of nuts when he goes to the 'Zoo.'

The little monkeys seem to know that we have got something for them ;
for see how some of the boldest come around, thrustingtheir paws between the
bars for our gifts, while some of the timid ones want a lot of coaxing before
they cautiously creep near for a nut, to be enjoyed in the house in the top
corner, where they know it will not be stolen from them by the others. What
a lirely and noisy lot of chatterboxes they are, to be sure ! Look now at these
few chasing that big fellow up the bars, across the poles, from swing to swing,
and down across the floor, then up again, dodging and re-dodging, each trying
his best to get to him to take away what he has in his paw. He wins in the
scampcr, aml now sits Victoriously on that perch at the top of the cage, and,
with a. smaller companion, whom he has permitted to join in the fun, is busy
pulling to pieces the feathers aml ribbons which his thievish paws have snatched
from some visitor's bonnet.ICO WALKS I." 27115 'ZOO.'

What a lot of stories might be told about monkeys! for they almost all
possess a remarkable talent for imitation, and in many cases show greatintelli--
genec. Some people would have us believe that these monkeys are our
relations. They say that our ancestors must have been monkeys. But we
cannot at all agree with them in this fancy. )lonkeys may be very much like
us, but they were not formed to walk uprightly. You can't get a smile from
them. They can't talk, nor can they imitate our voices. They run on all-
fonrs, grin rery unpleasantly, and chatter most unmusieally. They themselves
don't recognise us as relations, for in their native homes, it'a man comes near,
they do their best to show him that he is not wanted, by throwing twigs at
him and by savagely screeching at him. The ""ord of God is truth, and in that
we read, ' God created man in His own image.'

But let us leave the monkeys and take a peep at some other inhabitants
of the ' Zoo.' Here, on a nice sandy piece of ground, is the Tortoise. Do you
know the diil'erenee between a tortoise and a turtle? The turtle's shell is
flat, so that he may swim in the water; but the tortoise lives on the land, and
his shell is elegantly :rched. The tortoise makes very good food for some
birds; but they don't always find it easy to get at him, his legs and head are
so soon taken into the shelter of his armour. The birds know this, and so look
out for some nice hard rock or sharp stone. They then pick Master Tortoise
up in their claws, give him a llight into the air till they are right above the
stone, and then let him drop. The poor fellow comes down so heavily on the
stone, that his armour is split up, and so the birds get at him and gobble him
up.

llere in the reptile house are the beautifully marked but very dangerous
Snakes; and in a case, if we look long enough, we may see some green frogs,
so green that it is difficult to distinguish them from the leaves of the plant
that is in the case. And here in a pond are the crocodiles. The ancient
Egyptians treated them as sacred reptiles. Those selected as the objects of
idolatrous worship were tamed, and sometimes took part in religious pro-
nessious. They are still considered sacred by some of the natives of Africa.
They keep them in ponds, with attendants to wait on them. But the Word of
God is being carried by our missionaries into those countries; aml where that
goes, superstition and idolatry give way before it.

We will now go to the row of houses near the clock-tower, to see some
of the animals which are kept there. Here is one fellow who no sooner catches
sight of us advancing towards his abode, than he raises himself on his hind-legs,
stretches his fore-legs up the bars of his cage, and shows us a line set of white
teeth set around the entrance to his red tunnel. Into this he expects us to
throw buns or some biscuits. Well, when we have satisfied his expectations
and his hunger for the moment--for he is one of those fellows who are con-
tinually hinting that the smallest contributions will be thankfully received--
he gets down on all-fours, that we may have a good look at him.

Master Brain, of the Bear family, is a clumsy, heavy-looking fellow, and
is very fond of squeezin". I know some little boys and girls who are fond of
squeezin'r. They will put their arms around father's or mother's neck and
given very loving squeeze. But Master Bruiu's hugs are very different. He
will squeeze fiercely, and is most dangerous at such close quarters; but
when caught and caged, he appears to make the best of a bad job, and
makes love--cupboard love--to all who collie near. Still, we must not go too
near.

The Grisly Bear, whose home is on the Rocky Mountains and the plains
of North America, is a very fierce fellow. If an enemy should happen to meet
him in his way, he will look steadily at him for a moment, then make a swift
rush, raise himself on his hind-legs and give a tremendous blow with his fore-
paw, inflicting deep cuts with his long claws. So strong is he that he is able
to carry away the body of a bison. This bca' and some others have a habit
of doing what we call 'putting by for a rainy day,' for he will often dig a pit
and bury what he may chance to kill. This habit has often been very useful
to hunters. If suddenly overtaken by this animal, they have stretched them-
selves along the ground, remaining quite still, as though they were dead; and
then Bruin, turning sexton, has scraped out a shallow g'ave, put the man in,
and covered him with earth. After a while the hunter wriggles out of his
unpleasant situation and makes his escape.

The Polar Bear is quite as large and fierce as the gr' - . Its head is flat,
its neck rather long, and its fur beautifully smooth and white. It lives on the
shores surrounding the North Pole, where it pursues seals both in the water
and on the ice, lying flat, as we see it in the picture, to watch for an oppor-
tunity to spring on its prey.

The common or Brown Bear was at one time a native of the British
Islands; and many were caught and carried to Rome, for the cruel sports
in which the Romans delighted. Private gentlemen, and even the nobility,
used also to keep them in pits, to get amusement by watching them fight with
dogs which were shut in the pit with them.

God has so made Bruin that, like other animals, he has not much difficulty
in satisfying his wants. His feet are armed with terrible curved claws, with
which he can tear a carcase, dig up the earth for roots, or climb a tree. And
the Polar bear also has the soles of his feet covered with hair, which helps
him to walk firmly and without slipping on the ice. Bruin's teeth and his
digestive organs are adapted to the food he eats. Nothing comes amiss to
him. He likes a snack of fish, or a potato, or an apple; he will visit a farm-
yard to get his leg of mutton or piece of pork, or make his way to some
garden to dig his own vegetables. But perhaps his greatest delight is to
climb a tree to enjoy a dip into :md lick his lips over the honey which the wild
bees provide. We make good use of him when dead. His skin is valued for
making fur cloaks, caps, &e.; his flesh is used as food, bear paws being eon-
sidcred very nice ; and the fat makes bear's-grcase for the hair. 'The mania
the fur cloak,' when winter approaches, cats enormous quantities of berries
and other food, which make him very fat. He then selects some cavern or
hollow tree, or he digs a hole, in which he sleeps throughout the winter. In
the spring he is very, very thin. In the Gardens there is a bear-pit; and from
the stone terrace above we may, by placing a ban on the point of an umbrella,
get Muster Bruin to climb his pole for it.

The IIymna may very well be called a scavenger among animals, for at
night he prowls about and eats the last remains of ear-eases which the tiger and
other larger animals have left. The spotted hya'na of South Africa is smaller
than the striped, but is more fierce and dangerous. Besides its ordinaryhowl-
ing, this animal indulges in a noise very much like laughter, and on this
account is often spoken of as ' the laughing hyzena.'

Travelling in some countries is made very unpleasant and dangerous
because of the Wolf. It is a little larger than a full-sized mastill'; the con-
tinuous roll of its fiery green eyeballs gives it a very terrible appearance. It
is a coward when by itself; but when numbers get together and huntin packs,
they will attack the strong reindeer or bull'alo or bear, and in lonely places
will venture to attack man. And so little feeling have they for one another,
that if one of them falls exhausted or wounded, the rest set upon and devour
it. It is the shepherd's enemy, for it often attacks the sheep. The wolf usedI. l'alc'm. a. Stork Paddock 2, Eagle.

at one time to have a home in England, but long ago the people exterminatcd
them. ltstill infests various countries of Europe and other parts of the world.

Cunning Master Reynard is still very often to be seen in England, and
visits filrmyards for the purpose of getting poultry. There are many different
sorts of foxes kept in the Gardens. When looking at some of them, we are
reminded of several passages of Scripture ; and especiallyof that very affecting
saying of our Lord: ' The foxes have holes . . . but the Son of Man hath
not where to lay His head.'

Vv'e want you now to come with us to visit some of the birds of the 'Zoo.'
There are some of many kinds. There are those we love because they live and
build and sing around us ; and there are the rich and rare kinds from countries
across the seas. \Ve will leave our homely feathered friends, and take our
walks amongst the curiously shaped and richly coloured ones that are perhaps
strangers to us.

First let us look at the king of birds--the Eagle. It makes its home in
the very wildest parts of the mountainous districts, carrying a few sticks and
brambles to some shelf of a rocky precipice, that is very dillicult for any one
except the eagle to get at. And here, with the sticks serving for a nest, the
two pale brownish-spotted yellow eggs are laid and hatched. The hungry
little ones, like some of you little people, keep their parents constantly
employed searching for food. So the timid hare and little bunnie and the
bloating little lamb are pounced upon and carried off by the swift eagle for its
little ones' dinner. The eagle's eye is very wonderfully made; and it has the
power of seeing objects that are very near and also tlmse that area. great
distance away. The Golden Eagle is the largest and finest of these birds: its
colour is dark brown, am] the head and back of the neck are covered with
beautiful golden red-pointed feathers. Its beak is strong and curved, and its
feet are armed with long, sharp talons. When it seizes its prey, it sits upon
it, and by doing so forces its talons a long way in ; aml then with a firm hold
of its booty flies to its rocky home.

The Falcon, another of the birds of prey, was once much used in hunting
down other birds. Like the eagle, it can see a long way. Its flight greatly
exceeds in swiftness the progress of an express train. The falcon always tries
to fly above the bird it is pursuing, so as to swoop down upon it. It builds its
nest amongst the rocks, and lays four eggs ofa reddish-brown colour.
One of the birds that the tamed falcon was very much employed to hunt
was the Heron, which in flying carries its long neck, head, and long, sharp bill,
stretched out before it, aml the long legs stretched out behiml. Sometimes
the heron killed the falcon, as it swooped swiftly down, by throwing its head
back and receiving the falcon on the point of its sharp beak, where it was fixed
as it' on a bayonet.

At times, very early in the morning or late in the evening, the heron
may he seen standing stiff and still in some shallow piece of water, just as we
see it in the picture, waiting for its dinner. And though he looks so stupid,
yet his little eye is peering into the water, and no sooner does a fish or frog
approach, than away darts the sharp bill, and in a moment the bird is winging
his way, carrying his struggling prey with him, to Mrs. Heron, who is sitting
on the fire bluish eggs in the flat mass of twigs and sticks which is its nest.

The Pheasant is a lover of the quiet woods; the Golden Pheasant, which
is a native of China, is the finest of the tribe. Their feath
beautifully coloured, showing very fine mixtures of almost all colours. The
golden pheasant has a rult' or collar of black and gold, which, when it pleases,
it can set up around its neck like the ruilles that were worn in Queen
Elizabeth's time. Its tail is about twice as long as its body. The nest is
made of gr ss and leaves on the ground, aml the bird lays and sits on from
twelve to eighteen olivevbrown eggs.

Here, with a pond to serve instead 01' the rushing waters of the sea, are
the Gulls. But they lose their beauty by confinement, and might be passed
as not worthy of much notice. Yet how pretty they look around the sea-
coasts, as they gracefully wheel about high in the air! 01-, when the wind
blows fiercely, we may see them sailing against the storm and uttering shrill
cries, which people say are a warning to the sailors that the rocky coasts are near.

The Stork was once not uncommon in England. In llolland the people
seem to be very anxious to make them comfortable, for it is a common practice
to place boxes on the roofs of the houses, that the storks may come and bring
what some people call 'good luck.' It also makes its nest of sticks and g 'ass
on the tops of tall trees, or of ruins or pillars. Very curious stories are told,
which seem to show that they have laws to govern them; and those that break
the law are very severely punished bythe others, who meet together, and, with
loud clatterings of their bills and flapping of wings, say what they have to
say, and then all fiercely set upon the naughty one and tear it to pieces.

What a peculiar-shaped bill this bird has! It is so much like a spoon
that some one named it Spoonbill. It uses this bill in fishing for worms, snails,
and water-plants. Here, too, is another with a peculiar head. He has a horn
on the top of his bill, and so is named Ilornbill. And see this singular-looking
bird. Its long hooked bill has beneath it a bag, which it uses as a fishing
net and market basket, to carry home what it finds whilst out. It is called a.
Pedcan.

But we must stop here. These are a few of the birds. There are
hundreds more, each one interesting and worth looking at; each wonderfully
made, and teaching us that ' in wisdom' hath God 'made them all.'

JUMBO! That 's a name which 1 think all of you will know. But perhaps
for the sake of those who, like myself, know of kittens, dogs, and even a boat,
named ' Jnlnho,' I had better say that the Jumbo we know is an Elephant, and
a very knowing one, too. Early in 1882 there was quite an excitement about
him, when it became known that he was to be sold to an American showman.
He had lived in the 'Zoo ' for so many years, and had given so many children
a ride on his broad back, that we hardly thought the ' Zoo ' could be the ' Zoo '
without him: and so, when we were tohl that Jumbo was to go across the
sea to America, we all thought it a right-down shame.

But fortunately Jumbo is not the only elephant who is so tame as to let
our young folks mount for a ride, for the other elephants left at the 'Zoo'
are trained to carry young people. These magnificent animals are very wonder-
fully made. The head is large, and, with the tasks, very heavy; but the belles
of the head are not solid, as in some other animals, for that would make
it too heavy. They are very large, but hollowed into small cells shaped some-
thing like the cells of a honeycomb, and others very long and narrow. 'l'he
trunk, however, is perhaps the most wonderful part of this animal. It is
really the elephant's nose, and a most useful part; for, as the neck is very
short, the elephant cannot bring his month near enough to the ground to reach
anything; so the trunk is used to pick up his food and put it into his mouth.
If he wants drink, he draws the water first up his long nostrils, and then,
placing the end of his trunk into his month, he blows the water down his
throat. In this long trunk there are said to he as many as forty thousand
muscles. The long teeth or tasks consist of very fine ivory, aml are used to
make lmii'e-haudles, combs, and many other things. These tasks sometimes
grow so large as to weigh two hundred or even three hundred pounds. Some
owners of elephants teach them to use these tusks for raising heavy stones,
and for carrying large logs of wood; and they will very cleverly pile up timber
with them. The elephant grows till he is eight or nine or perhaps ten
feet in height; and then he is such a big, bulky fellow that he weighs about
five tons.

Not far away from the elephants, we see two animals which I don't think
we could ever love. The Rhinoceros looks clumsy and awkward, but really he
is very nimble and strong. His little eyes, which seem to sparkle with mischief,
and that horrid-looking horn on his nose, make us think he would be a
dangerous fellow to deal with. And so he is; for he is not only ugly-looking,
but ugly--tempered as well. But this one at the ' Zoo' is tame enough to take
food from our hands. He is covered with a very thick and hard skin, so hard
that he would not be able to move about if it; were not for the loose folds of
thinner skin around his joints. The horn does not grow from the bones of
the skull, but from the skin.

The Hippopotamus is even uglier than the rhinoceros. His head is
large, eyes small, and mouth large. He can enjoy himself just asnluch in the
water as on the land, swimming and diving with great case, and often walking
along the bottom in search of plants. The teeth are very valuable, as from
the hippopotamns' tasks dentists make false teeth for those who are unfortu--
nate enough to have lost their own.

But from the clumsy let us turn to the graceful. Here is the beautiful
Girall'e. llow slendcrly shaped are its limbs ! Its beautiful long neck enables
it to reach the leaves of the trees on which it feeds. But, to reach the ground
for its food or drink, it has to stretch its front legs wide apart, and, while it. is.
in this position, its enemies--the lion, leopard, and other animals--can easily
overpower it. As it can run very swiftly, it usually, when attacked, takes to
flight; but should its enemies pursue it till it wearies, it will beat oil' even a
lion by giving snelra swift and strong storm of kicks as its assailant will not
meet with anywhere else. Its eye is very large and bright, and so stands out
that it can look all round without turning its head.

The Seal tank will be very attractive to you: you may see the seals merrily
diving and swimming about, and sitting on their chairs, catching the fish their
keeper throws to them, kissing him when he asks for a kiss, popping out
of the water near their keeper when he calls them by name, and readily
obeying him in performing tricks which he has taught them.

Amongst the remaining animals of the 'Zoo,' many of which it is im-
possible to chat ahouthere, are those pretty, gentle creatures of the Deer linuily.
Noblest amongst. them is the Stag. Many years ago great numbers lived in
the forests of Great Britain; but now they are seldom to he found excepting
on Exmoor, in Devonshire, and in the Highlands of Scotland, where large
herds exist. They are also to he found in other parts of Europe, and in the
north of Asia.

Though its very light and graceful form and slender limbs do not look to
he possessed of much strength, yet for swift speed and strength the stag
exceeds almost all the inhabitants of the forest. It is necessarily very strong
in its neck, as it uses its head and branching horns or antlers for defence. The
horns once a year drop off, and when the new horns grow, they are larger and
have more branches than the old ones. This goes on every year until the
animal gets old, when the horns become smaller each time they are renewed.
The female has no horns, and is called a ' Hind.' Their senses of sight, scent,
and hearing are very good. Their large, full eyes can spy out an object u.
great distance away; their sharp ears catch the slightest sound; aml they
scent an enemy afar off. From its reddish colour this species is sometimes
named the ' lied Deer.'

Another kind of deer very much like the stag, but with broader horns and
with its skin sometimes spotted with pale spots, is the Fallow Deer. The two
animals are seldom seen in the same places, nor is the fallow deer so robust as
the stag. It loves the woody places; and tame ones may be seen strolling
about some of our parks in herds.

In various parts of the cold Arctic regions, large numbers of a very useful
deer manage not only to find a living amongst the scanty herbage, but to thrive
there. The Reindeer serves the Laplander as his horse. And a swift steed it
is, too; for it draws its master's sledge over the icy snow as fast as a. quick
horse can go on firm ground. It is also his cow, for it gives him milk; and
its flesh is his food. With its skin he clothes himself and his family, roofs
his hut, carpets the floor, and makes his bed. Both the male and female have
horns, those of the male often being more than four feet long. The hoof isLlama

divided very high, so that; the two parts spread out over the snow, instead of
sinking into it when the foot is put down.

The I-llk, or Moose Deer, is the largest and strongest of the deer family.
its body is covered with very coarse, stifl' hair, and its skin is so hard that a
bullet. can scarcely get through it: it has also broader horns than the reindeer,
but in other ways the two animals are very much alike.

The timid little Musk Deer lives in the high mountainous districts of
Central Asia, where it roams about at night in a solitary state. ()nits stomach
is a little bag, the reddish contents of which have a very powerful scent.
About fifteen thousand ounces of this very highly valuable stuti' are brought over
every year from China. and India. Some of it is used in medicines, but the
greater portion is made into perfmnes. Unlike other kinds of deer, two of its
teeth are very long and hang down from its mouth.

The G: elle is the lightest. made and most graceful of all animals. It is
found in very large herds in North Africa aml Asia. They run very quickly;
and when they are forced to stand at bay, the herd will close together, with
the females and young in the centre, while the males stand around and fight
with their horns. Their large, soft black eyes have such a tender expression
that the hunter often linds himself unable to ch '0 and kill them.

The Addax is also found in North Afrie 1nd in Syria, but not in large
herds. Both male and female have slightly twisted horns.

One of the prettiest of Antelopes is the ()ryx, with its long shiny black horns
bending backwards over its body. It has soft light-brown hair, and is a very
swift runner. When using its horns in defence, it lowers its head until the
tips ofthe. horns rest on the ground, and then charges straight for its enemy.
So eonra-v'eons ' ' this antelope that it has been known to keep a lion at bay.

The Gun i. a curiously-shaped animal. Its (lowing tail and mane resemble
those of the horse, but its delicate legs are like the antelope's, while its head,
armed with strong horns sweeping down and then up to a. point, is most like,
that of the ox. It also has a quantity of shaggy black hair on its (chin and
breast.

The Illoulilon is very much like our mountain sheep, ditl'ering' only by being
covered with hair instead of wool; and from its wild life growing: very much
strange ' and livelier than the ordinary sheep.

The Llama is the beast of burden to the inhabitants of South America.
They are very sure-footed, having their hoofs so nicely made that they -au go
down the steepest places. They will live for many days without tasting water,
as their stomachs are provided with a number of cells to hold water. The
long silky hair with which they are covered is very valuable for making cloth.

The Kangaroo, or ' Old Man,' as the Australians name him, is very timid,
and generally seeks safety in flight, often giving the hunters a long stern chase
before they catch him. It is immensely strong, especially in its long legs,
which it uses to defend itself. The female kangaroo has a kind of bag or
pouch into which the little ones leap on the slightest alarm; and very coin--
fortable they must look, calmly peeping out of this hiding-place, as their
mother by immense leaps carries them to a place of safety.

Do not these little kangaroos remind us not only of our parents' shelter-
ing care, but of One to Whom we should fly for safety in any trouble--God,
the Creator of all, and the Saviour of all who will seek His help ?_

But we must leave these delightful Gardens, with their marvellous variety
of interesting animals. and be off to ' fresh woods and pastures new.'THE FIRST CRYSTAL PALACE.

CHAPTER X.

TIIE CRYSTAL PALACE--THE ELECTRIC EXHIBITION.

HERE is one notable place which we really must not forget to
- visit--THE CRYSTAL PALACE. True, we have, most of us, been
there more than once; but that is just the reason why we want
to go again. There is so much to see in that immense enclosure
that one cannot take it in all at once; and erenwhcn we have
become familiar with the permanent features of the place, there are fresh
additions, again and again, and good music to feast our ears with, and the
beautiful building glistening like a fairy pavilion in the sunshine, and the
spreading grounds to ramble in, and the llowers in bright masses and devices of
many colours, and the cllatfiuches and redbreasts and sparrows among the trees
and bushes, and--But it is time (hat sentence came to an end. Given a fine, sunny
day, in spring, or summer, or autumn, and a nice little party of friends--boys
and girls and older folk, if they are not too proud and stately to admire and
enjoy the scene--and there can scarcely be abetter place for a tired Londoner
to pass a few happy hours than the Crystal Palace.

I dare say you have seen pictures of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park---
the building which was erected for the Great Exhibition of 1851. It was
designed by Mr. Paxton, who rose from being a gardener's boy to be ' Sir
Joseph Paxton, M.P.' Built almost entirely of iron and glass, it had a
beautiful fairy-like appearance; and though it was nearly twice the breadth
and fully four times the length of St. Paul's Cathedral, covering twenty acres
of ground, it had a gay, lightsome look, which was a pleasing novelty
amongst our public buildings. It was opened by the Queen on May lst, 185],
and continued open till the 11th of October. During those one hundred and
forty-four days of exhibition it was visited by more than six millions of persons.
And no wonder; for not only was the building itself a marvel, though run up
in a few months, but the variety and value of its contents, the perfection of its
arrangement, and the beauty of its vistas--especially that along the nave, or
body of the buiMing--presented a. combination of attractions which the world
had never before seen, and which remains as yet unrivalled.

\Vhen the Exhibition was over, a general desire was expressed that the
building should be purchased by Government, and so preserved from destruction;
but this was not agreed to. A few gentlemen, however, in 1852, came to the
rescue, and bought it, and had it removed to Sydenham, where it was erected,
much altered and improved, on the upper part. of a lovely estate of three
hundred acres. When opened as our present Crystal Palace by the Queen, on
June 10th, 1854-, the building was found to have been greatly changed from its
former self. In place of one trausept there were three, and the roof of the
nave had become arched, instead of being flat, and had been raised tbrty--t'our
feet higher than the old one. The central trausept is the great feature of the
architecture, being three hundred and eighty-four feet long, one hundred and
twenty wide, and one hundred and sixty-eight high; but its total height from the
garden front is two hundred and eight feet--six feet higher than the
Monument.

It would take up all my pages to give a description of all the things to be
seen in this immense building and its aide-spreading grounds. All I can say
to you is, 'Come and see.' Roam along the beautiful nave, and gaze on the
statues, and plants, and flowers, and fountains, and works of art; turn off into
those wonderful Courts--Assyrian. Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Medizeval, &c.,
not forgetting the resplendent portions of the Alhambra; then traverse the
picture galleries; descend to the lower regions, and watch the machinery and
various processes of manufacture. But the sun is shining, and soon you will
want to be out in the grounds. So out let us go, aml gave for a minute from
the upper terrace on the grand prospect--trees, and water, and beds of flowers;
hill and dale and verdant alley--and the rosary and water temples and
panorama house. If we wander down the steps, and along the winding paths,
we shall come to the upper terrace of the grand plateau, and shall have before
us the lake, which has three islands in its bosom, adorned with life-size models
of the fearful and gigantic animals which are supposed to have swarmed on our
planet many ages ago. Then, if we pass on to the rustic bridge, we shall see
an excellent representation of the strata between which that grand English
necessary, coal, is found. It is worth looking at for a few minutes; for it is
not a mere painted model, but is constructed of several thousand tons of coal,
and ironstone, and limestone, and red sandstone, old and new.

And now we will finish our visit by spinning you a yarn about the ELI-:crme
Exumlrxox which we visited at the Palace a year or two ago, and of which
our artist gives you the principal features in the picture.

As we looked around at the many beautiful uses to which electricity is
put, we could not help thinking what an important little incident that was which
happened about two thousand four hundred years ago. Six hundred years
before our Saviour was born, there lived at Miletus, in Asia Minor, an old man
whose name was Thales, and who was known to be very wise. This old
philosopher was one (lay handling and rubbing a piece of amber, and on placing
it near some light things, he was very much surprised to see these light things
jump towards the amber. Now, although he was a wonderfully clever man, he
did not try to find out the reason of this. He only wondered why it was so,
and at last thought that amber when rubbed received some sort of life. And
there he left the'subject. Two thousand two hundred years rolled away, and
we find that in 3.1). 1600 there lived at Colchester a man named Gilbert, famous
also for his wisdom. This man, reading what old Thales had written about'5"

unber in one of his books, like a wise man, determined to find out if other
hings would act like amber. And it was not long before Gilbert had made a
ist of things that would become 'electrical' by rubbing; and from the Greek
word electron, which means 'amber,' he gave the name 'clectrieity' to this
new power.

This Gilbert, you see, loved to dive into difficulties, and to make mysteries
plain: and there have been very many men who have had the same talent
since then, and to whom we owe all those inventions and discoveries which
have made such a great difference in the world. There was one who, in 1672,
made thc first machine for producing electricity. This was a very simple
globe of sulphur turned by a. handle, and pressed as it was turned with a cloth
held by the hand, to make it electrical. These were simple beginnings of a
long chain of experiments, each one of more importance, and unfolding
greater benefits, than the one before it. As the clever men who took up the
work where the other philosophers had left it got more knowledge, so they made
better and more powerful machines, and at last found out that the electricity
they produced with their machines could be carried along wires in connection
with each machine.

This fact at length led some one to think that the current of electricity
along the wires would give at one end similar signs to those made at the other.
'l'hen dials, something like the face of a clock, but having letters instead of
figures, and a hand like a compass needle, were fitted to the ends of the wires;
and on trial it was found that whatever movement was made with one needle
the electric current made the other needle at the other end of the wire perform.
Thus the great telegraph system originated. And now, like the fine threads
of the beautiful spider's web, the active wires of the telegraph spread out
above our houses, alongside our railways, across the country, and last, but
not least, under the rolling waves of the sea. Some of these machines do not.
require any one to be constantly watching them and writing the messages;
for, when a message comes by them, they will print it in capital letters, or in
long and short strokes, or in wriggled lines upon paper, each of which lilies
has a distinct meaniiw.

By an instrument invented a few years ago, such as the man in the
picture is using, and named the 'telephone,' a person may speak or sing at
one end and be heard at the other, though the. intervening distance be loxw.

Have you ever noticed the humming noise in a pole that has a telegraph
wire at the top ? This noise attracts the woodpecker, who thinks it is caused
by insects inside the wood, and the bear, who mistakes it for the hum of the
bees, of whose honey he is so fond. The piece of wood with the birds on,
of which our artist gives a. sketch in the picture, had a. hole peeked right
through by these birds.

The ends of two wires attached to a powerful battery are called poles.
When these poles are brought together and then separated a short distance,
the current of electricity jumps across the space, and fills it with in-
tense light. Now this light is so very hot that it will melt the hardest:
metals, and even the diamond. So something harder than metal is made,
called carbon, and placed in holders connected with the wires, and then this
carbon forms the poles. The light is found to arise chiefly from the white-hot
tips of the carbon rods, and from an arch of flame which spreads from one to
the other, and through which little pieces of white--hot carbon pass over from
one point to the other. This light can now be used to light our streets or our
rooms, or the miner may carry it with safety into the dangerous mines, or
the diver down into the sea. It also is used in some of our lighthouses.

Now let us just peep at the Palace lit up with the electric light, and note

the brilliant effect as it floods the immense building; and then we nmst hic
away home by rail or road.

RICHMOND.

[-2 will now extend our rumbles, mnl explore some of the suburbs
and outlying parts of the great city. And first let us go a little
way down the Thames.

()ur stemnboat has carried us among the ships of all nations,
and past the large storehouses on either side of the river, and
now, five miles from the centre of London, as we turn a bend in the river,
we see a pretty picture. The sun is shining on a tree-covered hill, whoseGREENWI 011. m

masses of variously shaded green throw out into dazzling whiteness the palace-
like building which nestles at its foot. It is a. spot we ought to feel proud of,
for this is the famous Gusexwrcn HOSPITAL.

Like every building designed by Sir Christopher Wren, there is something
here which is very pleasing to look upon. Though a Hospital, it looks every
inch of it a, palace. And I am told that in all Europe there is not a more
beautiful building, used as this one has been, than this Hospital. For many
years a royal palace stood on this spot, which, becoming old and allowed to
go to rain, was pulled down, and a new one commenced; and during the
reign of William and Mary, the Queen made the good suggestion, that as the
old and worn-out soldiers had their Hospital and Asylum at Chelsea, the old
sailors ought to have one also. It was a happy thought, and the sailors for
many long years have blest this good Queen Mary for it. And here was just
the spot for such an asylum, where the old Jack tars could look out upon the
younger ones, as they went down to the sea in ships.

'Why not,' said Sir C. Wren, 'give up Greenwich Palace, make of it a
large building, and use that for the old tars' resting-place '9 ' Wren's sugges-
tion was accepted; he made his designs, and presented them and his services
as a gift. At first one hundred veteran sailors were admitted here; three
years later three hundred and fifty had been admitted, and so on, until at length
more than two thousand seven hundred bronzcd and broken-dmvn seamen,
many of them maimed, most of them aged, found shelter within the walls of
Greenwich Hospital. Here they had their library, reading-rooms, little cabins,
their picture gallery, their open courtyards for exercise, their covered walks
for bad weather, and a park in which to stroll in sunny weather. But they are
gone, and Greenwich will no more be noted for its groups of merry-eyed,
bronzed-l'aeed, patched-up old sailors, spinning yarns of their seafaring life.
In the quiet of their homes, amongst relatives and friends, they spend their
last days.

The picture gallery which the old sailors had, or the Painted Hall, as it
is named, is what now attracts most attention from visitors; for, besides a
finely painted ceiling, it has a good collection of pictures. These, of course,
are chiefly representations of sea-fights, and portraits of our great seamen.
Perhaps the most interesting sight is the Nelson room, where we find pictures
illustrating Nelson's life, from the time when, as a. midshipman, he tried to
kill a bear in the Arctic regions, to his death on board the Victory. And""~:

amongst other relics, we may see the coat he were when he received his
death-wound at Trafalgar. Models of ships and statues are amongst the
other attractions of the museum here; as also the many articles found
amongst the ice and snow when Captain MeClintoek discovered that Sir John
Franklin and his men had died in the Arctic regions.

In the Naval School at the back of the Hospital eight hundred sons of
seamen receive a free education and are trained for the sea.

The Observatory at the top of yonder hill was placed there for the benefit
of pilots and sailors, in order to find out the motions of the moon and the
places of the fixed stars. It has a most wonderful clock, which keeps exact
time, aml which sets the time for all the clocks in England. For this purpose
other clocks are connected with this one by telegraph wires, which carry the
time forward, and bring back an answer. The current of electricity leaving
Greenwich takes the signal given by this clock, and then brings back an
answer from the other clocks, saying how far they are wrong. A gentleman
was being taken round by the Astronomer Royal, and as they were passing in
front of a galvanic battery the great clock at \Vestminstcr was replying. It.
was sending word that it was going well, and was only the twentieth part of
a second slow. Twice a day it sent word how it was going.

The park is very fine, and is full of hills and dales, where you may have
as much climbing up and rolling down as you like.

"'0 will now turn about and, returning to London Bridge, take a little
voyage up the river and ' view Chelsea's glorious pile,' as Mr. Rogers, the
banker poet, phrases it. On our right, after we have steamed along for a few
minutes, we come to the Emlmnlnneut which extends from Battersca Bridge,
near old ChelseaChurch, to the grounds of CHELSEA HOSPITAL, furnishing a line
promenade of nearly a mile in length. At length we reach the Hospital, which
is the counterpart of the one we have visited at Greenwich, since it provides
an asylum for invalid and aged soldiers, just as Greenwich used to do for old
sailors.

This noble building was finished in the year 1690, from the design of Sir
Christopher Wren. Its first stone had been laid several years before by
Charles II. We get a summary of the history of the building from the
inscription on the frieze of the large quadrangle, which tells us--in Latin--that
it was founded by Charles II,, augmented by James II.. and completed by
William and Mary, for the aid and relief of soldiers worn out by old age or
by the labours of war. The north front extends along way, and has before it
avenues of limes and chestnut trees. In its centre isa fine portico, surmounted
by a tall clock turret. If we enter the vestibule, we shall find on the eastern
side the chapel--a lofty room, with arched ceiling, and paved with black and
white marble. From its walls hang a. large number of flags captured by the
British army, and thirteen 'eagles' taken from the French at the famous
battles of Barossa, Talavera, and ""aterloo. 0n the western side is the dining
hall, where a dinner is served up for the pensioners every day, except Sunday,
at twelve o'clock ; but they are allowed to take it in their own separate apart-
ments, and do not dine in public for the benefit of inquisitive visitors, who
might. want to know how they managed to chew without teeth, and other
irrelevant matters.

This excellent Hospital provides food and clothing and shelter for five
hundred old soldiers; but the numberof out pensioners is about sixty-four
thousand, of whom nearly eight thousand are over seventy years of age. The

inmates look very picturesque in their old-fashioned costume--long scarlet
coats, lined with blue, knee-breeches, and three-cornered cocked hats. They
have beef to dinner on Sundays, and nmtton on week-days, varied by bacon on
one day--the monotony of mutton, 'always muttou,' being too great even for
these old campaigners to stand. It is pleasing to know that the wants of these
poor old fellows--who are all of them incapable of earning anything by labour--
are liberally provided for. Some kind hearts have thought of them in their
feebleness, and have left various legacies for their benefit ; and from the
interest of these private funds the library is kept up for them, and extra
comforts and amusements are provided. The inmates are portioned into six
companies, and for the cleanliness and order of each ward the responsibility
rests on the captain and officers of the company occupying it.

That some of the predecessors of these venerable worthies have lived to
a good old age, is evident from the records on the tombstones in the burial
ground adjoining the Hospital ; where we find that Thomas Asbey died in 1737,
aged 112; Robert Comming, in 1767, aged 116; Peter Dowling, in 1768, aged
102; and that a soldier who fought at the Battle of the Boyne (1690), died in
1772, aged lll ! There were some tough warriors in those days, certainly.

Close by the Hospital, and to the north of it, we find another national
institution--the Duke of York's School, or, to take the full title from the
inscription which we read on the frieze of the portico, 'The Royal Military
Asylum for the Children of Soldiers of the Regular Army.' The children to
be admitted to this school are selected by Government commissioners, and are
chosen out of the following classes: 'Orphans, or those whose fathers have been
killed, or have died on foreign stations; those who have lost their mothers, and
whose fathers are absent on duty abroad; those whose fathers are ordered on
foreign service, or whose parents have other children to maintain.' The number
of boys admitted is seven hundred, and of girls three hundred. The boys receive
regular military training; and if we pay the school a visit at the right time, we
shall be highly pleased and amused at the smart exercise and manoeuvres of these
young soldiers, while the excellent music of their miniature band will delight our
ears. The girls, besides the usual items of education, are initiated in needlework
and household matters. The boys are clad in red jackets, blue brooches and stock-
ings, and black caps; while the costume of the girls consists of red gowns, blue
petticoats, straw hats, &c. It would not be good for these boys and girls to
have all work and no play, and to be drilled into more machines: so we are126 BOTANICAL GARDENS, KEW.

glad to see that they have large playgrounds, where they can run about in the
open air, and cloistevcd arcades, in which they can amuse themselves when the
weather is too cold or wet to be away from shelter.

Now let us run up the river a little farther, with K aw and its BOTAXICAL
Ganesxs as our first destination.

How delightful this journey on the water is! We could linger at many
places on our way, but just now we must be satisfied with a passing glance.

ch Gardens were, for some time, the private grounds surronmling the
palace of ch, and belonged to the royal family since the time when the Prince
of Wales, son of George II. and father of George 111., admiring the situation,
bought the place from its owner, a private gentleman. The Botanic Gardens
were commenced by the mother of George 111., who tool: a great delight in
the study of plants ; and under the able management of Sir \Y. J. Iloolier
they obtained a world-wide renown. Soon after Queen Victoria ascended the
throne these gardens were very liberally given up by royalty to the public.

The gardens are full of interest. The temples and other picturesque
objects that ornament the grounds are mostly the works of Sir W. Chambers.
The Museum of Timber, which was formerly used as the Orangery, the elegant
Temple of the Sun, and the Pagoda, which is one hundred and sixty-three feet in
height, were each built about. 1761. The hothouses and conservatories are
very numerous, of which the Palm House forms the chief attraction. It is large
enough and high enough to allow the plants that it contains to expand and
grow to their natural size, for it is three hundred and sixty-two feet in length;
the centre is one hundred feet wide and sixty-six feet high; the wings fifty feet
wide and thirty feet high. Some of the other buildings are almost as large,
and the \Vinter Garden is more than twice as large as the palm house. The
water-tower and pagoda are very conspicuous objects, and may be seen for
some distance round. The Museums contain specimens of the wood of the
trees in its natural state, and of the many uses to which it is put; the leaves
of the plants and trees, with their flowers or fruit, and the various medicines
and dyes produced from them; and, indeed, the whole collection in the
museums serves to show us the various uses aml conveniences to which plants
and trees may be put. \Vhere it has been fouudimpossible to get a natural
sporimen, a. wax model here serves the purpose. One of the best of these isKEW GARDENS
the model of an enormous flower, called a parasite, which grew in Sumatra,
and measured a full yard across.

But let us turn to look at a few of those plants called 'economic,' or which
produce food for man, or are in other ways useful to us. You will surely be in-
terested in this one, the sugar-cane. The greater quantity of our sugar is
obtained from the juice of its stem. It is principally grown in the East and
West Indies.

Here is a shrub, the leaves of which will produce 'the cup that cheers,
but not inebriates.' The tea-shrub is cultivated in plantations on the hill~
sides of China and India. In 1877 our import of tea exceeded 186,000,000 lbs.
And then we see another shrub from which a favourite beverage is obtained.
The berries, which look so much like cherries, on this plant, form the coffee as
we get it from India and the \Vest Indies. But perhaps the next is more useful
than these two; certainly it is more nourishing. It is the cocoa--tree, bearing
long pods, generally four inches in length, which contain the seeds or cocoa-
nibs. And now we may look at the vine, with its sweet grapes. What a pity
it is that people will destroy so much of this beautiful fruit to make a drink
that does so much harm !

Some sorts of grapes when dried are very enjoyable, especially to young
people who like puddings or cakes ; they are sold as Valentin, Museatel, and
Sultana raisins and entrants. Here, too, are the spices with which mother
flavours so many nice things for your pretty little mouths, and the tamarind,
eitron, and orange trees. Many plants and trees are growing here from which
drugs and medicine are produced. Quinine is made from the Peruvian bark;
and alocs, balsams of Peru and of Tohi, camphor, castor oil, and sarsaparilla,

ware derived from plantsbearing those names. Dyes also are obtained from the
indigo, logwood, eatecha, and arnatto plants. Then here is an imliarubber tree,
which yields a milky liquid, from which our indiarubber is made. The South Sea
Islanders are provided with food from this bread-fruit tree; and the traveller
in Australia may quench his thirst at the bottle tree, inside which a mnnber
of reservoirs holding water are formed. Another wise provision, for the hot
climate of Asia, is to be seen in the pitcher-plant, with its long tubes of
different shapes, which secrete a very nice-tasting fluid. Another thirst-
qnenehing tree is the traveller's tree, of Madagascar. Many of this nature
are here, besides those from which the natives obtain their foods. The grounds
and hothouses are full of native and foreign flowering plants, and, where possible,RICIIJIOJVD. [29

the clematis, passion--flower, and other climbing plants are trained. There is
a. grand collection of ferns; and in the water-lily house the display is very
pretty. Nor must we forget, in concluding our visit, to notice the flagstatl'.
It is the trunk of a tree named the Douglas Spruce; it is one hundred and fifty-
nine feet in length, and is supposed to be about two hundred and fifty years
old.

To my young readers who may be able, I would say, Go to this beautiful
garden to see the exquisitely shaped plants and wonderfully made flowers ; and
not once only, but often, to notice the changes of nature, as spring's freshness
develops into summer beauty, and that in turn is tinted at autumntide. Lusty
winter's tierec blasts may not touch these gems of nature, for the watchful
gardener notes his coming, and transplants them where the chill of winter is
not felt.

How great is the goodness of God in creating these things to gratify our
senses; in making them beautiful to look on, sweet to our smell, delicious to
our taste, and useful to man ! And we, too, are created for use and good ends.
Let us, like these plants, try to answer the purpose for which we were created,
that, when the chilly blasts of death shall approach, our Gardener may trails--
plant us to a safe and eternal home.

The walk from Kew to RICHMOND is not a very long one, and, if we go
alongside the river, may he made very pleasant and interesting indeed. For
there is so much to attract the attention, so many of Dame Nature's wonderful
wild flowers to pick, if we want. to give pleasure to those at home by taking
a bunch; so many bright andswift--wingedinsects to watch. When we reach
Richmond Bridge, which is over one hundred years old, having been built
in the years between 1774- and 1777, at a cost of PS26,000, we are able to get.
some very pleasing views, especially looking up the river to Richmond Hill and
Twickenham Meadows. Our poets have again um] again sung the praises of
thispnrt of the river's course :

' Where Thames along the daisied meads
His wave in lucid mazes leads--
Sileut, slow. serenely flowing.
Wealth on either side bestowing.'

The old village has grown into a populous town, and many picturesque
mansions have given place to the statelier houses. We will not spend our
10
time in examining the town, but will pay a short visit to the old church.
Except the old square tower of flint and stone, there is little of the original
building left. The tower contains a pen] of eight bells. Amongst the many
tablets and monuments in and around the church, we notice the brass tablet
to the memory of James Thomson, placed in the church wall by the Earl of
lluchau, who was 'nnwilling that so good a man and sweet a poet should be
without a memorial.' The church is full of memorials to many other great
men and women: actors, authors, poets, the famous and the unknown, the
rich and the poor, rest amid {his much-loved scenery, awaiting the great day
when their lives will be weighed in the balances.

But let us stroll to the Green, and see the remains of the old palace to
which the sovereigns of England, when they were wearied of city life, used to
come to find pleasure and recreation. So far back as the time of the first
Edward a palace stood here, and Edward II. also lived here. The old palace
was the scene of Edward III.'s death. I-Ierc also Anne, the Queen of Richard
11., died. She was the Queen who taught English ladies the use of the side--
saddle in riding. Until about 1500 the palace and village had been known by
the name of 'Sheen,' which in the Saxon tongue meant 'resplcudent.' Its
tine situation, and the beautiful view from it of the river for some distance,
may have occasioned the name. But when I'Ienry VII. rebuilt the old palace,
he ordered the name to be changed to Richmond, after his own title, which,
you will remember, was 'Earl of Richmond' before he was made King at the
battle of Boswortll Field. He and his son Henry VIII. spent much time
here, and Richmond obtained a name far-famed for its gaiety. Festivity
followed festivity, and at these times, from the castle walls and windows, and
from the shady walks around the spacious green, many were the spectators
of the exciting tournament, when the mail-clad knights met to try their
prowess in contest before their King. In the dark, gloomy days of Queen
Mary's reign, the good Princess Elizabeth was shut up within the palace
for a short time as a prisoner. When she became Queen, she made this one
of her favourite places of residence. The only remaining part of this famous
old palace is the entrance gateway to the Wardrobe Court (now known as Old
Palace Yard), and just inside the gate a rough red brick and stone building,
having turrets and battlements. Above the gateway are the arms of Henry
VII. All else has long ago either crumbled away or been pulled down.

half ago, in his poem, Smnmcr, nas neen one of the most famous spots in
England. The view from the hill is as pretty as when the poet described it;
and though some of the places and objects seen by him are now concealed
behind tall trees, or have been removed in the course of time, yctncwrillages
dot the landscape, and other objects are here, helping to form one of the
loveliest pictures in all England.

Standing near the summit of the hill is a large and stately building. It
is the \Vesleyan Theological Institution--a training college for Missionary
students who are preparing to go forth to the dark countries of the world to
teach the heathen about the Lord Jesus.

From a gate on the hill we enter the park, which is, excepting "'indsor,
the largest round London. We can well imagine ourselves in the midst of
a forest when we have entered, for the woods appear so very thick, and some
of the trees are very old; and whilst we are enjoying the quiet of the woods,
watchingthe dear little bunnies at the foot of that tree, sportively popping
in and out of their warrens, there comes trooping along a small herd of deer.
They are accustomed to the sight of people in their park, so that we need have
no fear, for they will take but little notice of us. Altogether there are in
the park sixteen hundred fallow and fifty red deer. When George II. was
King, he kept a flock of three thousand wild turkeys in the park. There are
two lakes, or Pen l'onds, here, and occasionally a flock of fifty or sixty herons
will assemble, but they never stay long. We may roam about the two thousand
and fifteen acres of forest-land which the park contains, finding something
at every turn to entertain us: but now we must leave what has long been
considered one of the fairest and prettiest spots in England.

BUSHEY PARK AXD HAMPTON COURT-'EI'I'ISG FOREST--HIGHGATE.

VOW let us haste away to enjoy the beauties of Dcsum PARK.
We seat ourselves amongst. the ferns at the foot of these limes,
to enjoy our pienie, with this t'allen trunk serving as a. a table,

their shadows around us, whilst between the trees we hare
glimpses of the glories of the chestnut blooms, and right before us, at the
end of the long avenue, we see the water of the fountain glistening in the
sunlight. The three unrivalled avenues of limes and horse-chestimts, over
a mile long, are the glory of Bushey. lushey is always pleasant, but

the broad circular sheet of water, decorated with a bronze statue of Diana in
the centre.

And now we stand before HAMPTON (loun'r, the palace of Cardinal
Wolsey and Henry VIII., and then of all our Sovereigns in succession: from
Edward VI. to George 11., but now by royal liberality a palace open to all.
Here a day may be pleasantly spent in examining the palace and its contents,
and in strolling through its well-kept and ornamented gardens. \Vhen
Wolsey took the manor of Hampton, he was in the height of his power,
holding the position of Archbishop of York, and very soon after was made
cardinal. He had built at very much expense :1. grand palace, which every one
admired, and even the King grew jealous and envious. The palace itself was
not all that excited the envy aml admiration of the monarch or his people.
\Ve are told that 'every room had hangings of wonderful value, and every
place did glitter with innumerable vessels of silver and gold. There were two
immlrcd and fourscore beds, the furniture to most of them being silk.' To
quiet the jealousy and envy of his sovereign, and to keep in his favour, the cardinal
was at length almost compelled to offer the gorgeous palace to the King as
a gift. Of course the King accepted the gift, and then made this a very
frequent residence am] a scene of much gaiety.

For a few short years Anne Boleyn presided over the Courtfestivities, and
then the cruel King had.her beheaded. Asimilar fate befel Catherine Howard.
Ilcre Edward VI. was born, and a few days afterwards his mother (Jane
Seymour) died. IIenry added very largely to the building and its decorations.
Charles I. spent much time here; partly because of the plague that raged in
London aml partly for pleasure, and at last as a prisoner. Cromwell lived
here, and had an organ erected in the great gallery. William III. had some
parts pulled down, and Sir Christopher Wren built statclicr rooms. Perhaps
more time, money, and thought were spent upon Hampton than pleased the
Londoners. Here \Villiam III. met with the accident which brought on his
death. George II. was the last monarch who lived here. For a long time
the place was much neglected, but in November, 1838, it was thrown open to
the public.

The Great I-Iall--a very fine room--was built by Henry VIII. The
coloured windows contain the portraits of the King, his wives, and their
children, as well as the arms, badges, and devices of the llouscs of York and
Lancaster. 0n the walls hang tapestries, which, though faded, must onceBUSBEY PARK AND HAMPTON COURT.l 36 EPI'IA'G FOREST.

are all in the portion of the building erected by 'Vren, and contain amongst.
their attractions :1 very large collection of paintings.

The charming gardens owe their form to Charles 11., who laid them out
very carefully. They were extended and improved by William lll. lie had
the canal dug and bordered with avenues of lime trees, erected fountains and
stocked them with gold fish, formed the terraces and broad gravel walks.
Then, too, there is the 17m to be seen for a small payment. It was planted
in 1769, and is now one hundred and fifteen years old. Its stem is 38 inches
round, the leading branch 110 feet long, and it gives about 1,500 bunches of
grapes every y -ar; one year there were 1,750 bunches. Then we go a-walkiug
in the groves of that pleasant. shady little retreat named the ll'ilrlenms;
and before we go home we must go to the Maze. What fun and frolic we have,
walking between the high hedges, trying to get to the centre! Laughter
rings all around, which of course we join in, when we come to a t'nllstop.
But we turn and try again, and with more blunders and more laughter, after
a lot of wandering, we at last reach the centre. Then we make more
blunders, and have more fun in getting out; and so ends our visit to ' llappy
lIampton.'

But we must now 'amble away from the banks of the Thames, and see
something of a favourite breathing ground on the north-east of London.
The forest known as EWING FOREST is only a small remaining portion of a
large royal forest which in very early times extended almost over the whole
county of Es x It was then known as the Forest of Essex. At that time
there dwelt within its borders a very powerful tribe of ancient Britons, whose
chiefs, Caractacus and Boadieea, were far-famed for braverv. It is thought,
from what has been discovered during the last few years, that when the
Romans invaded England and marched into Essex, these chiefs prepared to
resist the invaders, and dug an encampment at Longhton, which they fortified.
The Romans, finding the Britons so strongly encamped, also iutreuehcd
themselves in a spot near , and in the light that ensued the Romansthoroughly
defeated the Britons. Until very recently, nothing was known of these
remains." 3. Old Beechfl'mes.

1. Old Chingfoxd Church.
Little by little the Forest grew smaller, as the outer portions were
cleared, and villages and hamlets sprang up outside its borders, till there was
left. only that part around the Abbey and parish of Waltham. This, under
the name of \Valtham Forest, included those parts which have since become
known as Epping and llainault'. Forests. The sovereign of the country
claimed a. royal right to all this, as well as to other forests. No fence was to
he set. up; no tree cut down; no bird, rabbit, or other living thing was to be
killed except by royal consent. And very severe were the punishments
, inflicted on transgressors. But. harshness gradually gave way to gentle
treatment; and Queen Elizabeth, in one of her visits to her lodge, is said
to have given to the poor of several parishes the privilege of lopping wood,
beginning at midnight on the 11th of November every year, when the people
used to meet together, while one of the company struck an axe into the bonghs
of the trees. This lopping of wood extended right through the winter till
the 23rd of April.

After some time the commissioners who had to look after Woods and
Forests thought it would be more profitable to sell the sovereign's right;
and so a large piece of the forest. was sold. IIainalIlt Forest having gone,
and the landowners on the edge of the Forest gradually fencing in more
land than they were entitled to, Epping Forest was reduced to avcry small one.

As Epping Forest. was not more than a few miles from the East. of
London, the people living in the crowded streets and foul-smelling courts of
that part. of our great city, and many others living around the forest, naturally
loved the place. There was no spot near where the hard-working fathers
and the toiling mothers could get such sweet rest as at Epping Forest. Quiet
family parties brought their humble meal, aml forgot the noise and worry of
life as they revelled on the grass aml under the shady trees. Here, too, came
children in shoals for a day's enjoyment, and the grim old beeches and oaks
looking down on them, and the thickly growing forest around, would send back
the sounds of their merry voices in gentle echoes. And Epping also saw
numbers come, who, like the great. industrious naturalist, Thomas Edward,
were bootmakers, working hard and long at that. or some other busy craft,
and snatching all the spare moments they could to delight in watching nature's
wonders. For here were to he found many kinds of beetles, butterflies,
and other wonderfully made insects. The patient-seeking botanist was
rewarded with rich and varied ferns and mosses, and awhole host of wildIIIGHGA TE. I39

plants flowering in every part. And, 1 :nn sorry to say, tne merry little
songsters were trapped for sale.

So no wonder the people cried out when they saw the Forest getting
smaller by degrees. A stir was made, until Parliament took the matter in
hand, and an Act was passed which will preserve the Forest for the enjoyment
of the people.

Amongst the more noticeable parts of the Forest are Queen Elizabeth's
Lodge, at Chingl'ord, an old and pretty-looking building, which was
originally lmilt as a. hunting-lodge for Queen Elizabeth. Close by the Lodge
is a newer building, known as the Royal Forest Hotel, and fitted inside in the
style of buildings during the reign of the Tudor sovereigns. The ornamental
lakes form very attractive portions of the Forest. Old Chingl'ord Church is
well worth visiting. It goes by the name of 'the Green Church' in the
neighbouring villages, because the old llints and stones of which it is built
are almost completely covered with ivy. Probably it is one of the oldest
churches in Essex; it is now disused. Old Father Time has left his imprint
on it, and the rough winds of winter have given ita weather-beaten and
ruinous appearance, but it forms a. very pretty, interesting object.

llull never returned to Parliament an abler member, nor has I-lighgate ever
linked itself with a more goodly memory, than that of Andrew Marvell; a
memory which remains nncclipsed by the even better known and probably
more lengthy association of SAMUEL TAYLOR Com-:moon, who for the last
nineteen years of his life lived at a little old-fashioned house at the top of
1lighgute 11ill.

He was born at St. Mary ()tiery, in Dcvonshirc, on October 21st, 1772.
His father wasat. the time the vieur, but died some little while after, leaving
his widow pennilcss and with a numerous progeny, the youngest of whom
became the famous 'Tablc Talker,' S. T. Coleridge. At ten years old, sonn-
t'riemls secured his election to Christ's Hospital, where he had for a con-
t.emporary the gentle 'Elia,' and where he was regarded as a very clever
but eccentric boy, being at the age of fifteen completely absorbed in the study
of metaphysics. He remained here till the age of nineteen, by which time he
had secured the position 01' senior ' Greeian,' and was Captain of the school,
and conseqticntly entitled to an Exhibition at Cambridge, where he entered
September 7th, 179l. In October, 1793, he quittcd the University without
taking his degree. For this a variety of reasons are forthcoming, the most
conclusive being that he was deeply in debt. He had formed a hopelessHIGIIGATE. :41

attachment fora young lady who in no degree returned lus affection. Once
more in London, he became, in his lm'e-lorn and starring condition, an easy
prey for the recruiting sergeant, and was enlisted in the 15th Dragoons under
the name of ' Combcrback.'

 

It was about this period that, obeying the strict injunctions of his mother,
to put, on 'a clean shirt every third day'--absorbed in love or metaphysics,
or both--lie for some weeks in succession put, on one garment without removing
its predecessor. llis Dragoon experiences were happily not of long continuance,
his previous career and associations becoming known. The discovery of these,
coupled, doubtless, with the fact that habits of mental abstraction, which wereI42 [{IGIIGATE.

beginning to develop themselves, were not calculated to make a good soldier,
procured his discharge.

Immediately afterwards he published his first volume of Poems, which met
with considerable praise. llaving taken up his residence at Bristol, as a means
of maintenance he delivered a course of lectures on the French Revolution, and
was very favourably received. He also projected a Liberal newspaper, styled
The Watchman, but unfortunately for its success he was strongly Conservative,
and the paper did not survive the ninth issue.

He and Southey at this time jointly wrote a drama, entitled, The Fall of
J-'obcspierre, but the result was not satisl'actory. A much more prosperous
venture for them was their engagement to the Misses Frieker; Coleridge
marrying, in 1795, Miss Sarah, and on the same day Robert Southey marrying
her sister. Coleridge and his bride settled in a cottage in the village of Nether
Stowey, in Somersetshire, at the foot of the Quantoch I-l ills, where he formed
congenial friendships with William Hazlitt and William Wordsworth.

Three years after his marriage, the Wedgwoods (Josiah and Thomas)
granted him an annuity, upon the strength of which he went to Germany.
Returning to England after the lapse of two years, he went to reside in the
Lake District, whither Southey and Wordsworth had preceded him, and by the
subsequent publication of their poetic works they became generally known as
the ' Lake poets.' At this time he assumed the direction of the political and
literary department of the Morning Post, which position he held for many
years. From 1808 to 1814- he contributed also to the Courier.

In 1808 he lectured on Poetry and the Fine Arts at the Royal Institution,
receiving the usual honorarium of one hundred guineas. He made another
unsuccessful venture in the publication of The Friend, which collapsed with
No. 28.

The life of Coleridge in Cumberland is a charming contribution to the his-
tory of students, but we do not recommend it for imitation. De Quincey says
Coleridge adopted the manner of the luxurious Romans of Seneea's day, who
lived chiefly by candle-light. Between two and three in the afternoon he made.
his first appearance, and through the night, when not a single other light
could be seen among the cottages of Grasmere, Coleridge's night-lamp would
be descried by the lonely traveller as he descended the hill from Dunmailraise.
About seven in the morning, when other folk were waking up to life's duties,
' this insulated son of reverie ' was ' retiring for the night ".STAIRCASE OF CROMWELL HOUSE.
He came to llighgate in 1815 to reside in l'cmbcrton Row with the
(iillmans, where he passed the remainder of his life. In the your following be
published 'Christubel,' and in 1825 '.>>\ids to ltefleetion,' and subsequently
other works. At Highgate his occupations were chiefly those of lecturer aml
author; and in 18:25, on the incorporation of the Royal Society of Literature,
Coleridge had the high distinction of being elected one of the first ten Asso-
ciates to receive the annual grant of one hundred guineus ; u by no means
despised addition to his income.

The absence of a proper training had made him slotht'ul and imprudent,
and the tide of prosperity always left. him stranded in pecuniary embarrassments.
These are the blemishes of all otherwise noble and godly life, filled by many
illustrious friendships.

The willing fingers which had so long obeyed the high behest of the skilful
brain at last grew weary; the body, prostrated by the delusive medicinal
remedy, opium, no longer answered to its accustomed tasks ; but the serene mind
and the kindness of soul were characteristic of the man and the Christian to
the lust. \Vithin a few hours of his death he wrote his own epitaph:

the greater part of the people are not aware of. Do we find ourselves nearly
lost in great London, aml unable to make out the way to a certain place?
Well, who shall direct us 1' The postman? 0, no! he looks so busy delivering
his bundle of letters. Who then? This slow-moving policeman. Yes, let us
try him.

' Officer, can you direct us to that address, please?' We hand the card
to him; and at once we get correct instructions. Or if a fire breaks out, he
is ready at once to call the firemen, and knows where a ladder may be found,
so as to use it for rescue before the lire-escape comes. He knows the quickest
way to the tnrncoek's house, and calls him to give a quick supply of water to
put out the fire. Or if a doctor is wanted, he knows where the nearest one
lives. And not only does he know all about his district or ' beat,' but he seems
to be an intelligent man ready at all times with advice and assistance. He
knows when a horse should be in its stable instead of in the shafts, and soon
liuds out if the animal is being ill-treated or not. lIe is courteous, patient,
and civil; will gladly assist timid persons across the crowded roads; and sees
that nothing goes wrong with people or property; and though people and
things often give hiln very much annoyance, he must forget all that annoys,
and speak civilly.'

Policemen have to preserve the peace; to do their utmost to prevent.
robberies and other crimes, and to catch any that offend against the laws; to
watch over the safety of four millions of people, who are Spread over more than
six hundred square miles; and to look after about six lmndrcd thousand houses,
and property that is worth more than twenty millions of pounds. ' Bobby '--
as he is familiarly called, in memory of the great Sir Robert Peel, who first
instituted this useful body of men--is exposed to all kinds of weather, and has
a hard time of it during the cold, wintry nights, while you are soundly sleeping,
snugly tucked in your warm beds. Not only has he to face the sharp winds of
winter, but ofttimes the armed burglar, who resists the officer's interruption
of his midnight thefts. And then it is we find that not only is the policeman
a busy and an intelligent man, but he is a brave man also.

Hark! the cry is raised, 'Stop thief! Stop thief! ' and a ooy is seen racing
down the road. Biddy, the gaunt old Irislnvoman who keeps the hot chest-
nut stall at the corner, has just served a customer, giving change for a piece
of silver. This piece she had just dropped into her long purse, when theTEE POLICEMAN.:48 L 0ND 03/ CHA RA C 2' [IRS

jingle of the money attracted that young rascal's attention, and, quick as
thought, he dashed forward, upsetting her fire and tray of baked nuts, snatched
the purse from her hands, and was 011' like a. shot. It did not take Biddy long
to recover, and soon she was loudly calling, ' Stop thief!' Instantly as the
cry fell upon our slow-moving policemau's ears, he seemed to be full of life,
and,'_eatchiug sight of the thief, was soon with flying strides overtaking him.
Now the thief is caught, and we will leave our policeman on his way to the
station. But we have seen enough of him to know that his life is no easy one;
that his duties, no matter how unpleasant, are performed cheerfully; and that
but for his watchfnlncss and courage we could not feel so safe as we do.

An altogether different-looking person from the one we last chatted about,
is the DUSTMAN. Unlike the policeman, here we have no gloved, clean, neat-
as-a--pin individual, but atall, strong-looking fellow, wearing alarge fantail hat,
coarse grey jacket, and trousers tightly drawn in just below the knee with a strap
and buckle. The little bit of hair showing below the rim of his hat is full of dust,
and his hands and face are begrimed with dirt. But our friend has not made
himself so dirty just for fun or fancy, but has become so in doing his duty.
For his business is to take away the dust, ashes, and rubbish, that are put into
thedust-bins in our back gardens. You have perhaps watched him at work. He
draws the high box-cart close alongside the pavement in front of the house, and
then he and his fellow-workman go to the dust-bin, and proceed to cmptyit with
their shovels and baskets. As soon as one basket is filled, the ' filler' helps it
on to the shoulder of the ' carrier,' who takes it to the cart, mounting up the
side of the cart by means of a ladder, and then returning for the other basket,
which the filler has filled during that time. This precess is repeated at
difi'crent houses till the cart is filled; then the men make the best of their way
to the dust-yard, where they shoot the contents of the cart on to the dust-
heap, and again proceed on their rounds.

Many years ago, when our fathers and mothers were children, people, if
they wanted the dust cleared away, had to keep their ears open for the noise
of a. large hand-bell which the dustmau used to ring to give notice to house-
keepers of his approach. But such bell-ringing became a nuisance, and so it
was stopped, and then the men had to employ the musical instrument they were
born with, I mean the voice. Have you ever had some dust down your throat?
[low it does tickle and make you cough! You don't feel like singing then, doTHE DUSTMAN.
you ? No; but these men, living amongst the dirt and breathing in the dust,
are continually showing the power of a good pair of lungs, as they sing out in
loud and clear tones, ' Dust-oy-ee! Dust-oy-ee ! '

The dust-yards are the places where the dust is brought and sifted, and
these are generally to be found as near as possible to the river or to some canal.
These places are chosen because a large quantity of soil or ashes is taken by
sailing barges down the river to Faversham, Sittingbourne, and other places in
Kent, where there are large brick-making fields. Near the centre of the dust-
yard the largest heap of ' soil,' or the finer portion of the dust, is placed; and
around it are a number of smaller heaps, consisting of the mixed (lust and
rubbish waiting to be sifted.

Among the heaps are the Sifters, old men and women : the women wear
coarse, dirty cotton gowns tucked up behind them, their arms bored above the
elbows, their bonnets crushed and battered, and over their gowns astrong
leather apron. Furnished with iron sieves, they quickly separate the 'soil'
from the 'brcezc' or Cinders, which is placed in another large heap at some
other part of the yard. It is a scene full of life, especially in one of the (lust-
yards just outside London. The sieves are jerked busily backwards and forwards
by the Sifters, and other workers are actively pitching the sifted soil by
shovell'uls to the top of the lofty pile, while children scrape amongst the
rubbish for rags and bones, oyster-shells, old bricks, old tin pots, and old boots.
These they carry away to separate heaps. Carts fully loaded come in, and
empty ones go out, and poultry and pigs scratch and cackle and grant amongst
the heaps.

The dust that is thus collectcd'aud sifted is used either for manure or
for making bricks. The finer soil is found to be just what is wanted to mix
with marshy soil so as to make it fit for cultivation. For making bricks it is
mixed with the clay. When the bricks are put in the kiln to bake, the coarser
portion of the dust-heap, or breeze, is placed between the bricks and on top of
the kiln. So you see how we may enrich our land or build our houses fromthe
contents of the dust-bin. The old bricks and oyster-shells are sold to the
builder, and with them he prepares the ground on which be builds; they also
help in making roads. The old tin pots are re-made into new articles. The
old boots go to the London bootmakers, who use them as stuffing between the
in-sole and the outer one. The rags after a time are turned into paper, &c.;
and from the bones are made buttons and various useful little articles.
Now, as you hear of all the useful things that can be made from such
very unpromising materials, do you not understand better than before the
wisdom of the command, ' Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing
he lost'?

The day has been alittle showcry, and the rain has made the roads and
footpaths just wet and dirty enough for passengers, as they hurry along, to
splash their boots with the mud; and those boots that are not splashed hare
been dulled with the showers, and so our Snonnmcxs areas busy as bees.
For a, pair of dirty boots is one of the many things an Englishman really (lis-
likes ; and that especially if the day is fine, or when the sun suddenly comes
out from behind the clouds, as it does on showery days, dazzling us with its
brilliancy. True shocblaeks' weather, that: For then they, as the old precept
tells them, 'makc hay while the sun shines.' Then it is that the specks of
dirt and splashes of mud seem so large, so annoying, and dull boots seem so
very dull. The shoeblaek knows this; and it is not his fault if people walk
about with dirty boots on their feet. He singles out the dirty boots passing
near him; with a smart salute he asks the wearer, ' Clean your boots, Sir E"
and steps forward with brush ready for action. How rigorously he works,
brushing the splashes of mud from our trousers ! and then, turning them care-
fully up all round, see how he briskly brushes away the dirt, rubs the blacking
well in, and with polishing brushes in both hands, and not forgetting to use
elbow--grease, makes the blood in our feet tingle again with warmth as he
polishes the boots. Ab! and such a polish! If the old folks in ancient days
could have got such a polish on their boots, I think many ol'thcln would have
used them as looking-glasses.

Early in 1851 people were anxiously looking forward to the month of May,
when the Great Exhibition was to be held in Hyde Park. It was the first of
its kind, and was got up at the suggestion of the late Prince Consort.
People from all parts of the world were sending articles to it, and coming to
see it. And some of the good people of London who wanted to do something
for the outcast and destitute children, were thinking and talking too about the
coming event; and amonfit them were three Ragged-School teachers :
Messrs. R. J. Shape, J. MaeGregor (who has since become known as 'Rob
Roy '), and J. R. Fowler. These gentlemen were walking together, when one
of them, who had seen the shoeblaeks of Paris, said, 'Why not turn some ofn.
the boys into the streets as shoeblaeks '9 ' This was a good thought, and many
were willing to help. Soon the lads, whom these good men wanted to rescue
from a life of sin aml crime. were gathered together into a room, where they
were taught to polish boots; and on the last day of March, 1851, five boys, in
their bright red jerseys, were sent out for the first time into the streets of
London as shoeblacks. A penny only was the charge, and it tempted many
clerks, and merchants, and foreigners, to place their boots upon the boys'
boxes, and have them cleaned and polished in right good style.

So the boys picked from the gutter, the street Arabs, the lads used to
thieving, who were now the red-jacketed shoeblacks, commenced their new
life of honesty and industry. At first they were very much annoyed by the
idle boys, who threw flour into their blacking-boxes, and called them nick-
names; but the red-jackets stuck mani'ully to their posts; and it was not long
before those who teased and annoyed them, seeing the dignity of earning an
honest living and having money placed in the bank, wanted also to join the
brigade. And by July of that year there were thirty-three boys employed,
who, during the Exhibition, cleaned over a hundred thousand pairs of boots,
and earned between them five hundred pounds.

Let us take a peep at the 'Old Reds,' or Central Shoeblacks' Home. It
is evening when we go there, just the time when the boys come trooping home
from all directions, balancing their boxes skilfully on their heads. Asking at
the door of the Home in Sall'ron Hill for Mr. Nichols, the Snpermtemlent,
we are soon in a large room, listening to all this gentleman has to tell us
about the lads. Here in one corner is a sort of counter, where the boys, as
they come in, buy what they want for tea, getting a good thick slice of bread
and butter for a halfpenny, enough meat to cover the bread fora penny, and
a half-pint of tea for a hall'penny. Seated at the long tables are several
having their tea, while others who have finished are chatting, laughing, and
joking, waiting to pay in their earnings. The room is well lighted, and upon
the rafters there hang mottocs bidding ' Welcome to all,'_and stating that
' Honesty is the best policy.'

And now the lads come to the little pay-window in the Superintendent's Ofliee
to pay in their earnings. We are shown the nicely kept books, and notice
that whatever the amount of earnings may be, or even if the lad brings in only
two or three pence, Sixpence is immediately given to him. If there is anything:
over, it is then divided into three equal portions: one of which is returned to
the lad, another goes to the Society, and the other is put into the Savings
Bank for the lad, and helps him to buy clothes, to be apprenticed, or to
emigrate. Their average earnings are three shillings and Sixpence per day, so
that maily of them get as much as fifteen or twenty pounds put into the bank
during the year. Upstairs we are shown a. beautifully large and clean schoolroom,
with the Christmas decorations still up, where the schoolmaster, Mr. Bates,
keeps perfect order, and that too although he has to teach sometimes A B C
and other simple lessons to some of the roughest and worst lads that can he
, found in London. Four nights every week they must attend this school, as
well as morning and evening school on Sunday; and every day is begun and
ended with Bible reading and prayer. Upstairs again is the large, clean, and
well-aired dormitory, where forty-five boys sleep.

There are eight other Shoeblack Societies in London besides this; but in
this one alone, since the beginning, there have been nearly six thousand boys,
who have been started in life on the good old principle that ' Honesty is the
best policy.'

Tm; Finsnam--It is late in the evening, and the streets seem more than
usually crowded with passcrs-by, and with the well-filled 'buses and cabs and
other vehicles passing along. There is a constant hum of voices and patter of
feet, and the whir-r of moving wheels, or the noisier rattling over the stones,
as some driver more eager than the rest rushes along. The air is filled with
these and the usual sounds of a. busy street at the close of day, when from far
down the road there comes the hoarse roar of shouts, which we know at once
to herald the coming of an engine of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. In the
distance we see it speeding on its errand of mercy, anld the hoarse cries of ' Hi!
lli ! ' from the firemen warn the drivers of other vehicles to draw away to the
sides of the road, giving a clear space in the middle for the engine to pass
quickly on its way.

0! how grand they look as they dash by! So quickly did they pass that
we had only time enough to catch a glimpse of them, and they were gone. We
could just see thcdrivcr bending to his horses, urging them along, and the
noble and well-trained animals springing forward, seemingscarccly to touch the
ground as they bounded on their way. There was a flash as the light of the
street lamps fell upon the brass helmets, making them glitter as those fearless
men sped by. A shower of sparks, a cloud of smoke, as the engineer put moreTHE l-'XRCMAN'
coal on the engine fire, and the roar of voices cheering and shouting ' Fire!
Fire ! ' dies away in the distance, and they are gone.

A volume of smokejust beginning to be tinged with the red reflection of
the flames shows where the fire has broken out. We want to see these
men at work, so we hasten along to the scene of tile fire. Here we are at last.
The lower part of the house is already burning fiercely, and the flames are
rapidly spreading upwards, till from every window smoke is beginning to pour
forth. There are some people left inside who cannot get out, because the
stairs are burning. But help is at hand, for the crowd in the street is opening
and cheering as the tall fire-escape is rapidly pushed through by eager and
willing hands. Quickly, quietly, and without any confusion, the firenlau sets
his ladders up and leans them against the window-sill of the smoking room
where he is told there are some children. How still and quiet every one is, as
he uimbly runs up tlle ladder, opens the window, and jumps into the room!
And then, when he comes again to the window, carrying the frightened children
whom he has found, what a deafening cheer the crowd give for the brave fellow!
But they are all brave fellows. There is not one among them who would not
do the same if he had the opportunity

But see, there go some in at the smoking doorway to hunt through the
house, to find out where the seat of the fire is, and to see that all the people
have been rescued. And ifyou could follow them, you would see them, when
entering the rooms, stopping to close the doors behind them, and to shut all
the windows, because where there is a draught there the fire burns quickest
and fiercest. You would see them rushing up over the blazing stairs aml
through volumes of smoke, and searching into every nook and corner with
their hunps. When their lamps begin to burn dimly, or go out in the heavy
smoke, then they hasten away from that spot, lest they should become over-
powered with the impure air and be sufi'oeated.

The watcrman is here now, and has got a good supply of water, which is
rising from the plug-hole in a foaming fountain, and is spreading over the
ground, till the fire is reflected as in a glass. The firemen have unrolled their
lcathern hose, and the ground seems to be covered with gigantic worms. The
nozzle to one length of hose is being screwed on by yonder fireman, and as he
raises it and points it, the stream of water rushes through and against the
burning mass, and a cheer bursts from the excited crowd; and again and again
they cheer, as other firemen, some from the ground and others from the houses
around, point their hose and throw stream after stream of water upon the
fire.

There are 58 fire stations, where 39 steam tire-engines and 115 manual
engines, or engines through which the water is pumped by hand, are kept
ready to be sent out at a moment's notice to any fire. There are 137 fire-
escapes and 575 firemen. In one year the firemen were called to as many as
4,292 chimneys on fire, and altogether the engines ran 25,754- journeys, or a
distance of 58,377 miles, and at the fires they pumped 21,000,000 gallons of
water on the flames. You will, I am sure, say, 'What a noble body of men
they are!' and will wish them 'God speed' on all their journeys, when I tell
you that in one year, out of 160 people whose lives were in danger, the London
Fire Brigade rescued 127.

Tns Cumxar Swan--Herc he is, his face as black as soot, his eyes red
with rubbing away the salt tears which the soot has brought out of them ; his
teeth white and glistening, shining out like rows of ivory against his black
face, as he opens his mouth and sings out his well known call of 'Su'e-cp,
swe-ep ! ' We cannot see what the cloth is that his suit is made of, whether
it is fustian or tweed, nor whether it is brown or grey, or any other shade. All
is the colour of soot, for soot covers him from top to toe. It is his business
which so begrilnes him with black. He sweeps the soot from the chimneys of
our houses, and so his dark trade makes him one of our fire-defenders. For if
we allow the soot to gather thickly in the chimney, the fire might turn sweep
---and a very dangerous and expensive one--as a spark or piece of burning
paper carried up by the draught would very quickly set it in a blaze. Our
sweep has a very keen scent for the smell of burning soot, and as the job will
be a profitable one, he is not long in letting the people know of his willingness
to put out the fire. And when it is put out, he will point to his damaged and
scorched machine, and charge heavily for his work.

To see him properly, you must open your eyes very early, as he is up with
the lark in the morning; for his work nmst be done when stoves and chimneys
are cool. In September and October he is very busy; for then we call to mind
that in a little while we shall have November's chilly fogs and Deccmber's
cold winds about us, making us shiver. Then we shall want the cheerful blaze
in the grate, and shall love to draw up nearer to the fire. But first let us see
to the chimneys, and call the sweep in to bring all the soot down. For a foulTHE CHIMNEY SWEEP'
chimney makes a dull fire, and blacks flying about may promote bad tempers.
But after he has done his work about the chimney, and we see the fire brightly
burning, we rub our hands and say, ' What a cheerful fire! llow cosy it is! '
and so forget to be cross. 0 yes! let the sweep come.

The sweep is quite a respectable-looking person, compared with what he
used to be. He no longer looks the ragged, shuffling sweep, calling out in
long, lazy, and dolcful tones, 'Shwi--<<eepf and, instead of walking, he rides
in a neat little cart, drawn by a sleek, well fed, and brightly harnessed little
pony, of which he is the happy possessor. 0n the sides of the cart he (liSplays
his sign-board, with his name in gaily painted letters, stating that he sweeps
chimneys and beats carpets, and that orders are punctually attended to. His
machine is formed of several hollow rods made of cane, which will easily bend.
and will not break in the twists and tnrnings of the chimney. The rods fit
into one another by means of brass screws, and to the top tube of the machine is
fixed the brush or head, which is made of elastic whalcbone spikes. This gives and
bends just as the man who is working the machine moves it either up or down.

But let us go back some seventy or eighty years, and sec h_ow people
managed to get the soot down from their chimneys. You have heard, perhaps,
people frighten children by saying something like this : ' The sweeps will come
and take you away in their bags.' That was only a silly threat; but long ago
sweeps have been known to steal children. Some parents also would sell their
boys if they were small or slenderly formed. For the sweeps wanted such
boys to sweep the chimneys by climbing up inside.

These poor little fellows were made to go up the chimneys, pressing their
knees and elbows against the sides of the fine. When their shoulders and
elbows were firmly fixed, then they shufilcd the legs up; and when their legs
were fixed, then they shuffled the shoulders up. And so they climbed the
chimneys, while, until they were quick and expert, a bigger boy followed, who
often made the small boy go quicker by sticking pins in his feet, and sometimes
by burning straw under him. The poor little ' chunnny,' as he was called, had
' a very painful task; for, what with shuffling up and slipping down, he rubbed
serere sores in his arms and legs. The little climber had a cap to protect his
eyes and mouth, and a sort of flannel tunic, but his arms and legs were bare.
He carried with him a scraper and brush, but they were seldom used, except
where there were turns and corners ; for the boy really swept the greater part
of the soot away by shullling up and down with his shoulders and limbs.
The masters were very cruel to them, beating and kicking them for very
little faults, and would sometimes flog them with a rope made hard at both
ends. Through such a. cruel training, the children grew up to be stunted,
unhealthy, evil, and ignorant men. The sweep in those days lived day and
night covered with soot, for he seldom washed himself; and the climbing boys
lived in very filthy places, and had the soot-bags for their beds. But about
fifty years ago our Government came to their rescue, and stopped the employ-
ment of climbing boys.

The soot which is swept down is sold to market gardeners and others
around London, who use it as a manure to mix with the earth, which it very
much enriches. So even the dirty smoke, as it comes from our coal fires, and
congregates as soot in our chimneys, is of some use.

PUNCH may very well be considered one of our London characters. So
well known )8 Punch, that the sight of the two men, one carrying the show
and the other the drum and pipes, passing through the streets,' ls quite enough
todraw after them a group of curious little folk, all on the tip-toe of excite-
ment, wondering when and where the men will stop and pitch the show. Just
a very little way down a by-turning in one of the principal streets, is a favourite
spot for setting down the show.

At such a spot there may often be seen a. little crowd of children gathering
almost before the show has been pitched, or the man has had time to get
within the curtain. For, although he does not intend you shall know it, the
showman is inside, hidden away from sight by the long green haize curtain
'that falls around. The little ones, watching the lively movements of the
figures, and hearing the curious talk, and of course seeing no other man than
the one outside who is busy with his drum and pipes, innocently imagine that
the figures are speaking. There are some preparations to he made by the
showman; so, while they are going on, the man with the drum suspended
from his shoulders, and the row of pipes stuck just within the folds of his
scarf, tries to swell the crowd by blowing a tune on the pipes, keeping up a '
rub-a-dub-dub accompaniment on the drum. There is not much music in the
noise this musician is creating, but the well--known strains from the pipes soon
draw the people around, anxiously awaiting the appearance of Punch, and
curious to see his merry performances.

People of all sorts gather round. Little ones in the cure of bigger'li:

brothers and sisters are lifted up in their arms, or on their shoulders, so that
they may see PUNCH. Shoeless, hatlcss, and perhaps homeless boys and girls,
who spend most of their time roaming the streets, squeeze in to have one
piece of merriment, and laugh at the comical figures. The errand boy at sight
of Punch's funny face forgets his business, and, putting his basket down, settles
himself comfortably to have a. spell of enjoyment. Nor does any one seem too
old to watch the show. The old lady with her market-basket on her arm is
as well pleased as any juvenile, and even the busy man of business must stop a
moment on the outskirts of the crowd and enjoy the mirth of this merry
exhibition. ,

Punch seems to have made his first appearance in England more than
two hundred years ago; for we find that in 1666--7 an Italian puppet-player set
up his booth at Charing Cross, and paid a small rental to the overseers of the
parish of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. If we look in their books under that
date, we shall see four entries of various sums ' received of Punchinello, ye
Italian popet player, for his booth at Chariug Cross.' 80 that Master Punch-
is rather an old inhabitant in our midst, and we may look upon him as a rare
relic of the rough fun of our forefathers.

Amongst a multitude of London cries, having reference to watercresses,
milk, muffins, etc. ., you will sometimes hear that of 'Chairs to mend!' and,
looking from your window, will see a man and his wife, with a basket of tools
and some lengths of cane, ready and anxious to repair any old cane-bottomed
chairs that may need to be committed to their care. Sometimes such people
will undertake the repair of umbrellas as well; but I need scarcely say that
umbrellas must be kept well within sight, if you consign them to persons
whom you do not know, and whose principles may not be so correct as they
should be.

At evening, when streets are being repaired, or buildings erected, you
will sometimes come across a steady-looking old man, who is left in charge
of tools and valuable material, and who has to keep watch and ward all the '
night It is apost of trust, and also of some danger to the health, especially
on cold, rainy, gusty nights, when the watchman needs any shelter and warmth
he can get. Our artist has portrayed one who is fortunate in having a nice
little daughter to bring him something hot for his supper.

Another sight often to be seen in London streets is that of danger in-',CELIBHENDBRS.THE WATCHERS.Jae

curred in crossing the busy roadway. You and I need to have all our wits
about us, to keep ourselves cool and collected, and to exercise a. sharp look out,
when we cross from side to side. But poor little children often run great risks
in this way; and I am always glad to see a good man or woman, big boy or
girl, in true Christian kindness, take the little ones by the hand, and steer
them quietly and steadily across the perilous road. Often, in the City, a tall,
stalwart policeman fulfils this good ofiice, and so deserves well of his country.
LONDON STONE--FAREWELL.

:m'wxemn:

     
 
  
   
   

E have had several pleasant walks and talks together, and now,
_ .1 for the present, we are come to the end of our travels. I dare
cg] say, if you live in London, you have often longed to be away in the
country, out in the fields and lanes, and on the hill sides, or on the
beach or the cliffs. Well, let us hope we shall all have our fair
share of rural enjoyment. But, meanwhile, till our turn for holiday comes,
do not let us make ourselves unhappy by longing for what we cannot con-
veniently have just now. The country is all the more delightful by way of
change and contrast, and the town is just as charming to young country folks
as the fields and woods are to us townspeople. There is much to be seen in
both, and we may pass the time very agreeably in noting everything remarkable
in the city and suburbs, and so making ourselves ready to guide and entertain
our country cousins when they come to see us. '
When you have been staying in the country, and have taken a. nice walk
with your cousins or friends, you have sometimes wanted to know the name of
a. tree or of a wild flower, or whose seat that nice mansion in the distance was;
and you have been a little disappointed and surprised if your companions have
not been able to tell you what you wantedto learn, and you have wondered what
was the good of living in the country if people did not know the names and
properties of all the pretty and interesting objects that surround them. Well,
now, when your friends return the visit, and come to see the sights of London,
you will feel a little awkward and ashamed if you cannot act as an intelligent
guide to at least a good part of the notable things in and about this great city.
I shall be very glad if the few talks we have had together shall furnish you
with enough information to make a good beginning. When once you have felt
the pleasure of imparting information--not prosily, but inbrilliunt little pieces,
as occasion offers--I am sure you will feel inclined to go on in the path of

knowledge, and pick up and store away, ready for use, larger fragments of
topical lore.

Where shall we take leave of each other ? Shall it be in me precincts of
Paternoster Row, where, if we turn round into Panyer Alley, we shall find a
stone built into the wall of a house, supporting the figure of a pannier, or
wicker basket, surmounted by a boy, and hearing this inscription :

' When you have sought the city round,
Yet still this is the highest ground ' P

No, I think we will go a little eastward, and find St. Swithin's church, in
Cannon Street, nearly opposite the railway station. Here, inserted in the
outer wall of the church, we shall discover the famous LONDON STONE, and get
a glimpse at the top of it through an oval opening. This is supposed to have
been the old Roman milestone which formed the centre from which the high
roads radiated through England. It is not a. very beautiful object; but it is
an old landmark, and so here, in the centre of London life, we will shake hands
and bid each other a hearty ' Goon Brn' till we meet again.
