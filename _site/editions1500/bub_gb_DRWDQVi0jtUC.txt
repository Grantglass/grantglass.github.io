R O B I N S O N CRUS O E. 


I Was 'bornatYorl;, in the year 1632, of a re;- 
putable family. My father was a native of Brer 
who, by raerchandhing at Hull for fome tiine^ 
gained a very plentiful fortune. He married *my 
mother at York, who received her firft. breath in 
that countryi and as her maiden name was Rpbiiir 
fon,' I was called Kreutzno£t\ which not 

being ealily pronounced in the Englifti tongue, we 
■are commonly known by the name of Crufoc. 

I was the youngeft of three brothers. The eld- 
• ‘eft was a lieutenant-colonel in Lockhart’s regiment, 
but flail! by the Spaniards : what became of the 
other, I -could never learn. 

No charge nor paiiis were w'anting inmy educar ' 
tion. My father dgligned me for the law ; yet no- 
tching, \yould ferve me but 1 mull go to fea, bntha- 
'gainlbthe will of my father, the tears of my mother,, 
and the intreaties.of friends. Orie rabrning ray fa- 
ther expoflulated very warmly with me ; What rear

<lition of uneafinefs and uncertainty ? He recom- 
mended to me Agur’s wifii, Neither to dejire poverty 
nor riches ; that a middle ftate of life was the moft 
happy; and that the high towering thoughts of rai- 
ling our condition by wandering abroad, were fur- 
rounded with mifery and danger, and, often ended 
with confulion and difappointinent. I intreat you, 
nay,l command^you, (fays he,) to defiftfromthefe in- 
tentions. Confider your eldeft brother, who laid 
(down his Ufe for his honour, or rather loft it for 
his difobedience to my will. If you will go, (added 
lie,) my prayers fliall however be offered for your 
prefervatipn ; but a time may come, when, defolate, 
opprelfed, or forfaken, you may wifh you had taken 
^ your poor defpifed father’s counfel.' He pro- 

nounced thefe words with fuch a moving and pater- 
nal eloquence, while floods of tears ran down his 
aged cheeks, that it feemed to ftem the torrent of 
my refolutions. But this Toon wore off, and a little 
after I informed my mother, that I could not fettle 
to any bufinefa, my refolutions were fo ftfong to 
fee the world; and begged flie would gain my fa- 
ther’s confent orily to go one voyage; which, if it 
did nqt prove profperoUa, I would never attempt 
a fecond. But my defire was as vain as my folly 
in afking. My mother paflionately expreffed her 
difiike of this propofal, telling me. That as/Ijefa-w' 
I ivas bent upon my ovjn deflru 6 iion^ contrary to their 
'voill and my duty ^ Jloe 'would fay no more^ but leave 
?ne to myfdf to do •whatfoever I pleafed. 

I was then,,I think, nineteen years old, when one 
tithe being at Hull, I met a fchool-fellow of mine 
going along with his father, who was mafter of a fhip, 
toLdndon; andacquainting himwithmy wandering 
defires, he affured me of a free pajTage, and a plenti- 
ful fhare of what was neceffary. Thus, without im- 
ploring a bieffmg, or taking farewell of my parents, 

I took lliipping on the firft of September 1651. We-

fet fail foon after; and our fliip had fcarce left the 
Humber aftern, when there arofe fo violent a llor.m, 
that, being extremely fea-lick, I concluded the judg- 
ments of God defervedly followed me for ray dif- 
obedience to my dear parents. It was then 1 called 
to mind the good advice of my father j how eafy 
and comfortable was a middle ftate of life ; and I 
firmly refolved, if it pleafed God to fet me on dry 
land once more, I would return to my parents, 
implore their forgivennefs, and bid a final adieu to 
my wandering inclinations. 

Suchweremy thoughts while the florm continued j 
but thefe good refolutionsdeereafed with the danger; 
more efpecially vrhen my companion came to me, 
clapping me on-the fhoulder ; What^ Bob ! faid he,> 
Jure you "was. not frightened laji night •with fcarce a 
capful of ’windP — And doyou^ cried I, calljuch a vio- 
lent form a capfull of vjind? A florm^ you fool yoti^ 
laid he, this is nothhg : a good Jhip and fea-room al- 
ways baffles fuch a foolijh f quail of wind as that: But 
you’re a freff waterfailor : Come^ hoy^ turn fee 
what fine iueather we have now ^ ana a good bowl' of 
punch will' drown all your pafi Jbrrows. In fhort, the 
punch was made, I was drunk, and in one night^s 
time drowned both my repentance and my good re- 
folutions, forgetting entirely the vows and promifea 
1 made in my diftrefs : and whenever any reflec- 
tions would return on me, what by company, and 
what by drinking, I foon maftered thofe fits, as I 
deridingly called them. But this only made way 
for another trial, whereby I could not but fee how 
much r was beholden to kind providence. 

Upon the fixth day we came to an anchor in Har- 
, wichroad, where welay wind-boundwithfomeNew- 
callle Ihips'j and therebeing good anchorage^ and 
our cables found, the feamen forgot their late toil 
and danger, and fpent the time as inerry as- if they 
had been on Ihore. But on the. eighth day there

arofea brilk gale of win<l, which prevented our ti- 
ding it up the river; and ftill increafing, our fliip 
rode forecaflte in, and fliipped feveral large feas. 

It was not long before horror feized the feamen 
themfelves, and I heard the Mailer exprefs this me- 
lan choly ej a cul^-tion^Lordhavemercy upon us^we/haK 
be- all loji and undone I For my part, lick unto death, 

I kept my eabin, till the univerlaland terribly dread* 
fu! apprehenlions of our fpeedy fate made me get 
upon deck j and there I was affrighted indeed. The 
fea went mountains high : I could fee nothing but 
diltrefs around us; two flips had cut their malls on 
boaj'd, and another was foundered ; two mor‘6 that 
had loll their anchors, were forced out to the mercy 
of the ocean; and, to fave our lives, we were for- 
ced' to cut our foreman and main-mail quite away. 

, Who is there fo ignorant as not to judge of my 
dreadful condition ! I was but a frefli-water lailor^ 
pud therefore it feemed more terrible. Our Ihip 
was very good, but over-loaded; which made the fail- 
ors often cry out. She would founder’. Words I then 
was ignorant of.’ All this while the florm continu- 
ing, and rather increaling, the mailer and the more 
-foberpart of his men went to prayers, ei;pe£ling death 
' every moment. In the middle of the night one cried 
out, We had fprung a leak’, another there was 
four foot water in the hold. I .was jufl ready to ex- 
pire withfear, when immediately all hands werecal- 
led to the pump; and the men forced me alfoin that 
extremity tdlharewith them in their labour. While 
thus employed, themaller efpyinglbmelight collicfs' 
bred a gun as a lignal of dillrefs; and I not under- 
Handing what it meant, and thinking that either the 
Ihip broke, or fome dreadful thing happened, fell 
into a fwoon. Even in that common condition of 
woe,' nobody minded me, excepting to thfull me a- 
lide with their feet, thinking me dead, and it was 
■a great while before. I recovered. 

Happy

Happy it was for ns, when, jipon the fignal given, 
they ventured out their boat to fave our lives. Ali 
our pumping had been in vain, and vain had all our 
attempts been, had they not come to our Ihip’s Tide, 
and our men caft them a rope over the flern with a 
buoy to it, which after great labour they got hold 
of, and we haling them to us, got into their boaty 
and left our (hip, which we perceived link within lefs- 
than a quarter of an hour; and thus I learned what 
v/VL's Foundering at fea. And now tl:^ 

niCn inceflantly laboured to recover their own iliip ; 
butthefearan fa high, and the wind blew fo hard, that 
they tbouglit it convenient to hale within (hore;. 
which, with great dililcu It y and danger, at'laft we 
happily effeded, landing at a place called G cmer, not 
far from Winterton light houfe ; from whence we 
all v/alked to Yarmouth, where, as objects of pity^ 
many good people furnilhed ns wkh necelFaries to- 
‘carry us either to Hull or London. 

Sti*ange, that after all this, like the prodigal foni 
I did not returu to my father ; who, hearing of the 
ihip’s, calamity, for a long time thought me intpmb- 
ed in the deep. No doubt but I lliould h?ive flyared 
in kis fatted calf as the fcripture exprelTeth it : 
but my ill fate ill 11 puflied trie- on, in fpite of the 
powerful, convidions of reafon and confcienee. 

When 'we had been at Yarmouth three day s,Imet 
my old companion, who had given me the invitation- 
to go on board along with his father. His behavi-- 
our andfpeechwas altered, and ina melancholy man-^, 
ner alked me how I did, telling his father who I was,, 
and how I had made this voyage for a trial only to/ 
proceed farther abroad. Upon which the old gentle-

with a captain who took a fancy to me, to go to the

-gation, how to keep an account of the fliip’s courfe, 
take an obfervation, and led me \nto the knowledge 
of feveral ufeful branches of the mathematics. And 
'indeed this voyage made me both a failor and a mer- 
chant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces 
of gold duft for my adventure, which produced, at 
rny return to London^ almort three hundred pounds. 
But in this voyage I was extremely fick, being thro wn 
into a violent calenture through excellive heat, tra- 
ding upon the coaft from the latitude of fifteen de-* 
grees north even to-the line itlelf. 

But alas I my dear friend the captain fooh departed 
this life after his" arrival. This was a fenfible grief 
to me; yet Trefolved to go another voyage with his- 
mate, who had now got command of the fliip. This 
proved a very unfucce'lsful one ; for though I did not 
carry quite a hundred pounds of my late acquired 
vFealth, (fothatl hadtwo hundredpoundsleft. Which 
I repofed with the captain’s widow who was an ho- 
neft gentlewoman,) yet my misfortunes in this un- 
happy voyage were very great. For our (hip failing

fothat we prepared ourfelves to fight. They had eigh>-

in many Were killed and wounded on both Tides; but 
finding ourfelves overpowered with numbers, our' ‘ 
fhip difabled, and ourfelvestoo impotent to have the ■ 
lead: hopes of fuccels, we were forced to furrender; 
and accordingly were all carried prifoners.into the

came afrefh into niy thoughts. However, my condl' 
tion was better than I thought it to be, as will foon 
appear. Some hopes indeed I had that my new pa- 
tron would go to fea again, where he might be taken 
by aSpanifli or Portugoefe man of war, and then I 
lliould be fet at liberty. But in this I was miftaken ^ 
for he never took me with him, but left me to look 
after his little garden, and do the drudgery of his 
houfe, and when he returned from fea, would make 
me lye in the cabin, and look after the fliip. I had 
no one that I could communicate my thoughts to, 
which were continually meditating my efcape ; no 
Englifliman, Irifliman, or Scotfman here but my- 
felf ; and for tvyo years I could fee nothing pra£li- 
cable, but only pjeafed myfelf with the imagination* 
After fome length of time, my patron, as I found, ^ 
grew fo poor, that he could not fit out his fliip as u? 
fualr and then he ufed conftantly, once or.twicea- 
week, if the weather was fair, to go out a-fifhing, 
taking me and a young Morefco'boy to row theboat 
and fo much pleafed was he with me for my dexte- 
rity in catching the filh, that he would often fend 
' me with a Moor, who was one of his kinfmen, and 
the Morefeo youth, to catch a dilh of fifli for him* 
One morning as we were at the fport, therearofe 
fuch a thick fog, that we lofl fight of thefhore; and 
rowing we knew not which way, we laboured all the 
night, and in the morning found Ourfelves in the 
ocean, two leagiles from land. Ho\vever,we attain- 
ed there at. length, and made the greater hafie, be- 
caufe our Ifomachs were exceeding (harp and hun- 
gry. In order to preventfuchdifattersfor thefuturCy 
my patron ordered a carpenter to builda little flate- 
Toom or cabbin in the middle of the long-boat, .with- 
a place behind it to fleer and hale home themaia 
' llieet, with other conveniences to keep him from, 
the weather, as aifo lockers to put in all manner- 
of provifions, with a handfoine fhoulder-of-muttpiv 
fail,, gibing over the cabin,-

Iri this he frequently took us out a-fifhing j and

togd vvithhim,madeprovirions extraordinary, provi- 
ding alfotht'ee fufees with powder and (hot, that they 
might have fome fportat fowling alongthe fea-coaflr. 
The next morning. the boat was made clean, her an- 
cient and pendants out, and every thing ready^ but 
their minds altering, ray patron ordered us to go 
a-filhing for that his guefts^would certainlyfup with 
him that night. ' 

r And now t began to think of my deliverance in- 
deed. In order to this I perfuaded the moor to get 
fome proviiions oh board, as not daring to meddle 
with our patron’s; and he taking, my advice, we flo- 
red ourfelves with rulkbifcuit, and three jars of wa- 
ter. Befides, r privately conveyed into the boat a 
bo'ttle of brandy, fome twine, thread, ahammer, hat- 
chet, and a faw; andin particular fome bees-wax, 
which was a great comfort to me, andfervedto make 
candles. IthenperfuadedMuley (for fo was the moor- 
called) to procure fome powder and (hot, pretending, 
to kill fea-curlieus, which he innocently and readily 
agreed t0. in fliort, being provided with all things 
tiecelTary, we failed out,' refolving for my own part 
to make my efcape tho’ it fhould cqft me my life. 

When we had pafled the caftle, we^ell tb filhing; 
but tho’ I ‘knew there was a bite, I diflembled the 
matter, in order to put further out to fea. Accord- 
ingly we ran a league further ; \vhen giving the boy 
the hern, and pretending to ftoop for fomething, I 
feized Mulcy by fiirprife, and threw him overboard. 
'As he was an excellent fwimmer, he foon ai*ofej and 
made towards the -boat i upon which I took out a 
fufee, and prelented itathim: Mitiey^ faid I, I never

The harm lefs creature, atthefewords, turned himfelf 
froinme, and I makeno doubt got fafe to land. Then 
turning to the boy Xury, I perceived he trembled at 
the adion j but- 1 put him out of all fear, telling him, 
that if he would be true and faithful to me, I would 
do well by him. And therefore^ faid I, mujijlroke

him, and from that day forward began to love hint 
entirely. 

W e then purfued our voyage ; andleflthey fliould 
think me gone to the Streigh^t’s mouth, I kept to 
the Southward to the truly Barbarian coafl: ; but 
in the dulk of the evening I changed ray courfe^ 
and fleered diredly S. and by E. that J might keep- 
near the fhore ; and having a frefh gale of wind, 
with a pleafant fmooth fed, by three o’clock next 
day I was 150 miles beyond the Emperor of Mo- 
rocco’s dominions. Yet flill having the dreadful 
apprehenfion of being retaken, 1 continued failing 
for five days fucceflively, till fuch time as the wind 
fhifting to the fcuthward, made me conclude, that 
if any velTel was in’chace of me, they would pro-_ 
ceed no further. After fo much fatigue and 
thought, I anchored at the mouth of a little river, 

1 knew not what, or where : neither did I then, 
fee any people. What, I principally wanted waS' 
frefh water ; and I was refolved about the dufk to 
fwim afhore. But nofooner did the gloomy clouds 
of night begin to fucceed the declining day, when 
we heard fuch barking, roaring, and howling of 
wild creatures, that one might have thought the 
very flrangefl monfters of natuire, or infernal fpi- 
rits, had their refidence there. Poor Xury, #1-

and in the morning we' Jhould fee men who are worfe 
than thofe we fear ^ what then? 0 den we may give 
dem de foot. gun replied Hury laughing, and de^ 
gun make dem all ruh away. The wit, andBroSen 
Englifii which the boy had learned among the cap-* 
tives of ' our nation, pleafed me entirely ; and to 
add to his chearfulnefs, I gave him a dram of the 
bottle: we could get but little deep all the night 
for thofe terrible howjings they made; and indeed 
we were both very much alFrighted, when, by the 
rollings of the water, and other tokens, we juflly 
concluded one of thofe monfters made towards our 
boat. I could not fee it till it came within two 
oars length, when taking my fufee, 1 let fly at 
him. Whether I hit him or no, I cannot tell 4 but 
he niade towards the fiiore, and the noife of my 
gun increafed the ftupendous noife of the. mon- 
gers. 

The next morning I was refolved to go on lliore 
to get frofir water, and venture my life among the 
beails or favages, fliould either attack me. Xury 
fdid, he would take one of the jars, and bring me 
fome. I alk,ed him why he would go, and not I ? 
The poor boy anfwered, If wild 'mans come, they 
■tat me, you go way. A mind fcarcely now to be

Hiofl: powerful law of nature! This indeed increaf-

they fall eat neither of us. So giving Xury a piece 
of rulk bread to ea^ and a dram, we waded a- 
fliore, carrying nothing with us but our/arms, and 
two jars for water. . I did not go out of fight of 
the boat, as dreading the favages coming down the 
river in their canoes : but the boy fedng a low 
defeent or vale about a mile in .the country, he

wandered to it ; and then running back to me with 
great precipitation, I thought h€ wp purfued by 
fome lavage or wild beaft; upon which I approach-' 
ed, refolving toperifh dr proteft him from danger. 
As he came nearer to m^, I faw Ibmething hang- 
ing over* his Ihoulders, which wal a creature he 
had Ihot like a hare, but different in colour, and 
longer legs ; however, we were glad of it, for it 
proved wholefome and nourifhing meat; but what 
added to our joy was, my boy alfured me there 
was plenty of water, and that he fee no wildmans. 
And greater fUll was our comfort,' when we found 
frelh water in the creek where we were whi^n the 
tide was out, without going fo far up into the 
country. 

In this place I began to confider that the Cana- 
ry and Cape de Verde iflands lay not far off; but 
having no inllrument, I knew not what latitude, 
or when to fland off to feafor them; yet my hopes 
were, I Ihould meet fome of the Englilh trading 
velTels, who would relieve and take us in. 

The place I was in was no doubt that wild coun- 
try, inhabited only by a few, that lyes between 
the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and the Ne- 
grcfes. It is filled with wild bealls, and the Moors 
ufe it for hunting chiefly. From this place I 
thought I faw the top of the mountain T enerilfe 
in the Canaries ; which made me try twice to at- 
tain it ; but as often was I drove back, and fb fort 
ced to purfue my fortune along fliore. 

Early one morning we came to an anchor un- 
der a little point of land, but pretty high ; and 
the tide beginning to flow, we lay ready to go 
further in, but Xury, whofe youthful and pene-

cfpiedra fearful raonfter indeed. It was a terrible 
gre^at lion that lay on ftore, covered as it wei e 
by a fhade of a piece of the hill. Xnry, faid I, 
you Jhali go on Jljore and kill him. But the boy 
looked amazed; Me kill hint., fays he, he eat me 
at one mouth ; meaning one mouthful'. Upon which 
I bid him lye ftill, and charging my biggeft gun 
with two flugs, and a good charge of powder, I 
took the belt aim I could to flioot him through 
the head; but his leg lying over- his nofe, the (lug 
broke his knee bone. The. lion awaking with the 
pain, got up, but foon fell down^ giving the moft 
hideous groan I ever heard; but taking my fecond 
piece, r (hot him through the head, and then he 
lay flruggling for life. Upon this Xury took heart;

iflands, or lofe my life among the negroes. And 
in a word, I put my whole ftrefs upon this; “ Ei- 
“ that I muft meet with fome fliip, or certainly 
“ perifii.” 

One day as we were failing along, We faw peo- 
ple ftand on thelhore looking at us; we could al- 
io perceSve they were black, and flark naked. I 
was inclined to go on lliore; but Xury cried. No, 
no; however -I approached nearer, and I found 
they run. along the Ihore by me a good way. They 
had no weapons in their hands, except one, who 
held a long flick, which Xury told me was a lance 
with which they could kill at a great diflan ce. I 
t-alked to them by ligns, and made them fenfible I 
wanted fomething to eat; they beckoned to me to 
flop my boat, while two of them ran up into the 
country, and in lefs than half an hour came back, 
and brought with- them two pieces of dry flefh, 
and fome corn, which we 'kindly accepted ; and to 
prevent any fears on either fide, they brought the 
food to the fhore, laid it ^own, then went and 
Rood a great way off till we fetched it on board, 
and then came clofs to lis again. 

But while we were returning thanks to them, 
being all we could afford, two mighty creatures 
came from the mountains, one as it were purfuin.g 
the other tvith great fury, which we were the ra- 
ther inclined to believe', as they feldom appear 
but in the night; and both thefe fwiftly palling by 
the negroes jumped into the fea, wantonly fwim- 
ining about, as though the diver f ion of the waters 
had put a flop to their fiercenefs. At lafl one of 
them coming nearer to my boat than I expedled 
or delired, I fhot him direflly through the head; 
upon which he funk immediately, yet rifmg again, 
would have willingly made to the fliore; but be- 
tween the wound and the flrangling of the water, 
he died before he could reach it.

perceived the creature to be flain by it. I made 
ligns to them to draw near it with a rope, and 
then gave it to them to hale on fliore. It Was a 
beautiful leopard which made me defire its Ikin : 
and the negroes feeming to covet the carcafe, I 
freely gave it to them. A,s for the other leopard,

OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. ^ 17 

Being recommended to an horieftplariter, I lived 
with him till fuch time as I was informed of the 
manner of their planting and making fugarj and 
feeing how well they lived, and how I'uddenly they 
grew rich, I was filled with a defire to fettle a- 
mong them, and refolved to get my money remit- 
ted to me, and to pur chafe a plantation. 

To be brief, I baught a fettlement next door to an 
honen; and kind neighbour, born at Lilbon, of Eng- 
lifh parents,- whofe plantation joining to mine, we 
improved very amicably together. Both our fiocks 
were low, and for two years we planted only for 
food: but the third year we planted fome tobacco, 
and each of us drelTed a large piece of ground the 
enfuing year for planting canes. But now I found- 
how much I wanted afl'ulance, and repented the' 
lofs of my dear boy Xury.- 

Having none to aflift me, niy father’s tvords , 
came into my mind; and 1 ufcd «to aflt rayfelf, If 
what I fought was only a middle f la don of life, why 
could it net as well be obtained in England as here ? • 
When I pondered on this with regret, the thoughts 
of my late deliverance' forfook me. I had none to 
converfe with but- my neighbour; no work to be 
done but by my own hands; it often made me fay,^ 
my condition was like to that of a man cafl upon 
a defolate ifland. So unhappy are we in our fe- 
fle'dions, fo forgetfiil of what good things %ve re- 
ceive ourfelver, and fo unthankful for our deli- 
verance from thofe calamities that otbers endure. 

I was in fome meafure' fettled, before the cap- 
tain, who- took me up, departed from the Brafils. 
0 .ne day I went to him, and told him what ftocic 
I had in London, i defiring his afllflance in getting, 
it remitted ; to which the good gentleman readily 
confented, btit would only have me fend for half

and fa taking letters of procuration from me, bid 
me trouble myfelf no farther about it. 

And irideed wonderful was his kindnefs towards 
me; for he not only procured the money I had 
drawn for upon my Captain’s widow, but fent-nie 
over a fervaiit with a cargo, proportionable to 
my condition. He alfo fent me over tools of all 
forts, iron work, and utenlils necelTary for my 
plantation, and which proved of the greateO: ute 
to me in my bulinefs. 

Wealth now accumulating on me, and uncom- 
mon fuOcefs crowning my profperous labours, I 
might have relied happy in that middle Hate of 
life my father had fo often recommended ; yet no- 
thing w6uld Content me, fuch.was my: evil genius, 
but I ipull leave this happy llation, for a foolilh 
ambition in rifmg : and thus, once more, I call 
myfelf into the deep efl gulf of raifery that ever 
a poor creature fell into. Having lived four years 
in Brafil, I had npt only learned the language, 
but contrafted acquaintance with theraoH eminent 
planters, and even the merchants of St. Salvadorej 
to whom, once, by way of difeourfe, having given 
an account of my tv/o voyages to the coall of 
Guinea, and the manner of trading there for mere, 
trifles, by which we furnilh our plantations with 
negroes, they gave fuch attention to what I faid, 
that three of them came one morning to me, and 
told me they had a fecret propofal to make. Af- 
ter injoining me to feqrecy, (it being an infringer- 
ment on the powers of the kings of Portugal and 
Spain,) they told me they had a mind to fit out a 
lliip to go to Guinea, in order to flock the plan- 
tation with negroes, which, as they could not be 
publicly fold, they would divide among them and 
if I would go their fupercargo in the Ihip, to ma- 
nage the trading part, I Ihould have an equal lhare 
of the negroes, without providing any Hock. The-, 

thing 



6# ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1.9 

tBing indeed was fair enough, had I been in ano- . 
ther condition. But I, born to be my own de- 
ftroyer, could not relifV the propofal, but accept 
ted the offer, upon condition of their looking af- 
ter my plantation. So malting a formal will, I 
bequeathed my effeds to my good friend the cap- 
tain, as my univerfal. hen*; but obliged him to dif- 
pofe of my effe^ls as direiicd,- one half of the pro- 
duce to himfelf, and the other to be i fliipped to 
England. ^ ’ v 

The fhip being fitted out, and all things ready, 
we fet fail on the firft of September 1659, being 
the fame day eighth year I left my father and, mo- 
ther in YorkOhre. We failed northward upon the 
coafV, in -order to gain Africa, till we made Cape 
Augufline ; from whence, going farther in the' 
ocean, out of fight of land,' we fleered as though 
we were bound for the ifle Fernand de Norenba, 
leaving the i (lands on the eafi; and then it was we 
met with a terrible tempefl, which continued for 
twelve days fucceffively, fo that the winds carried 
us wherefoever they pleafed. In this perplexity, 
one of our men died, and one man and a boy were 
wafhed over board. : When the weather cleared 
up a little, we found ourfelves eleven degrees' 
north latitude, upon the coafl of Guinea. Upon 
this thecaptain gave reafons for returning; which 
I oppofed, counfelling him to fl^nd away forBar- 
.badoes, which,, as I fuppofed, might be attained 
in fifteen days. So altering our courfe, we failed 
iiorth-wefl: and by weft, in order to .reach the lee*? 
ward iflands; but a fecond florm fucceeding, droV(? 
us to the wcflward ; fo that we were juftly afraid 
of falling into the hands of cruel -favages, or tho 
paws of devouring beads of prey. 

In this great diftrefs, one of our men, early in 
the morning, cried out, Land, land; which he had- 
no fooner cried out, hut our fliip ftruck upon a 
; fand,' 



ao LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

fand, and in a moment the fea broke over her lit 
fuch a manner, that we expelled we fliould all have 
periflied immediately. We knew nothing where 
we were, or upon what land we were driven ; 
whether Sn ifland or the main, inhabited or not 
inhabited ; and we could riot fo much as hope that 
the Ihip would hold out many minutes, without 
breaking in pieces, except the wind by a miracle 
Ihould^turn about immediately. While we flood 
locking at one another, expedljng death every mo- 
ment, the mate lays hold of the boat, and with 
the help of the reft got her flung over the fhip’s 
fide, and getting all into her, being eleven of uS,.' 
committed ourfelvCs tq God’s mercy, and the-wild 
lea. And now w’e faw that this latt effort would 
not be a fufficient proteftion from death f fo high did 
the fea rife, that it was impolhble the boat fhould 
live. As to making fail, we had none y neither if 
we had, could we make ufe of any. So that when 
W'e had rowed, or rather were driven about a 
league and a half, a raging wave, like a lofty 
mountain, came rolling aftern of us, and took us 
with fuch fury, that at once it overfec the boat. 
Thus being fwallowed up in a moment, we had 
hardly time to call upon the tremendous name of 
God; much lefs to implore, in dying ejaculations^ 
his infinite mercy to receive our departing fouls. 
Men are generally counted infenfibie, w'hen 
firuggling in the pangs of death ; but while I was 
overwhelmed with w’ater, I had the moft dreadful 
apprehenlions imaginable;, for the joys of heaven 
and the torments of hell, feemed to prefent them-i 
felyes before me inthefe dying agonies, and even 
the fmall fpace of time, as it were, between life and 
death. I w’as going, I thought, I knew not whe-

to ftrike me with horror and confuiion 1' I flrove 
however to the Jaft extremity, while all my com- 
panions were overpowered and iritombed in the 
deep : and it was with great difficulty I kept my

ta'ken in. As foon as I got on my feet, I ran as 
fart as I could, lert another wave fhould purfue 
me, and carry me back again. But, for all the 
harte I made, I could not avbid it ; for the fea 
came after me dike a high mountain, or furious 
enemy j fo that my bufin el's was to hold my breath*

time carried me with a mighty force" and fw'iftnefe 
toward the ffiore ; when raifing myfelf, I held out 
as W'dl as polfible, till at length the water having 
fpent itfelf, begaii to return, at which d ftrnck 
forward, and feeling ground with my feet, I took 
to ray heels again. Thus being ferved twice more, 
I was at laft daflied againft a piece of a rock, in 
fuch a manner as left me fenfelefs; but recovering 
a little before the return of the wave, which, ho 
doubt, would then have overwhelmed me, I held 
fart the rock till thofe fucceeding waves abated? 
and then fetching anoflier run, was overtaken by^ 
a fmall'wave, which was foon conquered^ But 
before any more could overtake me, I reached the 
main land, where, clambering up the clifts of the

It was like a reprieve to a dying malefoftor, with 
the halter about his neck, and ready to be turned 
off. I was wrapt up in contemplation, and often 
lifted up my hands, with the profoundeft humility, 
to the divine powers, for faving my life, when 
the reft of my companions were all drowned. And 
now I' began to caft my eyes around, to behold 
what place I was in, and what I had next to do. 
I could fee no houfe nor people t I was wet, yet 
had no cloaths to fhift me j hungry and thirily, 
yet nothing to eat or drink.; no weapon- to de- 
ftroy. any creature for my fuftenance, nor defend 
rayfelf againft devouring beafts. In fliort I had 
nothing but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a box half 
filled with tobacco. The darklome night coming 
upon me, increafed my fears of being devoured 
by wild creatures ; my hiind was plunged in de- 
fpair, and having no profpeft, as 1 thought, of life 
before me, I prepared for another, kind of death 
than what I had lately efcaped. I walked about a 
furlong to fee if I could find any freflt water, which 
I did, to my great joy; and taking a quid of to- 
bacco ‘to prevent Hunger, I got up into a thick 
buihy tree, and feating myfelf fo that I could not 
fall, a deep fleep overtook me, and for that night 
buried my forrows in a quiet repofe. 

It was broad day the next morning before I a- 
wakened ; when I not only perceived the tempeft 
was ceafed, but faw the fliip driven almoft as far 
as the rock before mentioned, which the waves 
had dalhed me againft, and which was about a 
mile from the place where I was. When I came 
down from my apartment in the trfee, J perceived 
the fliip’s boat two miles diftapt on my right hand,

what I fliould load it with, it being not able to 
bear a ponderous burden. And this I fdon thought 
of, firll laying upon it all the planks and boards I 
could get ; next I lowered down three of tho fea- 
men’s chefls, after I had filled them with bread, 
rice, three Dutch cheefes, five pieces of dried 
goats flefii, and fome European corn, what little 
the rats had fpared; and for liquors, I found fe- 
veral cafes of bottles belonging to our fidpper, in 
which were fome cordial waters, and four or five 
gallons of rack, which 1 flowed by themfelves. 
By this* time the tide beginning to flow, I percei-

for arms and ammunition, and in the great cabin 
found two good fowling-pieces, two piflols, feve- 
Tal pow'der-horns filled, a fmall bag of fliot, and 
two old rufly fvvords. I likewife found three bar-

with great diiiiculty; for near half an hour, kept my 
back ftraining againfl: the chefts to keep my effects 
in their places, .all I had would have gone into the' 
fea. But after fome time, the rifing of the water 
caufed the raft to float again, and coming up a lit- 
tle river, ■yvith land on both fides, I landed in a lit- 
tle cave, as near the mouth as poffible, the better 
to difcover- a fail, if any fuch providentially paf* 
fed that way. . 

Not far off, I efpied a hill of a flupendous height, 
furrounded vvith leffer hills about it, and thither I 
was refoved to go and view the country, that I 
might fee what part was bell to fix my habitation 
in. Accordingly, arming myfelf with a piftol, a 
fowling piece, powder and ball, I afcended the 
mountain. There I perceived, I was in an ifland, 
encompaffed by the fea; no diflant lands to be feen, 
but fcattering rocks that lay to the weft; that it 
feemed to be a barren place, and, as I thought, 
inhabited only by wild beafts. I perceived abun- 
dance of fowls, bwt ignorant of what kind, or 
whether good for nourifliment. I fliot one of them 
at my return, which occafi on ed a coufufed fcr earn- 
ing among the other birds; and I found it, by its 
colours and beak, to be a kind of a hawk, but its 
llefli was perfed carrion. 

When I came to my raft, I brought my effeds 
on fliore, which work fpent that day entirely; arid 
fearing that fome cruel beafts might devpur me in 
the night time while Tflept, I made a kind of hut or

got on board as before, and prepared a fecond raft, 
far more nice than the firfl:; upon which I brought 
away the carpenter’s ftores, two or three bags 
full of nails, a great jack-fcrew, a dozen or two of 
hatchets, and a grindlfone. lalfo took away feve- 
ral things that belonged to the gunner, particular-

bullets, another fowling-piece, a fmall quantity of

thefe, 1 took all the men’s cloaths I could find, a 
fparn foretop-fail, a hammock, and fome bedding ; 
and thus, compleating my fecond cargo, I made all 
the hafte to fliore I could, fearing fome wild beafl 
might delfroy what I had there already. But I 
only found a little wild cat fitting on one of the 
ehefis, who not feeming'to fear me, or the gun 
"that I prefented at her, I threw her a piece ofbif- 
cuit, .which file inftantly ate and departed. >• 

, When,! had gotten thefe elFeds^on fii'ore, *I went 
to work, in order to make me a little tent with the 
fail and fome poles, which I had cut for that pur- 
pofe; and having finiflied it, what things might be 
damaged by the weather, I brought in, pilingallthe 
empty ciieils and calks in a circle, the better to for- 
tify it againft any fudtto attempt of man or bead. 
After this, I blocked up the doors with fome boards, 
and an empty cheft, turned the long way out. I 
.then charged my gun and piftol, and laying my bed 
on the ground, fiept as comfortably, till next mor- 
ning, as though I had been in a Chriftian country. 

Now, tho’ I had enough to fubfifi: me a long time, 
ytt defpairing of a fudden deliverance, or that 
both ammunition and provifion might be fpent be- 
fore fuch a thing happened, I coveted as much as 
I could; and fo long as the fiiip remained in that 
condition, I daily brought away one necelfary or 
other; particularly the rigging, fails, and cordage, 
and fome tv/ine, a; barrel of wet powder, fome fw-

gar, a barrel of meal, three calks of rum, and|^ 
what indeed was molt welcome to me, a whole 
hoglliead of bread. 

The next-time I went, I cut the cables in pieces, 
carried off a haulfer whole, with a great deal of 
iron work, and made another raft with the mizen 
and fprit-fail-yards; but this being fo unwieldy, by 
the too heavy burden I had upon it, and not being 
able fo dexteroufly to guide it as the former, both 
my cargo and I were overturned. For my part^ 
all the damage I fuftained was= a wet Ikin : and at 
low water, after much labour in diving, I got 
moll of the -cables, and fome pieces of iron. 

Thirteen days had I now been in the illand, and 
eleven times on board, bringing av/ay all that was 
polTible ; und, 1 believe, had the weather been calm, 
1 lliould have brought away the whole Ihip piece 
by. piece. As 1 was going the twelfth time, the' 
wind. began to rife; however, 1 ventured at low 
water, .and rummaging the cabin, iri a locker I 
found feveral razors, IcilTars, and fdme dozens of 
knives and forks; and in another thirty -fix pounds 
in pieces of eight, lilver and gold. ^hl fimpls 
vanity^ laid I, whem this world Jo much dotes on^ 
where isr now thy u/r/«^fe*y excellency to me? 
you cannot procure nie one thing needful^ nor remove 
tfie from this defolate if and to a place of plenty. One- 
of thefe knives^ fo meanly efefmed^ is to me more 
preferable than all this heap. E’err therefore re- 
main where thou art., tofnk in the deep as. unre- 
garded.^ even as a creature whofe life is not worth 
preferving. Yet, after all this exclamation, I 
wrapt it up in a piece of canvas, and began to 
think of making another raft; but I foon percei- 
ved the wind begin to arife,- a frelh gale blowing, 
from the Ihore, and the Iky bvercafl with clouds 
and darknefs. So thinking a raft to be in vain, 
I let myfelf into the water with what things I had

about me ; and it was with much difficulty I got a- 
Ihore, when foon after it blew a fearful ftorra. 

That night I flept very contehtedly in my little 
tent, furrounded with all my effects ; but when I 
looked out in the mornings no more fiiip was to 
be feen. This much furprifed me for the prefent i 
yet, when I had confidered 1 had loft no time, a- 
*batcd no pains, and had got every thing ufeful 
out of her, I comforted myfelf in the beft mannei^, 
and entirely fubmitted to the Vv^ill oT Providence. 

My next thoughts were, howl fliould defend 
and fecure myfelf front favages and wild beafts, 
if any fuch were in the ifland. At one time I thought 
of digging a cave, at another I was for ereftinga 
a tent, and, at length, I refolved to do both ; 
The manner or form of which will not, 1 hopej 
be unpleaiing to deferibe. * 

When I confidered the ground where Iwas, that 
it was moorifli, and had no frefh water near it, 
ray refolutions were to fearch for a foil healthy 
and well watered, where I might not only be fliel- 
tered'from the fun’s fcorching heat, but be morfe 
conveniently fituated, as well to be fecured froih 
wild; men, and beafts of prey, as more eafily to 
difeover any diftant fa^ Ihould in ever fo happen. 

And indeed it was not long before I had my de- 
fire. 1 found a little plain near a rifing hill, the 
front towards which being as fteep as a houfe- 
lide, nothing could defeend on ine from the top. 
On the lide of this l*ock was a little hollow place, 
fefembling the "entrance or door of a cave. Juft; 
before this place, on the circle of the green, 1 re- 
folved my tent ffiould ftand. This plan did not 
much exceed a hundred yards broad, ^nd about 
twice^ ds long, like a delightful green before my 
•door, with a pleafing, tho’ irregular defeent every 
way to the low grounds by the fea-fidc, lying on

fered from the excefllve heat of the fun. After' 
this I dre\\^ a femicircle, containing ten yards irt. 
its feinidiaineter, and twenty yards in the whole, 
driving down jcwo rows of ftrong Bakes not fix 
inches fromxiach other. Then with the pieces of 
cable which I had cut cm board, I regularly laid 
them in the circle between the piles up to their 
tops, which were more than five feet out of the 
earth, and after drove another row of piles look- 
ing within fide againft them, between two or 
three feet high, which made me conclude it a lit- 
tle impregnable caftle for men and beafls. And 
for my better fecurity I would have no door, but- 
entered in and came ' out by the help of a laddei*j7 
which I^lfo made, 

Here was my fence and fortrefs, into which I 
carried all my riches, ammunition, and BoreS. 
After which, working on the rock,^ what with the 
dirt and Bones I di g out, I not only raifed iny 
ground two feet, but made a little cellar to my 
manfion houfe ; and this coB me many days labour 
and pains; One day in particular a Ihow-er of rain 
falling, thunder and lightening enfued, which put 
me in terror leB my powder fliould take fire, and 
not only hinder, m^ necelEry fubliBeiice, by kil- 
ling me food, but even up me and my habi- ■ 
tation. To prevent which, 'I fell to making box- 
es and bags, in order to feparate it^ having by 
me. near 150 weight. And thus being eBabliflied 
9s king of the ifland, every day b went out wdth 
my gun to fee what I could kill that was fit to- 
eat. I foon perceived numbers of goats, but ve* 
ry fiiy; yet having watched them’ narrowly, and - 
feeing I could better flioot off the rocks than wdien 
in the low grounds, I happened to_ flioot a flie- 
goat fuckling a young kid ; which not tbinking-its -

the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive f 
but finding it could not be brought to eat, -I was 
forced to flay, it alfo fo"r my own fubfiflrence. 

' Thus, entered into as ftrange a feene of life as 
ever a"hy man was in, I bad moft melancholy ap- 
•prehenflons concerning my deplorable condition ; 
and many times the tears would plentifully 
run down my face, when I confidered how I was 
debarred from all communication v/ith human 
kind. , Yet while thefe defpondihg cogitations 
would feem to m^keme accufe Providence, other 
good thoughts would interpofe and reprove me 
after this manner : Well, ftippofing you are fo de- 
folate, is it not better to be fo than tbtally pe- 
rifli ? Why were you Angled out to be fayed, and 
the reft deftroyed ? Why fhould you complain, 
when not only your life is preferved, biit thefhipt 
driven even into your reach, in order to take what 
was neceflary out of her for your fubflftence? But 
to proceed: It was by the account I kept, the3c'th 
of September,, wlien I firft landed on this ifland.

that when the florm yvtis abated, I might be able 
to' get fome food and heceflaries Out of her ; which 
I conceived were not damaged, becaufe the fhip 
did ftand upright. ■ At, this time 1 lamented the

it were lye dry, I waded through the fands, then

weather was rainy that I could not lye dry. So 
wet would it be at certain feafons, that I was o-

- bound up his leg, and cured it in a little time ; at 
length it became fo tame and familiar as to feed 
before the door, and follow me where- 1 pleafed. 
This put me in mind to bring up tame creatures, 
in order to fiipply me with food after my ammu- 
> nition was fpent. 

Dec, 28, 29, 30. The weather being exceffive 
hot with little air, obliged me for the mofl: part to 
keep within doors,. 

Jan. I. Still fultry. However, obliged by ne- 
celfity, I went out with my gun, and found a great 
llOre of goats in the valleys ; they were exceed^ 
ingly ftiy, nor could any dog hunt them down. 

. Jan. 3, to 14. My employment this time was 
to finifh the wall before defcribed, and fearch the" 
ifland. I difcovered a kind of pigeons like our 
houfe-pigeons in a nefl; among the rocks. I brought 
them home, nurfed them till they eould fly, and 
then they left me. After this I fliot forae, which 
proved excellent food. Some time I fperit vainly 
in contriving to make a calk; I may well fay it 
'yvas vain, becaufe I could neither join the flaves, 
or fix the heads, fo as to makelt tight ; fo leaving 
that, I took fome goats’ tallow I had by me, and 
a little oakum for the wick, and provided myfelf 
with a lamp, which ferved me inflead of candles. 

But now a very flrange event happened. For 
beiiig in the height of my fearch, what fliould come 
' into my hand, but a bag which was ufed to hold 
coi-n (as iTuppofed for the fowls,) fo immediate- 
ly refolving to put gunpowder in it, I fhook all 
" the hulks and ditt upon one fide’ of the rock, little 
expelling what the confequence would be. The 
rain had fallen plentifully a few daysjiefore; and 
about a month after, to my great amazement, fome- 
thing began to look out very green and flourilh- 

ing; 



ROUm^on C R US OS. -^7 

5 ng: and when I canie to view it tnore nicely, every 
day as. it grew, I found . about ten or twelve ears 
of green barley appeared in the very fame ihape 
and make as that in England. 

I can fcarce exprefs the agitations of my mind 
•at this light. Hitherto I had looked upon the ac- 
tions of this life, no otherwife than only as the 
events of blind chance and fortune. But now, the 
ap'pearance of this barley,^ flourifiiing in a barren 
foil, and my ignorance in not eonceiving how it 
lliould come there, made me conclude, that nitra- 
cles were not yet ceaj'ed: nay, I even thought that 
God had appointed it to grow there without any 
feed, purely for my fuftenance in this raiferable 
and defolate ifland. And indeed fuch great affect 
this had upon me, that it often made me melt into 
tears, through a grateful fenfe of God’s mercies ; 
and the greater ftill was my thaukfulnefs, when I 
perceived about this little field of barley, feme 
rice flalks, alfo wonderfully flourifliing. 

While thus pleafed in inind, I' Coftcltided there 
imifb be more corn in 'the ifl.md; &nd therefore 
made a diligent Tea rch naUro'wly araotlg the rocks ; 
but not being able to find any, on a fudden it came 
into ray rriind, how I had fliaken the hulks of Uorii 
out of the hag, and- then my admiration ceafed, 
with my gratitude to the divine Being, as thinking 
it was but natural^ znd not to be conceived a mi- 
racle; tho’ even the manner of its- pre'fetvatioti 
might have made me own it as a wonderful event 
of God’s kind pfovidencc. 

It was about the latter end of June when the 
ears of this corn ripened, which f laid up -very 
carefully, together with 20 or 30 {talks e>f rice,' 
expecting one day I fliould reap the fruit i of my 
labour; yet four years were expired before I'cduld 
allow niyfelf to eat any barley bfead, artd' hiuch 
longer time before I had any rice. Aft cp ' this,

with: indefatigable pains and induflry for three or - 
four months, at laft I finiflied my wall on the i 4 th< 
of April, having' no way to go into It, but by a - 
ladder again fl the wall. ' • 

; April i6th I finiflied my ladder, and afcended It; 
^afterwards pulled it up, then let it down on the 
-other fide, and defcended into my new habitation, 
\yhere I had fpac.e enotigh, and fo fortified, that 
nothing could attack me, without fcalmg the walls. 

But what does all human pains and induftry a- 
vail, if the blefling of God does not' crown our 
labours?' Or, who can ftand beford the Almighty, 
when he flretcheth forth his arm ? For one time, 
;as I was at the entrance of my cave, there happened ' 
fuch a dreadful earthquake, that not only the roof 
•of the cave came tumbling about my ears, but the 
the polls Teemed to crack: terribly at the fame time,. 
This put mein.great amazement; and running to 
xhe ladder, and getting over the wall, I then plain- 
ly knew it was an earthquake, the placed Hood 
on fufiaining three terrible fliokes in lefs than three 
•minutes; But judge of my terror when I faw the 
top of a great rock roll into the fea; I then expec- 
ted the ifland would be fwallowed up every mo- 
ment: And what made the fcene Hill more dread- 
ful, was to fee the fea thrown into themoH violent 
agitations and diforders by this tremendous accident. 

For my part, I Hood like a criminal at the place 
of execution, ready to expire. At the moving of 
the earth, I was, as it were, fea-tick ; and very 
much afraid JeH the rock, under which \yas ray 
fence and habitation, fliould overwhelm me and it 
in a laHing tomb. 

.When the third dreadful fliock had fpent itfelf, 
my fpirits began to revive; yet Hill 1, would not 
venture to; afcend the ladder, but continued fitting 
mot knowing what I fliould do. So little grace had 
I then,, as only to Lor dj have mercy upon rhc. !

and no fooner was the earthquake over, but that 
pathetic prayer left me. 

It was not long after, when a horrible tempeR 
arofe, at the fame time attended with a hurricane * 
of wind. The fea feemed. mountains high, and the' 
waves rolled fo impetuoully, that n^iing could- 
be perceived but froth and foam^ TfiwMiours did 
this flrorra continue, and in fo violent 'a manner, 
as to tear the very trees up by the roots, whiclu 
was fucceeded by abundance of rain. When,; the 
tempell; was over, I went .to my tent p bur' the fain' 
coming on in a furious manner, I %vas obliged to- 
take fhelter in the cave, .where I was forced to 
cut a channel through my fortification to let the 
water Out. It continued raining 'all that night, 
and fome time the next day. Thefe accidents made 
me refolve, as foon as the weather cleared up, to-

April 16, t--20. Thefe days I fpent in con- 
triving how and in whr.t manner I fliould’ fix my 
place of abode. All this w'hiie I was und,er the- 
mqfl dreadful apprehenfiohs. When I looked rounds 
my habitation, every thing I found in its proper 
place., 1 had feveral refolutions \vhether I fliould'

where 1 might pitch my tent.

in pra^lice, I was ftopt for want of tools and in- 
flruments to work with. Moll of my axes and 
hatchets were ufelefs, occalioned by cutting the 
hard timber that grew on the ifland’.' It took me 
up a full week to make my grindHone of- ufe to.

had mufch refreflied me when I awaked. I fella- 
fleep_ a. fecond time, and fell into this ftrange anj‘ 
-terrible fort of dream : 

Methought I was fitting on the-fame fpot of 
.ground^ at the outfide of the wall where I fat when 
the florm blew after the earthquake; and that P 
faw a man defcending from a great black cloucl, 
and light upon the ground. He was all over; as-, 
bright as a fiaih of fire that a little before furroun- 
ded him; his countenance inconceivably terrible^ 
theoarth as it were trembled when he ftept upon 
the ground, and fla Hies of fire feemed to fill alb 
-the air. No- fooner I thought him landed upon- 
the earth, but with a long fpear or other weapon 
he made towards me; but firff afcending a riling 
ground, his voice added to ray amazement, when, 
t thought I heard-him pronounce thefe dreadfirl 
words, XJnlmppy opretchl feeing all thefe things^f 
Have not brought ifjee to I'tpentance, thouf)alt im~ 
•ntediately die. In pronouncing this dreadful fen-' 
tence, I thought he went to kill me with the fpear 
that was in his hand. 

Any body may think it impofllble for me to ex- 
prefs the horrors -of my mind at this vifion ; and • 
even when I awaked, this very dream made a deep; 
impfefiion upon my mind. The little divine know-- 
IcdgeT had, I received from my father’s inftruc*-- 
tions, and that was w'orn out by an uninterrupted 
leries of feafaripg impiety for eight years fpace^ 
Except what ficknefs forced from, me, I do not re* 
member I had one thought of lifting up my heart* 
towards God; but rather had a certain llupidity 
of foul, not having the leaft' fenfe of fear of the 

— ' omnipotent 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 43 

omnipotent Being when in diBrefs, nor of grati- 
tude,, to him for his deliverances. Nay, when I 
was on the.defperate expedition on the defart A- 
frican fhore, I cannot remember I had one thought 
of what would become of me, or to beg his confo- 
lation and alTiftance in my fufferings and diftrefs. 
When tbe Portugal captain took me up, and ho- 
nourably ufedme ; day, farther, when I was even 
delivered from droWning by efcaping to this iPand,; 
I never looked upott it as a judgment, but only 
faid'I was an unfortunate dog, and that’s all.- In-? 
deed fome fecret tranfports of foul I had, which 
was not through grace, but only a common flight 
of joy, that I was yet alive, when my companions 
were all drowned, and no other joy could I con- 
ceive but what is common with the failors over a 
bowl of punch, after they have efcaped the greats- 
efl dangers. , 

The likelihood of wanting for neither food nor - 
conveniencies, might have called upon me for a 
thankful acknowledgment to Providence; Indeed; 
the growth 'of my corn touched me with fome 
fenfej but that foon wore off again. The terrb 
ble earthquake pointed to me as it were the fingen 
of God, but niy dreadful amazement continued no 
longer than its duration. But now, when my fpi- 
rits began- to link under the burthen of 3 flrong 
diftemper, auclT could leifurely view the miferies 
of death prefent thenafeives before my eyes ; then 
ray awakened confcicnce began to reproach me 
With my paft life,, in whi,ch 1 had fo wickedly pro- 
voked the juftice of God, to pour down his ven- 
geance' upon me. 

Such refleftions^ as thefe opprefled me even in 
the violence of my diflemper. Some prayers I 
uttered which only 'proceeded from my fear of 
death. But when I. co.nfidered my father’s advice 
and prophecy, I could tloL forbear weepings for

t(^ld I did perfiji in my folly^ I Jhould 

not only be deprived of God^s hleffing^ hut have time 
enough to nefiedi upon my defprjing bis inJlt'u6iions 
and this in a nvr etched time^ -when nOpe could help

no foul in the ifland to adminifief any comfort to 
me, f prayed eariieflly to the Lord, that He would 
help me in this Tuy gteat calamity. And this, I* 
think, was the firtt time I prayed in fincerity ^or 
many years. But now I muft return to my jour- 
nal. . , 

June 2.8. Something refrefhed with flecp, and^ 
the ht quite off, I got up.. My dream ftili occa> 
honed in me a great confternation ; and fearing: 
that' the agde might return the fucceeding day^ I 
concluded it time to get fomething to comfOrt mci. 
Lfilled a cafe-bottle with water, and.fet it witbiri- 
the reach of my bed; and to make it more nourifh* 
ing, and lefs dhilly, I put fome rum into it. The' 
next thing f did was to hoil me a piece of goats- 
fiefh, of which I atO but little, I was very weak;;, 
however, walked aboiit, dreading the return of 
my diflemper ; and at night I fupped on three of 
the turtle’s eggs, which I roafted and ate, begr 
ging God’s bleffing therewith. 

• After I had eaten, I attempted to walk again’ 
put of doors with my giln ; but Was fo vveak, that 
I fat down, and looked at the fea, which was- 
fmooth and calm.' While ! continued here, thefef 
thoughts came into my mind ; ' ' ’ 

' In what manner 'is the produdlibn. of the earths 
and fea, which I have feen fo much of ? From, 
w'hence came- myfelf, and all other creatures Ji- 
ving^ and of what, are we made ? 

Our beings Were alTuredly created by -fonie al- 
mighty invifible powers who framed the- earth, the; 
fea, and air, and all. therein. But what is that 
power? 

* Certainly 



0 r ROBINSON CRUSOE. 45. 

Certa-nly it muft follow, that God has created 
it all. Yet, faid I, if God has made all this, he 
muft be the ruler of them all, and what is rela- 
ting thereto ; for certainly the power that makes, 
mufl indifputably have a power to guide and di-, 
red them. And if this be fo (as certainly it muft,) ’ 
nothing can happen without his knowledge or ap- 
pointment. Then furely if nothing happens with- 
out God’s appointment, certainly God has appoint- 
ed thefe my 1‘ufferings to befal me. And here -I 
fixed my firm belief, that it wa§ his will that it 
fhould be fo; and then proceeded to inquire, why 
fhould God deal with me in this manner.^ Or 
What have I done thus to deferve his indignation? 

Here confcience flew in my face, reprehending 
me as, a blafphemer ; crying with a loud and pier- 
cing voice, UnvjQrthy ii^retch l d,ire you ajk 'ivhat 
you have, done ? Look upon your pafl life^ and fee- 
"vjhat you have left undone ? Aflt thyfelf,* why. thou 
wert not lone ao-o in the mcrci let's hands of Death? 
Why not drowned in Yarmouth roads, or killed 
in the fight when the fliip was taken by the Sallee 
man of war ? Why not intombed in the bov/els of 
wild beafts on the African coaft, or drowned here 
when all thy companions fuffered.fiiip wreck in the 
deean-.^ - - - ' ' * . 

Struck, dumb with thefe reflexions, I' rofe up in 
a penfiVe manner, being fo thoughtful that I could 
not go to fleep ; and fearing the dreadful return 
of my diflemper, it caufed me to remember that 
the Brafilians ufed tpbacco for almofl: all dtfeafes. 

I then went to my cheft, in order to find feme, 
where Heaven no doubt direXed me .to find a cure 
for both /oul and body ; for there I found one of 
the Bibles, which till this time I had neither lei- 
fure nor inclination to look into ; 1 took both the 
tobacco and that out of the cliefl, and laid them 
on tlj,e table. Several experiments did ! try wdth 

- ^'!:fhe 



46 LXFE“ a nd AD'VEKTtJRES 

thd tobacco': Firrt L took a piece - of leaf, and 
chevyed'it biit it being vety green and flrpng, al- 
mofl: flupified«mei Next I fteeped it in fomfe rum 
an hour or two^ refolving when I went to bed to- 
take a dofe of it; 'and in the third place, I burnt 
fotne over a pan-of £1% holding my nofe over it 
fo long as I could' endure it without fuffocation. - 

In the intervals of this operation, though my 
head was giddy and diflurbeX at the tobacco, I took 
up the Bible to re&d. No fooner did I open it, 
but there’ appeared to me thefe words> Call on mb 
in the day of trouble^ and I luill deliver thee^ and 
thou /Imlt glorify me. 

At firll this fentence madfe a very deep'^impref-T 
fion on my*heart; but it foon -wore off again, 
when I confid'ered the word deliver was foreign 
tome. And as the children oif Ifrael.faid, when 
they were promifed flefli to eat, Can God fpread a^ 
tahieibi the nuildernefs P in like manner I began to 
fay. Can God himfeif dciiyer me from tlfts dcfdlate 
ifland? However, the words would Hill return 
to my mind, and afterwards made a greater im- 
preflion upon me. As it now was vei’y late, and 
the tobacco: had dozed- my head, 1 was inclined to 
deep ; but before J would- lye down; I felhoh my 
knees, and implored the promife that God had 
maderto me’ in the holy feriptures, that if I called 
upon him in the day of trolible., he nvould deliver ma 
With miichdiffibulty l after drank the rum,* where^- 
in I' had'iieeped the tcbacco; which'flying in my 
head, threw me into fuch a profound fleep, ithat 
itwas three n’clocb the. next day before l,awak-! 
ed ; or rather, I believe, I flept two days, having 
certainly Idfl: a day in iny account, and I cbuld 
never tell any other way. When I 'got up, my 
fpirits were lively and cheerful ; my Homach much 
better, being very hungry ; and in fliort, no fit 
rettrrned the next day ; which was the 2^th, :but 
I fbund myfelf much altered for the better.

or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 47 

The 30th, I went abroad with my gun, but not ” 
far, and killed a fea-fowl or two, rel’emblitig a 
brand-goofe, which, however I. cared not to eat 
when I brought them home, but dined on twb 
more of ;:he turtle’s eggs. In the evening I re- 
newed my medicine, excepting that I did not take' 
fo large a quantity, neither did I chew the leaf, 
or hold_ my head over the fmoke : but hext day, 
which \vas the-ift of July, having.a little fpice of 
the cold fit, I again took my medicine as I did the 
fi<£t time. 

• July 3* quite left me, but v,ery weak. 

In this condition, I often thought of 'thefe words, 
I nuill deliver thee ; and while at fome times I 
would think of theimpoifibility of it^ other thoughts 
would reprehend me, for difregarding the deliver- 
ances I had received, even' from the mofl: forlorn 
and diftreffed condition. I afked,myfelf, what re- 
gard have I had to God for his abundant mercies ? 
have I 'done ray part Ae has delivered me^ hut I 
■have not glorified hint as if I had faid, I had not 
owned and been thankful for thefe as deliverances, 
-and how could J expert greater ? So much did 
this fenlibly touch my heart, that 1 gave God 
thanks for .my recovery from ficknefs in the moft 
humble pi-otlration. ' 

July 4. This morning I began ferioufly to pon- 
der pn what is written in the New Teftament, 
refolving to read a chapter every morning and 
night as long ds my thoughts would engage me. 
As foon as I fet about this work ferioufly, I fouiid 
my heart deeply affefted with the impiety of my 
paftlife; thefe words that’ I thought were Ipq- 
iten to me in my dream revived, All thefe things 
hu'&e not. brought thee to repentance. After thfe, 
I begged oT God to alfilV me ivith his Holy Spi- 
rit in returning to ray duty. One day, in per- 
.nfing the feriptures, I came to thefe words, He 

is 


48 LIFE A N D ADVENTURES 

is exalted a Prince and a Saviour^ to give re- _ 
fentance^ and to give remijfton ; Immediately 
I laid down the book, and, with uplifted hands 
' to heaven, loudly cried, 0 hlejjed Jefus^ thou fon 
,f)f David, JefUs^ thou exalted Prince and Saviour, 
give me 'repentance!^ And pow indeed J prayed 
with a true fenfe of my condition, and a more cer- 
tain hope, founded on the word >of God. Now I 
had a different fenfe of thefe words. Call on me, 
and I vjill deliver thee, that is, from the dreadful 
load of guilt, which oppreffed my finful foul,, and 
not from a folitary life, which might rather be 
called a bleffing, (feeing I wanted neither food nor 
raiment,) when compared with living among the 
human race, furrounded with fo much oppreflion,- 
mifery, and afflidlion: In a word, I came to this 
conclufion, that a deliverance from fin was a much 
greater bluing than a deliverance fi'om affliftion,. 
But again I j5i-oceed to my journal. 

To the 14th of July, I walked about with my 
gun little and little- at a time, having been redu- 
ced to the greatest extremity of weaknefs. The 
applications and experiments I ufed were perfec- 
tly new ; neither could I recommend them to any 
one’s praftice. For though it carried off the fit, 
it very much weakened me; and I had frequently 
.convulfions in my nerves and limbs forforae time. 
From hence I learned, that going abroad in rainy 
weather, efpecially when it was attended with 
flprms and hurricanes of wind, was mofl_ pernici- 
ous to health. 1 had now been above ten months 
in the ifland; and as 1 never had feen any of the 
humankind, I therefore accounted myfelf as foie 
monarch; and as I grew better, having fecured 
my habitation to my mind, I refolved to make a 
.tour round my kingdom, in order to make new 
difeoveries. 

The 15th of J uly I began my j biirney. I fiffl: 



T R oli INS O N CR tr S:0 E. ■ 4^ 

went to the creek, where I had brought my- rafts 
on fliore; and travellmg farther, founu the tide 
went no higher than two miles up, where there 
was a little bcpok of running waters, on the banK 
of which were many pleafant Savannas or nfiei- 
daws, plain, fmooth, and covered with grafs. On 
the rifing parts, where I fuppofed the water did 
not reach, I perceived a great dealof tobacco grow^-^ 
ing to a very ftrong ftalk. Several other plants 
Ilikewife found, the virtues of which 1 did 
underlland. I fearched a long time for the Calla- 
va root, which I knew the Indians in that climate 
made their bread of; but all in vain. There were 
feveral plants of aloes, though at that titne I 
knew not what they were; likewife I faw feveral 
fugar-cane, but imperfe£l for want of cultivation. 
With thefe few'^difcoveries I came back that nightj 
and flept contentedly in my little callle. 

The next day, being the i6th, going the Tame 
w’ay, but.farther than the day before, I found the 
country move adorned with woods and trees. Hera 
I perceived different fruits in great abundance. 
Melohs in plenty lay on the ground, and clufters 
of grapes, ripe and very rich, ipread oyer the trees. 
You may imagine i w'^as glad of this difeovery, yet 
ate very fparingly, left I Ihould throw myfelf in* 
ta a flux or fever. The grapes I found of excel* 
lent ufe, for when I had dried them in the fun, 
which preferved them as dried railins arc kept, 
-they proved A ery wholefome and nourifliing, and 
ferved me in thofe feafons when no grapes were 
. to be hadi . - - ‘ 

The night drawing on apace, I afeended up n. 
tree, and flept very comfortably, though it was 
the firft time I had lien put of my habitation. And 
, when the morning came,' I proceeded with great- 
pleafure’on my way, travelling about four utiles, 
as I imagined by the length of the vall.ey'y direH:*

ing my cpurfe northward^ there being h ridge of 
hills on the fouth and north fide of me. At the 
end of this valley, I came to an opening, where the 
country feemed to defcend tothe weft; thercl found 
a little fpring of frefii water, proceeding oat, of 
the fide of a hill, with itschryftal ftreams running 
direftly eaft. And indeed here my fenfes were 
charmed with the moft beautiful landscape nature 
could afford: for the country appeared fo flou- 
rilhing, green, and delightful, that to me it feemed 
like a planted garden. I then defcended on the 
lide of that deliciotis vale, when I found abiindance 
of cocoa, orange, lemon, and citron trees, but ve- 
ry wild and barren at that time. As for the limes, 
they were delightful and wholefome, the juice of 
which I after ufed to mix in water, which made it 
very cool and refrelhing. And now I was refol ved to 
carry home mid lay up a ftore of grapes, limes 
and lemons againft the approaching- 'wet feafoii. 
So laying them up in feparated parcels, and then 
taking a few of each with me, I returned to my 
little caftle, after having fpent three days in this 
journey. Before I got home, the grapes vvere fo 
bruifed that they utterly fpoiled ; the limes indeed 
were good, but of thefe-l could bring only a few. 

July 19. Having prepared two bags, I returned 
thither again ; but to my great fnrprife found all 
the grapes fpread about, trod to pieces, and abun- , 
dance eaten, which made me conclude there were 
\yild heafts thereabouts. To prevent this happen- 
ing again, I gathered aiarge quantity of the gi*apes, 
and hung them upon the out-branches of the trees, 
both to' keep" them unhurt, and that they might 
cure and dry in the fun : and having well loaded 
fiiyfelf with limes and lemons, I returned once 
more to my old place of refidence. 

And now contemplating on the fruitfulncfs of 
this valley, the jileafantnefs of its fituation, its 

fecurity 



Of ROBINSON CRUS OR. 51 

fdciirity from {forms, and die del5j;htfuln6fs of rflfe 
adjacent woods, I concluded 1 was fettled in the' 
v/orfl: part of the country, and therefore was 
thinking to remove my habitation. But when I 
confidered again, that though it was pleafant, it 
was off from the fea-iide where ther« was a polTi- 
bility, fome time or other, a fliip nfiight either be 
driven or fail by; and that to inclofemyfelf among 
hills and woods muft certainly put an end to my 
hopes of ddiverance ; I refolved to let my caftle 
remain where Providence had firfl affigned it. Yet 
fo ravilhed was I with this place, that I made me^ 
a little kind of bower, furrouViding it with a double 
hedge, as high as I could reach, well flaked, and 
filled with bulruflies ; arid having fpent a great 
part of the month of July, I think it was the firft- 
of Auguft before 1 began to enjoy my labour. 

Aug. 3. Perceiving my grapes tb be dry, I took , 
them from the trees, and they proved excellent 
good raifins of the fun ^ the moft of which I car-' 
ried to my cave; and happy for me I did fo, by 
which I faved the beft part of my winter food. 

Aug. 14. This day it began to rain ; and tho^ 
I; had made me a tent like the other, yet having no 
fhelter of a hill to keep .me from ftorms, nor a. 
cave behind me to retreat to, 1 was obliged to ,re-» _ 
turn to my old eaftle. The ‘rain continued more 
or lefs every day, till the middle of October ; and 
fometimes fo violently that I could not (Hr out of 
my cave for feveral days* 

This feafon I found my family to increafe? for 
one of my cats that ran aWay from me, and who I 
thought had. been dead, returned about Augufl, 
with three kittens at her heels, like herfelf, which 
I thought ftrange, becaufe both my cats were fe- 
males, and the wild cats of tfie ifland feemed to 
be of a dilferent kind from our European cats j 
but frpm thefe cats proceeded fuch numbers, that

do wild beafts or vermin. 

To the 26th of this month I could nor ftir out,

food, I was compelled to verrture twice, the firll 
*of which I fliot a goat, and afterwards found a

me for breakfalt ; a piece of goat’s flefh or turtle

Worked two or three hours at enlarging my cave, 
and by degrees worked it on towards one fide, till 
I came to the ontfide of the hill, and made a door 
■ or %yay out, which canie beyond my fence or Wall, 
and fo I came in and out this way.- But after I 
had done this, I was troubled to fee myfelf thus 
expofed; thoiigh 1 cohId not perceive any' thing to 
fear, a goat being the biggell creature I had feen 
upon this ifland. 

Sept. 30. Calling up my notches on my poll, 
which amdunted to 365,1 concluded this tq be the • 
. anniverfary of my landing; and therefore humbly 
proftratihg myfelf on the ground, eonfefling my 
lins, acknowledging God’s righteous judgments 
.upon me, and praying to.Jefus Chrill to have 
' mercy on me, I failed for twelve hours till the 
going down of the fun ; and then eating a bifeuits 
■ and a hunch of grapes, laid, me on the bed, and 
with great comfort took my night’s repofe. Till 
this time I never had diflinguillied the Sabbath day; 
but now I made a longer notch than ordinary for 
the days of rell, and divided the weeks as well as 
I could, though I found I had loll a day or two in . 
my account. My. ink failing foon after, I omitted 
in my daily memorandum things of an indilFerent 
nature, and contented myfelf to write down only 
;the moll remarkable events of my life» The rainy

and dry feafons appeared now regular to me, and 
ej^perience taught me how to provide for them; 
yet, in one thing I am going to relate, my expe- 
rience very much failed me. You may call to- 
m’nd what I have mentioned of fome barley and' 
rice which I had faved ; about thirty.ftalks of the 
former, and twenty of the latter; and at that 
time the fun being in it? fouthern pofitton, going 
from me, together with the rains, made me con- 
clude it a very proper feafon to low it. Accord-- 
ingly I dug up a piece of ground, with my wooden 
fpade, and dividing it in, two parts, fowed about^ 
two-thirds of my feed, prelerving by me about a- 
handful or each. And nappy it was I did fo ; fop 
no rains falling, it was choked up, and never ap- 
peared above the earth till the wet feafon came- 
again, and then part of it grew, as' if it had been, 
newly fovyn. 

I was refolved flill to make another trial; and 
feeking for a moiller piece of ground near my 
bower,. I there fowed the refl: of my feed in Fe- 
bruary, a little before th^ vernal equinox; which 
having the rainy months of March- and' April to 
water it, yielded a noble crop, and fprung’ up very 
pleafantly. I had {fill faved part of the feed, not 
daring to venture ah ; an 4 by the time I found- 
out the proper feafons to fow in, and that I might; 
expeft every, year two feed-rimes and two harvefts, 
my flock amounted to above half a peck of each- 
fort of grain.- ' , ' 

s. No fooner were the rains over^ but the flajees' 
which I had cut from the trees, fliot out like wil- 
low's the fir 11 year after lopping their heads. I 
was ignorant of the tree I cut them from:- but 
they grew lo regularly beautiful, that they made 
a molt lively appearance, and fo, flpurilhed in three 
yeafs timCj that I refolved to cut more of them ;

and thefe foon growing, made a glorious fence, ass 
afterwards I lhall obferve. 

• And now I perceived that the feafons of the 
year might generally be divided, not into fuminer 
and winter, as in Europe, but into wet and dry 
feafons as in this manner.

.The wet feafons would continue longer or fliort- 
<er as'the winds happened to blo\v. But having 
found the ill confequences of being abroad in the 
rain, I took care , before hand to furnifli niyfelf 
with proyifiohs ;^and, during the wet months, fat 
'•vyi|hin doors as much as poffible. At this time f 
,^^n^.ived to piJ^ke many things thatl wanted, tho^, 
me muck labour and pains, before I conld. 
accomplifh. them. The firfl 1 tried was to make a 
bafket ; but all the twigs I could get proved fo 
brittle, that I could not then perform it. It now' 
proved of great advantage to mO, that, when- a 
boy, I took great delight in ftanding at a bafketf 

maker’s in the fame town where my father lived,

to view them at work : and, like other boys, cu- 
rious to fee the mariner of their working thefc’ 
things, and very officious to affifl, I perfecUy learn- 
ed the method of it, and wanted nothing but the 
tools. And it coming into my mind, that the twigs- 
of that tree of which I made my (fakes, might be* 
as tough as fallow, willow, or ofiers, growing in. 
England, I refolved to make an experiment, and' 
went the next day to my country-feat, and found 
foine fit for my turn ; and after cutting dov/n a> 
quantity with my hatchet, I dried them in my pale^ 
and, when fit to work writh,, carried them to iny' 
cave, where I employed myfelf -in making feveraL 
forts of bafkets, infomuch that J could put in what-- 
foever I pleafed. It is true, they were not cle- 
verly made, yet they ferved my turn upon all-oc-- 
cafions. ' 

But flill I wanted two necelTary things. I hadi 
no cafk to hold my liquor, except two rundleta- 
almoft full of rum, a few bottles of an ordinary 
fize, and fome fquare cafe- bottles ; neither had t 
a pot to 43oil any thing in, only a large kettle^ 
unfit to make broth, or flew a bit of meat ; I want- 
ed likewife at the .beghming of this dry feafon a» 
tobacco pipe; but for this £ afterwards found an- 
expedient. 

I kept myfelf employed in planting my fecond' 
row of flakes. But remembring. that- when I tra- 
velled up to the -brook, I had a mind to fee the 
whole ifland^ I now refumed my intention, and 
taking ray dog, gun, hatchet, two bifcuit-cakes, a- 
great bunch of raifins, with a larger quantity of 
powder and flmt than ufual, I began ray journey. 
Having palfed the vale where my bower flood, I 
came within view of the fea lying to the wefl f 
when, it being a clear day, I fairly deferied land, 
extending from the W. to the S. W. about 16 or 
Jjf leagues^, as I concluded; but could not fay 

whe-

■whether it was an ifland or a continent. Neither 
could I tell what this place might be; only thought 
it was part of America, and where ! might have 
been in a miferabll condition, had Handed. Again,. 
I confidercd, that if thi^ was the Spanilh coaft,-. 
certainly, one time or other, I Ihould fee fome 
lliip pafs by and if it was not, then it mufl be 
the Savage coaft, between the Spanifli country 
and Brafil, which abounds with cannibals or man- 
eaters. . 

As I proceeded forward, I found this fide of the.. 
ifland much more pleafant than mine ; the fields 
fragrant, adorned with fweet flowers and verdant 
grafs together wdth feveral very fine woods. There: 
v/ere parrots in plenty, which made me long for 
one to be my companion ; but it was with great: 
difficulty I could knock one down with my ftick ; 
and I kept him at home fome years, before 1 could- 
get him to call me by my name. - , 

In thelov^ grounds I found various forts of hares 
and foxes as I took them to be, but. much different: 
from thofe in England. Several of thefe I killed,, 
but never ate them; neither indeed had I any oc-- 
cafion; for abounding with goati, pigeons, turtle, 
and grapes, T could defy LeadenhalJ. market jto: 
furnifli me a better table. In this journey I did* 
not travel above two miles a day, becaufe J took- 
feveral turns and windings to fee what difcoveries' 

1 could make, retinming weary enough to the place 
where I defigned to reft all night, which was either 
in a tree, or to a place which I furrounded with, 
ftakes, that no wild creature might fuddenly fur- 
prifc me. When 1 came to the ,fea fliore,^ I was 
amazed to fee the fplendor of it. Its. ftrand was 
covered with Jlidls of .the moft beautiful filh, and: 
conftantly abounding with innumerable turtles,, 
and fowls of many kinds, which i was ignorant of,, 
except thofe called Penguins, I might have fliot 
" as.. -

as many as I pleafed, bitt’wasfpaiMng of my ammu- 
nition, rather chufmg to kill a Ihe-goat, which I 
did with much difficulty, on account of the flatnefs 
of the country. ^ 

Now, though this journey produced the moft 
pleafingfatisfacHon^ yet my habitation was fo much 
to my liking, that 1 did not repine at my being 
feated on the worfl part of the ifland, I cpnti-- 
nued my journey, tra^"elIing about twelve miles 
further towards the eafl, where I fet a great pile 
on the fiiore for a mark, corcluding that my next 
journey fliould bring me to the other fide of. the 
ifland, eafl: from my caftle, and fo round till I 
came to my poll: .again. As I had a conflant view 
of the country, t thought I could not mifs my’ 
W'ay ; but fcarce bad I travelled three miles, when 
I defcendedrinto a very large valley , fo fur round- 
ed with hills covered with wood, that I having no 
guide but by the fun, nor even then, uhlefs I knew 
well the polition of the fun at that time of the day f 
and to add to my misfortune, the weather proving 
very hazy, I was obliged to retnrn. to ray poft’by 
the fea fide, and fo backwards the fame way £1 
jcame. In this journey my dog furprifed a kid, 
and would have killed it, had I not prevented him.’ 
As I had often been thinking of getting a- kid or 
two, and fo raifmg' a breed of tame goats to fup- 
ply me after my , ammunition was fpent, I took this 
opportunity of beginning:. and having made a col- 
lar for this little creature with a ftririg msde of 
rope-yarn, I brought it to ray bower, and-there 
inclofed and left him ; and having fpent a month 
in this journey, at length I returned to my old ha- 
bitation. - 

No body can doubt of my fatisfadion, when I 
returned to my little caiflle, and repofed myfelf in 
my hammock. After my journey I rcfled myfelf 
a week, which time I employed in making a cage 

. for 



58 LIM AND AtrVENTURES 

for tny pretty poll. I now began, to confider of 
the poor kid I had left at the bower, and I iinme-r 
diately went to fetch it home; When I’ came tliere, 

I found the young creature alniort flarved j I gave 
It Ibme food, and tied it as before: but there was 
no occafion, for it followed me like a dog ; and 
as T -conflantly fed it, it became fo loving,. gentle, 
and fond, that it commenced one of my domeflics, 
and would never leave me. 

The rainy feafon of the autumnal equinox be- 
ing now come, kept the 30th of September in 
the moft folemn manner, as ufual, it being the 
' third year of my abode in the ifland. I fpent the 
whole day in acknowledging G'od’§ mercies ; in 
giving him thanks for making this foUtary life as 
agreeable, and lefs finful, than ‘that of human fo-f 
ciety ; and for the communications of his grace to 
my foul, in fupportlng, comforting, and encou* 
raging me to depend upon his providence, and 
hopafof his eternal prefence in the world to come. 

Indeed I often did-coniider how much more hap- 
py I was in this ftate of life than in that accurfed 
manner of living I formerly ufed; and fometimesr 
when hunting, or viewing the country, the an- 
. guilh of my foul would break out upon me, and' 
my very heart would fmk within me, to think of 
the woods, the mountains, the defarts I was in ; 
and how I was a prifoner locked up within the 
ternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninha- 
bited wildernefs without hopes, and without re>^ 
demption. In this condition, f would often wring 
ray hands, and weep like a child : And even fome-' 
times in the middle of riiy work this fit would 
take mej and then 1 would lit down and figh, 
looking on the ground for an hour or two toge- 
^ther, till fuch time as my grief got' vent in a flood 
of tears. '

manner, I opened my Bible, when immediately I 
fixed my eyes upon thefe words; I ’will never leave 
ihee^ nor forfake thee ! Surely, thought I, thefe 
Words are direfted to me; or elfe why fliodld they 
appear juft at a moment when I am bemoaning 
my forlbrn cdndltion 1 and if God does not for- 
fake nie, what matters it, lince hecan make me-^ 
more happy in this ftate of life, than if I enjoyed 
the greateft fplendor in the world But while I 
was going to reidrn God thanks for. my prefent 
ftate, fomething feemed to fliock my mind, as if it 
had thus faid: Unworthy wretch !’ can you pre- 
tend to be thankful for a condition, from- whkh 
you would pray to be delivered ! Here I ftopt;-~ 
and though I could not fay, I thanked the Divine 
Majefty fbr being there, yet I gave God thanks 
for placing to my view my former wicked courfe 
of life, and granting me a true knowledge of re- 
pentance. And whenever I opened or fhut the 
Bible, I blefi’ed kind Providence, that direded my 
good friend in England, to fend it among my goods 
without my order, and for afiifting me to fave it 
from the power of the raging oCean. - 

And now beginning 'my third year, my feveral

part of the day r for in the middle of the day the 
fun being in its height, it was fo hot, that I could 
Hot ftir out ; fo that I had only but four hours in 
the evening to work in: and then the want of 
tools, of afiiftance, and fkill wafted a great deal 
-of time to little purpofe. I was no lefs than tvvo

and forty days making' a biiard^fit for-a long flielf^ 
•which two fawyers, with their tools and law-pit, 
Would. have cut opt of the fame tree in half a day* 
It wasf of a large tree, as my board was to be 
broad. I was three days in cutting it down, and 
two more in lopping olF the bows, and reducing^ 
it to a piece of timber. Thus I hacked and hew- 
ed off each fide, till it became light to move ; then 
I t\irned it, made one fide of it fmooth and flat as. 
a board from end to ..end, then turned it downward,- 
cutting the other fide, till I brought the plank to 
be about three inches thick, and fmooth qn both 
lides. Any body might judge my great labour and 
fatigue in fucli a piece of work ; but this 1 went 
tlirough with patience, as alfo many other things 
that my circumfiances made neceffary for me to do.' 

The hartrell months, November, and December,' 
were now at haiid^ in which I had the plealing, 
profpedl: of a very good crop. But here 1 met 
with a new misfortune’; for the goats and hare's, 
having tailed of the fvveetnefs of the blade, kept 
it fo fhort, that it had np flrength tp flioot ujl in- 
to a fialk. To prevent this, I inclofed it with u: 
hedge, and by day Ihot fome of its' devourers ; and 
my dog, which I had tied to the field-gate, keep- 
ing barking all night, fo frightened thefe creatures,* 
that,! got entirely rid of them. , - 

But no fboner did I get rid of thefe, than, other 
enemies appeared, to wit, whole flocks of feveral 
forts of birds, who only waited till my b-ack was 
turned to ruin me. So much did this provqke me, 
that I let fly, and killed three of the malefadfocs ; 
and afterwards ferved them as they do notorious- 
thieves in England, hung thena up in chains as a 
terror to others. And indeed fo good an effeft had 
this, that they no't only forfook the corn,- but alb . 
that part of the ifland, fo long as thefe criminals^ 
hung there. ; ^ 

My 



ROTSINSON CRUSOE.- 6t 

My corn having riptned apace, the latter end 
of December, which was my fecond harveft^ i 
reaped it with a fcythe, made of one of my broad, 
fwords. I had no fatigue in cutting down my firft 
crop, it was fo flender. The ears I carried home 
in a baiket, fnbbing it out with my hands inflead 
of threfliing it ; and when ray harveft \Vas over, 
found my half peck of feed produced near two 
bulhets of rice, and t%yo buftiels and a half of 
barley. And now I plainly forefaw, that, by 
God’s goodnefs, I diould be furnilhed with bread i 
but yet I was concerned, becaufe I knew not how 
to grind or make meal of my corn, nor bread,* 
neither knew how to bake it. I would not how- 
ever tafle any of the crop, but refolved to pre- 
ferve it againfl next feafon, and in the mean while 
ufe my befl; endeavours to pro\dde myfelf v^ith 
other food. 

But where were my labours to end ? The whnt* 
of a plough to turn up the earth, or fhovel to dig 
it, 1 conquered by making me a wooden fpade ; 
the w’ant of ahafrpw, I fupplied myfelf withdrag- 
ging over the com a great bough of a tree. When 
k was growing .r was forced to fence it^ when 
ripe to mow it, carry it home, threfli it, part it 
from the chaff, and faye it. And after all, 1 want- 
ed a mill to grind- it, fieve to drefs it', yell and 
fak to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it, 
This fet my brains on work to find feme expedi- 
ent for every one-of thefe neceffaries againfl the 
next .bar vefl. 

And now having, more feed, niy firfl *c.are was’ 

, to prepare' me more land, 1 pitched Upofi two 
large flat pieces of ground near my caflk for that 
purpofe, in which I fowed my feed, and fenced it 
with a good hedge. This took me up three months j

ing him to know andfpeak his own name I'd//, the 
firlt ^yelcome word I ever heard fpoke in the ifland. 
I _ had been a long time contriving how to make 
earthen velTels, which I wanted extremely; and 
when I confiilered the heat of the climate, I did 
not -doubt but if Tcould find any fuch clay, I might^ 
botch up a pot, ftrong enough when dried in the 
fpn to bear handlings and to hold any thing that 
was'dry^ as corn, meal, and other things. 

To bo Ihort,' the clay I found ; but it would oc- 
eafion the moft ferious perfon to fmileto fee what 
aukvvard ways I took, and what ugly milhapen 
things. I made.; how many either fell out orcrack- 
od by the violent heat of the fun, and fell in pieces 
whop thoy were removed; lb that I think it waa' 
two months time before I could pcrfedl any. thing; ^ 
apd evep thep byt too clumfey things in imitation 
of earthen jars- Thele- however I yery gently, 
placed in wipker baskets,, made on purpofe fon 
them, and between the pot and the balkets; fluf- 
fed it- full of rice and barely ftraw ; and thefe h 
prefurned would hold my dried corn, and perhaps 
the meal, when the corn was bruifed. As for the 
fmaller, things,"! made them with better fuccel's ; 
fuch as little round pots, flat diflies, pitchers, arid 
pipkins; the fun baking them very hard. 

Yet flill I wanted one thing abfolutely necelfa-' 
ry, and that was an earthen pot, not only to hold 
my liquid, but alfo to bear the fire, which none 
of thefe could do. It once happened, that as I 
was putting out niy fire, I found therein a broken 
piece of one of . my veflels burnt hard as a rock, 
nnd red as a tilei This made me think of burning - 
feme pots; und having no notion of kiln, or of 
glazing them with lead, I fixed three large pipicins, 
and twQ <?r thi'ee pots in a pile one upon another* 

The

trfiie fire I piled round the out fide, nUd dry - wood, 
on the top, till ! fa\v the pots in the infide red 
hot^' and found that they did not crack at all ; and- 
when I perceived them perfeftly red^ I let one of 
rhem (land in the fire aboitt five or fix hours, till 
the clay melted by the extremity of the heat, and 
would have run to glafs, had I buffered it j upon 
which 1 hacked my fire by degrees till the rednefs- 
abated; and watching them till the morning, vl 
found I had three very good pipkins, and two 
earthen pots, as well burnt and fit for my turn a% 
i could dOfire. ' 

No joy eoUld be greater than mine at this dif. 
covery. For after this, I may' fay; I wanted for 
no fort of earthen ware. 1 filled one of mjr pip- 
kins with water to boil me fome meat, which i6 
did admirably well, and with a piece of kid I made 
me fome, good broth, as well as my circumfiancea 
wotolfi affbi'd nie a^ .ftat time- 
The next concern I had was-to get me a 
mortar to beat fome corn in, infVead of a mill to 
gfind it. Here indeed I was at agreat lofs, as not 
being fit for a ftone- cutter; and many days I fpent 
find out a great rtone big enough to cut hollow: 
bnd make fit for a mortar, and ftrong enough tiy 
bear the weight of a peftil, that would break the' 
torn without filling it with fand. 'fiutull the ftbues. 
aof'the ifiand being of a mouldering nature, reti^- 
fiered my fearch fruitlefs ; and then I refolded tiy 
fiook out^aig^eat^bIock of hard wbod-; which having 
ibonTound, -I formed it With my axe and hauimer,, 
and. then with iuHnire labour made a hollow in. it,, 
jufl as the Indians of Brafil make thdr canoes* 
When I had finiflied this, I made a great peftil’ of 
Iron wood, and then laid them i^p againft lUy fu ex-

My nekt bufinefs was to make me a fiewe, to 
•fift my meal, and part it from the bfan and hufk* 

F xa Having 



64 LIFE akd ADVENTUIIES 

Having no fine thin canvas to fearch the meal 
through, I could not' tell’ what to do. What linen 
I had was reduced to tags; I had goats hair enough^ 
but neither tools to work it, nor did I know how 
to fpin it; At length I remembered I had fome 
neckcloths of callico ormuflin of the Tailors, which 
1 had: brought out of the fhip, and with thefe I 
made -three fmall lleves, proper enoughs for the 
work.'' - , ' 

I come .now to confider the baking part. The 
want of an oven I fupplied by making fonie earthen 
pans very' broad, but not deep. When Lhad a ‘ 
iriind to bake, 1 made a great lire upon the hearth, 
tlie tiles of which I made myfelf ; and when the 
wood was burnt int6 live coals, I fpread them 
over it, ,till it became very hot; then Sweeping 
them away, I fet down my loaves, and whelming 
down the earthen pots upon them, drew the allies 
and coals all around the outfide of the pots to con- 
tinne the he^t ; and in this manner X baked my 
barley loaves, as well as if I had been a complete 
paftry-coqk, and. aXfo made of the rice feyeraj 
. pak^s and puddings. 

It Is no wonder, that all thefe - things took me 
mp the bell part of a; y^ar, Ijnce what intermedi- 
ate time I had w^s bellowed in managing my ne-v^ 
harvell and hufbandry ; for in the proper feafdn I 
^reaped my qorn,' icarried it home, and laid it upin 
,the ear in njy large balkets, till -I bad time to rub^ 
inllead [of threfiiing it.s And now indeed my corn 
increafed fo ■ much, that it produced me' about 
twenty bulhejs of barley, and as much of rice^ 
that I not only began to ufe . it freely^ but was 
thinking how to enlarge my barns, and refolved 
to fow, as much, at actime as .would be fufiicient fot

OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

For now my hopes being fruftrated, I looked upon 
this world as a thing I had nothing to do with ; 
and very well might I fay, as father Abraham faid 
unto Dives, Between me and thee there is a gulf b 
fixed. And indeed I was feparated from its wic- ^ 
kednefs too, having neither the lull of the flefh, 
the luft of the eye, nor the pride of life ; I had 
nothing to covet, being lord, , king, and emperor 
over the whole country I had in my poffelliorf, 
without difpute, and without control; I’hadloacU 
ings of corn, plenty of turtles, timber in abun- 
dance, and grapes above meafure. What was all 
the reft to me? The money I had by me lay as 
defpicable drofs, which I would freely have given 
for a grofs of tobacco pipes, or a hand-mhl to 
grind my corn : in a word, the nature and expe- 
- rience of thefe things diftated to me this juft re- > 
fleftion ; That the good things of this world are 
no farther good to us, than they are for our ufe ; 
and that whatever we may heap up to give others^ 
we can but enjoy as mpch as weufe, and no more. 

Thefe thoughts rendered my mind more eafy , 
than ufual. Every time I fat down to meat, I did 
it with thankfulnefs, admiring the providential 
hand of God who in , this wildernefs had fpread a 
table to'me. And now I confidered what I enjoy- 
ed, rather than what I wanted ; compared my pretr 
fent condition with what I at firft expefted it ihould 
be j how I lliQiuld have done, if I had got nothing 
out of the Ihip ; That I muft have perilhed before 
I had caught-filh or.turtles ; or lived," had L found 
-them, like a -mere favage, by eating them, raw,' 
and pulling them in pieces with my claws, like, a 
.beaft. I next compared my ftation to that vvhich 
I deferved; how undutiful I had been iD roy pa- 
,rents ; how deftitute of the fear of God ; how void 
of every thing tliat was good; and how ungrate- 
ful for thofe abundant mercies. I had receivedfrom , ^

I made me a cap of goat-{kins, with the hair out-

me fo well, that afterwards I made me a waiflcoat 
and open kneed-breeches of the fame : And then 
I contrived a fort of an umbrella, covering it with 
Ikins, which not only kept ont tjie heat of the lurr, 
but the rain alfo. Thus being eafy and fettled> iii 
iriy mind, my chiefeft happinefs was to converfe 
with God, in mofl heavenly and comfortable eja-

For five years after this I, cannot fay any extra- 
ordinary thing occurred to me^ My chief employ^ 
ment was to cure my raifins, and plant my barley 
and rice, of both which 1 had a year’s provifion 
before-hand. But though 1 was difappointed ih 
my firrt canoe, I made it, at intermediate times, 
my builnefs to make a fecond,'^of much inferior

But as I perceived it would nowifeanfwer my de- 
llgn of failing to the other fhore, ray thoughts 
were confined to take a tour round the ifland, to 
fee what further difcoveriesi could-make. To this 
intent, after having moved her to the water, and 
tried how fhe would fail, 1 fitted up a little inaft 
to my boat, and made a fail of. the ftii p’s fail that 
lay by me. I then made lockers or boxes at the

ammunition, which \vould preferve them dry eB-* 
they from rain, or the fpray of the fea ; and in the 
* infide of the boat, I cut me a long hollow place

her near the edge of it, but forced me more and 
more out from the eckly to the left of me ; and 
all I could do with my padlera was ufelefs, there 
being no wind to help me. 

Now I began to look upon rayfelf as quite loft, 
fince as the current ran on both ildes of the ifland, 
1 was very certain they muft join again, and then; 
I had no hopes but of perifliing for want in the 
fpa, after what provifion I had was fpent, or be- 
' fore, if a ftorm fliould happen to afife. 

Who can conceive the prefent anguifli of my 
mind at this calamity? With longing eyes did I 
look upon my little kingdom,' and thought the ifland 
the pleafanteft place in the univerfe. Happy, thrice 
happy defartj laid ly lhall I neVer fee tliee more ? 
Wretthed creature J whither ani I going? Why 
did I murmur at my lonefome condition, when now 
X would give the- whole world to he thither again ? 
While I was thus cdmplainirig, I found myfelf to 
be driven about two leagues into the fea ; how-^ 
ever, I laboured till my ftfengtli was far fpent, to 
keep my boat as far north as pdflibly I could, tdr 
that fide of the current where the eddy lay on; 
About noon I perceived a little breeze of wind-,

to feparate ; and as the main force of it drove aWay 
niore fouthwardly, leaving the rocks to the north- 
eaft, ,fo the other came back by the repuife of the 
rocks, making a ftiarp eddy, which returned back 
again to the north-weft with a very fwift ftreara. 

They who have experienced what it is to be re- 
prieved 'upon the ladder, or to be faved from 
tlneves juft going to take aw^y their lives, or fuch 
as have been in the like calamities with my own, 
may guefs my prefent excefs of Joy^ how -heartily 
I run my -boat into the ftream of this eddy, and 
how joyfully I fpread my fail to the refrefhihg wind, 
ftanding chearfufty before it, with a fmart tide un- 
der foot. By the alfiftance of this eddy, I was 
carried above a league home again, when being lit

i found the water to be in a fort of a ftand A-/ 
bout four o’clock in the afternoon, I reached with-

of the rock, which caufed this dilafter, ftretch- 
ing out, as I obferved before, to the fouthward, 

' which throwing oft the current more fouthwardly, 
had occafioned another eddy to the north. But 
having a fair brilk gale, I ftretched acrofs this ed- 
dy, and in an hour came within a mile of the ihore,

and after an humble proftfation, thanking God 
for my deliverance, with a refolution to lay all

fea; yet I could wifli ray bpatj which had coft me 
fo much trouble q^d pains, on this fide the ifland 
once more, but which indeed was imprafticable. 
I therefore began to lead a-very retired life, living 
near a twelve-month in a very contented manner, 
wanting for nothing except converfation. As to 
mechanic labours, which my neceffities obliged me 
to, I fancied I could upon occafion make a tolerable 
carpenter, were the poor tools I had to workwith- 
. al but good. Befides as I improved in my earth- 
en ware, I contrived to make them with a wheel, 
which I found much eafier and better; making my 
, work lhapely, which before was rude and ugly. 
But I think I was never fo elevated with my owtf 
performance or projeft, than for being able to 
make a tobacco-pipe; which tho’ it proved an auk- 
ward clumfy thing, yet it was Very found, and 
carried the fmoke perfectly well, to my gyeat fa- 
tisfaclion. _ ^ , 

I alfo improved' my wicker-ware, fnakiug me a- 
bundance of necelTary ballcets, which, though not 
very handfome, were very handy and convenient 
to fetch things home in, as alfo for holding my 
llores, barley, rice, and other provifions. 

My powder beginning to fail, made me examine 
after what manner I fliould kill the goats or birds 
to live on, after it was all-gone. Upon which I 
contrived -many ways to enfiiare the goats, and 
fee if I1:ould catch them alive, particularly a flie- 
goat with young. At laft I nad my defire: for 
making pit-falls and traps baited with barley and 
rice, I found one morning in one of them an old 
•he-goat, and in the other thr^e kids, one male, 
the other two females. 

So. boi flier ous was the old one, that I could hot 
bring him away. But I forgot the old prpverb, 
That hunger ’’JJiU tame a lion : for had I kept him 
t.hree or four days without viduals, and then given

en him feme water with a little corn, he wohld 
have been as tame a^a young ki^. The other crea- 
tures 1 botmd with ftririgs together; but 1 had great 
difficulty before I could bring them to my habita- 
tion. It was Ibrae time liefore they woidd feed; 
but throwing them fweet corn, it fo much tempted, 
them that they began to be tamer; from hence I 
concluded, that if I defighed to furnifh myfelf witli 
goats flefti, when my ammunition was fpent, the 
tamely breeding them up, like a flock of fheep, a- 
bout my fettlement, was the only method I could 
take. I concluded alfo I mull: feparate the wild 
from the tame, or elfe they would always run 
wild as they grew up; and the befl: way for this, 
was to have forae inclofed piece, of ground well 
fenced, either with hedge, or pale, to keep them fa 
effectually, that thofe within might not break out, 
or thofe without break in. Such an undertaking 
was very great for. one pair of hands ;' but as there 
was an abfolute neceflity for doing it; my firll care 
was to find a convenient piece of ground Where 
there Was likely to be herbage for them to eat, 
water to drink, and cover to keep _them from the 
fun. 

Here again I gave'another injflance of my igno- 
rance and inexperience, pitching upon a piece of 
meadow land fo large, that had I inclofcd it, the 
hedge or pale mufl have been at leafl; two miles a- 
bout. Indeed had it been ten miles, I had time 
enough to do it in : but then I did not confider 
that my goats would be as wild in fo much com- 
pafs, as if they had had the whole ifland, and con- 
fequently as difficult for me to catch them. This' 
thought came into my head, after I had carried it, 
on, 1 believe, about fifty yards : I therefore al- 
tered my fcheme, 'and refolved to inclofe a .piece 
of ground about 150 yards in length, and 100 in 
breadth, fufficient enough for as many.-as would

maintain, me till fuch time as my flock increafed,, 
and then I could add more ground. I now vigor- 
oufly profecuted my work, and it took rne about 
three months in hedging the firft piece j in which 
time I tethered the three kids in the befl part of it, 
feeding them as near riie as poflible, to make them 
familiar: and indeed I very often would carry 
fotne ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed 
them out of my hand; by which they "grew fo tame, 
that when my inclofure was finiflied, and I had let 
them loofe, they would run after me for a hand- 
ful of corn. This indeed anfwered my end ; and^ 
in a year and a half’s time I had a flock of about 
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years af- 
ter, they amounted to forty-three, befides what 
I had taken and killed for my fuflenance* After- 
which I inclofed five fcveral pieces of ground to 
feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that I 
might take them as I had occafion, 

project X nkewife foimu aouitioriai blef-.

left me withont troubling me any more. In this, 
plentiful manner did I live, wanting for nothing

me, the want of my boat; I knew not which way 
to get her round the ifland. One time I refolved to 
go along the Ihore by land to her-; but had any

that it reached down to the calves of iny legs. As 
for Ihoes and ftockings, I had none, but made a 
refemblanoe of fomething^ I know not 'what to 
call them ; they were made like bulkins, and laced 
on the fides like fpatterdallies, barbaroufly fliaped 
like the reft of my habit. I had a broad belt of 
goats Ikin dried, girt round me with a couple of 
thongs,; inftead of buckles ; on each of which, to 
fupply the deficiency of fwotd and daggerj hung 
- my hatchet and faw. I had another belt, not fo 
broad yetfaftened iiithe famemanner, which hung 
over ray fhoulder, and at the end of it, under my 
left arm hung two pouches, made alfo of goats 
Ikin, to hold my powder and fliot. My balket I 
carried on my back, and my gun on my fhoulder'; 

■ and over my bead a great clujn fey ugly goat-lltin 
umbrella, which, ho\vever next to my gun, was^ 
the mbft necefiary thing about me. As for m^r 
face, the colour was nor fo fw'aj-thy as the Mulat- 
toes, or as might have been expecled from one- 
who took fo little care of it, iti a climate within 
jiine' or ten degrees of the Equinox. -At one time 
my beard grew fo long that it bung down above a' 
quarter of a yard ; but as 1 had both razors and; 
fciffars in ftore, I cut it all off, and fuffered none 
to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan whif- 
kers, the like of which I had feen worn by forae 
Turks at Sallee, not long enough indeed to hang 
* a hat upon, but of fuch a monftrous^ fize, as. would; 
have amazed any in England to have feen. 

But all this' was of no confequenee here, there- 
being none toiobferve my behaviour or habit. Audi 
fo without fear, and without control, I proceeded 
on my journey, the profecution of which took me 
up five or fix days. I firft travelled along the fea- 
Ihore, dir^ftly to the place where I firft brought 
my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks ; but. 
having now no boat to take care of. 1 went over

land a cearer v ay tO‘the fame height that I -was 
before upon ; when looking forward to the point 
of the rock, which lay out, and which I was for- 
ced -to double with my boat, I was amazed to. fee 
the fea fo fmoothand qiuet, there being no ripling 
iri otion, nor current any more than in other places. 
This made me ponder feme time to gltefs the rea- 
fon of' it, when at laft I was convinced, that the; 
ebb fetting from the weft, and joining with the 
current of water from fome great river on lliofe, 
rauft be the occafion of thefe rapid ftreams ; and 
that confequently, as the winds ilqw more weft- 
wardly, or more fouthwardly, fo the current came 
the nearer, or went the farther from fliore. Tp 
fatisfy ray curiotity, I waited there till evening,, 
when the time of ebb being made, I plainly per- 
ceived from the rock the current again as before,, 
-with this difference, that It ran farther off, near 
half a league from the fhore j whereas, in ray ex- 
pedition, it fet clofe upon it, furioufly hurrying 
me and my canoe along with it, w'hich at another, 
.time it would not have done. And now I was 
convinced, that, by obferving the ebbing and flow- 
ing of the tide, I might eaftly bring my boat round 
the'ifland again. : But when' I :began to think of. 
putting it in praftice, the remembrance' of tlfe late 
danger ftruck me with fuch horror, that I changed 
my refolution, and formed -another, which was 
more fafe, though more laborious ; and this w^as 
i to make another canoe, and fo have one for oiie 
iide of the ifland,. and qne for the other, 

\I had now tw’o plantations in the ifland,; the 
firft -my little fortification, fort, or caftle, witli 
many large and fpacious improvements: for by 
this time I had enlarged the cave behind me with 
- feveral little caves, one within another, to hold 
my bafkets, corn, and ftraw. The piles with 
which I made ray wall, were grown fo Ibfty and

great as obfcured my habitation. And near- this, 
commodious and pleafant-fettlement, lay my well 
cultivated and improved corn fields, which kindly 
yielded me its fruit in the proper feafon. My fe- 
cond plantation was that near my eountry-feat, or 
little bower, where my grapes flourifhed, and 
where having planted many flakes, Lmade inclo- 
fures for my goats, fo flrongty fortified by labour 
and time, that it was much ftronger than a wall, 
and confcquently impofliblefor them to break thro’. 
As for my bower itfelf, I kept it conflantlyin re- . 
pair, and cut the trees in fuch a manner as made 
them grow thick and wild, -and form a mofl de- 
lightful fliadci In the centre of tins flood my tent, 
thus erected ; I had driven four piles in the ground, , 
fpreading over it a piece of the fhip’s fail ; be- 
neath which I made me a fort of couch, with the- 
fkins of the creatures I had flain, and other things;, 
and having laid therepn one of the failor’s blank- 
ets, which I had faved from^the wreck of the lliip, 
and covering myfelf with a great watch-coat, I 
took up this place for my country retreat. 

Very frequently from this fettlement did I ufe- 
to vifit my boat, and kept her in very good order;. 
And fometimes I would venture in her a call ox 
two from fliore,. but no farther, left eithena flrdng^ 
current, a fudden flormy wind, or fome unlucky ac- 
cident, Ihould hurry me from theifland, as before.- 
■But now I intreat your attention, whilfl J pro-^' 
ceed to inform you of a new, but mofl furprifing; 
fcene of life which here befell me. 

You may ealily fuppofe, .that, after having beeh 
here fo long, nothing could be more amazing than, 
to fee a human creature; ' One day it happened,- 
that going to my boat, I faw the print of a man’s; 
naked foot on thefliore, very evident on the land, as. 
the toes, heels, and 'every part of it. Had .1 fejen an;

have been more confounded. My willing ears 
gave the (Irideft attention, I cafttny eyes around, 
but could fatisfy neither the one or the other. I 
proceeded alternately to every part of the ilipre, 
but with equal elFeftj neither cottld I fee any o- 
ther mark, tho’ the fand about it was as fufcepti-. 
ble to take impreflion, as that which was fo plainly 
ftamped. Thus ftruck with confufion and horror, 
I returned to my habitation, frightened at every 
bulh and tree, taking every thing for men; and pof- 
felTed with fhe vvildeft ideas ! That night my eyes 
never clofed. I formed nothing but this moll dif- 
mal imaginations', concluding it mull be the mark 
of the devil’s foot which I had feen. For other- 
wife how could any mortal come to this illand ? 
Where was the Ihip that tranfpocted them ? and 
what ligns of any other footlleps ? Though thefe, 
feemed very llrong reafons for fuch a fuppolition, 
yet (thought 1) why Ihould the devil make the priat 
of his foot to lio ptiTpcfs, ZZ 1 can fee, when he 
might have taken other ways to have terrified me ? 
Why Ihould he leave his mark on the other lide of 
the illa'nd, and that too o_n the fand, where the 
Purging waves of the ocean might foot! have erafed 
the impreflion. Surely this action is not confill-; 
ent with the fubtilty of Satan, faid I to myfelf, but, 
rather muft be fome dangerous creattre, .-forae 
wild favage of the main land over-againll me, that 
venturing too far in the ocean, has been driven 
here^ either by the violent currents, or contrary- 
wind§; and riot caring to Hay on this defolate 
illdnd; has gone back to lea again. 

Happy indeed, thought I to myfelf, that none of 
the favages had feen me in that place: yet I w'a? 
not altogether without fear, left, having found my 
boat, they fiiould return in numbers and devour 
me,- or at:leall carry away all my corn,^ and def- 
troy my flock of tame goats; in a word, all my 

religious 



8a LIFE AND ADVENTURES' 

religious hopes vaniflied, as though I thought God 
could not now protedl me by his'power, who had 
fo wonderfully pfeferved me fo long. 

What various ohains of providence are there in 
the life of man? How changeable' are our affections, 
according to different circumftances ? We love to- 
day what we hate to-morrow ; we fhun one hour 
what we feek the next. This was evident in me 
in the moftconfpicuous manner: fori, who before 
had fo much lamented my condition, in being ha- 
nifhed from all human-kind, was now even ready 
to expire, when I confidered that a man had fet 
his foot on this defolate ifland. But when I conli- 
dered my ftation of life, decreed by the infinitely 
wife and good providence of God ; that I ought 
not to difpute my Creator’s fovereignty, who had 
an undoubted right to govern and difpofe of his 
creatures as he thinks convenient; and that his 
jnflicE and meycy could either punifh or deliyer 
me: I fay, when I confidered all this, I comfort- 
ably found it my duty to truft fincerely in him, 
pray ardently to him, and humbly refign rayfelf to 
» riis divine will. 

Onerraorning,' lying 'on my bed, thefe words of 
the facred writings came again into my mind. Call 
upon me in the day of trouble^ and I 'will deliver 
thee^ and thou /halt glorify me. Upon this fentence^ 
rifing more chearfully from ray bed, I offered up 
my prayers in the moft heavenly manner: and 
when I ha'd done, taking up my Bible to read, thefe 
words appeared firfl in my fight : IVait o'n the Lord^ 
and be of good cheer^ and he Jhall Jirengthen thy 
heart: JVait^ I fay., on'the Lord. Such divine com- 
fort did this give me, as to repiove all caufe of 
fadnefs upon that occafion. 

Thus, after a world of apprehenfions and fears, 
for three days and nights, I at laft ventured out 
of my caftle, and milked my goats, one of which 
■ ' ' ' ' ■ was. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^ 

was almofl fpoiled for want of it. I next (though 
in great fear) vifited my bower, dnd milKed my 
flocks there alfo ; when growing bolder,, I went 
down to the fhore again,, and mea Turing the print 
of the foot to mine, to Ice perhaps whether I my- 
felf had not occafioned that mark, I found it much 
fuperior in largenefs ; and fo returned home, now 
abfolutely convinced, that either forae men had 
been ^ftlore, or th^t the ifland mufl be inhabited ; 
and therefore that I might be furprifed befot-e 1 
wA§ aware. 

I now began to think of providing for my fecu- 
rity, and revolved in my mind many different 
fehemcs for that purpofe : I firft prepofcd to cut 
down my inclbfures, and turn my tame cattle 
wUd into the woods, that the enemy might not 
find them, and frequent the ifland in hopes of kil- 
ling the fame. Secondly^ I was for digging .up my 
corn-fields for the very fame reafon. And, Lajlly^ 
I concluded to demolifli my bower, lefl feeing a 
place of human contrivance, they might come far- 
ther, and find out and attack me in my little caftle. 

Such notions did the fear of danger fuggcfl to 
rafe ; and I looked, I thought, like the unfortunate 
king Saul, when not only oppreffed by the Phili- 
ftihes but alfo forfaken by God himfelf. And it is 
ftrange, that a little before, having entirely refign- 
-ed myfelf to the will of God, I fliquld now have fo 
little confidence in him, fearing thofe more who 
could kill this fading body, than he who could de- 
ftroy my immortal foul, , 

Sleep was an utter flranger to my eyes that 
night ; yet nature fpent and tired, fubmitted to a 
filent repofc the next morning. And then, join- 
ing reafon with my fear, I confidered, that this 
delightful and pleafant ifland might not be fo en- 
tirely forfaken as I might think; but that the in-, 
habitants from the other fliore might fail either 



84 LIFE and ADVENTURES 

with defign, or from ncceflity, hy- crofs winds ; 
and if the latter circuinftance, I had reafon to be- 
lieve they would departthe firft opportunity. How- 
ever^ my fear made me think of a place for retreat 
upon an attack. I now repented that I had made 
my door to come out beyond my fortification ; to 
remedy which, I refolvcd to make me 'a fecond 
one : I fell to work, therefore, and drove betwixt 
that double row of trees, which I planted about 
twelve years before, fevei*al 'flrong piles, thicken- 
ing it w'ith pieces of timber and old cables,* and 
ff^engthening the footof.it with earth which I 
dug out of my cave ; I alfo made me feven holes, 
wherein I planted my raulkets like cannon, fitting 
them into frames refembling carriages. This be- 
ing finiflied with indefatigable induffry, for a great 
Way every where, I planted flicks of pfier like a 
wood, about twenty thoufand of them, leaving a 
large fpace between them and my wall, that I might 
have room to fee an enemy, and that they might 
not be flieltered among the young trees, if they 
offered to approach the outer wall. And indeed , 
fcarce two years had paffed over my head, wheii 
there appeared a lovely fliady grove, and in fix 
years it became a thick wood perfectly impaffible. 
For my fafery I left no avenue to godn or out ; 
inflead of which I fet two ladders, one to a part 
of the rock which w'as low,, and then broke in^ 
leaving room to place another, ladder upon that; 
fo that whenT took thofe down, it was impoflible 
for any man to defeend without hurting himfelf ; 
and if they had, they would fUll be at the outfide 
of my Outer wall. But while I took all thefe mea- 
fures of hujjian prudence for my own prefervadon, - 
I was hot altogether unmindful of ether affairs. 
To preferyCi my flock of tame goats, that the 
eneniy ffiould not take all at pnc.e, I looked out for 
the molt retired part of the ifiand, which was the 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 85 

place where I had loft myfelf before mentioned^ and 
there finding a clear piece of land, containing three 
acres, furrounded with thick woods, I wrought fo- 
hard, that, in lefs than a month’s time, I fenced 
it fo well round, that my flocks were very well fe- 
cured in it, and 1 put therein two he goats and ten 
ilie ones. 

All this labour was occafioned purely by fear- 
ful apprehenfions, on account of feeing the print 
of a man’s foot. And not contented yet with what 
I had done, I fearched for another place towards 
the well point of the ifland, where I might alfo 
retain another flock. Then wandering on this er- 
rand more to the weft of the ifland than ever I had 
yet done, and calling my eyes towards the fea, nie- 
thought I perceived a boat at a great diftance; 
but could not poflibly tell what it was for want of 
my perfpedlive glafs. I confidered that it was no 
ftrange thing to fee the print of a man’s fbot ; 
and, concluding them cannibals, blelfed God for 
my being call on the other tide of the ifland, where 
none of the favages, as I thought, ever came. But 
when I came down the bill to the fliore, which was 
tile S. W. point of the ifland, I was foon confirm- 
ed in my opinion ; nor can any one deferibe my 
horror and amazement, when I faw the ground 
fpread with fculls, hands, feet, and bones of hu- 
man bodies ; and particularly I perceived a fpace 
like a circle, in the hiidll of which had been a fire, 
about which I conjeftured thefe wretches fat, and 
unnaturally facrificed and devoured then* fellow- 
creatures. 

The horror and loathfomenefs of this dreadful 
fpeilacle, both confounded my fenfes, and made 
me difeharge from my ftomach in an exceffive man- 
ner. 1 then returned towards my habitation^ and 
^in my way thither Ihedding floods of tears, and 
falling down on my bended knees, gave God thanks 

- H for 



86 LIFE and adventures 

for, making my nature contrary to thefe wretches, 

^ and delivering me lb long out of their hands. 

Though reafon and my long relidence here had 
a^Tured me, that thefe favages never came up to 
the thick woody parts of the country, and that I 
had no reafon to be apprehenlive of a difcovery j ' 
yet fuch an abhorrence did I hill retain, that for 
two years after I confined myfelf only to my three 
plantations I mean my caflle, country feat, and 
inclofure in the woods. And though in pruccfs of 
* time, my dreadful apprehenfions began to wear 
aw^y, yet my. eyes were more vigilant for fear of 
being furprifed, and I was very cautious of firjng 
my gun, left being heard by thofe creatures, they 
fliould .proceed to attack me, I refolved, how- 
ever, manfully to lofe my life if they did, and 
went armed w th three piftols fluck in my girdle; 

' which, added to the-defcription I have given of my- 
felf before, made me look with a very formidable 
appearance. 

5 , Thus my circuniftances for fome time remained 

very calm and un'difturbed ; and when I corapai;;ed 
my condition ;to others, I found it was far from 
being miferable. And indeed would all perfons 
compare their, circumftances, not with thofe above 
them, but with thofe innumerable unhappy ob- 
jects beneath them, Lara fure we fliould not hear 
‘ thofe daily murmurings and complainings that, are 
in the world. For my part, I wanted but few 
things. Indeed the terror which the favages had 
put me in, fpoiled fome inventions for my own 
conveniencies. One of my projects was to brew 
me fome beer; a very whimfical one indeed, when 
it is confidered, -that I had neither caflcs fufficient, 
nor could I make any to preferve it in ; neither 
had I hops to make it keep, yefl: to make it work, 
nor a copper or kettle to make it boil. Perhaps, 

, indeed, after fame years, I might bring 'this to' 

bear,

Sear, as l had done other things. But now ihy 
inventions were placed another way ; and day and * 
night I could think of nothing but how I might 
deftroy fome of thefe cannibals, when proceeding 
. to their bloody entertainments; and fo faring a' 
viftim from being facrificed, that he might after 
become my fervant. Many were my contrivan- 
'ces for this purpofe, and as many more objeclior.S 
occurred, after I had hatched them. I once con- 
trived to dig a hole under the place where they « 
made their fire, and put therein five or fix pounds 
of gun-powder, which would confequently hlow 
up all thofe that were near it ; buttheni was loath ' 
to fpend fo much upon them, left it fhoUld not do 
that certa'n execution I could defive ; and but on- 
ly affright, and not kill them. Having laid this 
defign alide, I again propofed- to myfelf to lye* 
privately in atnbufh^ in fome- convenient place, 
with ray three guns double loaded, and let fly at 
them in the midft of their dreadful ceremony ; 
and having’ killed two or three of them at every 
fhot, fall upon the reft fuddenly with * my thred 
piftols, and not let one mother’s fon efcape. This 
imagination pieafed my fancy fo much; that I ufed 
to dream of it in the night-time^ To put my de- . 
figri in execution, I was not long feeking for a 
■jphee very convenient for my purpofe, where un-^ 

" leen I might behold every adtion of the favages. 
'Here I placed my two mulkets, each of which \vas, 
loaded with a brace of flugs, and font' or five 
fmaller bullets about the fize of^piftol bullets; 
the fowling-piece was charged with- near a handful 
of the largeft fvvan Ihot ; and in every piftol were 
about four bullets. And thfis all things being pre- 
pared, no fooner would the welcome light fpread 
over the element, but like a giant refreJJ^ed with- 
%uine^ as the feripture has it, would I iffuC forth

diftant, t^iew if I could fee any invaders approach 
unlawfully to my kingdom. But having waited in 
vain two or three months, it not only grew very 
, tircfome to me, but brought me into forne confider* 
ation, and made me examine rayfelf, what right 

I had to kill thefe creatures in this manner ;■ 

If (argued I to myfelf) this unnatural cuftom of 
theirs be a fin ofFenlive to Heaven, it belongs to 
the Divine Being, who alone has the vindidive 
power in his hands, to fliower down his vengeance 
upon them. And perhaps he does fo, in making 
them become one another's executioners. Or, if 
not, if God thinks thefe doings juft, according to 
the knowledge they conceive, what authority have' 
I to pretend to thwart the decrees of Providence^ 
which has permitted thefe adions for fo many ages; 
perhaps from almoft the beginning of the creation ? 
They never offended me, what right have I then 
to concern myfelf in their fhedding one another's 
blood ? And indeed I have fince known,, they va- 
lue no more to kill and devour a captive taken in 
war,, then we do to kill an ox, or eat mutton; I 
then concluded, it neceffarily followed, that thefe 
people were no more murderers than Chriftians, 
who many times put whole troops to the fword^ 
after throwing down their arms. Again I confi- 
dered, that if 1 fell upon them, I fhould be as much 
in the wrong as the Spaniards, who had commit- 
ted the greateft barbarities upon thefe people who 
never had offended them in their whole lives ; as 
if the kingdom of Spain was eminent for a race of 
men without common compaflion to the miferable^ 
a' principal fign of the raoft generous temper. 
Thefe confiderations made me paufe, , and bro'ught 
me to think I had taken wrong meafures in my re- 
iblution ; I now argued with myfelf, that it was 
better for me never to attack, but to .remain jun- 
difcovered as long as poflibly I could; that an'op- 

pofite 



c?T KOBINSONI CRUSOE. 89^ 

pofite conduft would certainly prove deftruftive ; • 
for as it was fcarcely to be fuppofed 1 could kill 
them all, I might either be overpowered by thes ' 
remaining, or that fome efcaping, might bring " 
thoufands to my certain deftrucVion. - And indeed • 
religion took their part fo much as to comvince me- ' 
how contrary it was to my duty to be guilty of 
lliedding human blood, innocent as to my particu- - 
lar, whatever they are to one another j that Ihad - 
notliing to do with it, but leave it to the God of"- 
• all power and dominion, as I faid before, to do"" 
therein what, feemsd convenient to his- heavenly 
wifdom.^ And therefore on my knees I thanked"^ 
the Almighty for delivering me from blood>guilti->*^ 
'nefs, and begged h’s protection that I might-neverv 
fall into their hands* 

Thus giving oveir <in attempt which j hadfafiily 
begun,,! hever afcended the hill on that occafion ’ 
afterwards; I only removed ray-boat, which lay on 
the other fide of the ifland; and every thing that- 
belonged to her, towards the eafl, into a little cove,:, 
that there might, not be the lead lliadow <pf difco-.- 
very of any boat near, or habitation upon the

always retired in it, except when I went out -to ■

once fet their eyes upon me, by the the fwiftnefs 
of their feet, would have left me no poflibility of 
efcaping? Thefe thoughts would fink my very foul, 
fo that I would fall into a deep melancholy, till 
fuch time as. the conlideration of my gratitude to 
the Divine Being moved it from my heart. I then 
fell into a contemplation of the fecret fprings of 
providence; and how wonderfully we are deliv^er-* 
ed, when infenfible of it; and when intricated in- 
uncertain mazes or labyrinths of doubt or hefita- 
tion, what fecret hint directs us in the right way, 
when we intended to go out of it; nay, perhaps, 

, contrary to our bufinefs, fenfe, or inclination. U- 
pon vvdiich, I fixed within me this as a certain rule,, 
never to difobey thofe fecret iraprelfions of mind 
to the afttng or not adling any thing that bffered,^ 
for which I yet could alfign no reafon. But let 
it be how it will, the advantage of this conduft 
very eminently appeared in the latter part of my 
abode on this ifland: I am a flranger in determin- 
ing whence thefe fecret intimations of Providence 
(derive* yet methinks they are not only fome proof 
of the eonVerfe of fpirits, but alfo of the fecret 
communications they are fuppofed to have with 
> thofe that have not palled through the gloomy vale 
of death, * 

Thefe anxieties of mind, and the care of 
prefervation, put a period to all future inventions- 
and contrivances, either for accommodation or con- 
venience; I now cared not to drive a nail, chop a. 
flick, fire a gun, or make a fire, left either the 
noife fliould he heard-, or thefmoke difcover liie. 
And on this account I ufed to burn my earthen 
■ware privately in a cave which I found in th^ 
v^ood, and which I made convenient for that pur- 
pofe; the principal- caufe that brought me here was, 
to make charcoal, fo that I might bake and drefs 
my bread and meat without any danger^ At that 

time ’ 


or ROBINSON GRUSOE. gt 

time a curious accident happened me,Myhich I 
fliall now relate, ‘ 

While I was cutting down fome wood for ma- 
king my charcoal, I perceived a cavity behind’^ 
very thick branch of underwood. Curious to look 
into it, I attained its mouth, and perceived it fuf- 
ficient for me to Hand ujiright in it. But when b 
had entered, and took a further view, two rolling; 
fhining eyes, like flaming ftars, feemed to dart 
themfelves at me; fo that I made all the hafte out 
that I could, as not knowing whether it was the de- 
vil or a monftej* that had taken his refldence in that- 
place. When I recovered a little from my furprife,. 
b called myielf a thoufand fools, for being afraidi 
to fee the devil one moment, who had now almoR 
lived twenty years in the niort retired folitude. 
And therefore refuming all the courage I 1 ad, I 
took up a flaming fii e-brand, and in I rulhed againv 
bhad not proceeded above three fleps when I wafc 
more affrighted than before; for then I heard a ve- 
ry loud ligh, like that of a human creature in thet 
greateft agony, fucceeded vdth a broken noife. re- 
ferabling words half exprelfed^ and then a broken 
figh again. Stepping back, Lord! (thought I to’^ 
myfelf,) where am I got? Into what inchantecf 
place have I plunged myfelf, fuch as are reported^ 
to contain miferable captives, till death puts an^ 
end to their forrow? And indeed, in fuch a great' 
amazement was I; that it ftruck me into a cold^ 
fweat; and had my hat been on my head,, I believe 
my hair would have moved it off. But again en-- 
couraging myfelf with the hopes of God’s protec- 
tion, I proceeded forward, and, by the light of 
my firebrand, perceived it to be a monftrous he- 
goat, lying'On the ground gafping for life; and 
dying of mere old age. At firfl I flirred him, think- 
ing to drive him out, and the poor ancient Grea-^^ 
ture ftrove to get upoahis feet, but was not able;

of this cave rededed a hundred thoufand lights to-’ 
me from my two candles, as though they were in^ 

' dented withiliining golcl, precious Hones, or fpark- ' 
ling diamonds. Anti indeed it was the moll delight-: - 
fill cavity or grottn of its kind that could be deli-» 
red, thoitgh entirely dark. The floor was dry: 
and level; , and had a kind of gravel upon it; no? 
naufeous venomous creatures to- be feen there,:, 
neithef any damp or wet about it. I could find no* 
fault but in the, entrance,- and 1 began to think : 
that even this might be very nccelfary for my de- 
fence, and therefore refolved to make it my moll:: 
principal magazine.- I brought hither two fowl-*

pieces at my caflle, planted in the nature of can-» 
non. In a barrel of gim^powder, which I, took upi, 
out of the fea-, I brought away about lixty pounds: 
of good powder, which were not damaged; and: 
thefe, with. a. great quantity of lead for bullets, L 
removed from my callle to this retreat-, now for-;

I defpifed both the cunning and ftrength of the 
favages, either to find me out, or to hurt me. 

But I mufl not forget the old goat, who caufed 
my late dreadful amazement. The poor creature 
gave up the ghofl: the day after my difcoveryf and 
it being very difficult to drag him him out, I dug 
his grave, and honourably intombed him in the 
fame place where he departed, with as much cere*- 
mony as any, Welch-goat that has been interred 
bout the high mountain Penmenmoure, 

I think I was now in the twenty^third year of 
my reign, and ray thoughts much eafier than for- 
merly, having contrived feveral pretty amufi^ 
ments and diverfions to pafs away the time in a 
pleafant manner. By this time my pretty Poll had 
learned to fpeak Englifh, and pronounce his words 
very articulately and plain; fo that for many hours 
■we ufed to chat together after a very familiar man- 
ner, and he lived with me no Id's than twenty-fix 
years. My dog, who was nineteen years old, fix- 
teen of which he lived with me, died fometime a- 
go of mere old age. As for my cats, they multi- 
plied fo faft, that I was forced to kill or drive 
them into the woods, except two or three, which 
became my particular favourites. Befides thefc, 
I continually kept two or three houfehold kids a- 
bout me, whom I did learn to feed out of my hand, 
and two more parrots who could talk indiferenr- 
ly, and call Robinfon Grufoe, but not fo excel- 
lently as the firft, as not taking that pains with 
them. I had alfo feveral fea-fowls which I had 
wounded and cut their wings ; and growing tame, 
they ufed to breed among the low trees about my 
caflle walls ; all which njade my abode very agree- 
able. 

But what unforefeen events fuddenly deflroy* the 
enjoyments of this uncertain ftate of life, when

94 LIFE and ADVENTURES 

December, in the foiithern folftice, and partrcir- 
lar time of my harveft, which required my atten- 
dance in the fields ; when going out pretty early 
one morning, before it was day-light, there ap*- 
peared to me, from the fea-fliore, a flaming lights 
about two miles from me, at the eafi: end of the 
ifland, where I had obferved fome favages had been 
before, not on the other fide, but to my great af- 
flidHon it was on my fide of the ifland. 

Struck with a terrible furprife, and my ufual 
apprehenfiohs, that the favages would perceive my 
improvements, I returned diredtly to my caffle; 
pulled up the ladder after me, making all things 
look as wild and natural as poflibly I could. In 
the next place, I put myfelf in a poflure of de- 
fence, loading my mufkets and piftols, and com*- 
mitting myfelf to God’s protedHon, I refolved to 
defend myfelf till my laft breath. Two hours af- 
ter, impatient for intelligence, I fet my ladder up 
ta tlie fide of the hill, where there was a flat 
place, and then pulling the ladder after me, afeendr 
ed to the top, where laying myfelf on my belly^. 
with my perfpective glafs I perceived no lefs than 
nine naked favages fitting round a fmall fire, eat- 
ing, as I fuppofed, human flefh^ with their two 
canoes haled on floore, waiting for the flood to 
carry them off again. You cannot eafily exprefs 
the conflernation I w'as in at this fight, efpecially 
feeing them near me; but when I perceived their 
coming mnft be alw ays with the current of the ebbY’ 
I became more eafy in my thoughts^ being very 
fully convinced, that I might go abroad with fecu- 
4*jty all the time of flood, if they were not before 
•landed. And. indeed tliis proved jufl: as I imagined; 
for no fooner did they all take boat and paddle Si- 
way, but the tide made N. W. Before they went 
off they danced, making ridiculous poffures and’ 
geftures,. for above an hour, all flark naked ; but 

whether 



x>r ROBINSON CRUSOE. 95 

’whether men or women, or both, I could not per-' 
ceive. When I faw them gone, I took .two guns 
upon my flioulders, and placing a couple of piftols 
in my belt, with my great fvvord hanging by my 
fide, I went to the hill, where at firll: I made a 
difcovery of .thefe cannibals, and then faw there 
had been three canoes more of the favages on fliore 
at that place, which, with the reft, were making 
ovex to the main land. 

But nothing could be more horrid to me, when 
going to the place of facrifice, the blood, the bones, 
tind other mangled parts of human bodies appear- 
ed, in my light: and fo fired was I with indigna- 
tion, that I was fully refolved to be revenged on 
the firft that came there, though I doft, my life in 
the. execution. It then appeared to me, that the 
vifits. which they make to this ifland are not very 
frequent, it being fifteen months before they came 
again : but ftill I was very uneafy, by reafon of 
the difmal apprehenfioris I had of their furprifing 
me unawares : nor dared I offer to fire a gun on 
that fide of the ifland, where they ufed to appear, 
left taking the alarm, the favages might return 
with many hundred canoes^, and then God knows 
in what manner^I Ihould have made ray end. Thus 
was I a year or radre before I faw any of thefe 
devouring cannibals again. 

But to wave this, the following accident, which 
demands attention, for a while, eluded the force 
'of my thoughts in revenging myfelf on thofe Hea- 
thens. 

• Pn the i6th of May (according to my wooden 
'calender) the wind blew exceeding hard, accompa- 
nied with abundance of lightening and thunder all 
day, and fucceeded by a very ftormy night. The 
feejuing anger of the heavens made me have re- 
courfe to my Bible.’ Whilft I was ferioufly pon- 
■dering upondt, 1 was fuddenly alarmed with the 

. ' ' ' noife 



96 L I FE A N D A D V E N TUR ES 

noife of a gun, which I conjedlured was fired upon 
the ocean. Such an unufuai furprife made me nart 
up in a minute, when with my ladder afcending the 
mountain as before, that very moment a flam of 
fire prefaged the report of another gun, which I 
prefently heard, and found it was from that part 
of the fea where the current drove me away. I 
could not but then think, that this muft be a fhip 
in diftrefs, and that thefe were the melancholy lig- 
nals for a fpeedy deliverance. Great indeed was my 
forrow upon this occafion; but my labours to aflift 
them muft have proved altogether vain and fruit- 
lefs. However, I brought together all the dry 
wood that was at hand, and making a pretty large 
pile, fet it on fire on the hill. I was certain they 
plainly perceived it, by their firing another gun 
as foon as it began to blaze, and after that feve- 
ral more from the fame cfuarter. All night long 
I kept up my fire: and when the air cleared up, I 
perceived fomething a great way at fea, direftly E. 
but could not diftingnifh what it was, even with 
my glafs, by reafon the weather was fo very fog-^ 
gy out at fea. However, keeping my eyes direct- 
ly fixed upon it, and perceiving it not to ftir, I 
prefently concluded it muft be a fhip at anchor, and 
fo very hafty I was to be fatisfied, that taking my 
gun, I went to the S. E. part of the ifland, to the 
fame rocks where I had been formerly drove away 
by the current; in which time the weather being 
perfectly cleared up, to my great forrow, I per- 
ceived the wreck of a fhip caft away upon thofe 
hidden rocks I found when I was out with my boat; 
and which, by making a kind of an eddy, were the 
occafion of my prefervation. 

Thus, what is one man’s fafety is another’s ni- 
in; for undoubtedly this fhip had been driven oh 
them in the night, the wind blowing ftrong at E. 
N. E. Ii.:d they perceived the ifland, as I now,,

guelTed they had not,, certainly, inftead of having 
fired their' guns fpr help, they would rather have ' 
ventured in their bqat, and faved themfelves that 
way. I then, thought', that perhaps they had done 
fo, upon feeing my fire, and were call: away in the. 
attempt; for, I' perceived no boat inthe Ihip. But 
then again I imagined, that perhaps they had ano- 
ther velTel in comp^uy, which, upon fignal, faved 
their lives, and took the boat up ; or that the boat 
might be driven into the main ocean, where thefe' 
poor creatures might he in the moft mifefable con- 
dition. But as all thefe conjeftures were very 
^certain, I could do no more than commiferate 
their diftrefs, and thank God for delivering me, in 
particular, when fo many periflied in the raging 
ocean, , 

Whenlconfidered ferioufly every thing concern* 
ing this wreck, and could perceive no 'room to 
fuppofe any of them faved, I cannot explain by a- 
ny poffible force of words, what longings my foul 
felt upon this light, often breaking out in this, 
manner: O that there had been but two or three, 
nay even one perfon faved, that v/e might have 
lived together, converfed with, &nd comforted one 
another I And fo much were my defires moved, 
that when I repeated thefe words, “ Oh I that there 
had been but one!” my hands would fo clinch to- 
gether, and my fingers prefs the palms of my hands 
fo clofe, that, had any Toft thing been between, 
it‘ would have crulhed it involuntarily, while ray 
' teeth would^ftrikc together, and fet againft each, 
other fo llrong, that it required fome time for me- 
to part them. 

. ’Till the lafi: year of my being on this ifland^ I 
never knew whether or-^not any had been faved 
out of this Ihip. I had the afl3i£i;ion fome time 
after, to fee the corpfe of a drowned boy come on

f]iipwreck: there was nothing on him but a fea* 
man’s waificoat, a pair of open-kneed linen draw- 
ers, and a blue linen Ihirt; but no particular mark 
to guefs what nation he was of. In his pocket 
were two pieces of eight, and a tobacco pipe, the 
laft of which I, preferred much more than I did the 
firfl. Apd now the cahunefs of the fea tempted 
me to venture out in my, boat to this wreck, not 
'only to get fomething neceflary out of the-lhip, 
but perhaps fome living creature might be qn 
board, whnfe life I might preferve. This had fuch 
an influence upon my rtiind, that immediately I 
wenthdrae^ and prepared every thing neceflary fof 
the voyage, carrying on hoard my boatprovifions af 
all forts, with a good quantity of rum, frefli wa- 
ter, and a compafs ; fo putting of, I paddled the 
-canoe along the fliotei till I came at lafi: to the 
north eafl part of the ifland, from whence I was 
to launch into the ocean; but here the currents 
ran fo violently, and appeared fo terrible, that 
niy heart began to fail me; forefeeing, thaHfl was 
driven into any of thefe currents, I might be. car- 
ried not only out of the reach or fight of the Aland 
but even inevitably' loft in the boiling fiirges of the 
ocean. 

So opprelTed was T at thefe troubles, that I gave 
over my enterprife, Jailing to a little creek on the 
Ihore; where ftepping out, I fat me down oh a ri 
fing hill, very penfive and thoughtful. 1 then per^ 
ceived that the tide was turned, and the flood came 
on^ which made it imp'radicable for me to go out 
for fo many hours. To be more certain how the 
fets of the tides or currents lay when the flood 
came in, I af&ended a higher piece of ground, which 
overlooked the fea both ways; and here ! fo':nd,

all that I had to do, was to keep to the north of 
the jfland in my return. 

That night 1 repofed myfelf in my canoe, cover- 
ed with my watch-coat inflead of a blanket, the 
heavens being my teller. I fet oiat with the firfl 
of the tide full north, till I felt the benefit of the 
current, which carried me at a great rate^eaftward, 
yet not with fu'ch impetudfity as before’, as' to take 
frohi me all government of my canoe; fo that in 
two hours time I came up to the wreck, which 
appeared to me a moft melancholy fight. It feem- 
ed to be u Spanifh veflel by its.biiildiug, ftuck faft 
between two rocks; her ftern and quarter beaten 
to pieces by the fea; her mainmaft and forerhaft 
were brought off by the board; that is, broken 
fhort off. As 1 approached nearer I perceived 4 
■ dog on board, who feeing me coming, yelped ^nd 
cried; and no fooner did I call him, but the poor 
creatui'e jumped into .the fea, out of which 1 took 
him up, almott famiflied with hunger and thirft ; 
fo that when I gave him a cake of bread, no raven- 
ous wolf could devour it more greedily ; and he: 
dran|t to that degree of frefli water, tliat He wbula 
have burft himfelf, had I fufFered.bim. 

The firfl fight I met with in the fliip, were two 
men drowned in the cook-room or forecafile, inclo- 
fed in one another’s arms ; hence I very probably 
fuppofed, that when the veflel fifuck in the fiorm, 
fo nigh'and inceffantly did the waters break in and 
over her, that the men net being able to bear it,- 
were ftrangled by the conftant rufliing in of the 
waves. There were feveral calks of liquor, whether 
wine or brandy I could not be pefitive, which laydn, 
'the lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the 
ebbing out of the water, yet were tpb large forme 
to pretend to middle with: likewife I perceived fe- 
yeral chefts, . which I fuppofed to belong to the

examining what was in them. Had the flern of

I iliould have made a very profperous voyage J 
lince, by what I after found in rhefe two chefts, I 
could nototherwife conclude, but that thefhipmuft 
have abundance of wealth on board; nay, if I muft 
guefs by the courfe fhe. fleered, flie muft have 
been bound from the Buenos Ayres, or . the Rip 
de la Plata, in the fouthern part of America, be- 
yond the Brazils to the Havannah, in the gulph 
of Mexico, and fo perhaps to Spain. What be- 
came of the reft of her failors, I could not certainly 
tell; and all her riches fignified nothing at that 
time to any body. 

r. Searching farther, I found a cafk^ containing a- 
bout twenty gallons, full of lic[Uor, which, with 
fome labour, I got into my boat; in a cabin were 
feveral mufkets, which ! let remain there; but took 
away with me a great powder-horn^ with about 
four pounds of powder in it. I took' alfo a fire- 
fhOvel and tongs, two brafs kettles, a copper pot 
to Kl-ks chocolate, and a grid-iron ; all which were 
extremely necefTary to me, erpecially the fire-lho- 
'vel and tongs. Andi fo with this cargo, accom- 
panied with my dog, I came away, the tide ferving 
for that purpofe; and the fame evening, about an 
hour within night, I attained the ifland, after the 
jgreateft toil and fatigue imaginable. 

' That night I repofed my wearied limbs in the 
boat, refolving the next morning to harbour what 
i had gotten in my new-found fubterraneous grot- 
to; and not carrying my cargo home to ray , anci- 
ent caftle. Having refrefhed myfelf, and got all 
my effefts on fhore, I next proceeded to examine 
the particulars; and- fo tapping the calk, I found 
the liquor to be a kind of a rum, but not like what 
we had at the Brafils, nor indeed ^ar fo good.

At tlie opening of the chefl, feveral things appeared 
very ufeful to mej for inflance, I found in one a? 
very fine cafe of bottles, containing; the fined and ,

bout three pints, curioufly tipt with diver. 1 
found alfo two pots full of the choiced fweatnieat.s,, 
and two more which the water had utterly. Ipoiled- 
Thefe were likewife feveral good ihirts, exceed- 
ing welcome to me, and about one dozen and a 
half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured 
neckcloths, the former of which were abfolutely 
neceffary for wiping my face in a hot day;, and ia 
the till, I found three bags of pieces of eight, about * 
eleven hundred in all, in one of which, decently 
wrapt up in a piece of paper, were fix doubloonsr. 
of gold, and fome .fmall bars and . wedges of the 
fame metal, which ! believe might weigh near a 
pound. In the other ched, which. I gueifed to be- 
long to the gunner’s mate, by the mean circum-

of very little value, except about two pounds of 
fine glazed powder,, in three ilaflcs,. kept, as I be-

of thofe many dangers that furround them, till, 
perhaps they are diffipated and vanifh away. 

When I came more, particularly to , conlider of 
the real danger had for fo manyjrears efcaped;. 
how I had walked about in the greatell feciirity 
and tranquillity, at a time, perhaps, when even 
nothing but the brow of the hill, a great tree, or 
the common approach of night, had interpofed. 
between me and the deltruclive hands of the can- 
nibals,, who would devour me with a? good an apr- 
peJte, as I would a pigeon or curlieu ; furqly all 
this, I fay, could not but make me fincerely thank- 
ful to my great Preferver, wkofe lingular protec- 
tion I acknowledged with the greatefl humility,, 
and without .which I mull inevitably have fallen - 
into the cruel hands of thofe devourers. 

Having thus difculTed my thoughts in the cl ear- 
ell: manner, according to my weak underflanding,, 
I next proceeded to confider tile wretched nature 
of thefe dellroying favages, hy feeming, though- 
with great rev erence^ to inquire, why God fhould- 
give up any of his creatures to fuch.inliumanit)^, 
even to brutality itfelf, to devour its own kind> 

But. 



ter ROBINSON CRUSOE? ' tos 

Blit as this was rather matter of abilrufe fpecula- 
tion, and a> my miferable fituation made me think 
this of mine the moft uncomfortable liruation in 
the world, I then began rather ro inquire what 
part of the world thefe wretches lived in j how 
far off the coaft v/as from whence they came j why 
they ventured over fo far frcrn home ;■ what kind' 
of boats conveyed them hither j and .why I could 
not order rayfelf and my bulin'efs fo, that I might 
be as able to attain their^ country, as they were 
•to come to my kingdom ? 

But then, thought I, how dial 1 I manage myfelf 
when I come thither; what will become of me if 
I fall into the' hands of the favages ? or how Ihall 
I-efcape from them, if they make an attempt upon' 
me ? and fuppoling I fhould not fal| into their 
power; what will I do for provdion, or which way^ 
mall I bend my couffe : Thefe counter-thanghts 
threw me into the grehteft horror and confufion 
imaginable; but then, T ftill looked" upon my pre- 
lent condition to be the mofl miferable that pofli- 
bly could be, and that nothing could be w of fe, ex- 
cept death. For (thought 1)' could 1 but attain 
the fhbre of the main, I might perhaps meet with 
fbme relief, or coalt it along, as 1 did with my boy 
Xury, on the African Ihere, till I came to fome 
inhabited country, where I might meet with fome 
relief, or fall in with foineChriftian fhip that m ght 
take me in ; and if I failed, Why then I could but 
meet With death, which would pUfc an fend: to all 
my njiferies. Thefe thoughts I muft cbnfefs, were 
the fruit of a diftempered mind; an impatient tem- 
per, made defperate, as it were, by long continu- 
ance of the troubles and the difappointments I, had 
met with in the wreck, where I hoped to have 
found fome living perfon to fpeak to, by whom I 
might have known what place I was, and of the. 
jprobable means of my deliverance. Thus, while 

my 


io6 LIf'E A NB ADVENTURES 

my thoughts were agitated, my refignatibh to the 
will of heaven was intirely fufpended f fo that I 
bad no power to fix my mind to any thing, but to 
the proje'dl of a*. voyage to the main land. And 
ipdeed fo much was I inflamed upon this account, 
that it fet my blood into a ferment, and my pulfe 
beat high^ as thougf^ I had been in a fever, till 
nature being, as it were, fatigued and exhaufled 
with the very thoughts of it, made me fubmit 
rayfelf to a filent Tepofe, 

In fuch a fituation it is very^ flrange, ‘ that I did • 
TiOt dream of what I was fo intent upon ; but, in- 
flead of j.t, my mind roved on a quite different 
thing, altogether foreignr I dreamed, that as I 
was ilTuing from my callle^ one anorning, as cu- 
ftomary, I perceived upon the {fore, two canoes^ 
and eleven Tavages, coming to land, who had 
brought with them another Indian, w hom they de- 
figned.to make a facxifice of, in order to devour j 
but juft as they were going to give the fatal blow, 
methought the, poor defigned viftim jumped away, 
and ran dircftly into my little thick grove before 
my fortification, to abfeond from his enemies f 
when perceiving that theothers did not Follow Turn 
that, way, I appeared to him ; that he humbly 
kneeled down before me, feeming to pray for my ' 
affiftance; upon which I fhe wed him my dadder, 
made him afeend, carried him to my cave, and he 
became my fervant j and when T had gotten this 
mam I faid to myfelf, Now furely I may have 
forae hopes to attain the main-land ; for this fel- 
low will ferve me as a pilot, tell me what tb do, 
and where I muft go for provifion? ; what , places 
to fliun, what to venture to, and what to efcape. 
But when I awaked, and found all thefe inexpref- 
ftble imprelfions of joy entirely vaniflied, I fell in- 
to the, greateft dejection of fpirit imaginable. 

' Yet this dream brought me to refl^, that one 

furc 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 107 

fure way of efcaping was. to get a favagej that 
after I had ventured jny life to deliver him from 
the bloody jaws of his devourers, the natural fenfe 
he might have of fuch a prefervation, might in- 
fpire him with a lafting gratitude and moft fincere 
affedtion. But then this objedUon reafonably in- 
terpofed : How can I effedl this (thought I) with- 
out I attack a whole caravan of them, and kill 
them all ? Why fliould I proceed on fuch a defpe- 
rate attempt, which my icru pies before had' fug- 
gefled to be unlawful; and indeed my heart trem- 
bled at the thoughts of fo much blood, though it - 
were a means to procure my deliverance. ’Tis 
true, I might reafonably enough fuppofe thefemen 
to be real enemies to my life,-men who would de- 
vour me, was it in their power, fo that if was felf- 
prefervation in the highell: degree to free myfelf 
by attacking them in my own defence, as lawfully 
as if they were adtually aflaulting me : though all 
thefe things, I fay, feemed ta me to be of the 
.greateft weight, yet, as I juft faid before, the 
dreadful thoughts of fhedding" human blood, ftruck 
fuch a terror to my foul, that it was a long time 
before. I could reconcile myfelf to it. 

^ But how far will the ardency of defire prompt 
on? For, notwithflanding the many difputes 
and perplexities I had with myfelf, I at length re- 
folved, right, or wrong, to get one of thefe fava- 
ges into my hands, coft what it wmuld, or even 
though I fliould Ipfe my life in the attempt. In- 
fpired with this firni refolution, I fet all rhy wits 
.at work, to find out what methods I fjiould take 
to anfwer my delign ; this indeed wasfo difficult a 
talk, that 1 could not pitch upon any probable 
means to execute it: I therefore refolved conti- 
nually 'to be in a vigHant pofture, to perceive 
' when the favages came on lliore, and to leave the 

reft

-Teft to* the event, let the opportnnities olFer as they 
would. ^ 

Such were my fixed rcfolutions ; and accord- 
ingly I fet myfelf upon the fcout, as often as I 
could, till fuch time as I was heartily tired v of it, 
I waited for above a year and a half, the greatell 
part of which timis I went out to the weft and 
fouth- weft corner of the ifland, almofb every day^ 
to look for canoes ; but none appeared. This was 
a very great' difcouragement ; yet^ though I was 
very much concerned, the edge of my defire. was 
as keen as ever, and the longer it feemed to be 
delay ed, the more eager was I for it : in a word I 
never before was fo careful to Ihun the loathing 
light of thefe favages, as 1 was now eager to be 
with them : and I thought myfelf fufficlently able 
to manage onfe, two, or three favages, if I had 
them, fo as to'make them my entire flaves, to do 
whatfoever I lltould dired them, and prevent their 
being able at any time to 'do me a mifehief. Many 
times did 1 ufe to pleafe myfelf with thef^ thbughts, 
with long .and ardent expedations ; but ' nothing 
prefenting, all my deep projeded fchemes, and 
numerous fancies, vaniftied away, as tho’, ' while 
;I retained fuch thoughts, the decree of Provi- 
dence was fuch, that no favages were to come 
near me. 

About a year and a half after, when, I was feri- 
oufly mufing of fundry other ways how I fliould 
attain my erid, one morning early I was very much 
furprifed by feeing no lefs than five Canoes all on 
Ihore togethferen my fide the ifland, and the favages 
that belonged to them all landed, and out of my fight, 
Such a number of themdifeoncerted afi my meafuresj

thefe wretches, my fpirits funk within me, when 
I perceived them drag two raiCerable creatures, 
from the boats, to atl afrefli the dreadful tragedy^

You may well imagine I was dreadfully affrighted 
upon this occafion, when, as I thoiight, they pur- 
sued him in a. whole body, all running towards my 
paJafco. And now, indeed, il expe^led that part of 
nay dream was going to be fulfilled, and that he 
would certainly fly to my grove for protei^ion, 
but for the red of my dream, I could depend no- 
thing on it, that the favages would purfue^ him 
thither and find him there. However, my fpirits 
beginning to recover, 1 dill kept upon my guard ; 
and I now plainly perceived there were but three 
men out of the number that purFued him. I was 
infinitely pleafed with what fwiftnefs the poor 
creature ran from his purfuers, gaining fo much 
ground of them, that 1 plainly perceived, could he 
thus hold it for half an hour, there was not. the 
lead- doubt but he would fave Ills life J'rom the 
poVer of his enemies. , ^ 

Between them dnd my cadle there was a creek, 
the very fame which 1 failed into with all my ef- 
feds from the wreck of the flitp, on , the deep 
banks of which Iwery much feared the poor vidiin 
would be taken, if He could not fwim for his efcape : 
but food was I out of pain for him, when I per- 
ceived he made nothing of it, though at full tide ; 
but with an intrepid courage, fpurred on by the 
fenfe of danger, he plunged into the flood, fwim- 
ming over in about thirty droke?, and then land- 
ing, ran with the fame incredible dr ength and 
fwiftnefs as before. When the tjiree purfuers 
came to the creek, one of them, who L perceived 
could not fwim (happily for his part,) returned 
bapk to his company; while the others, with as 
equal courage, but much lefs fwiftnefs, attained 
the other fide, as though theyAwere cefolyed never 
sto, give over their piurluit. And now, of never,

The greateft aflonifhment that my new fervant 
conceived, was the manner of killing, the favage"

fufficiently admiring the wound the Bullet had 
made in his breaft, he took up his bow and arrows, 
and came back again j upon which/i turned-to go

and learn him how to talk to me again. In the 
firfl placie, I made him undcrlVand his name was 
to be Friday, becaiife it was upon that day I faveeh 
bis life : then I taught him to fay Mailer, which 
I made him fenfible was to be my name. T like- 
wife taught him to fay Yes and No, and to know- 
what they meant, I gave him fome milk in an 
earthen pot, making him view nae while I drank: 
it brfore him, and Ibakcd^my bread in it j I gave 
him a cake of bread, and caufed him foak it like-*

As we pafled by the place where the two men had 
been interred, my man pointed direftly to their

itiountain; which was again laid crofs with fmaller 
flicks in Head of laths, and thatched over a great 
thicknefs with rice draw, which was as ftrong as 
reeds : and at the hole of the place, left on pur- 
pofe to go in oi^ out by the ladder, I had placed a 
kind of a trap-door, which, if it had heen attempt- 
ed on the outfide, would not have opened at all, 
but' have fallen down, and made a greatnoife; 
and as to iny_ weapons, e\^ry night I took them 
all to my bed-fide. 

But there was no occafion for this precaution ; 
for furely never mailer had a more fincere, faith- 
ful, and loving fervant than Eri day proved to me. 
Without pallion, fullennefs, or defign, perfedlly 
obliging and engaging, his affeftions were as much 
tied to me, as thofe of a child to his parents ; and 
1 might venture to fay, he would have facrificed 
his life for the favjng mine, upon any occafion 
whatfoever. And indeed the many teftiraonies he. 
gave me of this, fufficiently convinced me that I 
had no occafion to ufe thefe precautions. And 
here I could not but refleft, with great wonder, 
that however it has pleafed the Almighty in hh 
providence, and in the government of the creation, 
to take from fo great a part of the world of his 
creatures, the noblefl ufes to which their facul- 
ties, and the powers of their fouls are adapted, 
yet that he has beflowed u|K)U them the fame f ea- 
Ibn, affedlious, feiitiments of kindnefs, and obli- 
gation, painons of refentment, fmcerity, fidelity, 
and all the capamties of doing and receiving good 
that he has given us; and that when he is graci- 
ciiHy pleafed to offer them occafions of exerting 
thefe; they are as ready, nay, more ready, to ap- 
ply them to the proper ufes for which they were 
bcftowcd^/than we ofteil are. Thefe thoughts

;ceal the like faving knowledge from fo many mil- 
lions of' fouls, ■vvdio could certainly make a much 
.better ufe of it than generally mankind do at this 
time. Thefe reflections would fometimes lead me 
fo far, as to invade the fovereignty of provi- 
dence, and, as it were, arraign the juftice of 
rfuch an arbitrary difpolition of things,' that fhould 
obfcurevthat light from foitie^ and reveal it to 
others, and yet expeCt a like duty from all. But 
I clofed it up, checking my thoughts with this 
•concluiion 5 That we, were ignorant of that 

right and law by which thefe lliould be condemn- 
ed; but that as the Almighty was necelTarily, and 
by the nature of his eflence, infinitely jufl and 
' holy ; fo it could , not be otherwife, but that if 
ithefe creatures were all del lined to abfence from 
Ibimfclf, it was on account of iinntng againft that

with me, with an intention to kill a kid out of 
the flock, and bring it home, and drefs it. As I 
was going, I perccivecl a flie-goat lying down in the 
fliade, and two young kids fitting by her. Imme- 
diately I catched hold of my man Friday, and bid- 
ding him {land flill and not flir, I prefented my piece, 
and iliot one of the kids. My poor fervant, who had 
at a diflance perceived me kill his adverfary, and 
yet did not know by w’hat means, or how it was 
done,- flood trembling and furprifed, and looked 
fo amazed, that 1 thought he would have funk in- 
to the earth. He did not fee the kid I aimed at, 
or beheld I had killed it, but ripped up his waifl- 
coat to fee if he was not wounded, thinking my 
refolution was to kill him; for coming to me, he 
fell on his knees earneflly pronouncing many 
things which I did not underfland the meaning of ; 
which at length I perceived was, that I would not 
take away his life. *• 

Indeed 1 was much concerned to fee him in that 
condition, where nature is upon the feverefl trial, 
when the immediate hand of death is ready to put 
for ever a period to this mortallife: and indeed fo 
much compaflion had I to this creature, that it was 
with difficulty f refrained from tears. But how- 
ever, as another fort of countenance was neceifa- 
ry, and to convince him that I would do him no 
harm, I took him, fmiling, by the hand, then laugh- 
ed at him, and pointing to the kid which I had 
{lain, made figns to him to fetch it, which accor- 
<lingly he did. No lefs curious was he in viewing 
how the creature was killed, than he had been be- 
fore in beholding the Indian; which, while he was 
admiring at, I charged my gun again, and prefent- 
ly perceived a great fowl like a hawl^ perching u- 
ppna tree within fhot; and, therefore, to let Friday 
underfland vVhat I v/as going to do, I called him to

me agairij pointing at the fowl, which I found to 
be a parrot. I made him underhand that I would 
ilioot and kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and 
bid him look, when immediately he faw the' par- 
rot fall down. Again he Hood like one amazed, 
notwithflanding all I hadfaidto him; and the more 
confounded he was, becaufe he did not perceive me 
put any thing into my gun.. Undoubtedly a thing 
lb utterly llrange, carrying death along with it, 
far or near, either, to man or bead, mull certain- 
ly create the greater allonilhment to one who had 
never heard of fuch a thing in his whole life; and 
really his amazement continued fo long, tjiat had 
I allowed it, he would have prollrated hinifelf be- 
fore me and my gun, with the greatell worlhip and- 
adoration. As for the gun in particular, he would 
not fo much as fuffer his fingers to touch it for fe- 
veral days after; but w’ould come and communi- 
cate his thoughts to it, and talk to it, as if the 
fenfelefs piece had underllood and anfvvered him : 
all this I could perceive him do, when he thought 
my back was turned, the chief intent of which was, 
to defire if not to kill him, as I afterwards came 
to underftand. ' _ . 

I -never drove to prevent his admiration, nor 
hinder him from' thole comical gedures he ufed on 
fuch occalions ; but when his adoniihment was a 
little over, I made tokens to him to run and fetch 
the parrot that I had fliat ; which he accordingly 
did, (laying fonie time longer than ufual, by realon 
the bird, not being quite dead, had fluttered fome 
way farther from the place -^here Ihe fell. In the 
mean time, as he was looking for her, I took the 
advantage of charging my gun again, that fo' I 
might be ready for any other mark that offered ; 
but nothing more occurred at that time. Sol 
brought home the kid, and the fame evening took 
the Ikin, and divided the carcale as well as*l

could- Part of this flefti I flewed and boiled, in a 
pot I had for this purpofe. And then fpreading 
my table, I fat down, giving my man fome of it 
to eat, who was wonderfully pleafed, and feemed 
to like it very well ; but what was ftiofl: furprifing 
to him was to fee me eat fait with it : upon which 
he made me to underlfand, the fair was very bad 
for me ; when putting a little into his mouth he 
feemed to naufeate it in fucha manner, as to fpic 
and fputter at it, and then walked his mouth with 
frelh water ; but to fhew him how contrary, his 
opinion was to mine, I put forae meat into my 
mouth without fait, and migned to fpit and fput- 
ter as much for the waht of it, as he had dope at 
it : yet all this proved of no figniftcat’an to Fri- 
day ; and it was a long while before he could en- 
dure fait in his meat or broth, and even then but. 
a very finall quantity. 

Thus, having fed him fufficiently with boiled 
meat and broth at that time, the next day I was 
refolved to fealt him with a roaflcd piece of the 
kid. And. having no fpit to fallen it, nor jack to 
turn it, I made ufe of that common artifice which 
many of the people of England have, that is, to 
fet two poles upon each lide of the fire, and one 
crofs on the top, hanging the meat thereon with 
a firing, and fo turning round continually, roail 
it in the fame manner as we read bloody tyrants 
of- old cruelly roalled the holy .martyrs. This 
pradice caufed great admiration in my man Friday, 
being quite another way than that to which the 
favages Were accuflomed. But when he came to 
tafle the fweethefs and tendernefs of the flefh, he 
expreiled his entire fatisfaclion above a tboufand 
different ways. And as I could not but underfland 
his meaning, you may be fure I was as wonder- 
fully pleafed, efpecially when he made it alfo very

plain to me, that he would never, while, he lived, 
eat man’s flelh more. 

Jt is now high time I Ihotild fet my fervant to 
' work ; fo next day 1 put him to beat ctit feme 
corn, and lift it in tne fame manner as I had 
done before. And really the fellow w'as very 
quick and handy in the execution of any thing I 
ordered him to go about. I made him underftand 
it was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards 
let him fee me bake it. In Ihort, he did every 
thing as I ordered him in a little time as well as I 
could perform it myfelf. 

But now confidering I had two mouths to feed 
inftead of one, it was necelfary that I mull: pro- 
vide more ground for my harvefl:, and plant a laf- 
■ ger quantity of corn than I commonly ufed to do; 
upon which I marked out a larger piece of land, 
fencing it in, in the fame manner as I had . done 
before ; in the execution of which I muft give 
Friday this good word, that no man could work 
more hardy, or with better-^wili than he did : and 
when I made him fenfible that it was for bread to 
ferve him as well as me, he then very paffionately 
made me undevftand, that he thought I had much 
more labour on his account, than I had for myfelf ; 
and that no pains or diligence fhould be wanting 
in him, if I would but dired him in thofe works 
wherein he might proceed. 

I muft certainly own, that this was the mo ft 
pleafant year I ever had in the ifland ; for after 
fome time Friday began to talk pretty well, and 
underftand the names of thofe things which I was 
wont to call for, and, the places where I ufed to 
fend him. So that my long filent tongue, which 
had been ufelefs fo many years, except in an ex- 
clamatory manner, either for deliverance, or blef- 
fings, now began to be occupied in teaching, and 
talking to my man Friday ; for indeed I had fucTi

had been more charmed with my exceeding kind-- 
nefs, and his alFedliohs more placed upon me, than: 
any othpr objeft whatfoever among his own coun-

Thus having got what account 1 could from my 
man, I plainly underllood, that he had been as 
bad as any of the reft of the cannibals, haying 
been formerly among the favuges who ufed to come 
on Ihore on the fartheft part of the ifland, upon 
the fa,me bloody occafion as he was brought hither 
for ; and fometime after I carried him to that place 
where he pointed ; and no fooner did he come 
there, but he prefently knew the ground, lignify- 
mg te. me that he was once there when they ate 
op twenty men, two women, and a young child ; 
but as he could net explain the number in Englijhy 
he did it by fo many ftones in a row, making a 
fign to me to count them. 

This paflage I have the rather mentioned, be- 
caufc it led to things more important and ufeful 
for me to know : for after I had this fatisfaftory 
difcourfe with, him, my next queftioh was, how 
far it was from the ifland to the fhore, and whe** 
ther the canoes were not often loft in the ocean ? 
To which heanfwered, there was no danger; that 
no canoes were ever loft; but that after a little 
way out to the fea, there was a ftrong current,

afld a wind always one way in the afternoon. This 
I thought at firft to be no more than the fets of 
the tide, of going out or coming in ; Blit I after- 
ward underilood it was occafioned by the great 
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoko, 
in the mouth or gulf of which I imagined my king- 
dom lay ; and that the land which 1 perceived to 
the W. and N. W. mull: be the great ifland Trini- 
dadj on the north of the river. A thoufand quef- 
tions (if that would fatisfy me) did 1 aflc Friday 
about the nature of the country^, the fea, the 
coafts, the inhabitants, and what nations were 
nearefl: them ; to which queffions the poor fellow 
declared all- he knew, with the greatell opennefs 
and utmort (incepity. When I demanded of h.m. 
the particular names of the various nations of his 
fort of people^ he could only anfwer me in gene- 
ral, that they were called Carabe. Hence it was 
I confidered that thefe muff be the CaribbeeS, fo 
much taken notice of by pur maps, to be on that 
part of America, which reaches from the mouth 
of the river Oroonoko to Guiania, and fo. on to 
?t. Martha. Then Friday proceeded to tell me, 
that up a great way beyond the moon, as much as 
to fay, beyond the fettingof the moon, which mull 
be W. from their country, there dwelt white- 
bearded men fuch as I, was, pointing to my whif- 
kers, and that they kill much 'mans. F was not ig- 
norant with w'hat barbarity the Spaniards treated 
thefe creatures; fo that I prefently concluded it 
muft be them, whofe cruelties had fpread. through- 
out America, to be remembered even tofucceeding 
generations. 

Well, you may be fure, this knowledge, which 
the imperfedl information of my man had led me 
to, v; as very comfortable to me, and made me fo 
curious as to alkhim, hpw I might depart from 
this ifland; and get among thofe white men ? He

toid me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoes. In

Surely he 'means one for himfelf, and another for 
mej and if not, how mull two canoes hold me 
without being joined, or one part of my body 
being put in one, and another in the other ? And 
indeed it was a I'ong while before I underllood his 
meaning, which was, that it mufl be a large boat, 
as big as two canoes, able to bear with the waves^ 
and not fo liable to be overwhelmed' as one muft 
be. 

1 believe there is no (late of life but what may 
be happy, if people would btit endeavour for their 
part to make it fo. He is riot the happieft man 
that has the moll riches, but hr that is content 
with what he hath. Before I hdd my fervant, I 
thought inyfelf miferable till I had hiiri; and now 
that I enjoyed the happy benefits of liim* I Hill 
complained, and begged a deliverance from a place 
of retirement, eafe, and plenty, where Providence 
had fufficiently bleffed m6. In a word, from this 
time I entertained fome hopes, that one time or 
other I might find an opportunity to make my 
efcape from this ifland, and that this poor favage. 
might be a great furtherance thereto 

All the time lince my man became ID intelligent: 
as to underfland and fpeak to me, I fpared no- 
pains- nor diligence t®»‘inflrucl liim, according to- 
my poor fiiare of knowledge, in the principles of

but rather thought I alked him who was his fa— 
therj upon which T took another way to maker

all thefe hills and woods whjch we behold ? And 
here indeed I did not mifs of my intention ; for 
he told me, it was old Benamuckee (the god whom 
I fuppofed thefe favages adored^ who lived a great 
way beyond all. But as for his attributes, poor 
Friday was an utter ftranger. He could defcribe 
nothing of this great perfon ; and all that he could 
fay was, that he was very old, much older than 
the fea and land, the moon, or the Bars. Friday, 
(faid I again,) if this great and old perfon has 
made all things in the world, how comes it to paf^ 
that all things, as you in particular, do not adore 
and worfiiip him ? Upon this, looking very grave, 
with a perfect fweetlook of innocence, he replied, 
MaJIer^ all things fay 0 to by which it may 
reafonably be fuppofed he meant adoration. And 
where, faid I, do the people of your country go 
when they die? He anfwered, they all go to Be- 
namuckee, What, and thofe people that are eaten 
up, do they go there? Benamuckee, faid he, lov£ 
dearly ; me pray to Benamuckee in de canoe, 
and Benamuckee ouou’d love me 'when dey-tat a me 
'.all up. 

Such difcourfes as thefe had I with my man, and 
fuch made me fenlible, that the true ©od is wor- 
Hiipped, though under imperfefl: limilitude j and 
that the falfe adoration which the Heathens give 
to their imaginary deity, is as great an argument 
of the divine eflence, as the moB learned AtheiB 
(fifljly f> called ) can bring againfl it ; for^ God will 
,be glorified in his works, let the denomination be 
.what it will ; and I cannot be of that opinion 
which foine conceive, that God fhould decree men 
to be damned for want of a right notion of faith, 
in a place where the wifdom of the Almighty has 
not permitted it to be preached ; and therefore 
.cannot but conclude, that fince obedience is the 


beB facrifce, thefe poor creatures, ailing by that 

' light 



130 . LIFE and adventures 

light and knowledge which they are pofTefTed with, 
may nndoubtedly obtain a happy falvation, tho* 
not that enjoyment wjth Chrift, as his faints, con- 
feflbrs, and martyrs misft enjoy. 

But laying thefe determinations afide, more fit 
- for divines than me to difeufs, I began to inflruft 
my fervant in the faving knowledge of'the true 
Deity, in which the directions of God’s Holy Spi- 
rit affifted me. I lifted up my hands to heaven, 
and pointing thereto, told him, that the great 
Maker of heaven and earth lived there; that as 
his infinite power fafliioned this world put of a 
confufed chaos, and made it in that beautiful frame 
v/hich we behold, fo he governs and p'referves it 
by his unbounded knowledge, fovereign greaj;ners, 
and peculiar providence; that he was omnipotent, 
could do every thing for us, give every ‘thing to 
us, and take every thing away from us; that he 
was a rewarder and puniflier of good and evil ac- 
tions ; that there was nothing but what he knew, 
no thoughts fo fecret but what he could bring to 
light; and tljus, by degrees, I opened his eyes, 
and deferibed to him the manner of the creation 
of the. world, the lituation of paradife, the tranf- 
grelTion of our firfl: parents, the wickednefs of 
God’s peculiar people, and the univerfal fins and 
abominations of the whole earth. When*,thefe 
things were implanted in his mind, I told him, 
that as God’s juflice was equal to his mercy, he 
refolved to deftroy this world, till his Son Jefus 
Chrift interpofed in our behalf; and, to procure 
our redemption, obtained leave of his heavenly 
Father to come down from heaven into the world, 
where he took human nature upon him, inflrufted 
us in bur way to eternal life, and died as a facri- 
fice for our fms; that he was now afeended into 
heaven, mediating for our pardon, delivering our 
petitiops, and obtaining all thofe good benefits 

which

which we alk in his name, by humble and hearty 
prayers, all which were heard ar the throne of 
heaven. As very frequently I ufed to inculcate 
things intd his mind, Friday one day told me, that 
if our great'God could hear us beyond the fun, he 
mull: furely be a greater God than their Benamuc- 
kee, who lived but a little way off, and yet could 
not hear them till they afcended the great moun- 
tains where he dwelt, to fpeak to him. What, 
faid I, Friday, did you go thither to fpeak to him 
too ? He anfwered, No, they never went that 
were young men, none bvtt old men called their 
Ooivakak&e^ meaning the Indian priefts, who went 
to fay 0, (fo he called faying their prayers,) and 
they returned back, and told them what Bsnani.c- 
kee faid. From hence I could’not but obferve how 
happy we Chriftians are, who hath God’s immedi- 
ate revelation for otir certain gui^e; and that our 
faith is neither mifled, nor our reafon impofed 
upon, by any fet of men fuch as thefe Indian im- 
poflors. 

But, to clear up this palpable cheat to my man 
Friday, I told him, that the pretence of their an- 
cient men going up to the mountain to fa^ O to 
their god Benamiickee was an impoBure, and that 
their bringing back an anfwer was all a fliam, if 
not worfe ; for that if there was any fuch thing 
fpoken to them, furely it muB proceed from an 
infernal fpirit. And here I thought it necelTary 
to enter into a long difeourfe with ^im, which I 
did after this manner : 

Friday, (faid I,) you muB know that before this 
world was made, there was an almighty power fex- 
iBing, by whofe power all things were made, and 
whofe majefly lliall have no end. To be glorified 
and adored by beings of a heavenly nature,, he cre- 
ated angels and arch-angels, that is, glorious fpi- 
rits refembling liimfelf, to encompafs his throne, 

eternally 



132 LIFE and ADVENTURES 

eternally finging forth his praife in the moft hea- 
venly founds and divine harmony. , And, among 
this heavenly choir, Lucifer bore a great fvvay, as 
being then one of the peculiar favourites of thefe 
celeftial abodes; but he, contrary to that duty he 
owed his heavenly fovereign, with unbounded in- 
gratitude to his divine Creator, not only envied 
him that adoration which was his due, but thought 
to ufurp that throne which he had neither power 
to keep, nor title to pretend to. I^Ie railed a dif- 
fenlion and civil war in heaven, and had a num- 
ber of angels to take his part.' Unbounded folly! 
flupendous pride! thus to hope for victory , and 
afpire above his powerful Creator! the Deity, not. 
fearful of fuch an enemy, yet jurtly provoked at 
this rebellion, coiUmiffions his arch-angel Michael 
to lead forth the heavenly hoft, and give him bat- 
tle; the advantage of which was quickly percei- 
ved, by Satan’s being overthrown, and the prince 
of the air (for fo the devil was called) with all his 
fallen angels, driven headlong into a difmal place, ^ 
which is c?l\\cA. HelL 

‘ The recital of this truth made my man give the 
gbeatefl: attentioxi, and he expreffecT a great fatis-

them lip for thofe heavenly manfions. Now Sa- 
tan feeing himfelf foiled, yet that God had not ta- 
ken the power frotn him as prince of the air, which 
power Heaven designed he fhould retain, whereby 
his creatures might be tried} in revenge for the 
difgrace he had received, he tempts Adam’s wife 
.'Eve to talle of the tree of knowledge of good and 
evil, which God had fm‘biddeni He appears to 
her in the fizape of a ferpent, then a mofl beauti- 
‘ful creature, and tells her, that it was no better 
than an impofitioh which God had put upon her 
and her hulband, not to eat of that fair fruit which 
he had created; that the tafle thereof would make 
them immortal like God himfelf; and confequently 
as great and -powerful as he. Upon which flie not 
"only eat thereof herfelf,- but made her hufband cat 
alfo, which brought. them both under the heaven- 
ly difpleafure. , 

Here Friday exprelTed a great concern; Ah.^ 
poor indns! (cried he) -naughty -womansl naughty 
devil! make God not love de mans^ make mans like 
devil himfelf. ' 

Friday, faid I, God flill loVed mankind ; and 
though the devil tempted hzjman nature fo far, he 
would not fulFer him to have an abfolute power 
over them. I have told' you before of his tender 
love to his people, till they, like Lucifer, difo- 
beyed his commands and rebelled againfl: him ; and 
, even then, how Jefus Chrift, his only Son, came 
to fave linners. Blit flill every man that lives in 
' the world is under temptation and trial. The de- 
vil has, yet a pdwer,^ as prince of the air, to fug- 
geft evil cogitations into our minds, and prompt 
us on to wicked aftions, that he might glory in 
our deftrudlion. Whatever evil thoughts we have 
proceed froni him ; fo that God, in this our di-

, Senamuckecy to let none come near him but Oow^^ 
but fufFers the people as well as priefls to 
offer themfelves at his feet, thereby to be deliver- 
ed from the power and temptation of the devil. 

But though at firft: my man Friday exprelTed 
fome concern at the wickedncfs of Lucif^ry I found 
it not fo eafy to imprint the right notion? of him 
•in his mind, as it" was about the divine elfence of 
, God : for their nature aflHled me in all my argu- 
ments, to 'fliew to him plainly the neceifity of a 
• great firft caufe, and over-ruling governing power, 
of a fecret direfting Providence,' and of the equi- 
ty and reafonablenefs of paying adoration to our 
Creator,; whereas there appeared - nothing of all 
this in the notion of an evil fpirit, of his firll be- 
. ginning, his nature, and above all, of his inclin- 
.ation to evil aftions, and his power to tempt us to 
the like. And indeed this ^ unlearned Indian^ by 
the mere force of nature, puzzled me with one 
particular queftion,, more than ever I could have 
expeded. 

I had, it feems, one day been talking to him of 
the omnipotent power of God§ and his infinite ab- 
horrence, of fin, infomuch that the fcriptures fty- 
led him a confuming fire to all the workers of ini- 
quity ; and that it was in his power, whenever he 
pleafcd,* to defbroy all the world in a monjent, 
the greater par,t of which are continually offending 
him, . 

When, with a ferious attention, he had liftened 
a great while to what I laid, after I had been tel- 
ling him how the devil was God’s enemy in the 
hearts of men, and ufed all his malice and Ikill to 
defeat the good defigu of Providence, and deftroy 
the kingdom of Chrift ,in the world, and fo forth t 
,Very well,- mailer, (faid Friday^) you fay God is

day^ faid I, God is more wife, and ftronger than 
the ferpent : he is above the devil, which makes 
us pray to him, that he would' tread down Satan 
under our feet, enable us to refill his violent 
temptations, and quench his fiery darts. JVhy then^ 
anfwered Friday quickly, if God, as you fay^ has 
much Jlrong^, much might as the devil^ vihy- God no 
kill- devil^ make no more tempt^ no more ds -wicked? 

You may be certain I was lirangely furprifed at 
this queftion of my man’s; and tho’ an old man, 

1 was but a young dddlor, and confequently very 
ill qualified for a cafuill, or a refolver of intricate ^ 
do.ubts in religion. And as it required fome time 
for me to lludy for an anfwer,- 1 pretended not to 
hear him, nor to alk him what he faid ; but fo 
earnefl: was he for an anfwer, as not to forget his 
queftion, which he repeated in the very fame bro- 
ken %ords as above. When I had recovered my- 
felf a little, Friday^ faid I, God -will at lajl punijh 
him fevtrely^ being feferved fOr judgment^ and is 
to be cajl into the botfomlefs pit\ to remain in fire 
everlafiing. But all this did not fatisfy Friday ; 
for returning upon ' me, he repeated my words^ 
RESERVE At LAST, me no underfiand but -why 
not kill devil nov)^ not kill devif greats great -while 
ago ? Friday,^ faid I, you may as well aik me why 
God does not kill you and me, when by our wicked 
actions we fij much offend his Divine Majelly ? He 
gives us time to repent of our fins, and thereby 
we may obtain pardon. At thefe words, obtain 
pardon, Friday mufed a great while and at Iafl< 
looking me (ledfaflly in the face; Well-well, faid 
he, thals very -welf fo you^ I, devil, all -wicked 
mans, all preferve, repent God, pardon all. 

Indeed here I was run do\vn to the laft extremi-. 
ty, when it became very evident to me, how mere 
natural notions will guide reafonable creatures tO" 
knowledge of a Deity, and to the homage du&

Ibnie occafion to go out, fending Friday fox fome- ,

and made my habitation comfortable; and whent 
refledled, that> the' folitary life to which J had been- 
fb long confined that made me to look further to-

der Providence, to fa\^e the life, and for aught P 
know, the foul of this poor favage, by bringing 
him to the knowledge of Jefus Chrirt, it eaufed a - 
fecret joy to fpread through every part of my foul,; 
rind bfroquefttly rejoiced, that ever f was brought 
into this place, which I once thought the inofl: mi- 
ferable part of the world. * 

In this thankfulrfrarae of mind did I afterwards.' 
continue, while I abode on the iflandj and for 
three years did my man and 1 live in the great efl 
enjoyment of happinefs. Indeed I believe the fa- 
vage was as good a Chriflian as I ; and I hope we 
Were equally penitent ; and fuch penitents as were 
comforted arid' reflored by God’s Holy Spirit;. for 
now we had the word of the Lord to inilrucl us 
in the right way,, as much as if we had been on.‘

thereto,; like thofe in which we wear hangers in

I next gave him a very particular defcription of 
the. lerritories of , Europe, and in a particular

I laid before him the manner of our worfhipping 
Gpd, -our behaviour ,onp to another, and how we 
trade in fliips to: every part- in the univerfe. I 
then told him my misfortunes in being fhipwreck-

what my man. meant ; but examining ftnckly into^ 
it, I plainly found, that fnch another boat" re-' 
fembling mine had eome upon the country where' 
he dwelt ; that is tgu-f a fa r th er esplana-' 
tion, that the boa|^ was driven there through vio- 
lent {forms and flrefs of weather. It then came- 
into my mind, that fome European fhip having been- 
caff awaj'’, the poor diflreffed creatures were for- 
ced to have recourfe to the boat to faVe their lives ; 
and being all, as I thought, drovVned’, I never con- 
cerned myfelf to alk any thing concerning them,.' 
bnt my only inquiry was about the boat, and what: 
defcription my man could give of it. 

Indeed Friday anfwered ray demands very wellj- 
making every thing very plain to my underfland— 
ing; but beyond meafure was I fatisfied, when he“ 
told me, with great warmth and ardour, 0 Majler^. 
•we fnve ■white mans from drJtrwn * upon which F 
immediately afked him, if there w'cre any •white-

many, Friday? faid I, hereupon he numbered his' 
fingers, and counted feventeen. And when I afk- 
ed him.what became of them allj and whether they- 
lived or not ? he replied. Yes mafier^ they zll live^ 
they be live among my nation. This information: 
put frelh thoughts into my head, that thefe muft be 
thofe very men who before I concluded had been 
fwallowed up in the ocean after they had left their 
fhip, that had ftruck upon the rocks of my king-, 
dom, and after efcaping the fury of the deep, land- 
ed upon the wild fhore,, and committed themfelves * 
to the fury of thefe devouring Indians; 

The manner of their cruelties to one another, 
which confequently, as, I thought, muft be a£l:ed 
with greater barbarity to ftrangers, createddn me 
a great anxiety, and made me flill more curious 
to aflc Friday concerning them j he told me he was .

the ifland,' whence' I had once before beheld the| 
ppntinent of America, f could not tell immediately; 
^y;ha.t was the matter ; for fuddenly Friday, fell a] 
jumping and dancing as if he had been mad; and=

bu€ likewife of the great obligation he owed mo 
for his wonderful deliverance : nay, that he would 
not only inform his country-men of me, but ac- 
company hundreds of them to my kingdom, and 
make me a miferable facrifice like thofe unhappy 
wretches taken in battle. 

~ Indeed I was very much to blame to have thefe" 
cruel and unjuft fufpicions, arid muft freely own; 
I wronged the poor creature very much, who was 
of a quite contrary temper. And had he had' that’ 
difeerning acutenefs which many Europeans have,, 
he would certainly have perceived ray coldnefs 
arid indifFerenc'e, and alfo have been very niucb 
concerned upon that account ; as I was now irioro 
circumfpeded, I had much leffened my kindnefs' 
and familiarity with him, arid while this jealoufy 
continued, I ufed that artful way (now too much 
in fafliion, the occahon of flrife and diflention) of 
pumping him daily, thereby to difeover whether 
he was deceitful in his thoughts and inclinations : 
but certainly he had nothing in him but what was 
' eonfillent with the befl: principles, both as a reli- 
gious Ghriftian and a grateful friend,; and indeed 
I found every thing he faid was fo ingenuous and 
innocent, that I had no room for fufpicion ; and, 

N in fpite of all uneafinefs, he not only made me, 
entirely his own again, but alfo caulied me much 
to lament that I ever conceived one ill thought of 
him. 

As we were' walking up- the fame hill another^ 
day, when, the weather was fo hazy at fea, that I 
could not perceiW the continent, Friday, faid I*, 
don’t you Wiih yourfelf to be in your own coun-

I, if you Ihould offer to do all this, they will kill-

put on a grave, yet innocent and frtiooth counte- 
, nance, faying, no kill me y they willing 

dove learn : xhoit hy that they would be very wil- 
ding to learn { adding withal, that they had dear n~ 
\ed much of the bearded mans that come in the boat. 
Will you, faid I, go back again, Friday ? He Trai- 
led at that, and told me, that he could not» fwim 
fo far. But, faid I, I will make a canoe for you : 
Y^Sy Majhry faid he, .me go if you gOy me no go if 
you flay. I go, Friday ! w’hy, would you have 
them eat me up, and devour your kind mailer? 
iVb, nOy faid he, me make them not eat maflecy me 
make they much love you ; that is, he would tell 
them how I had llaih his enemies, and thereby la- 
ved his life, for which reafon he would make them 
dove, me : and then he related to me, as well as he 
was able, how exceeding kind thofe of his nation 
were to the white, or bearded men, as he called 
them, who, in their great calamity, w'ere driven 
into their country. 

. It was from this time, indeed, I had llrong in- 
-clinations to venture over, and ufe my utmoll ef- 
forts, if pollible, to’ join thefe white-bearded men, 
who undoubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguefe; 
for thought I,- it mull be certainly a better and 
fafcr way to efcape when there is a gdod company,’ 
than for me alone, from an illand forty miles off 
the Ihore, and without any afllllance. Some days 
after, Friday and I being at. work, as ufual, at the 
fame time diverting ourfelves with Various difcour- 
fcs, I told him I had a boat which I would bellow 

upon 



^144 LIFE and ADVENTURES 

upon himi whenever he pleafed to t*eturri' to his 
own nation : and to convince hihi of the truth of 
what I faid, I took him with me to the other fide 
of the ifland, where my frigate lay, and then tar 
king it from under the water,' (for I always kept 
it funk for fear of a difcpvery) w'e boih went in- 
to it to fee how it would manage fuch an txpedi- 
' tion. ' ■ ' /' ■' ' 

And really never could any be more dexterous 
In rowing than my faithful fervant, making the 
boat go as fall: again as I cbuld. Well^ how, Fn- 
'day, faid 1, fhall we now go to your fo much de- 
‘fired nation? But iiiflead of meeting with that 
' chearfulnefs I expelled, he looked very dull and 
melancholy at my faying fo ; which indeed at firfl: 
fur|)rifed 'me, till he made me fenfible, that his 
concern was about the boat’s being too fmall to 
go fo far a voyage. Upon which 1 let him under- 
hand I had a much bigger; and accordingly the 
next day went to the place where the firft boat 
lay, which I had made, when all the llrength I 
Tiad, or art I could ufe, failed me in my attempt 
to get it into’ the water; but now it having lain ih 
the fun two and twenty yearsj and no care being 
taken of it all that while, it became in a manner 
rotten. My man told me, that fuch a boat would 
do very well to the purpofe, fufficient to carry 
, enough vittle^ ^r'tng^ hread^ for that was his man- 
ner of talking. In fhort, my mind being flrbng- 
ly fitted upon ray defign of going over with him 
to the continent, I very jilainly told him, that We 
would both go arid make a boat frill as big, arid 
^ more proportionable than that, wherein he might 
fafely return to his own nation. 

Thefe words iriade Friday look fo very penfive, 
that I thought he would have fallen at my feet.

if my mafter fends me from him. And here I can- 
not but take notice of the flrong ties of ffiend- 
fliip which many times furpafs thofe of confangui-; 
nity ; for often we find a great difagreement a- 
' mong kindred ; and when there is any feeming re- 
gard for each other, it is very feldom true, and 
fcarce ever lafting, if powerful intereft does not 
bear the fvyay ; and that alone is~ often the occa-' 
fion of the greateft hatred in the workl, which is 
to delire the death of parents and relations, for’ 
the fake of acquiring their fortunes : but there 
was no fuch thing between my fervant and me ; 
inlfead of which there was the greatejl: gratitude, 
and the molt fincere love; he found me not only 
his deliverer, but his preferver and comforter; 
not a fevere and cruel tyrant, but a kind, loving,: 
and alFable friend. He wanted for no manner of 
fultenance ; and when he was ill, of out of Order, 
I was his phylician, not only for his body, but 
his foul ; and therefore no wonder was it, that 
fuch ah innocent creature, long lince diverted of 
his former natural cruelty, Ihould have an un- 
common concern at fo cruel a reparation from nle^ 
which -pierced him to the very foul, and made him 
delire even to die, rather than live without me. 

After I had told Friday^ in a very cafelefs man- 
' ner, that he lhould.be at his liberty as foon as the 
boat was made, the language of his eyes eXprelTed 
all imaginable confulion ; when immediately run- 
ning to one of his hatchets, which he ufed to wear 
as a defenlive weapon, he gives it into my hand,^ 
with a heart fo full, that he could/carcely fpeak, 
Friday y faid I, what is it you mean what mull I

and now Friday, fend away^ never fee Friday more* 
As though the poor creature had faid, Alas^ niy 
deareft kind mallerjj- how comes it to pafs, tliat 
after having ventured your precious life to favd 
me from the Jaws of the devouring cannibals like 
myfelf, after fuch .a tender regard to provide for 
me fuch a comfortable nourilhment, and' confinii- 
ing fo long a kind mafter, and a raoft lincere 
friend; and after making me forfake the falfe.no- 
tion of an Indian Deity, and worlhip the^true 
God in fpirit and in truth : after all this, how 
comes it now, that you are willing to fend me a- 
way to my former courfe of living, by which means- 
Undoubtedly we fliall be dead to each other ; but 
greater .rauft be my misfortune, that‘1 fltall never' 
behold my beft friend I have in the world any mo‘re.r 
And this undoubtedly, though he could not exprefs 
himfelf fo clearly, miift be hrs feuthnents ; for the 
tears ran down his cheeks in fuch a plentiful man- 
ner, that I had much ado to refrain from weeping 
alfo when I beheld - the poor creature’s affedlion ; 
fo that I was forced to comfort him in the beft 
manner I could, which I did, by telling him, if 
he was content to abide with me, I fliould be ever 
willing to keep him. 

After Friday’s grief was fomething abated, more 
fully to convince me of his affeftion, he faid, (J

J had not the leaft intention or delire of under-

Jy to ^ujther our efcjtpe. To which intept 

my n>an and I went to £earch for a gjroppr tree to 
fell, whereof we ought make a large periagua or 
canoe, to nndertake the voyage ; and indeed w^e 
were not long -in fi^nding one ht for our. purpofe, 
there being enough of wood in the ifland to have 
Imilt a 'fleet of Targe veflejs, but the thing we 
prineipally w?mted was, to g^t one fo near , the 
watej*, that we might latmch it after it was finiflj- 
. ed, and -not cpnnnit fo horrid a miflake as I had 
done onpe before. 

. Well, after a great fcanch for w'hat was heft 
and moft convenient-, Friday at latt, whofe jndg^ 
ment in fuch affairs was much fuperior to mine, 
pitches upon a kind of wood the moft flttjng for 
it. To -this day I 'cannot tell the name of the 
tree^ nor defcrihe it any other way, than only 
by fayiilg, thsc it is very like what we call fuftiCy 
or betwixt that and the 'Nicaragua wood, being 
much, of the fame colour and fmcll. But though 
my man cKoeeded me In the knowledge of the 
moft proper tree, yet I fhewed him a mudh better 
and cleaner way to make a Ganoe than ever he knew 
feefore-i for lie was for burning llie hollow or ca? 
vity of the tree, in order to make this boat ; but 
I then told him how we might do it with tools, 
learning him at the fame time how to n& them, 

. which indeed he did very deKteroufly ; fo that in 
a month’s labour \ve flniflied it, making ;it very 
handfome, by cutting the outlide into the true 
fliape of a boat. After this it took ns a full fortr 
cigM before we could get her into the water, 
which we did, as it were, inch by inch, npoa 
great rollers : but when Am was in, flie would 
have carried twenty men; w'ith all the eafe inuij- 
ginablc. 

As! was very well pleafed, you may be lure,

rto lefs amazed to behold with- what dexterity my 
man would manage her, turn her, and paddle her- 
along. Well, Friday, faid I, what do you think* 
of it now? Do 'you thjnk this will carry us over? 
Yesj Mafier^ faid he, 'wtf venture over 'well^ though 
great bloixj ’luind. But my delign was yet farther,, 
which he was infenfible of; and that was to make 
a mall and fail, and to provide her with an anchor 
and cable. As to a mart, that was no difficult 
thing at all to procure; fo I fixed upon a flraight 
young cedar-tree, which I found near the place,, 
great plenty of it abounding in the ifland; and fet- 
tjng Friday to. cut it down, gave him particular 
direftkjns how to fliape and order it; but as to the 
fail, that I managed myfelf. I very well knew I- 
had fome old ones, or pieces of fails enough, which 
had lain fix and twenty years by me; but not be- 
gin careful to preferve them, as thinking I ffiould 
have no qccalion to ufe them any more,, when I 
came to look them over, I found them* almofl: all 
rotten, except two; and with thefel went to work, 
and after a great deal of pains and awkward tedi- 
ous flitching for want of needles, at length Ifiniffied 
three'cornered ugly thing, like what we call in Eng- 
land a flioulder of mutton fail, to go with a boom 
at bottom, and a little fmall' fprlt at the. top, like 
thpfe which our longboats ufe, and which I very 
well knew how to manage; efpecially fince it was 
like that which I had in my patron’s fifliing boat,, 
when with my boy Xury I ra^de my efcape from 
the Barbarian fliore. 

It was near two months, I think, before I com- 
pleated this work, that is, the rigging, and fitted' 
my mall and fails f and indeed they*' were nicely 
done, having made a, fmall flay, and a fail, or fore- 
fail to it, to airdf, if we Ihould turn to the wefl- 
ward; and, which was ftill more, I fixed a rudder 
to the flern of her, to fleer with;, and though L 

N 3 ' was 



150 LIFE and ADVENTURES 

•vvas-but a very indifferent fliipwright, yet, as I 
was fenfibje of tfae great ufefulnpfs and abfolute 
necelTity of a tmn^g like this, I applied myfelf to- it 
with fuch a eonflant application, that at laft I ac- 
coinplifhed my defjgn: but what with the many 
dull contrivances 1 had about it, and the failure of 
many things, it coft me as much pains in ordering 
as in making the boat. Befides, when all ibis was 
done, I had my man to teach what belonged to its 
navigation: fpr though he very well underftood 
how to paddle a canoe along, he was an utter gran- 
ger to a fail and rudder, and was amazed when 
he faw me work the boat to and again in the fea, 
by them, and how the fail gibbed and filled this 
way or that way, as the courfe we failed changed. 
Aft^r fome time, and a little ufe, I made ail thefe 
things very familiar to him, fo that he became an 
expert failor, except in relation tp the compafs, 
and that I could make him underfland but little of. 
But as it hapenned, there was feldorn occaflon for 
it, there being but little cloudy weather, and fcarce 
ever any fog in thofe parts; the Bars were always 
vlfible in the night, and the (bore perfpicuous by 
day, except in the rainy “feafon, which confined 
every one to his habitation. 

Thhs entered in the fevai and twentieth year 
of my reign, or captivity, which you pleafe, (the 
laft three of which, blefled with the company of 
my man Friday, ought not to be reckoned, > I kept 
the'anniverfary of my landinghere, with the fame 
thankfulnefs to God, for his tender mercies, as I 
did before; and certainly, as I had great caufe for 
a thankful acknowledgment for ray deliverance at 
fir ft, I had much greater now, for fuch lingular and 
additional teftimohies ofthe careof Providence over 
me, in all my diftreffes, both of body and mind, and 
the great hopes I had of being efieftually and fpeedi- 
ly delivered; for I hadaftrbng impreflion upon my 

mind^ 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 15c 

mind, that I fhould riot be another year in this 
bland. But, however, I ftill conlffiflied on with my 
hulbandry, digging, planting, and fencing, as ufual ; 
gathering arid curing my grapes, and doing all other 
things that were neceflary. 

And now the rainy feafon beginning to come 
on, obliged me to keep the longer within doors ; 
but before this, I brought my new veflel into the 
creek, where I had landed my rafts from the Ihip, 
and haling her up to the fhore, I ordered my man 
Friday to dig a dock fufficient to hold her in, and 
deep enough to give her water, wherein flie might 
float j and then, when the tide was out, we made 
a ftrong dam crofs the end of it, to keep out the 
water ; by which means flie lay dry, as to the 
tide from the Tea j and to keep the rain from her, 
we thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of 
trees, like a houfe ; and fo we waited for the 
months of November and December, in which I 
dellgned to venture over the ocean. 

No fooner did the feafonable weather begin to 
draw near, but fo much was I elevated with this 
new dellgned adventure, that I daily prepared for 
the voyage. The firft thing I thought on was, to 
Jay by a certain quantity of provilions, as a fuf- 
ficient ftore for fuch'an expedition, intending in a 
week or fortnight’s time to open the dock, and 
launch out the boat for that purpofe. But one 
morning as I was very bufy upon fomething necef- 
fary for this occalion, I called Friday to me, and 
bid him go to the fea-lhore, and fee if he could 
find a turtle or tortoife, a thing which we com- 
monly had once a week, as much upon account of 
the eggs, as for the fake of the flelh, He had not 
been long gone, but he came running back, as 
though he was purfued for life, apd as if were flew 
over my outward wall,' or fence, like one that 
felt not the ground, or fleps, he fet Ms feet on ; 

and

and before I bad time to enquire the reafon of bis- 
precipitation, berberies out, O dearmafler^ Ofnr- 
roio! forroiv! Bad! O had! Why, what’s th« mat- 
ter, Friday P, hid I; 0 yonder^ yonder^ faid he,- 
there be one^ /wo, or three canoes! /wo, three. 
Surely (thought I) there muft be fix, by my man’s 
way of, reckoning ; but, on a ftridler inquiry I. 
found there were but three. Well, Friday, faid 
i, don’t be terrified, I warrant you we will not, 
only defend ourfelves againfl: ’em,' but kill the 
moll: of .thefe cruel favages. But though I com- 
forted him in the beft manner I could, the poor 
creature trembled fo, that I fcarce knew what fo 
do with him: 0 mafi err y faid he, /A(fj come look 
Friday, cut pieces Friday, cut a me up. Why,. 

. Friday, faid I, they will eat me up as well as you,, 
and my danger is as great as yours. But lince it 
is fo, we mull refolve to fight for our lives. What- 
fay you ? can you fight, Friday Yes faid he very- 
faintly, me Jljooty me kill vjhat I can^ but there come. 
great many number* That’s no matter, faid I again, 
pur guns will terrify thofe that we do not kill i, 

I am very willing to ftand by you to the laft drop- 
of my blood ? now tell me, if you will do the like 
by me, and obey my orders in whatfoever I eom- 
niand ? Friday then anfyv'ered^ 0 majlery me loJF 
life for yoUy me die luhen you bid die. Thus con- 
cluding all queflioris concerning his. fidelity, im- 
mediately I fetched him a .good dram: of rum, (of- 
which I had been a very good hulbaud,) and gave 
it him to comfort his heart. After he had drank 
it, I ordered him to tajee the two fowling pieces,., 
which we always carriedi' and load them with large 
fwan fliot, as bigas fmall pillol bullets then I 
took four mulkets, and loaded them with. two Hugs, ■ 
and five fmall bullets each, charging: my two ^ 
tols each with a brace. I hung my great fword, 
as cuilbmary, naked to my fide, and gave Friday. 

■ his 


©r KOBINSOT^J CRUSOE. 153 

bis hatchet, as a moft cxqellent weapon for defence. 

Thvs prepared, I abonght as well of myfelf aS^^ 
any knight-icrrant that ever Handled a fword and 
fpear. I took ipy perfpecliye glafs, and went up 
to the lide of the nill, to fee what I could difeo-* 
ver ; and I perceived very foon, by the glafs, that 
there were one and twenty fa vages, thr^ prifon- 
ers, and three canoes; and -that their chirf conn 
oera feemed to be the triumphant banquet upon 
the three poor human bodies; a thing which by 
this time I had obferved was (very common with 
them. I alfo rwnarked, that th?^ did not iand at 
that place from whence Friday imade his efcape, 
but nearer to the creek, where thefhore was low, 
and wshere a thick wood came very clofe to the 
fea. My foul was then filled >with indignation and 
abhorrence at fucb -inhuman wretches, which put 
a period to all my former thoughts in their vin^ 
dication : neither would I give myfelf time tocon> 
fider their right of conqueft, as 1 had done ibefore } 
hut descending from the mountain, I came down 
to Friday, arid told him, I was rdblved go 
fpecdHy to them and kill them all ; afldng hina at 
gain, ha the fame breath, if he would (ftand by 
Wh^hy this time heisg recovered from his fright, 
and his fjisVk much cheered wkh the dram I had 
giymi him, he was very pleafant, yet fei’ioufly tel- 
iangme,Us he did ibefore, When Ibid die ^ he 'mould 
die. 

And now it was, having fixed iny refolution in 
fo ftr-ong a manner, that nothing could divelV my 
breafl: of its uncommon fury, I immediately dU 
viejed the loaded arms betwixt us. To my man 
Friday I gave a piftpl to flick in his girdle, with 
three guns upon his flioulder, a weight too great 
I confefs to bear ; but what mufi: a poor king do, 
wlio had but one foldier in the world? But to 
fliew I made him bean no more than what I would 



154 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

lay on rayfelf, I fluck the other pillol in my girdle^ 
and^ other three guns tipon my fhoulders ; nay* 
fomething^ more, but that was like ^fop’s burden^ 
a fma 11 bottle of rum, which was foon lightened 
tO' our exceeding refrefliment. Thus we marched 
out, under a ponderous load of armour, like two 
invincible' champions, with a quantity of powder 
and bullets to ftand our battle, and load again, 
when the pieces were difcharged. And now my 
orders being to be obeyed, Tcharged Friday to 
keep clofc behind me, and not to flir, or Ihoot, or 
attempt any thing till I commanded him ; and, in 
the interim, not to fpeak fo much as one word. 
It was in this order I fetched a compafs to the right 
hand, of near a mile, as well to get over the creek, 
as to attain the .wood j . by this I thought to come 
Virhin Ihot of them before I could be difcerned ; 
as I found by my glafs would not be difficult to ac^ 
complilh. 

, But how ^ckle and wavering is the mind of 
men, even in our greateft fury and ftrongeft in- 
clination? For while I was tak'ng this march, my 
refolution Began to abate, not through fear of 
their numbers, who were a parcel of naked un- 
armed wretches, but thofe reflexions occufred to 
my thoughts ; What power was I commiflioned 
With, or what occafion or neceflity had I to go 
and imbrue my hands inhuman blood, and murder 
■ people that had .neither done nor intended ta.do 
me any wrong? They were innocent in particu- 
lar as to me; and their barbarous ctdlom was not 
only their misfortune, but a fign that God had 
left them in the mofl: immenfe llupidity ; but yet 
did not warrant me to be a judge of their aXions, 
much lefs a% executioner of his righteous judg- 
ments; that, on the contrary, whenever, he thought 
fit, he would take vengeance on them himfelf, and 
puniili thera-in a national way,, according to their 

national 



OF ROfelNSON CRUSOE. 155 

national crimes; but that was nothing at all to me,' 
who had no concern with them. Indeed my man 
Friday might juftify himfelf, becaufe they were his 
declared enemies, of that very fame nation that 
went to facrifice himiiefore, and indeed it was 
lawful for him to' attack them, which I could not 
fay was fo with, refpect to me. So warmly did 
thefe things prefs upon my thoughts all the way I 
went, that I only refolved to place niyfelf fo as 
to behold their bloody entertainment, without 
falling upon them, except fomething more than 
ordinary, by God’s fpecial direction, lliould oblige 
me thereto. 

Thus fixed in my refollition, I entered in the 
thick wood, (my man Friday following me clofe 
behind,) when with all poflible wearinefsandfilence 
I marched till I came to the Ikirt of it, on that 
fide which was the neareft to them ; for only one 
end of the wood interpofed between me and them. 
Upon which I called very foftly to Friday^ 
fhewing him a great tree, that "was juft at the cor- 
ner of the wood, I Ordered him to repair thither, 
and bring me word, if he could plainly perceive 
their actions : Accordingly, he did, as I Command- 
ed him, and came back with this melancholy ftory, 
that they were all about their fife, eating theflefli 
of one of their prifoncrs ; and that another lay 
bound upon the fand, a little diflant from them, 
which’ they defigned for their next facrifice; and 
this, he told me, was not one of their nation^ 
but one of thofe very bearded men, who wa^ dri- 
ven by a florm into their country, and of whom 
he had fo often talked to me abbut. You may be 
fure, that upon hearing this, ray foul was ready 
to fink within me; when afcending up into a tree, 
I faw plainly by my glafs, a white man, who lay 
upon the beach of the fea, with his hands and feet 
ty’d with flags, or things referabling rufhes, be-

ingj eover^ with cloathsi, And feemed td fee an 
puropean. From the tree where: I took thisi pro- 
i’pe(S^ I perceived another tree, and a thicket be>- 
yond it^: aboiit fifty yards nearer to them, than 
where I waa; which, by taking a fmail circle 
round, I might come at undifcovered,. and theu^I 
fiiould be within half a fhot oft thefe dfevourers* 
And this confideratidn alone, to be more per- 
fedtly revenged upon< them, made me with-hold my 
palfion,, though 1 was enraged' to the- higheft de^ 
gree imaginable; when- going back about twenty 
paces, I got behind^ fome biiflies, which held all 
the way tint came to the other tree; andthenl a-t 
fcendedi tOr at little riling ground,, not above eigh- 
teen yards di fiance, and there hhadra full view of 
thefe creatures,! and I? could perceive all their ac- 
tions. 

Such a fight did then appear, as* obliged me not 
to lofe a moment’^ time. No lelk than nineteen 
.of thefe' dreadful wretches fat upon the ground^ 
clofe. huddled together, exprefling allthe delight 
imagiuabl® at fa barbarous* an entertainment; and 
they had jufl font other tvvo to murder this poor

exaftly as you fee me? de* All which hepromifing 
he would perform, I fet down one of my mulkets, 
and the fow.lingpiece upon the gi’ound, and Friday 
did the fame by his; and with the other mulkot I 
took ray aim at the favages, hiding him do the

I only killed one, and wounded two ; butniy maii 
'Friday^ taking his aim much better than I, killed 
two, and wounded three. You may be fure they 
were in a dreadful conflernation, at fuch an un- 
'expecled difafler; and thofe who yet had efcaped 
, our penetrating fhot, immediately jumped upon 
their feet, but were , in fuch confufion, that they 
knew not which way to run or look, not knowing 
from whence their deftrudtion came. We then 
threw down our pieces, and took tip others, giv- 
ing a fecond dreadful volley; but as they wefe 
loaded only with fvvan-diot; or fmall piftol bullets, 
we perceived only two of them fall; though ma- 
ny were.^ vrouuded, who run yelling and fereaming 
'about like mad creatures. Now Friday^ faid I, 
lay down your piece, and take up the raulket, and 
follow me. ^ He did lb, with great courage, when 
•{hewing ourfelves to the favages, we gave a great 
Ihout, and made diredly to the poor vidlim, who 
would have been facrificed. had not our firll fire* 
obliged the butchers, with three others, to jump 
into a canoe. By my order, Friday fifed at them, 
at which fliot I thought he had killed them all, by 
reafon of their 'falling to the bottom of the boat; 
however, he killed two, and mortally wounded a 
third. In the mean time, I cut the flags that tied 
the hands and feet 0/ the poor creature, and lift- 
ing, him up, afked him in the Portuguejs tongue, 
JFhat he was? He anfwered me in Latin, Cbrifii- 
antis; but fi> very weak and faint, that he could . 
fcarce fland or fpeak. Immediately I gave him a 
dram, and a piece of bread to cherifli him, and alk- 
ed him what countryman he was ? He faid, Efpa- 
and then utteredall the thankfulnefs imagina- 
ble for his deliverance. Signior, ^faid I with as 
much Spaniyhas I was mailer of, J let us talk after- 
wards, but fight now; here, take this fword and 
piftol, ^nd do what you can. And indeed he did

fo with fuch courage and intrepidity, that he cut 
two of them tp pieces in an inOant, the favages 
not having the power to fly for their lives. I or- 
dered Friday to run for thofe pieces we had left at 
phe tree, which he brought me w'ith great fwift- 
nefs, and then I gave him my mufiiet, while I load- 
ed the rert. But now there happened a fierce ep^- 
counter between the Spaniard and one of the fava- 
ges, who had made at him with one of their wooden

could.be expected, having twi(je wounded his ene-

dian had thrown him upon the ground, and was 
wrefling my fword out of his han4, which the 
Spaniard quitting, drew out his piflol,

too nimble for him. The Spaniard taking one qf 
the fowling-pieces, wounded two, who running ip- 
to the wood, Friday purfued and killed one; but 
the other, notwithftanding his wounds, plunged 
hirnfelf into the .fea, and fwam to thofe two who 
were left in the canoe, which, with one wounded,

get out of our reach, and Fridray was as eager in 
purfuingthem ; and indeed I Was no lefs anxious ' 
about their efcape, left after thejiews had been 
carried to their people, they fliould return in inul- 
^titudes, ahd deftroy us. So being refoh-ed to pur« 
fue them, I jumped into one of thdr canoes, and 
bid Friday follov) tne ; but no fooner was I in, 
than, to ray furprife, I found another poor crea- 
ture, bound hand and foot for the (laughter, juil 
as the Spaniard had been, with very little life in 
him. Immediately 1 unbound him, and would have 
helped Tiiraup; but he could neither fland nor 
fpeak^ but groaned fo piteoufly, as thinking he 
was only unbound in order to be flain. Hereu- 
pon 1 bid Friday fpeak to him and tell him of bis • 
deliverance; when pulling out my bottle, I-made 
the poor wretch drink a dram, which, with the 
joyful news he had received, fo revived his heart, 
that he fat up in the boat. As foon as Friday be- 
gan td hear him fpeak, and look more fully in his 
face, it 'would have moved any one to^ tears to 
perceive his uncommon tranfports of joy ; for he 
kilfed, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed 
hallooed, jumped about, danced, fung, then cried 
again, wrung his bands, beat his face and head, 

' then fling and jumped about again, like a dillrac- 
ted creature : fo that it was a great while'before 
I could make him fpeak to me, or tell me what 
was the matter with him : but when he came to- 
the liberty of his fpeech, at lajft he told ine it was 
his father. ' ‘ • 

Here indeed I was infinitely . moved to fee that 
dutiful and tender alFe^lion this poor lavage had 
to his aged parent. He would lit down by him in 
the boat, open his bread, and hold his -father’s 
head clofe to bis bofom, half an hour togetherj to 
cherifli it ; then he tOok his arms and ancles, 
which were IfilF and numbed with binding, and 

O 2 chaffed

cfiaffed and mbbed them with his hands; by which 
means perceiving what the cafe was, 1 gave him 
fome rum, which proved of great benefit to him.. 

While >ye were bufy in this adion, the favages 
had gotten, ahnofi out of fight; and happy it was 
\vc did not purfue them;. for there arofe -from the 
north-wefl:, which continued all night long, fuch 
a violent florm, that I could not fuppofe otherwife 
but that they were all drowned. After this, I call- 
ed Friday to me, and alked him if he had gi ven hif, 
father any bread? He Ihook his head, and laid, 
None^ not one hit, me eat a np all ? fo J gave him 
a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried fon 
this end. I likewife gave him a dram for himfelf, 
.and two or three bunches of raifins for his 
ther. Both thefe he carried to him, for he would, 
make him drink the dram to comfort him. -j 

Away he then runs out of the boat as if he w'a$ 
bewitched, with fuch an extraordinary fwifmefs, 
that he was out of fight as it were in an inftanti 
but at his return I perceived him flacken his- pace, 
becaufe.he had fomething in his hand. And this 
I found to beh as he approached nearer, an earthy 
enjug with fome water to his father, with two 
more cakes of bread, which he delivered- into my 
hands.' Being very thirty myfelf, I drank fome 
of the water, of which when his father had dranh 
fufficiently, it more revived his fpirits than all the 
rum- 1 had given him, 

I then called Friday- to me,; and ordered hhh ^0 
carry the Spaniard one of the cakes, .and fome 
water, who * was repofing himfelf npdn a green 
place under the fliade of a tree, but fu y/eak, thafe 
though he exerted himfelf, he could not Rand upon 
his feet. Upop which i oT(\ei"e^ Friday to rub and 
bathe his ancles with rum, as be did his father’s. 
But every minute he was employed in this, he 
would call a wifliful eye towards the boat, where 

. . he

ite left his father fitting; who fuddenly difappesr-- 
ing-, he flew like lightning to him, arid finding he on- 
ly laid himfelf down to eafe his limbs, he return-- 
ed back to me prefently ; and then I fpoke to the* 
Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him to 
the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling,, 
where I would take care of him. Upon- which-, 
Friday took him upon his back, andfo carried hint 
ro the canoe, fettiug him clofe by his father ; and 
prefently fiepping out again, launched the boat off,, 
and paddled it along the (hore fafier than I conld 
walk, though the wind blew very hard too : and’ 
having brought them fafe to the creek, away he 
runs to fetch the other canoe; which he brottghc 
to the- creek ainiofl as foon as I got to it by land ;, 
when wafting me over, he took our new guefts. 
out of the- boat; but fo weak were they, that I 
was forced to make a kind of a hand-barrow ; and 
when I came to my caffle, not being willing to 
^make an entrance into my wall, we made them a 
liandfome tent, covered with old fails, and boughs^ 
of trees, making two good beds of riee^flraw, 
with blankets to lye upon and cover them. Thus, 
like an abfohite king, over fiibjefts who owed 
tlieir lives to me, 1 thought myfelf very confide-' 
rable, efpecially as- I had now three religions in 
my kingdom-, my man Friday being a Preteflant, 
his father a Pagan, and the Spaniard a Papill t 
but I gave liberty of corfcience to them all-. 

To get provifions for my poor weak fubjeds, I 
ordered to kill me a yearling goat ; which, 

when he had done, I cutoff the hinder quarters, 
arid chopping it into- fmal I pieces, boiled and dew- 
ed it, putting barley and rice into- the broth. 
This- I carried into their tent, fet a table, dined 
with them myfelf, and encouraged them. Friday 
was my inccrpreter to his father; and indeed to 
the Spaniard too, who fpoke the language of the* 

• • O ^ favages.

Ravages pretty well. After dinner I ordered 
day to fetch homci all pur arms from the' field of 
battle, and the next day to bury the dead bodies^ 
which he did accordingly. 

And now 1 made Friday inquire of his father 
whether he thought thofe favages had efcaped the* 
late florm in their canoe j and if fo, whether they 
would not return with a power- too great for us 
to' refiff.^ He anfwered, that he thought it im-. 
polfible they could outlive the ftorin.; or if they 
were driven fouthwardly, they would come to a- 
land where they would as certainly be devoured,, 
as if they were drowned in the fea. And fuppofe 
• they had attained their own country, the ftrange- 
nefs of their fatal and bloody attack, would make 
them tell their people, that the reft of them vvercr' 
killed by thunder and lightning; not by the hanth 
of man, but by two< heavenly fpirits (meaningf 
Friday and me) who were fent from ^bove to de- 
ftroy them. And this, he faid, he knew, becaufe., 
he heard them fay the fame to one another. And 
indeed he was in the right onh; for I have heard 
fince, that thefe four men gave out, that whoever 
went into that inchanted illand, would be deftroy- 
.ed by fire fropi the gods. 

No canoes appearing fome time after, as I ex- 
pefted, my apprehenfion ceafed : Inftead of 'which 
iny former thoughts of a voyage took place, efpe- 
dally whfen Friday^ s father 'alfu red me I fliould 
have good ufage in bis nation. As to the Spani- 
ard., told me, tha;fixteen more of his country-, 
men, and Portuguese, who had been fliipwrecked,., 
made their efcape thither j that though they were, 
in union with' the favages, yet they were yery, 
miferable for want of provilion and other necef- 
faries. When I afked him about the particulars 
of his voyage, he anfwered, that their fhip was.

ed in the ocean ; the refl having fa ved. their lives, 
in, the boat, were, now landed pn the main cpnti.% 
nept.- And what do they intend to do there? faicf 
I. He replied, they have concerted meafures to 
efcape, by building a veffel, but that they had nei-, 
ther tools nor provilions, fo that all their defigns 
came to nothing. Snppoling (faid 1) I fliould make 
a proppfal, and invite them ner,c, would they noti 
carr,y me prifoner to iVetu Spain P He anfvvrej’cdy 
No : for he knew them to be fuch honelt men, as: 
\yould fcorn to aft fuch inhumarr bafenefs to their 
deliverer : That if I plealed, he and the old fa--: 
vage wQuld go over to them, talk with them n- 
' tout 4t, and billing me an anfwer: That they Ihoultl 
. all fwear fidelity to me as their leader, upon the 
holy^ focrament : andTor hb part, he would not ^ ' 
only dp the fame, but Hand by me to the lall drop 
of his blood, fliould there be occafipn. 

Thefe folemn aflurances made me refolve to- 
grant them relief, and to fend thefe two over for 
that purpofe : but when every thing was ready, the 
Spaniard v;^i£ed an objeftion, which carried-a great 
deal of weight in it : Yau jino'w^ Sir, faid, he, 
having been fame time v)ith you, I cannot but hi,, 
fenfible of your pock of rice and corn, fufficient 
perhaps, for us ai prefent, but mt for them, Jhoulf. 
they come over prefently much lefs to, victual

great an occafon for them to difagree and rebel, 
as the. children of Ifrael.//;V againp God himfelf,^ 
•vshen they ’wanted bread in the ’wildernefs . . And^ 
therefore, my advice is to -wait another ha^~vep, and 
in the mean time cultivate and improve fome moreti 
land, 'whereby we may have plenty of provifions,^ * 
in order to execute our defign. 

This advice of the Spaniard*^ I approved ex-; 
tremely ; and fo fatisfied was I of his fidelity, that,

redeemed him ever after. And the ^ we ajl four 
went to work upon fome mere land, ahd a gmn ft 
feed-time we had gotten fo much cured and _tfirrt- 
med up, fufficient to fow 22 biiihels of barley on, 
and 16 jars of rice, which was infliort all thefeed* 
we had to fpare. - / 

As we were four in number, and 'by this tithe' 
all in good health, we feared not a hdhdred In- 
dians, fliould they venture to attack us ; and while' 
the corn was growing, 1 pitched upon fome trees, 
fit to build us' large vefi'el,^ in c‘^{e iht Sp^atiiardr 
came over ; which being marked, I ordered Fri^ 
day and his father to cut them down, appointing; 
the Spaniard^ who was now my privy coOTfellor, 
to overfee and direct the work. I likewife 'in- 
cteafed my flocks of goats, by fhooting the Wild 
dams, and bringing home their kids tcVmy indo- 
fure : nor did I negleft the grape-feafon, but cu'-- 
red them as ufual,' though I had fuch a quantity" 
now, as would have filled barrels with railins* 
And thus all 6f ns being employed," they in work-' 
ihg, and I in proving for them, till harveft'came,. 
God Almighty bieiied the increafe of ft fo, mnch,, 
that from twenty-two barrels of barley, we thtefli- 
ed out two hundred and rc\>enry, and the like quan- 
tity'^of rice, fufficient to victual a fliip fit' to car- 
ry me and all the Spaniards to any part of Anief,

Thus the prindpal objeiflion being ahfwered by" 
a fufficient ft ock of p^rovifiom, I font my two am- 
hafladors over to the main-land, with a regal au- 
thority to adminiftcr the oaths of allegfance and" 
fidelity, and have an inftrument tigned Under iheir' , 
hands, though I never allied whether they had’pen,, 
ink or paper: when giving each of them a muf-

fion enough for eight days, they failed away with'

cr£ek, they had landed jufl at my door, and mighs 
not only have forced me out of my caftle, but 
plundered me of all I had in the world. Now I 
was fully convinced they were all Englilhmen,- 
three of which were unarmed and bound ; when 
immediately the fir ft four or five leapt on Ibofe 
and took thofe three out of the boat as prifoners,; 
one of whom I could perceive ufed the mofl paf- 
fionate gefturcs of intreaty, affi£lion, and defpair, 
while the others, in a lelTer degree, llievved abun- 
dance of concern. 

Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very 
much aftonilhed, and I beckoned to Fridays, who 
was belOw, to afcend the mountain, and likewife 
vievy this light. 0 Mafler^ fays he to me, you fee 
Englifli mans eat prifoners as •well as Savdge mans. 
And do you think they will eat them, Friday ? 
faid I, Tei," f lid Friday^ they eat a all up.' No,, ho, 
faid I, Friday., I am much more concerned left 
they murder them ; b'at as for eating them up, 
that I am fure they will never do.- 

And riow I not only lamented my misfohtune, 
in not having the Spaniard and Savage with me, 
but alfo that 1 could not come within fliot of them 
unperceived, (they having no fire arms among 
them,) and fave thefe three men, whom I thought 
they were going to kill with their fwords. But 
feme comfort it was to me, that I perceived they' 
were fet at liberty to go where they pleafed, the 
rafcally fcamen fcattering about as though they' 
had a mind to fee the place: ahd fo long did 'they 
negligently ramble, that the tide had ebbed fo low, 
as to leave the boat aground. Nor were the! fWo 
men that were in her more circumfped: for ha-' 
ving drunk a little too much liqUor, they fell fall

but, as Providence ordered it, all their force was 
ineffedual to launch her, when I could hcai; them 
fpeak to one another, IVhy^ let hsi' alone:; Jack, 
can’t ye^ Jibe’ll float next tide; by which words I 
was fully convinced they were ray own country- 
men. All this while I lay very quiet, as being 
fully fenfible it could be no lefs than ten hours 
before the boat would be afloat, and then it would 
be fo dark, as that they cotild not ealily perceive 
me, by wdiich means I fhould be at more liberty to 
hear their talk, and obferve all their motiuns ; not 
but that I prepared for my defence: yet as I had 
now another fort of enemies to ebrnbat with, I 
afted with more caution. I took two fufees on 
my fhoulders, and gave Friday three mulkets; 
befides, my'' formidable goat-lkin coat, and mon- 
ftrous cap, made me look as fierce and terrible 
as HerculeJ of» old, efpecially when two piftols 
were lluck in my belt, and my naked fword hang- 
ing by my lide. 

' If was my defign at firfl: not to make any at- 
tempt till it was dark, but it being now two 0’-' 
clock, in the very heat of the day, the failofs 
wer'e all flraggling into the woods, and undoubt- 
edly w'ere Ihin down to fleep. The three poor 
diftreffed creatures, too anxious to get any re- 
pofe, were, however, feated under the lliade of 
a great tree, about^a quarter of a mile from me. 
Upon which, without any more ado, I approach- 
ed towards them, with my man following behiftd 
me, and, before I was perceived, I called aloud 
to them in Spanijh^ What are ye^ Gentlemen? 

At thefe words they darted up in great confufion, 
when they beheld the ftrange figure I made, they 
returned nq anfw'er, but feemed as if they would 
fly from me; Gentleman^ (faid f in Englifl?^) don’t

there were two enormous villains among them,

they were killed or feized^ niight induce the reft 
to return, to their obedienee. Well, well, faid I,

When he had given me allthefatisfadion I conid 
^{ire, I gave him and his two’ companions each 
of them a gun, with powder and ball fufficient, 
advihng them to fire upon them as they lay fleep- 
ing. The captain moaelily faid, that he was for- 
ty to kill them ; though, on the other hand, to let 
thefe villains efcape, who were the authors of his 
mifery, might be the ruin of us all. Well, faid 
he, do as you thiiil^fit ; and fo accordingly I fi- 
red, killing one of, toe captain’s chiefeft enemies, 
and wounding the other, who eagerly called for 
alfiflance ; but the captain (who had referved his 
piece) coming up to him, Si-rrah^ faid he, His 
late to call fot affijlance^ you Jhotild rather cry to 
God to pardon your villainy ; and fo knocked him 
down with the flock of his gun : three others were 
alfo flightly wounded, who at my approach cried 
out for mercy. This the captain granted, upon 
condition that they would fwear to be true to him' 
in recovering the fliip, which they folemnly did; 
however, I obliged the captain to keep them bound. 
After which I fent Friday and the captain’s mate 
to fecure the boat, xind. bring away the oars and 
fails; when, at their return, three men coming 
hack, and feeing their late diflrelTed captain now 
their conqueror, fubinitted to be bound alfo. And 
then it was, that having more liberty, I related 
the adventures of my whole life, which he heard 
with a ferlous and wonderful attention. After 
this I carried him’^nd his two companions into my 
little fortified caflle, fliewed them all my conve- 
niencies, and refreflied them with fuch provifions 
as I could afford. When this was over, we be- 
gan to confider about regaining the fhip : he faid, 
that there were twenty-fix hands on board, who 
Iqiowing their lives were forfgited by the law. For 
confpiracy and mutiny, were fo very hardened, 
that it woiild be dangerous for. our fmall company •

to attack therti. This was a reafonaWe: inference 
indeed; but fomcthing we muft refolve oh, and 
itnmediately' put in execution : we therefore hea- 
ved the boat npon the beach fo high, that ihe could 
not (hoot off at high water mark, and broke a 
hole in he> not eafily to be flopped ; fo that ail 
the llgnals they gave for' the boat to come on board 
\v ere j.n vain. This obliged them to lend another 
boat alhore, with ten men armed, whofe faces the 
captain plainly deferied, the boatfwain being the 
chief officer.; but he faid there were three honefl: 
lads ^mong them, who were forced . into the 'eori- 
fpiraey. Hereupon 1 gave him frelh courage, (for 
I had perceived he was in concern;) in the mean , 
>yhtle fecuring our prifoners, except two, whom 
we took to our aflillance, we thought ourfelves 
able enough to adventups a battle. When the 
fgilors landed, and beheld their boat in that con-, 
dition, they not only halooed, but fired for their 
companions to hear, yet they received no anfwer. 
This flruck theni with horror and, amazement, 
thinking their companions were murdered, they \ 
made as if they would return to the Ihip. I could 
perceive the captain’s Countenance change at this, 
till of a fudden three men were ordered to look 
after the boat, while the other feven leapt on Ihore, 
in order' to fearph for their companions : and in- 
deed they came to the brow of the hill, near my 
ancient qaflle, from whence they could fee to a 
-gpeat diflance in the woods, and there Ihouting 
and hallooing till tired and weary, they at length' 
fga ted themfel v es under a fpr eading tree- My o- 
pinion was, that nothing could be’ done till night, 
*when I mi^t ufe forae artifice to get them all out 
of the boat ; but of a fudden they flatted up, and 
made to the fea-fide ; hereupon I ordered Friday 
and the captain’s mate to go over the creek, and 
halloo as loud, as they coul<^ and fp . decoying them,

ifito the woodsj come- round to me again. And 
this indeed had a good effect ; f®r they followed 
the noife, till coming wellward to the creek, they 
called for their boat to carry the;m over, and tak- 
ing one of the men out of her, left two to look 
after her, having faftened her to the Ihimp of a 
little tree on Ihore. Hereupon . immediately the 
captain and our party pafling the creek, out of 
their fight, we furprifed them both, by the caji- 
tain’s knocking down one, and ordering the other 
to furrender upon pain of death, and who, being 
the honeftefi: of them all, fincerely joined with us# 
By this time it was pretty late } when the reft i*e- 
turning to their boat, which they found aground 
in the creek, the tide out, aiid the men gone, they 
ran about wringing their hands, crying it was art 
inchanted ifland, and that they fliould be all mur'^ 
dered by fpirits or devils. My men would willingly 
have fallen upon them, but I w-ould not agree to 
ha2ard any of ouf party. But to be more cer- 
tain, Friday and the captain crawlM upon their 
hands and feet as near as polfible;; arid when the 
boatfwain ajiproaclied in fight, fo eager was the* 
captain, that he fired, and killed him. on the fpoti 
Friday wounded the next man, arid a third ran a* 
Way. Hereupon I adtanced with ray whole army^ 
and it being dark, I ordered the men we had fur- 
prifed with the boat, to call them by their names,, 
and to parley with them. Accordingly he called 
out aloud, Tom Smith, Tom Smith? He anfwered, 
IVho^s that ? Kobinfon, anfwered the other, for 
God? s fake, 'Tom, Jurrender immediately, or you’re 
all dead men. Who mufl: we furrender to, fays 
Smith. To our captain and fifty men. here, ’who- 
have taken me pr if oner, vjounded Will Fryes, and 
killed the boatfvain. Shall we have quarters; then?" 
faid he. Hereupon the captain calls oiit. You, 
Smith, you know my voice, furrender immediaiely,

and you (hall alt have your lives granted except 
Will Atkins. Hereupon Atkins cries out, What 
have I done-^ Captain^ more th'an the rej}^ luho have 
been as had as me P but that was a lie, for he was 
the perfon .that laid hold of hiiiii, and bound him. 
However^ he was ordered to fubmit to the go- 
■verttor’s mercy, for fuch was 1 called. And fo 
laying down their arms, we bound them all, and

Will Atkins, who was ordered to prepare for 
death next morning. Hereiipon Atkins imploi'ed

gave him four men well armed; while himfelf, his 
mate, and five more, went in' the other boat. By 
midnight they came within call of the fliip, vdien 
the captain ordered Robin fon to hail her, and tell 
them, that with great difficulty they had found the

Nothing noMv remained, but to confult what Wfe

ter twerlty-eight years, two months, and nineteen 
days refidence, that fame day and month that I ef^ 
caped from Sallee, landing in England, Jolne ii 
1687, after five and thirty years abfence from* 
my own country, which- rendered me altogether 
a ftranger there. 

, Here I found my firfi: captain^s widow alive, 
who had buried a fecond hufband, but in very 
mean circumflances, and whom I made mighty ear 
fy upon my account,. Soon after I went down to 
Yorkfhire, where all ray family were expired, ex- 
cept two lifters, and as many of one of my bro^ 
ther’s children, I found no provifton had been 
made for me, they concluded I had been long fince 
dead; fo that I was but in a very^ flender ftation* 
Indeed the captain did me a great kindnefs, by his 
jreport to the owners, how I had delivered their 
lliip on the defolate iflandj upon which they made 
me a prefent of aool. Sterling.. I next went to 
Lifbon, taking my man Friday withme, and there 
arriving in April, I met the Portuguefe captain, 
who had taken me on board on the African coaft; 
but being ancient, he had left off the fea, and rer 
ligned ail his bufinefs - to his fon, who followed 
the Brazil trade. So altered both of us were, that 
we did not know each other at firft^ till I difco^ 
vered myfelf more fully to him. ' After a few em- 
braces, I began to inquire of joiy concerns f and 
then the old gentleman told me, that it was nine 
years fince he had been at Brazil:, where my part- 
ner was then living, but my truftees were* both 
dead; that he believed I Ihould have a good account 
of the prbduft of my plantation; that the imagina- 
tion of my being loft hadobliged my truftees to giyc 
an eftimate of my fhare to the procurator-fifcal,

which was given to the poor. I then defined him to teli 
me what improvement he thought had been made of 
my plantation, and whether he imagined it was 
worth my while to look after it ? He anfwercd, 
he did not know how mugh it was improved; but 
.this he was certain of, that my partner was grown 
vaftly rich upon his half of it; and that he had 
been informed, that the king had 200 moidores 
per annum for his third part. He added, that the 
furvivors of my truftees were perfons of an inge>- 
tiuous charader; that my partner could witnefs 
my title, my nanie being regiftered in the country, 
by which means I fliould indifputably recover, a 
confiderable fum of money. . But, anfwered I, how 
could my truflees*^ difpofe of my cfFeds, when I 
made you only my heir ? This he faid was true ; 
but their being no affidavit made of my death, he - 
could not a£t as my executor. However, he had 
ordered his fon (then at Bralil) to ad by procu^ 
ration upon my account, and he had taken poflef- 
lion of my fugar-houfe, having accounted himfelf 
for eight years with my partner and truftees for 
'the profits, of which he would give me a very 
good account. ' , 

And indeed this he |jerfofraed very faithfully in 
a few days, making himfelf indebted to me 470 
moidores of gold, over and above what had been 
loft: at Tea, after I had left ' the place. And then 
he recounted to me what n^sfortunes he had gone 
through, which forced my money out of his hands, 
to buy part in a new fliip: but, fays he, you Jhall 
7 iot •want, take this, and -when my fm returns, eve^ 
ry farthing Jhall be paid you. Upon which he put 
into my hand a purfe of 150 moidores in gold; as 
likewife the inftrument containing the title to the 
Ihip which his fon was in, and which he offered as 
fecurity for the remainder. But really when I -

or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 177 

England ; w)ien, as it happened, I got a young* 
Englifli gentleman, a merchant’s fon at Lifbon, to 
accompany me, together with two Englilli, and 
two Portuguefe gentlemen; fo that with a Portu- 
guefe fervant, an Englilh failor, and my man Fri- 
day, there were nine of us in number. 

Thus armed and equipped, we fet out, and 
came to Madrid, when the fummer decaying, we 
liafted to Navarre; where we were informed, that 
there was fcarcely any palling, by reafon of the pro- 
digious quantity of fnow;fovthat we were obliged to 
^bide hear twenty days at Pampeluna, and at laft to 
take a guide to condudl us fafe towards Tholoufe. 
And now twelve other gentlemen joining with us^ 
together with their fervants, we had a very jolly 
company. Away our guide led us by the fright- 
ful mountains, and through fo many intricate 
mazes and windings, that we infenfibly pafied them, 
which, as we travelled along, ulhered us inth the 
profpeft of the fruitful and charming provinces* of 
Languedoc and Gafcogne. 

But now came on two adventures, both tragi- 
cal and comical. Firft, our guide was encounter- 
ed by three wolves and a bear, who fet upon him 
and his horfe, and wounded him in three pla- , 
ces; upon which my man riding up to his aflift- 
ance, lliot one of them dead upon the fpor, which 
made the others retire to the woods But th6 
pleafanteft adventure was, to behold my man at- 
tack the bear. ’Tis fuch a creature, that if you* 
let him alone, he will never meddle with you : and 
this my man very well knew, and fo begging leave 
of me in broken Tingiilh, he told us he 'woMldmake 
good laugh. Why^ you lilly fool, faid I he’ll eat 
you up at a mouthful. Eatee me up, replied he, 
by way of fcorn, me not onty eatee him, but make 
much good laugh. Upon which, pulling off his boots^ 
he claps on his pumps, and running after the raon-

, flrous beafl, he called out, that he Wanted to dlf- 
courfe with him, and then throwing Clones on purr 
ppfe to incenfe him, the bead turns about in afury^ 
and with prodigious flrides fliuffles after him. But 
though he was not fwift enough to keep up pace 
with Friday, who made up to us as it were for 
help, yet being angry. You faid I, immediate^ 
ly take horfi^ and let us Jhool the creature. But 
he cried, Dear Majler^ no fioot^ me make y oil laugh 
much. And fo he turned about making figns to 
follow, while the bear ran after him, til! coming 
to a ^eat oak, he afcended in a minute, leaving 
his gun at the bottom of it. Nor did the bear 
make any dilficulty of it, but afcended like a cat^ 
though his weight was very great. You mud con- 
lider I was not a little amazed at the folly of my 
man, as not perceiving any thing 'to occadon our 
laughter, till fuch time as we rode up.nearer, and 
beheld the bead mounted upon the oak, on the be- 
ginning of the fame branch, to which Friday clung 
at the farther end, where the bear durd hot come. 
Hereupon Friday cried, out, Now majler^ me hiake 
much laugh^ me make de hear dance. Upon w'hich 
he fell a-fliaking the bough, which made the crea- 
ture look behind him, to. fee how he could retreat. 
Then, as if the bear had underdbod Ms dammer-

faid he, pray^ Mr Bear., come farther : and then 
indeed we all burd into laughter, efpecially whep. 
we perceived Friday drop like a fquirrel upoU the

way down the tree. Arid now thinking it the 
mod convenient time to Moot the creature, Friday 
cried out, 0 dear majler^ no Jlnot^ me JJpoot by and

he, me make once more much laugh. And accord-

looking to fee whether we were pleafed, he burll 
out into a hearty iaoghter, faying, So ive kill de.

long arrows. Thus ended oiir divcrlion, to our 
great fatisfa6lionj efpecia.lly in' a place whci'e the 
terrible bowlings lii*uck us with a continual ter- 
ror. But the Ihows now growing Very deep, par- 
ticularly on the mountains, the ravenous creatures 
wer«-obliged to feek for fuftenance in the villages, 
where, coming by furprife on the country people, 
they killed feveral of them, beiides a great num- 
ber of tlieir flieep andhorfes. 

• Our guide told Its, we had yet one more danger- 
ous place to pafs by; and if there were any more 
wolves in the country, there we Jhould find them. 
This was a fmall jjlahn encompalTed with woods, 
to get through a long lane, to the village where 
we were to lodge. When we entered the wood, 
the fun was within half an hour of fetting; and a 
little after it was- fet, we came into the plain,' 
which was not above two furlongs over, and then ' 
we perceived five great wolves crofs the road, 
without taking notice of us, and fo fwifr. as though 
th^ were purfuing after their prey. Hereupon - 
our guide believing there were more coming, de- 
fired lis to be upon odr guard. Accordingly our 
eyes were very circumfpefl:, till about half a league 
farther, we percei ved a dead fiorfe and near a dO;sen 
of wolves devouring its carcafe. lyly man Friday 
fain would have fired at them, but I would not 
permit him; nor had wd gone half over rfie plain,

be ready to give a fecond volley fhould they ad- 
vance upon us and then, every jnan Ihould make 
ufe of his piftols. But there was no necelTity for 
• this;" for the enemy being terrified, flopped at the 
hoife of the fire; four of them were fhot dead, and 
feveral others being wounded, went bleeding a-. 
Way, as we could very plainly difeover by the 
fnow. And now reraembring what had been often 
told me, that fuch was the majefty of man’s voice, 
as to ftrilce terror even into the fiercelt creatures, 
I ordered all our companions to halloo as loud as 
pofiible; and in this notion I was not altogether 
miflaken, for they immediatejy turned about upon 
the firft halloo, and began to retire; upon which 
drderinga fecond volley in their rear, they galloped 
into the woods with great precipitation. 

Thus we had fome fmall time to load our pieces 
again, and then made all the hafle we coufd on 
our w'ay; but we had not rode far, before we 
were obliged to put ourfelves in a poflure of de- 
fence as before,- being alarmed with a very dread- 
ful noife in the fame wood, on our left hand, the 
fame way as we were to pafs, only that it was at 
fome diflance from us. By this time the darkfome 
clouds began to fpread over the elements, and the 
night growing very dufley, made it fo much the 
more to our difadvantage ; but dill the noife in- 
creafing, we were fully alTured, that it was the 
howling and yelling of thofe ravenous creatures; 
when prefen tly three troops of wolves, on our 
front, appeared to our fight, as though a great 
number of theni had a defign to furround us and 
devour us in fpite of fate. But as they did not 
fall upon us immediately, we proceeded on our 
journey in as fwift a manner as the roads would 
permit our horfes, which was only a large trot. 
It was in this manner we travelled^ till-fuch time

as we difcovered another wood, and had the prof- 
pe£l: of its entrance' through which we were to 
pdfs, at the farthed (ide of the plain. But fufely 
none can exprefs the terror we were in, when, 
approaching the lahe, we perceived a cpnfufecl 
number of the fiercefl: wolves dand.ing, and as it 
were guarding its entrance. Nor were we long 
in this amazement, before another occafion of hor- 
ror prefented itfelf; for fuddenly we heard the re- 
port of a ,gun at another opening into the wood, 
and looking that way, out ran a horfe bridled and 
faddled, flying vvith the greatefl fvviftnefs, and lio 
lefs than flxteen or Seventeen wolves purfijlng af- 
ter hint, in order to devour the poor creature; 
arid unquediOn ably they did fo, after they had run 
him down, not being able' to hold out that fvift- 
-nefs with which he at fird efcapedthem. 

When we rode up to thaf entrance from whence 
the horfe came forth, there lay the carcafes of an- 
orher horfe and two men, mangled and torn by 
thele devouring wolves; and undoubtedly one of 
thefe meri was the perfon vr’ho fired the g-un whi'ch 
we had heard, for the piece lay by him; but alas! . 
mod of the uppei‘ part of his body and his head 
"were entombed in the bowels of thefe ravenous 
'Creatures. , 

What courfe to take, whether to proceed or re- 
treat, we could not tell ; but it was not long be- 
fore the wolves themfelves made us come to a re* 
foiutiont for fuch numbers fur rounded us, every 
one of whom expe£lcd their prey, diat, were our 
bodies to be divided among them, there would not 
be. half a mouthful a-piece. But happy, very hap- 
py it was for us that but a little way from the en- 
trance, there lay loine very , large timber trees, 
which i fuppofed had been cut down and laid there 
for fale; amorigd which I drew iny little troop, 
placing ourfdves ih-axiine behind 'one long tree, 

^ "^S^hich

which ferved us for a breaft-work, when defiring 
them to alight, we flood in a triangle, or three 
fronts, inciofing our horfes in, the centre, the on- 
ly place where we could preferve them. 

Never certainly was there a more furious charge 
than what the wolves made upon us in this place; 
and the fight of the horfes, which was the princi- 
pal thing they aimed at, provoked their hunger, 
and added to their natural fiercenefs. They came 
on us with a dreadful noife, that made the woods 
to ring again; and beginning to mount the pieces 
of timber, I ordered every other man to fire as be- 
fore direfted, and indeed fo well did they take tlieix* 
aim, that they killed ’feveral of the wolves at the 
hrfl volley; but ftill we were obliged to keep a con- 
tinual firing, by reafon they came on like devils, 
juifliing one another with the greatefl fury. But 
our fecond volley fomething abated their courage, 
when flopping a little, we hoped they would have 
made the befl of their way; however^ it did not 
prove fo, for others made a new attempt upon us: 
and though in four firings we killed feventeen or 
. eighteen of them, laming twice as many, yet they 
feveral times fucccflively came on, as though they 
valued not their lives for the fake of their prey. 

Unwillijigly was I to fpend our laflfhot too fud- 
denly, and therefore called my other fervant, and 
giving him a horn of powder, bid him lay a large 
train <]uite along the timber, which he did, while 
Friday was charging my fufee and his own, with 
the greatefl dexterity. By thisrtime the wolves 
coming up the timber, I let fire to the train, by 
fnapping a difcharged piflol clofe on the powder. 
This fo fcorched and terrified them, that fome fell 
down, arid others jumpecfin among us; but thefe 
we immediately difpatched, when all the refl frigh- 
ted with' the light, which thedarkforae night cau- 
fed to appear more dreadful, began at length to re-

tire; upon which, ordering our lafl piflols to be 
• fired at once^ giving at the fame time, a great 
fliout, the wolves were obli2;ed to have recourfe 
to their fwiftnefs, and turn tail; and then we Tal- 
lied out upon twenty lame ones, cutting them in 
. pieces with our fwords, which obliged them* to 
howl lamentably, to the terror of their fellows, 
whorefigned to us the field as victorious conquer- 
ors. And indeed I queftion whether Alexander 
king oi 'Macedonia^ in any of his conquefls, had 
more occafion for triumph than we had; for he was 
but attacked by numerous armies of foldiers; 
whereas our little arm)' was obliged to combat a 
legion of devils, as it were, worfe than the canni- 
basl, who, the famemoment, had they flain us would 
have facrificed us, to fatisfy their voracious appe- 
tites. • 

Thus ended our bloody battle with the beafls, ha- 
ving killed threefcore of them, and faved our lives 
from theirfury. We ftill had a league farther togo, 
when, as we went, ours ears were falutde with their 
mofV unwelcome bowlings, and we expeCted every 
moment another attack. But in an h'our^s time 
we arrived at the town where we were to lodge; 
and here we found the place ftriCHy guarded, and 
all in terrible confufton, as well they might, for 
fear of the bears and wolves breaking into the 
.village, in order to prey upon their cattle and 
people; The next morning we were obliged to 
take a new guide, by reafon the other fell very 
bad of bis wounds, which he had received, as be- 
fore mentioned. After he bad reached Thouloufe^ 
we came into a warpi, pleafant, and fruitful coun- 
try, not infefled with wolves, or any fort of ra- , 
venous creatures : and when we told our flory 
there, they much blamed our guide, for tonduding 
us through the forefl at the foot of the mountains^

Ave informed them in what mariner we placed otir- 
lelves, and the horfes in the centre, they exceed- 
ingly reprehended us, and told us, it was an hun- 
dred to one, but we had all been deftroyed; for 
that it was the very, fight of the horfes^ their lo 
much defired prey, thar'made tlie wolves more 
xagingly furious than they would have been, which 
v/as eviilent, by . tlieir being at other times really 
afraid of a gu'n ; but then being exceeding hungry 
and furious, upon that accpupt, their eagernefa ta 
come at .the horfes made thiein tnfepfible of their 
danger; and that if we, had. not by a continual 
fire, and at lafl by the cunning ftratagem of tfie 
train of powder, got the .better of them, it ha|d 
been great odds if their number had nOt over- 
powered us ; befides, itwas a great mercy we alight-

courage and conduft, W'hich, had we failed to do, 
every man of us, with our. beafis, had beeii de-

apoflatize from the orthodox faith, or live in con- 
tinual fear of the inquifition. Upon this account 
I refolved to fell my plantation ; and for that in- 
tent I wrote to my old friend at Lifbon, who re- 
turned me an anfwer to my great fatisfadion; 
\vhich was, that he could fell it to good account j 
however, ,if I thought it convenient to give hint 
"liberty to offer it in my name to the two merchants, 
the furvivnrs of my truflees, refiding at the Bra*- 
fils, who confequently underflood its intrinfic va- 
lue,- having lived juft upon the fpot, and who I 
was fenfible were very rich, and therefore might' 
be the more willing to purchafe it ; he did not in 
the leafl doubt, but that I fhould make four or 
five thoufand pieces of eight more of it, than I 
could do, if I difpofed of it in any other manner 
whatfoever. • 

You may Be fure T cnuld iiotbut agree with tin’s 
kind . and rngenidus propofal ; and immediately I 
fent him an order to offer it to them, which he ac- 
cordingly did j fo that, about eight months after, 
the flfip being in that time returned, he gave me a 
fatisfadory account, that they not only willingly 
accepted the offer, but that they had alfo remitted 
33,000 pieces of eight to a correfpondent of their 
own at Lifbon, in order to pay for the purchafe. 

Hereupon in return I figned the inflrument of 
fale according to form, which they^ had fent from 
Lifbon, and returned it again to my old friend, 
he having fent me for my eflate, bills of three

hundred twenty- eight thoufand pieces of eight, re^- 
ferving the payment of one hundred jnoidores per 
annum, which I had allowed him daring life, like- 
wife fifty to his fon during his life alfo, according 
to my faithful promife, which the plantation wa& 
to make good as a rent- charge. 

And thus having led my reader to the know- 
ledge of the firfl part of my life, fo remarkable 
for the many peculiar providences that attended 
it, floating in an ocean of uncertainty and difap- 
pointnient, of adverfity and profperity, beginning 
fopliflily, and yet ended happily, methinks now that 
I am come to a fafe and pleal’ant haven, it is time 
to cafi: out my anchdr, and laying up my veflel, 
bid for a while adieu to foreign adventures. I 
had no other concerns to look after, but the carp 
of my brother’s two fons, which, with the good 
widow’s perfuafions, obliged me to continue at 
home feven years. One of thefe children I bred 
up a gentleman, and the other an experienced 
failor,^ remarkable for his courage and bravery. 
Befidei^ this, 1 married a virtuous young gentle- 
woman, of a wery good family, by whom I had 
two fons and one daughter. But my dear, and ten- 
der wife leaving this earthly flage, (as in the fe- 
cond part of my life you will hear,) which rent 
my foul as it were afunder, my native country 
became weary and tiresome to me: and my ne- 
phew happening to come from the fea, tempted 
me to venture another voyage to the Eaft Indies, 
•winch I did in the year 1694, at which time I Vi- 
fjted ray ifland, and informed myfelf of every thing 
that happened fince my departure^ 

. One might reafonably iinagme, that what I had 
fnffered, together with aii advanced age, and the 
fear of lofing, not only what I had gotten, but my 
life alfo, might have choked' up all the feeds of 
youthful ambition and curiofity, and put a lafting

many times over the temper of the mind, it will 
be no fuch great wonder to t'hink, that my power-

tinually in my thoughts all the day, and I dreanr- 
ed of it in the night ; nay, I made it the continual 
.. fubjedi of my talk, even to impertinence,^ w%en I 
was awake. I had fuch vapours in my head, that 
I adually fuppofed myfelf at my caftle ; that I not

niard, and the wicked failors, but that I talked and 
difeourfed with theiii abbut their manner of 'li-

that is all that I defire. Such, endearing tepder- 
nefs, graced with the mDft innocent, and yet moil 
powerful charms,, brought me infepGbly dnto my 
right underflanding and when I confidered all 
the tranfadlions of nay life,, and particularly piy 
new engagement ; that I. had now one child alrea- 
dy born, and my wife big of another ; and that ! 
had no occafion to, feek for nipre riches, , 'who alf

flruggling I altered my, refolutions at laft, refol- 
ving to apply mylelf to fonie bufiners or other, 
which might put a period to fuch wandering incU-,

copnty ||f Bedford, with a refolution to move thi- 
ther; upon this there was a prptty conveniept 
houfe, lurrounded with land, very capable of ,iin- 
,provement, which fuited my temper as to plant-

before I entered upon my new fettlement, having 
bought plopghs, hartows, cartSj waggons, hbrfe?, 
cows, anddheep ; fo that I now led the life of a 
country -gentleman, and as happy in my retire- 
ment as the greateft mopaych in the wotld. And 
what made me think my happinefs the greater was, 
that I was in that middle ftate of life., which toy

the felicity of a, rural retirement, which is ele- 
gantly deferihed, by the poet in thefe lines ;

to the iiTefiftible power of death, leaving this 
tranfitory life fora better. It is impoflible for 
me to hxprefs the beauties of her mind, or the 
loveiinefs of her perfon ; neither can I too much 
lament her lofs, which- ray lateft breath fhall re- 
cord : her influence was gi^eater over me than 
the powers of my own reafon, the importuni- 
ties of friends, the inrtrudions of a father, or the 
melting teai^s of a tender and difconfolate mother : 
in a word, Ihe was the Ipirit of all ray affairs, and 
“the centre of ray enterprifes. But now, fmce the 
cruel hand of death had clofed my dearefl’s eyes, . 
1 feemed in my thoughts a flranger to' the world j 
my privy counfellor being gone, I was like a /hip 
without a pilot, that could only run before the 
wind. And when I looked around me in*his bufy 
world, one part labouring for bread, and the other 
fquandering away their e/lates, this put me in 
'mind how ! had lived in iny little kingdom, where 
both reafon and- religion didated to me, that there 
was fdmething that certainly was the reafon and 
end of life, which was far fuperior to what could 
be hoped far on this fide the grave. My couii- 
try delights were now as infipid and dull, as mu- 
iic or fcience to thofe who have neither tafie nor 
ingenuity.. In fliort, refolving to leave off houfc- 
keeping, I left my farm, and in a few months re- 
turned to London. 

But neither cou|d that great city, fo famous for 
its variety of entertainment, afford me any agree- 
able delight ; a fiate of idlenefs I found to be the 
very dregs of life, and mod: hurtful to body and 
foul. It was now the beginning of the year 1694, 
at \yhich time my nephew (who, as I before ob- 
ferved,.had been brought up to the Tea, and ad- 
vanced to be captain of a ffiip) was returned from 
a fliort voyage to Bilboa, the fir/ 1 : he had made in 
that /iation. He comes .to me one morning, tel-

ling me, that Tome merchants of his acquaintance 
had propofed to him to go a voyage for them,' to 
the Eaft Indies and China, in the manner of pri- 
vate. traders : and now, tincle^ faid he, if you’ll 
accompany me thither^ Vll engage to land you upon 
your old ijland^ to vijlt the fate of your little king- 
dom. 

Jufl before he came in, my thoughts were fixed 
to get a patent for its poirdlion, . and then to fill 
it with inhabitants. After 1 had paufed a little' 
while, and looked fledfaflly on him, What devil., 
orfpirit, faid \.,fent you ■with this unlucky errand F 
He ftarted at fir ft, but recovering himfelf, when 
he perceived I was not offended. Sir, replied he, 
what I have propofed cannot, I hope, be ftyled 
unlucky, ftnce certainly you muft be defirous to 
fee your little territory, where you reigned, with 
more content than any of your brother-kings in 
the univerfe. Nephew, faid I, if you will leave 
me there, and call for me as you come back, I 
cave not if I give my confent ; but he anfwered, 
that the merchants would not allow their veffel, 
loaden with an, infinite value, to return there again, 
which was a month’s fail out of the way : beiides. 
Sir, faid he, if I fhould mifearry, was your re- 
queft granted, why then you would be locked up 
as before. This indeed carried a great deal of 
reafon in it, but we found out a remedy, and that 
was, to carry a framed floop on board, ready to 
be fet up in the ifland, by the affiftance of fome 
carpenters, which we fiiould carry with us, that 
might be fitted in a few days to go to fea. I was 
not long in forming my refolution, which over- 
fwayed my good friend the widow’s perfuafions, 
and the natural alfeftion I bore to my young chil- 
dren. I made my will, and fettled my eftate in 
fuch a manner, that I was perfeftly fure that my 
poor infants would have juftice done them. The 

' good

good widow not only undertook to make provlfion 
for my voyage, but alfo took the charge of my 
domeftic affairs, and to provide for my children’s 
education f and indeed no mother could take more 
care, or underilood that office better ; for which 
I lived to reward, and return her my hearty thanks. 

The beginning of January 1694-5, -my nephew 
being ready to fail, I and Friday went on board 
in the Downs on the 8th, having, beliie that floop 
already mentioned, a very confiderable cargo for 
my new colony. l had fome fervants, whom 

I propofed to leave there, as inhabitants, or to 
Work while I llaid there, as they fliould appear 
willing : there were two carpenters, a fmith, and 
a very ingenious fellow who was Jack of ^If trades; 
for he was not oply a cooper by trade, but alfo 
he Was dexterous at making wheels and hand mills 
-to grind corn, likewife a good turner, and a good 
pot-maker. I alfo carried a taylor, who confent- 
ed to rtay in my plantation, and prpved a mofl ne- 
ceffary fellow in the ifland. As to my cargo, it 
cdnlifted of a fufficient quantity of linen, and 
Eftglifi] fluffs, for cloathing the Spaniards that t 
eXpeded to find there; as likewile gloves, hats, 
fiioes, {lockings ; together with beds, bedding, and 
houfehold ftulf, efpecially kitchen uteniils, with 
pots, kettles, pCwter, brafs, &c. alfo nails, tools 
of all forts, ftaples, hooks, hinges, arid all other 
things neceffary ; all which, I think, coft me about 
three hundred pounds. Nor was this all; fori 
carried an hundred fpare-arms, mufkets and fufees, 
befides fome piftols, a confiderable quantity of 
feveral forts of fiiot, -two brafs cannon, befides 
fwords, cutlafles, and the iron part for fome pikes 
and halberts. I made my nephew take with us 
two fmali quarter deck guns, riiore than' he had 
occafion for in his fhip, to leave behind, if there 
was a neceflityj that fo we might build a fort

there, and man it againfl all oppofers whatfoever. 
Well, we pot -oiit to fea; and though I can’t 
lay this voyage was fo unprofperous as my others 
had been, yet contrary winds drove us fo far 
northward, that we were obliged to put in at 
Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound two 
and twenty days. Here indeed, our provifions 
were very cheap, and we added to our Ihip’sllores, 
by taking in feveral live hogs, two cows and calves, 
which I thenrefolved to put on fliore in my ifland, 
if Our necelfities did not call for them. On the 
^th of February we failed from Ireland, with a 
very fair gale, which laded for fome days ; and I 
think it was about the 20ch of the fame month, 
late in the evening, when the mate informed us, 
that he faw a flafli of fire, and heard a gun fired ; 
and when he was fpeaking, a boy came in, and told 
us, that the bcatfwain had heard another. Upon 
which we all ran to the quarter deck, from whence 
in a few moments we perceived a terrible fire at 
a didance. We had immediately recourfe to our 
reckonings, in which we were all of opinion, that 
there could be no land that way, it appearing to 
be at N. N. W. Hereupon we concluded that 
fome ftnp had taken fire at fe^, and that it could 
not be 'far off, by the report of the guns w'hich 
we had heard. We made up diredly to it, and 
in half an hour’s time, the wind being fair, we 
could plainly perceive a great fhip on fire in the 
middle of the fea. Touched with this unhappy 
difader, and confidering my former circumdances, 
when the Portuguefe captain took me up, I imme- 
diately ordered five guns to be fired, that the poor 
creatures, not feeing us, it being dark, (though 
we could perceive their flame,) might be fendble 
there was deliverance at hand, and confequently 
might endeavour to dve themfelves in their boat,

arid the fire \vas extinguifhcd in the ocean. 
But fuppofirig them all to be in their boats, we 
hung out our lanterns, and kept firing till eight 
o’clock in the morning ; when, with our perfpec- 
tives, we beheld two boats, full of people, makirig 
towards us, though the tide ^yas againfl them ; 
then fpreading out our ancient, and hanging out 
q. waft, as a fignal for them to come on board, in 
half an hour’s time, we came up to them, and took 
them all in, there being no lefs than fixty-four 
men, women and children. It was a French mer- 
chant fliip of 300 tons, homeward bound from 
Qiiebeqk in the river of Canada. The mafler in- 
formed me how, by the negligence of the fleerf- 
man, the. fteerage was fet on hre ; that, at his 
outcry fop help, the fire was, as they thought, to- 
tally extinguiflied ; but that fome fparks getting: 
between the timber, and within the ceiling, it 
proceeded into the,hold, where there was no re- 
lifting it ; that then they got into their boats, as 
creatures in the laft extremity, with what provi- 
lion they had, together with oars, fails, and a 
compafs. Intending to go back to Newfoundland, 
the wind blowing at S. E. and by E. though there 
were feveral chances again!! them, as ftorms to 
overfet and. founder them, rains and colds, to 
benumb aud perilh their limbs, and contrary winds 
to keep, them, back and ftarve them : bitt, faid he, 
in this our great diftrefs, we heard the welcome 
report of your guns, when, with unfpeakable 
j03S taking, down our mails and fails, we were 
refolved to lye by till morning; but perceiving 
your light, we. fet our oars at work to keep our 
boat a-head, the fooner to attain your ihip, the 
happy inftrument qf our deliverance.

that of other nations. Some v/ere weeping, tear-

if 1 afn not miflaken, our furgebn was obliged to 
Jet thirty of them blood. But among the paflen- 
gers, there were two priells, the one an old, and 
the other a young man; but what amazed me 
more, Was, that the oldefl; was iri the worfl: plight ; 
for no fooner did he perceive himfelf freed from 
da gery but be dropt down, is it were without 
life, and, to every one’s appearance, - quite dead'; 
but the furgeon, chaffing and rubbing his arm, open- 
ed a vein^ which at firll dropped, and then flow- 
ing more freely, the old man began to open his 
eyes, and in a quarter of an hour was well again.

about three minutes after, with great ferioufnefs 
and affection, while the tears flood in his eyes, 
which convinced me of the gratitude of his foul. 
Nor did he lefs ffiew his piety and wifdom, in ap- 
plying himfelf to his country people, and labour- 
ing to coropofe them, by tbe molt powerful rea- 
fons, arguments, and perfuafions. And when, in- 
deed, thofe people had taken their night’s repofe, 
in fudi lodgings as our Ihip would allow, we found 
nothing but the befl of manners, and the mofl: ci- 
vil acknowledgments, for which' the French are 
eminently remarkable. The neiit day the captain, 
and one of the priells, delired to fpeak with me, 
and my nephew, the commander. They told us, 
that they had faved feme money, and valuable 
things out of the ruined veflel, which was at our 
fervice; only that they delired to be fet on fliore 
fome where in our way. At the firft my nephew 
was for accepting the money ; but I (who knew 
how hard my cafe would have been, had the For- 
tuguefe captain ferved me fo) peyfuaded him to 
the contrary ; and therefore told them, that as we 
had done nothing but what we were obliged to do, 
by nature and humanity, and what we ourfelves 
might expeS from others in fuch calamity ; fo we 
took them up to fave them, not to plunder them,, 
or leave them naked upon the land, to perifii for 
WMnt of fubfillence, and therefore would not ac- 
cept their money r but as landing them, that w'as 
a great difficulty for, being bound to the Eall 
Indies, it was impoflible wilfully to change our 
voyage upon their particular account, nor could 
jny nephew (who was under charter-party to pur- 
fue* it by way of Bralil): anfwer it to the freighters. 
All that we could do, was to put ourfelves in the

hurricane happened) had before informed me that 
there were fuch perfons on-board, whom he fup- 
pofed to be dead, being afraid to inquire after 
them, becaufe he had nothing to give them for 
relief. Hereupon we refolved to let them have 
what we could fpare, ordering the mate to bring 
fome of his men on board us, which he did accord- 
ingly; as he and they looked.like Ikeletons, when 
meat was fet before them, I ordered them to eat 
fparingly. But, however they foon fell fick 
which obliged the furgeon to mix fometbing in their 
broth, which was to be to them, both food and 
phyljc. When they were fed, we ordered oiir 
mate to carry them a fack of bread, and four or 
five pieces of beef ; but the furgeon charged thent 
to fee it boiled, and to keep a guard on the cook- 
roctm, to prevent the men from eating it raw, and ^ 
confequently killing themfelves with what was de- 
ligned for their relief. But particularly I deflred 
the mate to fee what condition the poor palTengers

were in^ and the furge'^n gave him a pitcher of the 
fame broth which he had prepared for the men. 
And being curious to fee this fcene of mifery my- 
felf, I took the captain (as we called thg mate of 
the fliip) in our own boat, and failed after them. 

Here was a fad fight indeed ! fcarce were the 
viftuals half boiled in the pot, but they were rea- 
dy to break open the cook-room door. To ftay 
their ftomachs, the mate gave them bifcuits, which 
were dipped in, and foftened with the liquor of 
the meat, which they czW Breuife\ telling them, 
it was for their pwn fafety, that he was obliged 
to give them but a little at a time j and fo feeding 
them gradually, their bellies were comfortably 
filled, and the men did very well again. But when 
they came to the poor gentlewoman in the cabin,, 
who for feveral days had continued without footl^ 
giving what fhe had to her fon, they found her as 
it were in the arms of death. She was fitting up- 
on the floor of the deck, with her back up againfl 
the fides, between two chairs, which were laflied^ 
faff, and her head flirunk between her flioulders, 
like a fenfelefs corpfe - Nothing was wanting in 
my mate to revive and encourage her ; opening 
her lips, and putting fome broth into her mouth 
with a fpoon. But not having flrength to fpeak, 
fhe lifted up her head with much difficulty,, inti- 
mating that it was now too late ! at the fame time 
pointing to the youth her fon, as though fhe defi- 
red him to do what he could to fave the lad; and 
in a little after ftie died. 

The youth indeed was not fo far gone, yet lay 
flretched out in a cabin bed, like one that had 
-fcarce any life. In his mouth was a piece of an 
old glove, the reft of which he had ate up. At 
firft he vomited what the mate had given him ; but 
at length began fenfibly to revive, though in the

hogflieads of fugar ; but the youth having a bill of 
lading, I made the commander oblige himfelf to 
deliver a letter and the deceafed widow’s goods to 
Mr. Rogers, a merchant in Briftol ; but 1 believe 
the ftiip was loll at fea, for we could never hear 
what became of her afterwards. We were now 
in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. having as yet a 
tolerable good voyage. But, palTing by feveral 
little incidents relating to wind and weather, I 
ihall relate what is more remarkable concerning 
my little kingdom, to which I was then drawing 
near. I had great difficulty in finding it ; fcJf as 
I came to, and went from it before, on the fouth 
and eafl lide of the ifland, as coming from the 
.Brafilsj fo now approaching between the main 
and the ifland, not having any chart for the coaft, 
nor land-mark, it obliged us tol go on fliorc 
on feveral iflands in the mouth of the river O- 
roonoko, but to no purpofe. This I percei- 
ved, that what I thought was a continent before, 
Was no fuch thing, but a long ifland, • or rather a 
ridge of fands. On one of thefe iflands I found 
fome Spaniards, but they belonged tjo the ifle de 
Trinidad, who came hither in a floop to make fait, 
and to try to find fome pearl mufles. But at 
length I. came fair on the fouth flde of my ifland, 
and then I prefently knew the countenance of my 
little kingdom, fo we brought the Ihip fafe to an 
anchor, broadflde within the little creek, where 
Rood my ancient and venerable caflle. 

No fooner did I fee the place, but calling for 
Friday, I affied him where he was ? But when he 
looked a little, he clapped his hands, crying, 0

When the Englifh ancient was fpread^ and three 
gu'fts fired as a fignal of friendfhip^ we perceived 
a fm'oke rife from the creek ; upon which I order-

not forbear laughter to fee his behaviour, for h® 
\yould walk fever, al" hovirs with his father along

was a lady 5 while, every now and then he would 
nun to the boat, to get foinething fqr him, as a 
lump of.fugar, dram, bifcuit, or fomething or o-

i'riday on the ground, he would dancq round h'm, 
making cOmical poftures and 'geflures apd all this 
Avhile would be telling him one fiory or other of 
his travels and adventures. 

It was on the lOth of April, 1695, that I 

, fet my foot upon the ifland a fecond lime. When 
my faithful Spaniard^ accompanied by one more, 
approached the boat, he little knew who I was,, 
till I difcovered myfelf to him; Signior, <aid I, 
in Portuguefe, don’t you know me he fpoke ne-

then b^eckoned to the man to call out h'.s compa- 
nions, alking me, if 1 would walk to my own ha- 
bitation, and take poflelhon, where I iliould find 
fome mean improvements : but indeed they were 
extraordinary ones? for they had planted fo ma- 
ny trees fo. cl ofe together, that the place was like 
a labyrinth, -which none could find out, except 
themfelvcs, w’ho knew its intricate windings, I, 
alked him the meaning of all thefe fortifications ;

he told me he would give me a large account of 
what had pafled fince my departure to this time, 
and how he had fubdued fome Engllfli, who thought 
to be their murderers, hoping I would ilot be dif- 
pleafed, lince neceflity compelled them to it. As 
I knew they were wicked villains, fo I told him, 
that I was not only far from finding fault with it, 
but was rather heartily glad that they had fubdu- 
ed them. While we were thus talking, the man 
whom he had fent returned, accompanied by ele- 
ven more, but in fuch habits, that it was impof- 
fible to tell what nations they were of. He firll 
turned to me, and pointing to them ; Thefe, Sir, 
faid he, are fome of the gentlemen who owe their 
lives to your goodnefs ; then turning-to them, and 
pointing to me, he made thetn fcnfible who I was: 
and then indeed they faluted me one by one; not 
as ordinary men, but as though they bad been 
ambafladors or noblemen, and I a triumphant con- 
queror ; for their behaviour not only agreed with 
a manlike, majeflic gravity, but at the fame time 
was To obliging and courteous, as made them ad- 
mirable to the lall: degree. 

Before I relate the hiflory of the tranfadions 
of my kingdom, as Thad it from the Spaniard’s 
own mouth, I muft here infert what I omitted in 
my former relation. The matter is this : Jufl: be- 
fore we weighed anchor to fet fail, there happen- 
ed a quarrel on board the fliip, which had like to 
have occalloned a fecond mutiny, till fuch time as 
the courageous captain taking two of the mofl re- 
fraftory prifoners, laid them in irons, threatening, 
as they were concerned in the former diforders, 
to have them hanged in England for running a- 
way with the fiiip. This frightened fome of the 
reft, as thinking the captain would ferve them in 
the fame manner, though he feemed to give them 
good words for the prelent. But the mate having

intelligence 6f this, rtiade ine acquainted with their 
fears’; To tHat, to make them more eafy, and oui*- 
lelves more fate froin thfeir confpiracies, I was o- 
bliged to go dbv/n, arid pafs niy honour’s word 
for it, that, upon their good behavioiTr-, all that 
was pait,fliouldbe|5ardoned'; inteflirnoriy of which 
I ordered thC two riieh’s irons to be taken off, and 
theirifelves forgiven. But as this had brought iis 
to an anchor that night, in which there was a 
calrri, the t»,v6 irieri that had been m irons, flole 
each of them a mrilket, and foirie other weapons, 
and taking the hiip’s pinnace, not yet haled up, 
fan away to their brother rogues. The next 
mofning we fent the lopg-bpat, with men to pur- 
fue them; but all in vain; the mate, hi revenge, 
would have demolilhed iriy little caftle, burnt its 
furniture, and deflroyed their plantatioris ; but 
having no orders for it, he did not put it in exe- 
cution. Arid thus there were five Englifhmdn in 
the iOarid, which caufed great differerices, as my 
faithful Spaniard gave me a perfect account of, in 
the following inanrief ; 

. You cannot, Sir, but reriiember the embaffy you 
fent me about, and what a difappoiritinent we met 
with, by your abfence, at our return. There is 
but little variety in the relation of our voyage, 
being blelTed with calm weather, and a fmooth fea.'^ 
Great indeed w'as the joy of my countrymen, to 
fee me alive, having acted as the principal man 
onboard, the captain of the fliip wrecked veffel 
dying before ; nor was their furprife lei's, as know- 
ing I was taken priforier by the favages of ano- 
ther riatTori, they thought me long fince entomhed 
in their moriftfbus bowels. But when I fhewed 
them the arms, amriiunition, and provilions 1 had 
brought for them, they looked upon me as a fe- 
■ebrid Joftph advanced in Phaf oah’s court, and im- 
diyiately prepared to come along with me. In-

deed. they wereobliged to trefpafs upon their friend- 
ly favages by borrowing two of their canoes, un- 
der a pretext for filhing: and they came away 
the next morning, but without any provifions of 
their own^ except a few roots, which ferved them 
inftead of bread. After three weeks abfence, we 
arrived at your habitation. Here we met with 
three Englifli failors, who, I confefs, gave us prq- 
vifions, and that letter of direftion you had left 
for us, which informed us how to bring up tame 
goats, plant corn, cure grapes, make pots ; and 
in Ihort, every thing that was neceflary for our 
ufe ; as, in particular, 1 knew your method befl:, 
fo talcing Friday’s father to affifl me, we managed 
all the affairs ; nor were the reft of the Spaniards 
wanting in their kind offices, dreffing food for the 
Englifhmen, who did nothing but ramble and di- 
vert therafelves in the woods, either fhooting par-- 
rots, or catching tortoifes. But we had not been 
long afliore, before we were informed of two more 
Englifhmen, unnaturally turned out of their com- 
mon place of refidence by the three others above 
mentioned; this made my Spaniards and me (whom' 
they now looked upon as their governor in your, 
abfence) endeavour to perfuade them to take them 
in, that we might be as one family ; but all our 
intreaties were in vain, fo that the poor fellows, 
finding nothing to be done without induftry, pitch- 
ed there tents on the north fide of the ifland, a 
little inclining to the well, for fear of favages. 
Here they, built riVO huts, one to lodge, and the' 
other to lay their flores in; for my good hatured 
Spaniards giving them fome feeds, they dtig and 
planted as 1 had done, and began to live prettily. 
But while they were thus comfortably going on, 
thq three unnatural brutes, their countrymen, in 
a mere bullying humour, irifulted them, by fay- 
ing, the governor (meaning you) had given them

me now diftinguifh them) thought their three 
countrymen only jelled, and one of them invited 
them in, to fee their fine habitations j while the , 
other facetioufly told them, that fince they built 
tenements, with great improvements, they Ihbuld,- 
according to the cuflom of landlords, give them a 
longer leafe; at the fame time defiring them ta 
fetch a fcriyener to draw the- writings. One of 
the Wretches fwearing he Ihould pay for the jefl, 
fnatches up a firebrand, and clapping it to the 
outlide of their hut, very fairly fet it on fire, 
which would foon have confumed it, had not the 
honell man thrufl: him away, and trod it out with 
with his feet.' Hereupon the fellow returns with 
a pole, with which he would have ended his days, 
had not the poor man avoided the blow; when 
fetching his mulket, he knocked down the villain 
that began the quarrel. The other two coming 
to affill their fellow^ obliged the hpnefl; man to 
take his mulket alfo, and both of them prefenting 
their pieces, bid the villains Hand clF ; and if they 
did not lay down their arras, death Ihould decide the 
difpute oneway or other. This brought them to a 
parley, in which they agreed to take their wound- 
ed man and be"gone; but they were in the wrong 
that they did not difarm them when they had the 
power-, and then make their complaint to me and 
my Spaniards for jullice, which might have pre-* 
vented their farther defigns againft them. And 
indeed fo many trefpalTes did they afterwards com- 
'mit, by treading, down their corn, fliooting their 
young kids and goats, and plaguing them night and

ruined them of every thing they had. Had thefe 
people met together, no doubt but there would 
have been a bloody battle ; but Providence order- 
ed it for the better; for jufl as the three were- 
got thither, the two were at our caflle; and when 
they left us, the three came back again, but in a 
great rage, fcoffingly telling us what they had 
done; when one taking hold of a Spaniard's hat, 
twirls it round, faying, Seignior^ 

Spaniard, Jhall have the fame fauce^ if you don't

courageous man, knocked him down with one 
blow of his fifl ; at which another villain fired his 
- piflol, and narrowly miffed his body, but wound-

Spaniard takes up the fellow’s muffet whom he 
had knocked down, and would have fliot him, if I 
and the reft had not come out, and taken their arms 
from every one of them. 

Thefe EngUflimen perceiving they had made all 
of us tlieir enemies, began to cool; but notwith- 
flanding their better words, the Spaniards would 
not return them their arms again, telling them, 
they would do them no manner of harm, if they, 
would live peaceably ; but if they -offered any in- 
jury to the plantation or caflle, they would fliooc 
them as they would do ravenous bealls. This 
made them fo mad, that they went away raging

they were two parties of two different nations,:, 
who lately having a bloody battle with one ano- 
ther, happened to land by mere chance in the fame 
ifland, to devour their miferable prifoners t that 
they were entirely ignorant of any perfon’s inha- 
bitin'jg here ; but rather being filled with rage and 
fury againfl: one another, he believed, that as foon 
as day-light appeared, there would be a terrible 
engagement. Old Friday had fcarce ended his re- 
lation when we heard an uncommon noife, and 
perceived that there was a horrid engagement be- 
tween the two armies. 

Such was the curiofity of our party, efpecially 
the Engliflimen, that they would not lye clofe,' 
though Old Friday told them their fafety depend- 
ed upon it"; and that if we had patience, we fhould 
beholds the favages kill one another. However, 
they ufed fome caution, by going further into the 
woods, and placing themfelves in a convenient 
place to behold the battle. ' 

Never could there be a more bloody engage- 
ment,- nor men of more invincible fpirits, and pru- 
dent condud, according to their way and manner 
of fighting. It lafted near two hours, till that 
party which was neareft to our caflle began to de- 
cline, and at lafl to fly from their conquerors. 
We were undoubtedly put into a great conflerna- 
tion on this account, left they fhould run into our 
grove, and confequently bring us into the like 
danger. Hereupon we refolved to kill the firft 
that came, to prevent difcover)r; and; that too 
with our fwords, and the butt end of our muf- 
kets, fpr fear the report of our guns fhould be 
heard. ' 

And fo indeed) as we thought, it happened:

them to be (lain, but h^d them fu.rprifed and ta-

very gppd fervapts to us, being ftout young crea-

reinainder of the conquered favages fled to their- 
panoes, and put put into the pcean, while the con-, 
querors joining together, Ihouted by way of trir 
umph, and about three in the afternoon they alfo 
embarked for their own nation. Thus we wero^ 
freed at once from the favages and our fears, not * 
perceiving any of thefe > creatures for fpme confi- 
c|era,ble time -after. We found two and thirty mepi 
dead in the field of hat tie , fome were.h?w, withj

ai4 LIFE and adventures 

was, whether, as we perceived the favages haunt- 
ed that fide of the ifland, and there being more 
retired parts of it, and yet as well fuited to our 
manner of living, and equally to our advantage, 
we ought not rather to mdve our place of refidence, 
and plant it in a much fafer place, both for the 
feCurity of our corn and cattle. 

After a long debate on this head, it was refol- 
ved, or rather Voted nemtne contfadicente^ not to 
remove our ancient caftle, and that for this very 
good reafon, that-fOme time or other w’e expeded 
to hear from our fupreme governor (meaning you 
Sir,) whofe meffengers not finding us there, might 
think the place demolilhed, aud all his fubjefts de- 
Ilroyed by the favages. 

As to the next concern relating to our corri 
and cattle, we cbnfented to have them removed 
to the valley where the cave was, that being moft 
proper and fufiicient for both. But yet, when we 
confidered further^ we altered one part of our re- 
folution; wWch was, to remove part of our cattle 
hither, and plant only part of our coiui there : fo 
that in cafe one part was defltbyed,' the other 
might be preferved. Another refolution we took, 
which really had a great deal of prudence in it ; 
and that was, in not trufling the three favages 
Whom we had taken prifoners, with any know- 
ledge of the plantations which we had made in the 
valley, of what number of cattle we had there, 
much lefs of the cave, wherein We kept feveral 
arms, arid two barrels of powder you left for us, 
at yoUr- departure from this ifland. But though 
we would not change oUr habitation, we refolved 
to make it more fortified and more fecret. To 
thiirend, Sir, as you had planted trees at fome di- 
Rance before the entrance of your palace ; fo we, 
imitating your example, planted and filled Up the 
whole fpace of'grouiid, even to the banks, of the -

creek, nay, into the very ooze, where the tide 
flowed, not leaving a place for landing: and a- 
niong^thofe I had planted, they had intermingled 
fo many Ihort ones, all of which growing wonder- 
fully fall and thick, a little dog fcarcely could find 
a palTage through them. Nor was this fufficient, 
as we thought; for we did the fame to all thq 
ground, to the right and left hand of its, even to 
the top of the hill, without fo much as leaving a, 
palTage for ourfelves except by the ladder; which 
being taken down, nothing but what had wings or 
witchcraft could pretend to come near us. And 
indeed this was exceedingly well contrived, efpe- 
cially to ferve that occafion, for which we after- 
wards found it neceffary. 

Thus we lived two years in a happy retirement, 
having all this time not one vifit from the fava- 
ges. Indeed one morning we had an alarm, which 
put us in feme amazement ; for a few of my Spa- 
niards being out very early, perceived no lefs than 
twenty canoes, as it were coming on fliore ; upon 
which, returning home, with great precipitation, 
they gave us the alarm, which obliged us to keep 
at home all that day and the next, « going out only 
in the night-time to make our obfervation : but 
as good luck would have it, they were upon ano- 
ther delign, and did not land that time upon the 
ifland. 

But now there happened , another quarrel be- 
tween the three wicked Englilhmen, and fome of 
my Spaniards. The occafion was. this; One of 
them being enraged at one of the favages, whom 
he had taken prifoner, for not being able to com- 
prehend foraething which he was fliewing him, 
fnatched up a hatchet in a great fury, not to co?-‘ 
reel, but to kill him; yet mifling his head, gave 
him fuch a barbarous cut in the Ihoulder, that he 
had like to have ftruck off his arm; at which one

Ehglifhmah, coming to his ftlloW’s afiiftance, laid 
the good Spaniard dn the earth; wheh immediate- 
ly two others cdthing to his relief,- were attacked 
by the* third Englifh’man, aniidd With art Old cut- 
laft, who Wdurtded Htem both. This rt^roar fdOn

thej^ had been of my cantitry, 1 would have hing-

but kfio'wlng their inability^ and yo'cr vigilance ^ vje

How Seignior, faid I, do you hear what is aU 
ledgqd againil you ? what can you fty t.o jullify 
ib horrid an aftion, as to murder us in cold blood ? 
Po far, Sir, was the wretch from denying it, -that 
he fwore, d-mi) him but he would do it flill. But 
what have we done to you Seignior Atkins, faid 
or what will you gain by killing us? What fball 
we do to prevent you ? muft we kill you, or you 
kill us: Why will you, Seignior Atkins, (faid 'I 
fouling,) put us to fuch an unhappy dilemma, fuch 
u fatal needfity ? But fo great a rage did my fcof- 
dng, and yet feyere jeft, put him into, that he 
was going to fly at me, and undoubtedly had at- 
tempted to kill me if he had been poflefTed of wea- 
pons, and had npt been .prevented by three. Spa- 
niards. This unparalleled and villainous carri- 
age, made us feiioufly conlider what was to be 
done. The two Englilhmen and the Spaniard, 
w'ho had fav^d the poor Indian’s life mightily pe- 
titioned me to hang one of them, for an example 
to the others, which (hould be him that had twice 
attempted to commit murder with his hatchet, it 
being at that time thought impolBble the poor Have 
fliould recover. But they could never gain ray 
^ronfent to put him -to death, for the reafons above- 
mentioned, lince it was an Englilhman (even your- 
felf) who was my deliverer, and as merciful conn- 
fels are molt prevailing, when earneflly prelfed, 
fo I got them to be of the fame opinion as to cle- 
mency. But, tp prevent tbeir doing us any fur, 
ther mifehief, we afl agreed, that they Ihould haye 
no weapons, as fword, gitn, powder, or fliot, but 
be expelled from the fqciety, to live as they plea- 
4ed, by themfelves ; that neither the two Engliili- 
fpep, por the reff :of thp Spanisrds,: Ihould have 

T converfation 



4i8 life a n d Adventures 

converfation with them upon any account whatfo- 
ever : that they ftiould be kept from coming with- 
in a certain diftance of our caftle ; and if they da- 
red to offer us any violence, either by fpoiling, 
burning, killing, or deftroying any of the corn, 
plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle- belonging 
to the foctety, we would flioot them as freely as 
we would do beafls of prey, in whatfoever places 
we fhould find them. 

This fentence fecmed very juft to all but them^ 
felves ; when, like a mei-ciful judge, I called out 
to the two honeft Engl ifhmen, faying, You muft 
conlider they ought not to be ftarved neither ; 
and fmceit will befome time before they can raife 
corn and* cattle of their own, let us give them 
fonie corn to laft them eight months, and for feed 
to fow, by which time they’ll raife Ibmefbr them- 
felves; let us alfo beftow upon, them fix milk- 
goats, four he-dnes, and fix kids, as well for their 
prcfent fupport, as for a further increafe ; with 
tools neceflary for their work, as hatchets, an axe, 
faw, and other things convenient to build them 
■huts ; all which were agreed to ; but before they 
•took them in pofTeffion, I obliged them folemnly 
to .fwear, never to attempt any thing againft us 
■or their countrymen for the future. Thus dif- 
milfing them from our fociety, they went away, 
fulien and refraftory, as though neither willing to 
go nor ftay^ however, feeing no remedy, they 
took what provifion was given them, propofing^ 
to chufe a convenient place, where they might live 
by themfelves. 

About five days after, they came to thofe limits 
appointed, in order for more viduals, and fent me 
nvbrd by one of my Spaniards, whom they called 
to, where they had pitched their tents, and mark- 
.ed themfelves out an habitation and plantation, at 
the ’N. E. and moft remote part of the ifland. And ' 

indeed 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 219 

indeed there they built themfclves two very hand- 
fome cottages, refembling our little calUe, being 
under the fide of a mountain, with fome trees al- 
ready growing on three Tides of it, fo that plant- 
ing a few' more, it would be obfcured, from- fight, 
unlefs particularly fought for. When thefe huts 
were finifhed, we gave them fome dry goat-lkins 
for bedding and covering ; and upon their giving 
us fuller alTurances of their good behaviour for 
the future, we gave them fome peafe, barley, and 
rice for fowing, and whatever tools we could fpare. 

Six months did they live in this feparate condi- 
tion, in' wjuch they got their firft harvell in, the 
quantity of which was but fmall, becaufe they Jiad 
planted but little land : for indeed, all their plan- 
tations being to form, made it the more difficult, 
efpecially as it was a thing out of their element r 
and when they were obliged to make their boards 
and pots, &c.^ they could make little or nothing 
of it. But the rainy feafon coming on, put them 
into, a greater perplexity for want of a cave to 
keep their corn drj'’, and prevent it from fpoiling: 
and fo much did this humble them, that they beg- 
ged of my Spaniards to help them, to which the 
good-natured men readily confented, and in four 
days fpace worked a great hole in the fide of the 
hill for them, large enough for their purpofe, to 
fecure. their corn and other- things from the rain, 
though not comparable to ours, which had feverall 
additional apartments. 

But a new whim pofTeffed thefe rogues about 
three quarters of a year after, which had like to 
have ruined us and themfelves too : for, it feems 
being tired and weary of this fort of Jiving, which 
made them work for themfelves, without hopes of 
changing their condition, nothing would ferve 
them, but they would make a voyage to the con- 
tinent, and try if they could feize upon fome of

the favages, and bring them over as flaves, to db' 
their drudgery, while they lived at eafe and plea- 
fur e. 

Indeed the projedl was not fo ptepoflerous, if 
they had not gone farther ; but they neither did,, 
nor ptupofed any thing, but what had mifchief in 
thedelrgrt, or the event. One morning thefethred 
fellows came down to the limited flation, and hum- 
bly defined to be admitted to talk with us : which 
We readily gfanted ; they told us;^ in fiiort, that 
being tired of their rtianner of living, and the la* 
hour of their hands, in fuch employments, not be- 
ing fufficient to procure the necefTaries" of life,, 
they only defired one of the canoes we came over 
in< With feme arms and ammunition, for their de- 
fence, and they would feek their fortunes abroad,, 
and never trouble us any more To be fure, wd 
were glad enoxigh to get rid of fuch wretcheds 
plagues ; but yet honcfly made us. ingenuoufly re- 
prefent to them, by what We ourfelves had fuffer-* 
ed, the certain defIrucHon they were running into, 
either of being flarVed to death, or murdered by 
the favages. To this they very audacioufly re- 
plied, that they neither could nor would work 
and ctinfeqUently, that they 4night as well be flar-- 
l^ed abroad as at home : alid as to their falling in- 
to the hands of the favages, why, if they were 
murdered, that was nothing to iis, thete was an 
fend of them, neither had they any wives or chil- 
dren to cry after them; nay, fo intent were they 
ftpon their voyage, that if the Spaniards had not 
given them arms, fo they had but the canoe, they 
would have gone without them. 

Though we Could not well fpare Our fire-arms, 
father then they fliould go like naked men, we let 
them have two mulkets, a piftol, a cu lafs, and 
three hatchets, which were thought very fufficlent i- 
we gave them alfo goats flefli, a great baflcet full

of grapes, a pot of frefli butter, a young 

live kid, anda large canoe fufficient to carry twen- 
ty men. And thus, with a mafl: ma4e of a long 
pole, and a fail of fix large goats fkins dried, ha- 
ving a fair breeze, and a flood tide with them, 
they merrily failed away, the Spaniards calling af- 
ter them, Bon veyajo^ no man ever expelling to- 

fee them more. ' r. 

When they were gone, the Spaniards and Eng- 
](iflimen would often fay one to another, 0 ha-w ' 
■peacenble do. us nou livc^ Jlnce thofe turbulent fel~ 
ious have' left us? Nothing could be farther from 
their thoughts, than to behold their faces any more; 
and yet fcarce two and twenty days had paiTed 
over their heads, but one of the Engliflimen, being 
abroad a-planting, perceived at a diflance, three 
men well armed, approaching towards him. Away 
he flies with fpeed to our caftle, and tells me and 
the refl:, that we Were all undone,, for that, gran- 
gers were landed upon the ifland, and who they 
were he could not tell ; but added, that they were 
not favages, but men habited, bearing arms. Why 
then, faid I, we have the lefs occafipn to be con- 
cerned, iince, if they are not-Indians, they miift 
be friends ; for I am fure there is no Chriflian 
jDeople upon earth, but what will do us good ra- 
ther than harm* But while we were confidering 
of the event, up came the three Engliflimen, whole 
voices we quickly knew, and fo all our admira- 
tion of that nature ceafed at once. And our won- 
der was fucceeded by another fort, of inquiry, 
which was, what could be the occalion of their re- 
turning fo quickly to the ifland, when w'C little ex- 
pected, and much lefs delired their company , But 
as this was better toybe related by thernfelves, I 
ordered them to be brought in, when they, gave 
me the following relation ofvheir voyage:

T 3 reached 



Z22 L r FE JtND- An V EWTU RES 

reached land, where they foxind the people coming 
to give them another fort of reception than what 
.they expefted or dc-lired ; for as the favages were 
armed with -bows and arrows, they durd not ven-‘ 
ture on fhore, but fleered northward, lix dr feven 
hours, till they gained an opening, by which they 
plainly perceived, jthat the land that appeared from- 
this place Was not the main land, but the ifland». 
At their entrance into the opening of the fea,, 
they difeovered another, ifland, on the right hand'- 
northward, and feveral more lying to the wed- 
ward ; but being refolved to go on Ihore fome- 
where or other, they put over to one of the wef- 
tern iflands. Here they found the natives very 
courteous to them, giving them feveral roots and 
dried fifh nay, even their women too were as 
willing to fupply them with what they could pro- 
cure them to eat, bringing it a great wajr to them 
upon their heads. Among thefe hofpitable Indians 
they continued fome days, inquiring by figns and 
tokens, what nations lay around them ; and w^ere* 
informed, that there were feveral fierce and ter- 
rible people lived every way, accudomed to eat 
mankind.: but for themfelves, they never ufed' 
fuch diet, except thofe that were taken in battle, 
and of them they made a folemn feaft'l 

The Englidimen inquired how long it was fince 
they had a fead of that kind ? They anfwered, a- 
’bout two moons ago, pointing to the moon ; and 
then to two fingers ; that, at this time, their king 
had two hundred prifoners, which were fattening 
up for theflaughter. The Engliflimen were mighty 
dedrous of feeing the prifoners, which . the others 
niidaking, thought they wanted fome of them for 
their own food : upon which they beckoned to 
them, pointing to the ridng, and- then to the fet- 
ting of the fun ; meaning, that by the time it ap- 
peared in the ead next morning, they would bring

them fomej and indeed they were as good as their 
word ; for by that time they brought eleven men, 
and five women, juft as fo many cows and oxen 
are brought to fea*fort towns, to viftual a Ihip. 
But as brutifii as thefe Engliflimen were, their 
ftomachs turned at the fight. What to do in thi& 
cafe, they could not tell t to refufe the prifoners^ 
would have been the higheft affront offered to the 
favage gentry ; 4nd to difpofe of them, they knew 
not in what manner : however, they refolved to 
accept them, and fo gat^e them, in return, one 
of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and fix or 
feven of their bullets : things which though they 
were wholly ignorant of, yet feemed entirely con- 
tented with ; and dragging the poor wretches ihto^ 
the boat, with their hands bound behind them, de- 
livered them to the. Engliihmen. But this obliged 
them to put off as foon as they had thefe prefents, 
left the donors fhoiild have expefted two or three 
of them to be killed, and to be invited to dinner 
the next day ; and fo' taking leave with all pollible 
refpeft and thaijks, though neither of them under- 
ftood what the other faid, they failed away back 
to the firft ifland, and there fet eight of the pri- 
foners at liberty. In their voyage they endeavour- 
ed to comfort, and have fome converfacion with 
the poor captives; but it was impoflible to make 
them fenfible of any thing ; and nothing they could 
lay, or give, or do for them, could make them 
Dtherwife perfuaded, but that they were unbound 
only to be devoured ; if they give them any food, 
they thought it was only to fatten them for the 
flaughter ; or looked at any one more particular- 
ly, the poor creature fuppofed itfelf to be the fiidl 
facrifice : and even when we brought them to our 
ifland, and began to ufc them with the greateft 
humanity and kindnefs, yet they expecb:d every 
dav that their new mafters would devour tlmin. -

ing. Hereupon* 1 alkcd them, where Uteir new 
family v/as ? They told me, they had ,put theiSl 
into one of their huts, and they came to beg fome 
vidluals for them. This, indeed, made us all long 
to fee them; and fo . taking Friday’s father with 
us, leaving only two at our calfle, we came down 
to behold thofe poor creatures. 

When we arrived at the hut, (they being bound 
again by the Englilhm'eb, for fear of efcapihg,) 
we "found them ftark naked, expeding their fatal 
tragedy : there were three ludy men, well ftiaped, 
with ilraight and fair limbs, between thirty and 
five and thirty years old ; and five womenj two of 
them might be from thirty to forty,, two more, 
not above four and twenty j and the lad a comely 
tall maiden of about; feventcen. Indeed, all the 
women were very agreeable, both in their pro- 
portion and features, except that they were tawny 
which "their moded behaviour and other graces 
made amends for, .when they afterwards came to- 
be cloathed. i • 

~ This naked, appearance, together with their mi- 
ferable circumdances, was no very comfortable 
'fight to my Spaniards, who, for their parts, I may 
venture. Sir, vvitliout flattery, to fay, are men 
of the bed behaviour, calmed tempers, and fweet- 
ed nature, that can poflibly be; for they imme- 
diately ordered Friday’s father to fee if he knew 
any of thern, or if he underdood what they could 
fay. No fooner did the old Indian appear, but, he 
looked at them with great fcrioufnefs; yet, as 
they were not of his nation, they were utter dran- 
gers to him, and none could underdand.his fpeech 
or figns, but one woman. This was enough to 
anfwer the defign, which was to aflure them they

#onlcl not be killed, being fallen into the hands 
of Chriflians, who abhorred fudh barbarity. When 
they were fully fatisfied of this, they exprefled 
their joy, bj' fuch flrange gellures, and uncom* 
iTiOn toftds, as it is not polfible for me to defcribe. 
But the woman, their interpreter, was ordered 
next to inquire, whether they were content to 
be fervarits, and Would work for the men, who 
had brought them hither to fave their lives ? Here- 
upon (being at this time unbound) they fell a ca- 
pering and dancing, one taking this thing upon her 
ftonlders, and the other that, intimating, that 
they were willing to do any thing for them. But 
now, Sir, having Women among us, and dreading 
that it might occafion fome ftrife, if not blqod, 1 
diked the three men what they would do, and hoW 
they intended to ufe thefe creatures, whether aS 
ferva'nts or women ? One of them very pertly 
and readily anfwered, they would ufe them as 
both. Gentlemen, faid I, as you are yotir own 
mafters, I am not going to refirain you from that J 
but, metbinks, for avoiding diflenlion among you, 
I would only defire you to engage, that none of 
you will take more than one for a won>an or a 
wife, and that having taken this one, none elfe 
llionld prefume to touch her j for though we have 
not a prieftly aiithorify to marry you, yet it iS 
but reafonable, that whoever thus takes a womah^ 
fliould be obliged to maintain her, liiice nobody 
elfe has any thing to do with her ; and this indeed 
appeared fo jufl: to all prefent, that it was unani* 
moufly agreed to. The Knglillnnen then alk^dmy 
Spaniards, whether they deligned to take aiiy of 
them? but they all anfwered. No; fome decla- 
ring they had already wives in Spain ; and others, 
that they cared not to Join with infidels. On the 
reverfe, the Englilhmen took each of them a tem- 
porary wife, andfo fer'up a new method of living.

2.26 LIFE and adventures 

As to Friday’s father, the Spaniards, and .the 
three favage fervants we had taken in the late bat- 
tle, they all lived with me in our ancient caftle? 
and indeed we fupplied the main part of the ifland- 
with food, as necelfity required. But the moll: rer 
markable part of the ftory is, hovy thefe Englilli- 
men, who had been fo much at variance,, fhould 
agree about the choice of thefe women ; yet they 
took a way good enough to prevent quarrelling 
among themfelves. They fet ; the five women in 
one of their huts, and going themfelves to the o- 
ther, .drew lots which fhould have the firft choice. 
Now, he that had thg firft lot went. to the hut,: 
and fetched out her he chofe, and it is remarkable, 
that he took her that was the mofl homely and 
eldeft of the number, which made the reft of the 
Engliflimen exceeding merry* The , Spaniards 
themfelves could, not but fmile at it : but, as it 
happened, the fellow had the beft thought, in 
chufing one fit for application and bufinefs; and 
indeed fhe proved the beft wife of all the parcel. 

But when the poor creatures perceived .them- 
ves placed in a row, and feparated one by one, 
they were again feized with an unfpeakable ter- 
ror, as now thinking they were going to be llain 
in earneft ; and when the Engliflimen came to 
take the firft, the reft fet- up a lamentable cry, 
clapt their arms around her neck, and hanging 
about her, took their Lift farewell, as they, thought,, 
in fuch trembling agonies, and affedlionate embra- 
ces, as would have foftened the hardeft heart in 
the world, and made the dryeft eyes melt into 
tears ; nor could they be perfuaded, but that they 
were going to die, till fuch time as ; Friday’s fa- 
ther made them fenfible that the EnglUhmen had 
chofen them for their wives, which ended all their 
terror and concern upon this occafion.* 

Well, after this, the Engliflimen went to work, 

. and 



or ROBTN'SON CRUSbl:. t 227 

aiid being affifted by my gdod-natn red Spaniards, 
in a iiew hours they erefted every one of them a 
new hut or tent, for their feparate lodging, fince 
thofe they had already were filled with tools, 
iioufehold fluff, and provifion. They all continu- 
ed bn the north fhore gf the ifland, but" feparate 
as before; the three, wicked ones pitching farther 
off, and the two lionefl men nearer our caflle; fo 
that the ifland feemed to be peopled in three pla- 
ces, three towns beginning to be^ built for that 
purpofe. And here I cannot but remark, what is 
very common, that the two honefl men had the, 
worfl wives, (I mean as to induflry, clcanlinefs, 
and ingenuity,) while the three reprobates enjoy- 
ed women of quite contrary qualities. 

But another obfervation I made was, in favour 
of the two honefl men, to fliew what difparity 
there is between a diligent application to bufinefs 
on the one hand, and a flotliful, negligent, and 
idle temper, on the other. Both of them had the 
fame parcel of ground laid out, and corn to fow., 
fufficient for them ; but both did not make the fame 
improvements, either in their cultivation, or in 
their planting. The two honefl men had a multi- 
tude of young trees planted about their habitations, 
fo that when you approached near them, nothing 
appeared but a woocl, very pleafmg and delight- 
ful. Every thing they did profpered and flourifh- 
■ ed ; their grapes planted in order, feeriied as tho* 
managed in a vineyard, and were infinitely pre- 
ferable to any of the others. Nor were they 
wanting to find out a place of retreat, but dug a 
eave in the mqfl retired part of a thick wood, to 
fecure their wives and children, with their provi- 
fion and chiefefl goods, furrounded with innume- 
fablfe flakes, and having a mofl fubtle entrance, 
in cafe any mifchief fliould happen either from 
their fellow-countrymen, or the devouring fa- 
vages. 


LJFJ: Ar^5) AD.ySNTUHES 

As to the reprobates, (thou^ I mufl own they 
were much civilized than before,) inftead of 4 
delightful wood furrounding their dwelling w^ 
found the words of King Solomon too truly veri- 
fied I ’went by the vineyard of the Jlothful^ and 
it was all overgrown with thorns. In many place? 
their crop w.as obfcured with weeds 1 the hedgCjS 
having feveral gaps in them, the wild goats had 
got in, and eaten up the corn, and here and tfiero 
was a dead bufti, to flop in thofe gaps for the prcr 
fent, which was naraore than fliutting the flablcr 
door after the fteed was ftolen away. But as to 
their wives, they (a? I obferved before) were more 
diligent, and cleanly enongh, efpecially in their 
viduals, being inftruded by one of the honefl: 
ijnen, who had been a cook’s mate pn board a flijp: 
and very well it was fo ; for as he cooked hinifelf, 

' his companions and their families lived as well a? 
the idle hulbands, who did nothing but Jpiter ar 
bout, fetch turtles eggs, catch fifli and birds, and 
do any thing but work, and lived accordingly, 
while the diligent lived very handfomely and plen- 
tifully, in the moft comfortable manner. And 
now. Sir, I come today before your eyes a feene 
quite different from any thing that ever happened 
us before, and perhaps ever befel you f n all the 
time of your refidence on this ifland. I ihall in- 
form you of its original in the following mauner ? 

One morning. Sir, very early, there came five 
or fix canoes of Indians on fijore, indifputably 
upon their old'cufiora of devouring tfieir prifo- 
ners. All that we had to do upon fuch an occa- 
lipn, w^as tp lye concealed, that they, not having 
any notice of inhabitants, might depart quietly, 
after performing their bloody ex^cutipU t who- 
ever fii ft difeovered the favages, was to give no- 
tice to all the three plantations to keep wfilVd 
doors, and tfien a proper fcout was to be pfaced 

tp 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. ^29 

to give intelligence of their departure. But,' not»> 
withUanding thefe wife meafures, an unhappy dif- 
alter difcovered us to the favages, which.was like 
to have caufed the defolation of the whole illand ; 
for, after the favages were gone olF in their canoes, 
fome of my Spaniard® and i looking abroad, and 
being inflamed with a curiofity to fee what they 
had been doing, to our great amazement, beheld 
three favages fall afleep on the ground, who, either 
being gorged, could not awake when the others 
went off, or having wandered too far into the 
woods, did not come back in time. 

What to do with them at firll we could not 
tell ; as for Haves, we had enough of them already ; 
and as to kill them, neither Chrillianity nor hu- 
manity would fufFer us to Hied the blood of per- 
forts who never did us wrong. We perceived they 
had no boat left them to tranfport them to their 
own nation ; and that by letting them wander 
about, they might dilcover us, and inform the firll 
favages that Ihould happen to land upon the fame 
bloody occafion, which information might entirely 
ruin us ; and therefore I c.ounfelled my Spaniard 
to fecure them, and fet them about fome work or 
other, till we could better difpofe of them. 

Hereupon we all went back, and making them 
awake, took them y)rifoners. It is impoflible to 
exprefs the horror they were in, efpecially when 
-bound, as thinking they were going to be murder- 
ed and eaten, but we foon eafed them of their 
fear as to that point. We firll took them to 
'the bower where the chief of our country- work 
lay, as keeping goats, planting corn, &c. And 
then carried them to the two Engliflimen’s habita- 
tion, to help them in their bufmefs ; but happy it 
was for us all," we did not carry them to our caf- 
tle, as by the fequel will appear. The Englilh- 
•men indeed found them v;ork to do ; but whe- 

U ther 



LIFE A N D AD VENTURES 

ther they did not guard them ftriiEUy, or that they 
thought they covild not better themfelves, I can- 
'iiot tell; but certainly one of them rffn away in- 
to the woods, and they could not hear of him for 
a long time after. 

Undoubtedly there was reafon enough to fup- 
pofe he got home in fome of the canoes, the ra- 
vages returning in about four weeks time, apd 
going off in the fpace of two days. You may be 
certain, Sir, this thought could not but terrify 
Us exceedingly, and make us juflly conclude that 
this favage would inform his countrymen of our 
abode in the ifland, how few and weak we were 
in comparifon to their numbers ; and v/e expedled 
it would not be long before the Englilhmen would 
be attacked in their habitations ; but the favages 
had not feen th^ir places of fafety in the woods, 
nor our caflle, which it was a great happinefs 
they did not know. 

Nor w^ere we niiflaken in our thoughts upon 
this occafion ; for about , eight months after this, 
fix canoes, with about ten men in each canoe, 
came failing by the north fide of the ifland, which 
they never were accuflomed to before, and land- 
eti about an hour after fun rife, near a mile from 
the dwelling of the two Englilhmen, who, it feems, 
had the good fortune to difeover them about a 
league off: fo that it was an hour before they 
could attain the fliore, and fome longer time be- 
fore they could come at them. And now being 
confirmed in this opinion, that they were certain- 
ly betrayed, they immediately bound the twoflaves 
w hich were left, caufing two of the three men, 
v/hom they brought with the women, and who 
proved very faithful, to lead them with their 
wives, and other conveniencies, into their retired 
cave in the wood, and there to bind the two fel- 
lows hand and foot, till they had further orders. 

■ . They

They then opened their fences, where they kept 
their milk goats, and drove them all out, giving^ 
the goats liberty to ramble in the woods, to make 
the favages believe that they were wild ones ; but 
the Have had given a truer infoi'mation, which 
made them come to the very inclofures. The two 
frighted men fent the other Have of the three who 
had been with them by accident, to alarm the Spa- 
niards, and delirc their alhflance ; in the mean 
time, they took their arms and ammunition, and 
made to the cave, where they had fent their wives, 
and fecuring their Have;', feated themfelves in a 
private place, from whence they might behold all' 
the aftions of the favages. Nor had they gone 
far, when afeending a riling ground, they could 
fee a little army of Indians approaching to their 
beautiful dwelling, and, in a few moments more,^ 
perceive the fame, and their furniture, to their 
unfpeakable grief, burning in a confuming flame : 
and when this was done, they fpread here and 
there, fearching every bulh and place for the peo- 
ple,. of w’hom, it is very evident, they had infor- 
mation. Upon which the two EngliOimen, not 
thinking themfelves feenre where they flood, re- 
treated about half a mile higher in the country, 
rightly concluding, that the farther the favages 
ftrolled, there would be lelTer numbers together; 
upon which they next took their ftand by the trunk: 
of an old: tree, very hollow and large, whence 
they refolved to fee what would offer; but they- 
had not flood long there before two favages came 
running directly towards them, as though having 
knowledge of their being there, who feemed re- 
folved to attack them; a little farther were three 
more, and five more behind them again, all run- 
ning the fame way. It cannot be imagined what 
perplexity the poor men weqi’e in at this fight,, 
thinkingj that if alfiftance did not fpeediiy come,.

232 LIFE and adventures 

their cave in the wood would be difcovered, and 
' confequently all therein loft : fo they refolved to 
refill them there ; and when overpowered, to af- 
cend to the top of the trees, where they might 
. defend themfelves as long as their ammunition 
Jafted, and fell their lives as dear as polTible tO' 
thofe devouring favages. Thus fixed in their re- 
folution, they next conlidered, whether they fhould 
fire at the firft two, or wait for the three, and fo 
take the middle party, by which the two firft and 
the five laft wmuld be feparated. In this regula- 
tion the two favages alfo confirmed them, by turn- 
ing a litt?^e to another part of the Wood ; but th& 
three, and the five after them, came direftly to- 
tvards the tree. Hereupon they refolved to rake 
them in a direft line, as they approached nearer, 
^becaufe perhaps the firft Ihot might hit them all 
three ; and upon this occafion, the man who was: 
»to fire, charged his piece with three or four bul- 
lets. And thus, while they were waiting, the fa- 
vages came on, one of them was the runaway, who 
had caiifed all the mifehief ; fo they refolved he 
fiiould not efCape, if they both fired at once. But, 
however, though they did not fire together, they 
were ready charged ; when the firft that let fly, 
was too good a markfman to mifs his aim ; for he 
killed the formoft outright, the fecond (who was, 
the runaway Indian) fell on the ground, being 
Ihot through the body, but 'not dead, and the third* 
was a little wounded on the llioulc}er, who, fitting' 
down on the ground, fell a fereaming in a inoft 
fearful manner. The noife of the guns, which 
not only made the moft refounding echoes, from 
one fide to another, but raifed the birds of all 
forts, fluttering with the moft confufed noife, fo 
much terrified the five favages behind, that they 
flood ftill at firft, like fo many inanimate images. 
But when all things were in profound lilence, they 

came 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

came to the place where their companions lays- 
and thefe, being not fenfible that they were liable 
to the fame fate, {food over the wounded man,, 
undoubtedly inquiring the dccafion of this fad ca- 
lamity ; and ’tis as reafonablc to fuppofe, he told' 
them, that it came by thunder and lightning froniv 
-the gods, having never feen nor heard of a gun 
before^ in the whole courfe of their lives. By 
this time, the Engliflnnen having loaded their 
pieces, fired both together a fecond time, when- 
feeing them all fall- immediately upon the ground, 
they thought they had killed every creature of ' 
them; This made them come up boldly before 
they had charged their guns, which mdeecl was a 
wrong Hep ; for when they came to the place, 
they found four alive, two of them very little- 
wounded, and one not at all, which obliged them 
to fall upon them with their mufkets ; they firft 
knocked the runaway favage on the head, and a- 
nother that was but a little wounded in the arm,, 
and rhen put the other languifiaing wretches out 
of their pain ; wJiile he that was not hurt, with 
bending knees, and uplifted hands, made piteous . 
moans, and figns to them to fpare, his life : nor 
indeed were they unmerciful to the poor wretches, . 
but pointed to them to fit down at the root of a. 
tree hard by ; and then one of the. Engl ifiimen, , 
with a piece of rope twine he had in his pocket 
by mere chance," tying his two feet together, and ■ 
his two hands behind him, they left him there, 
making all the hade they could hfter the other 
two, fearing they fiiould find out their cave : but 
though they could not overtake them, they had 1 
the fatisfaftion to perceive them, at a didance, . 
crofs a valley towards the fea, a quite contrary 
wayrfo, their retreat; upon which they returned; 
tft the .tree, to look after their prifoner ; but wheiii 
; ' 3 tbeyy

they catne' there he was^one, leaving' the piece pf 
rope-yarn vvherewith he was bound behind him. 

Well, now they were as much concerned as e- 
ver, as not knowing how near their enemies might 
be, or iiT what numbers; immediately they re^ 
paired to their cave, to fee if all was well there,^ 
aud found every thing fafe, except the women, 
who w'Cre frighted upon their hui'bmds account, 
whom now they loved entirely. They had not 
been long here, before feven of my Spaniards came 
to, alFifl: them ; while the other ten, their fervants, 
a^d Friday’s father, were gone to defend their 
bovver, corn, and cattle, in cafe the favages fhould' 
have rambled fo far. ^There accompanied the fe- 
ven Spaniards, one of the three favages that had 
formerly been taken prifoners ; aud with them al- 
fo that very Indian whom the Engliimnen had a 
Jittle before left under the tree ; for it feems, 
they paffed by that way where the flaughrer was 
• made^ and fo carried along with them that poor 
wretch that was left bound. But fo many prifon- 
trs now becoming a burden to us, and fearing the 
dreadful confequence of their efcaping, moll of 
the Spaniards and Engliflt urged the abfolute ne- 
celfity. there was of killing them for. our common 
prefcrvation : but. Sir, the authority I bore as a 
governor, over-ruled that piece of cruelty; and 
then I ordered them to be fent prifoners to the 
old cave in the valley, bound hands and feet, w'ith 
two Spaniards to guard them. 

So much encouraged were the Engliflimen at 
the approach of the Spaniards, and fo great was - 
their fury againft the favages, for deflroying their 
habitations, that they had not patience to flay any 
■ longer; but, taking five Spaniards along with 
them, armed wdth four muflcets, ,a piflol, and a 
quarter-Ra<F, away they went in piirfuit of their 
enemies. As they pafl’ed by the place where the; 

favages

235- 

favages were flain, it wa^ very eafy to be percei- 
"ved that more of them had been thei'e, having at- 
tempted to carry off their dead bodies, but found 
it impr amicable, From a rlfiug ground, our party 
-had the mortification to fee the fnioke that pro- 
ceeded from the ruins ; when coming farther in 
light of the Ihore, they plainly perceived that the 
favages had embarked in their canoes, and were 
putting out to fea. This they were very forty 
for, there being no confmg at them to give them 
a parting falute; but, however, they were glad 
enough to get clear of fuch unwelcome guefls. 

Thus the two honeft, but unfortunate Englifii- 
men, being ruined a fecond time, and their im- 
provements quire dellroyed, moft of my good na- 
tured Spaniards helped them to rebuild, and we 
all alfdfed them with needful fupplies ; nay, what 
is more remarkable, their three mifehievous coun- 
trymen, when they heard iti, (which-wms after all 
thefe difalters were over,, they living remote eaft- ' 
ward,) very friendly fympathii'ed with them, and 
w orked for thpm feveral days : fo that in a little 
time their habitation was reWilt, tbeir neceflities 
fuppUed, and themfelves rellored to their former 
tranquillity 

Though the favages had nothing to boaft of in 
this adventure, (feveral canoes being driven a- 
fliore,' followed by two drowned creatures, having, 
undoubtedly met with a ’ llprm at fea that very 
•night they departed,) yet it was natural to be fup- 
pofed, that thofe, whofe better fortune it was to 
attain their native Ihore, would inflame their na- 
tion to another ruinous attempt, with a greater 
force, to carry all before them. And indeed fo it 
.happened ; for, about feven months after, our 
iflancb w^as invaded with a mofl fonnidable navy, 
no leTs than eight and twenty canoes full of fava- 
gesj ;%rrned with wooden fwofds, raonflrous clubs,

baws, and arrows, and fuch like inflruraents of 
war, landing at the eaft fide of the ifland. You 
may well. Sir, imagine, what coiiflernation our 
men were in upon this account, and how fpeedily 
they were- to execute their refolution, having on- 
ly that night’s time allowed them. . '1 hey knew 
that fincethey could not withftand their enemies, , 
concealment v/as the only way to procure their 
fafety : and therefore they took dowm- the huts 
that were built for the two Engliflimen, and drove 
their flock of goats, together with their own at 
the bower, to the old cave in the valley, leaving 
as little appearance of inhabitants' as poffible ; and 
then pofled themfelves w'lth ail their force, at the 
plantation of the two men. As they expedled, fo 
it happened ; for early the next morning, the In- 
dians, leaving their canoes at the eaft end of the 
ifland, came running along the Ihore, about two 
hundred and fifty in number, as near as could be 
guefled. Our army was but little indeed; and; 
what was our greateft misfortune, we had not 
arms fufficient for them. The account, as to the^ 
men, Sir, is. as follows :

befides the fire arms : nay, two of the women, in- 
fpired with Amazonian fortitude, could not be 
difluaded from fighting along with their deareft 
hufbands, and if they died, to die .with them. 
Seeing their refolution, we gave them hatchets 
likewife; but what pleafed them befl, were the 
bows and arrows (which they dexteroufly knew 
how to ufe) that “the Indians had left behind them, 
after their memorable battle one againll another. 

Over this army, which, though little, was of 
great intrepidity, 1 was conftitmed chief general 
and commander ; and knawing Will. Atkins., tho’ 
exceeding wicked, yet a man of invincible courage, 

I gave him the power of commanding under me : 
he and fix meiii, with their imifltets loaded, with 
fix or feven bullets apiece, were planted-jufl be- _ 
hind a fmall thicket of bufhes, as an advanced 
guard, having orders to let the firft pafs by; and 
then, when be fired into the middle of them, make 
a nimble retreat round part of the wood, and fo 
come in the rear of the Spaniards, who were Iha- 
ded by a thicket of trees ; for though the favages . 
came on with the fiercenefs of lions, yet they 
wanted the fubtilty of foxes^, being out of all • 
manner of order, and flraggling in heaps every 
way ; and indeed when Will. Atkins, after fifty 
of the favages had pafled. by, had ordered three of 
his men to give fire, fo great was their conilerna-

-there might have been a complete vid:ory obtain-’ 
ed ; but (laying to load their pieces again, difco- 
vered the whole matter. They were perceived by 
foine of the Icattering favages at a dilliince, who 
let fly their arrows among them, wounded Atkins 
iiimfelf, and killed his fellow Engli(hman, and one 
of the Indians taken with the women. Our party 
did not fail to .anfwer them, and in their retreat 
killed, about twenty favages. Here I cannot but 
take notice of our poor dying (lave, who, though 
flopt from his retreat by a fatal arrow, yet with 
his (laff and hatchet defjierately and gallantly af- 
failed the purfuers, and killed five of the favages, 
before his life fubmiited to a multiplicity of wounds. 
Nor is the cruelty of malice of the Indians to be 
lefs remarked, in breaking’ the arms, legs, and 
heads of -the two dead bodies with their clubs and 
wooden fwords, after a mod wrecched manned.' 
As Atkins retreated, our party advanced, to in- 
terpole between him and the favages ; but after 
three volleys,, we were obliged to retreat alfo : 
for they were fo numerous and defperate, that they _ 
came up to our very teeth, lliot their arrows like^ 
a cjotid, and- their wounded men, enraged with 
cruel pain, fought like madmen. They did not, 
however, think fit to follow us,' but drawing them- 
felves up in ^ circle, they gaye two triumphant 
Ihouts in token of viclory, though they had the ^ 
grief to fee feveral of their wounded men bleed to 
death before them. 

After I had. Sir, drawn up our little army to- 
gether upon a rifmg ground, Aitkin s, wounded as 
he was, would have had us attack the whole body 
of the favages at once. I was extremely well 
pleafed with the gallantry of the man ; but upon 
confideration I replied, You perceivs^ Seignior^ 
Aitkirts, hoTX) their viovcnded men fight ; let. them 
alorie till mornings when they will be faint ^ fi^Jfi

with. To which, JVill. Aitkins, iiuiling, replied, 
That's very true., Seignior., and fo f /all I too ; and 
that's the re a fort I would fight them., now lam warm. 
We all anfwered, Seignior Aitkins, for your partj 
you have behaved very gallantly ; and if you are 
not able to approach the enemy in the mornings 
we will fight for you ; till then we think it con- 
venient to wait ; and fo we tarried. 

By the hrightnefs of the moon that night, we 
perceived the favages in great diforder abouwheir 
dead and wounded men. This made us change our 
refolution, and relolve to fall upon them in the 
night, if we could give them one Volley undif- 
covercd. This we had a- fair opportunity to do* 
by one of the two Englillimen’s leading us round* 
between the woods and the fea-fide weltward, and 
. turning fliort foutf, came privately to a place 
where the thickell: of them were. Unheard and 
unpcrceived, eight of us fired among them, and 
did dreadful execution; and in half a minute after, 
eight more of us let fly, killing mrd wounding a- 
bundance of them ; and then dividing ourfelves in- 
to three bodies, eight perfons in each body, we 
marched from among the trees to the very teeth 
of the enemy, fending forth the greatefi: Ihouts, 
and acclamations. The favages hearing a diffe- 
rent noife from three quarters at once, hood in 
the utmoh confufion ; but coming in fight of us, 
let fly a volley of arrow's, which wounded poor 
old Friday, yet happily it 'did not prove mortal. 
We did not however give them a fecond opportu- 
nity, but rufliing in among them, we fired three 
feveral ways, and then fell to work with our 
fw'ords, haves, hatchets, and the butt-end of our 
mufleets, with a fury not to be refihed ; fo that, 
with the moh difraal fereaming and howling, they 
had recourfe to their feet, to fave their lives by a 

fpeedy 



a 40 LIFE and adventures 

fpeedy flight. Nor mufl we forget the valeur of 
the two women; Lr they expol’ed themfelves to 
the greateit dangers, killed many with their ar- 
rows, and valiantly deilroyed feveral more with 
their hatchets. 

In fighting thefe two battles, we were fo much 
tired, that w'e did not then trouble ourfelves to 
purfue them to their canoes, in which we thought 
they would prefcntly put to the ocean ; but there 
happening a dreadful llorm at fea, which continu- 
ing all that night, it not only prevented their 
voyage, but dalhed feveral of their boats to pieces 
agaiiilt the beach, and drove the fell fo high upon 
the fliore, that it required infinite pains to get 
them off. After our men had taken fome refrelh- 
ment and a little repofe, they refolved early in 
the morning to' go towards the place of their land- 
ing, , and fee whether they were gone off, or in 
what pollurc they remained. This neceffarily led 
them to the place of battle, where feveral of the 
favages were expiring;, a light no way pleafmg to 
generous minds, to delight in their mifery, though 
obliged to conquer them by the law of arms : but 
our own Indian Haves put them out of their pain, 
by difpatching them with their hatchets. At length, 
coming in view of the remainder of their army, 
W'e found them leaning upon their knees, w'hich 
.were bended towards their mouth, and the head 
between the two hands. Hereupon, coming within 
inufket-fliot of them, I ordered two pieces to be 
fired without ball, in order to alarm them, that we 
might plainly know' whether they had the courage 
to venture another battle, or were utterly difpi- 
rited from fuch an attempt, that fo we might ac- 
cordingly manage them. And indeed the projeft 
took very well; for no fooner did the favages hear 
the firll gun, and perceive the flafli of the fecond, 
but they ftiddenly flarted upon their feet, in the

greatefl: conilernation ; and when we approached 
towards them, they ran yowling and fcreaniing a- 
way np the hill into the country. ' 

- We could rather, at firll, have wifiied, that the 
weathej5 had permitted them to have gone ofF to 
the fea ; but when we confidered that their efcape 
might occadon the approach of multitudes, to our 
utter ruin and dUTolution, we were very well 
pleafed the contrary happened : and. Will. Atkins 
(^who, though wounded, .vvonld not part .from us 
all this v^hile) advifed usinot >to let'odip this ad- 
vantage, but Clapping between; them and their 
boats, deprive them of the capacity of ever re- 
turning to plague the ifland: .1 know y (faid he,) 
there is hut one obje£Hm you can make ^ which is^ 
ihat thefe creatures^ living like heajls 'in the nvoOd^ 
may make excur/tonsy riffle the plantations^ and de- 
Jlroy the tame goats : hut then.conffder^ vje had bet- 
ter to do with an hundred nieti^ whom voe can kill^ 
or make jldves off at leifitre, than with an hundred 
nationsy whom it is impofjible we ffmdd fave our- 
ffelves from^ mud) lefs fuhdue. This advice, and 
thefe arguments being a^iproved of, \ye let fire to 
their boats ; and though they were fo Wet that 
they would not burn entirely, yet we made them 
incapable for fwirammg in the feas. As Toon as 
the Indians perceived what We were doing, many 
of them ran out of the woods, in fight of us, and 
kneeling down piteoully cried out, Ort, Oa, IVa- 
ramakoa, intimating, 1 fiippofe^. that if we would 
bttt fpare their canoes, they would never trouble 
us again. • . ' , . ■ 

■ Bat all their j cornplaims, fubmiflions, and in- 
treaties, ’vvCrfe in -vain for Telf-preferVation obli- 
ging us to the contrary, we dellroyed everyone 
of them that had efcaped the fury of the oc:an. 
When the Indians perceived tliis, they raifed a la- 
mieiitable -cry, and 'ran iatb the woods, where they 



242 LIFEandADVENTUR.es 

continued running about, making the woods ring 
■with their lamentation. Here we fhould have con-« 
fidered, that making thefe creatures thus defperate, 
we 6 ugh t, at the fame time, to have fet a fuffici- 
ent guard upon the plantations ; for the favages, 
in their ranging about, found out the bower, de- 
liroyed the fences, trod the corn down under their 
'feet, and tore up the vines and grapes. It is true, 
we were always able to fight thefe creatures; but 
a 6 they were too fwift for us, and very numerous, 
we durft not go out fingle, for fear of them ; 
though that too was needlefs, they having no 
weapons, nor any materials to make them ; and 
indeed their extremity appeared in a little time af- 
ter. * - ■ 

Though the favages, as already mentioned, had 
deflroyed our bower, and all our corn, grapes, &c. 
yet we had ftillJeft our flock of cattle in the val- 
ley by the cave, ■with fome little corn that grew 
there, and the plantation of Will. Aitkins and his 
companions, one of whom being killed by an ar- 
row, they wdre now r^educed to two : it is re- 
markable, that this was the fellow who cut the 
poor Indian with his hatchet, and had a delign to 
murder me* and my countrymen the Spaniards. 
As oUr condition was fo low, we came to the re- 
folutlon to drive the favages up to the farther part 
of the ifland, where no Indians landed to kill as 
many of them as we could, till we had reduced 
their number ; and then to give the remainder 
fome corn to plant, and to teach them how to livo 
by their daily labour. Accordingly we purfued 
them with our guns, at the hearing of which, they 
. wOre fo terrified, that they would fall to the 
ground. Every day we killed and wounded fome- 
of them, "ian^ many "vve found flarved to death, fo 
that our hearts began to relent at the fight of fuch 
miferable objects. At laft, with great difficulty.

taking one of them alive, and ufmg him with 
kindnefs and tendernefs, we brought him to Old 
Friday, who talked to him, and told him how 
good we would be to them all, giving them corn 
and land to plant and live in, and prefent nourifti- 
ment, provided they would keep within fuch bounds 
as Ihould be allotted them ; and not do prejudice to 
others ; Go then^ faid he, and inform your country-

The poor creatures, thoroughly humbled, being 
reduced to about thirty-feven, joyfully accepted 
the offer, and earneftly begged for food ; hereup- 
on we fent twelve Spaniards and two Englifhmen, 
welUarmed, together with Old Friday, and three 
Indian flaves, who marched to the place where they 
were. The flaves were loaded with a large quan- 
tity pf bread, and rice cakes, with three live goats: 
and the poor Indians being ordered to lit down on 
the lide of the hill, they ate the viduals Very 
thankfully, and have proved faithful to the lafl, 
never trefpaIRng beyond their bounds, where at 
this day they quietly and happily remain, and 
where we now and then viflt theni. They are 
confined to a neck of land about a mile and a half 
broad, and three or four in length on the fouth- 
eafl; corner of the ifland, the fea being before, and 
lofty mountains behind them, free from the ap- 
pearance of canoes ; and indeed their countrymen 
nave never made any inquiry after them. We 
gave them twelve hatchets, and three or four 
knives; have taught them to build huts, make 
wooden fpades, plant corn, make bread, breed 
tame goats, and milk them, as likewife to ma|ce , 
wicker-works, in which, I muft ingenuoufly conr

Nor did his -remarks, end here; for making ob-

condition at tirfl, infinile’y worfe than theirs, he 
told ,me, that Englilhraen had, in their diftrefs, 
greater prefence of mind than thofe of any other 
-Goontry that he had met with ; and that they and 
the Portuguefe were the worfl men in the world 
to ftruggle under misfortunes. When they landed 
among the favages, tney found but little provHion^. 
except they would turn cannibals, there being^lnit 
a few roots and herbs, with little fubflance 
them, and of which the natives gave them bup 
very fparingly. Many were the ways they took 
to civilize and teach the favages, but in vain s- 
for they would not own them to be their inf truc- 
tors, whofe lives were owing to their bounty.. 
Their extremities v/ere. very great,, many days, 
^being entirely without food, the favages there 
-being more indolent and lei’s devouring than thofe 
who had better fupplies. When rhdt/ went out tp

return of their friend, who they thought had been 
entombed in the bowels of their enemies, their 
joy was inconceivable. Nor were they lefs fur- 
prifed at the light of the loaves of bread I had 
fent them, things that they had not feen for feve- 
ral years, at the fame time crolling and blefling it, 
as though it was manna fent' from heaven : but 
when they knew the errand, and perceived the 
boat which was to carry them to the perlon and 
place from whence fuch relief came, this ftruclc 
them with fuch a furprife of Joy as made fome of 
them faint away, and others burll out into tears. 

This was the fummary account that I had from 
them. I lliall now inform the reader what I next 
did for them, and in what condition I left them. 
As we were all of opinion that the favages would 
fcarce trouble them any more, fo we had i o appre- 
henfions on that fcore. I told them I was come 
purely to eftablifli, and rtot to remove them ; and^ 
upon that occafion, had not only brought them; 
neceffaries for convenience and defence, but allcr 
artificers, and other perfons, both for their ne- 
cefTary employments, and to add to their number.. 
They w'ere all together when I thus talked to 
them; and before I delivered to them the fto’res I 
had brought, I alked them one by one, if they had? 
entirely forgot their firfl: animofitie?,. would en- 
gage in the ffriclefl friendlhip, and lhake handS’ 
with one another ? On this, Will. Atkins, with: 
abundarice of good humour, faid, they had afflic- 
tions enough to make them all fober, and enemies 
enough to make them all friends : as for himfelfy 
he would live and die among them, owning, that 
what the Spaniards had done to him, his own mad 
humour had made necellary for them to do. Nor 
had the Spaniards occafion to juftify their proceed- 
ing to me ; but they told me, that, fince Will. At- 
kins had behaved himfelf fo viljantly in fight, and-

intercft of them all, they had not only forgotten 
all that was paft, but thought he ought as much 
to be trufted with arms and necelTaries as any of 
them, which they teftified by making him next in 
eommand to the governor and they mofl: heartily 
embraced the occafion of giving me this folemn 
afliirance, that they would never fepaiafe their 
interelt again as long as they lived. 

. After thefe kind declarations of friendfhip, we 
appointed all of us to dine together the next day ; 
upon this I Canfcd. the fhip’s cook and his mate 
come on il}ore for tltat purpofe, to afliflin drcfling 
our dinner. We brought from the fljip fix pieces) 
of beef, and four of pork, together with quf; 
punch-bowl, and materials to fill it ; and .in par- 
ticular, I gave them ten, bottles pf French claret,- 
and ten pf EngUlh beer, which was very accep-; 
table to them. The Spafiiards added to our feaffe 
five whole kids, which being roafted, three of them; 
were Cent as frelh meat to the failors on board, 
and the o«^her two we atfe ourfelves; After our; 
merry and innocent fealf was over, I began foi 
diftribute my eargoe among them. Firfl, I gavei 
them linen fufficientito make every one of theim 
four fliirts, and at the Spaniards requeft made

make every one a light coat like a frock agreeable

to make more upon their decay;. as alfo pumpSj;

a common father , to them all ; and they all enga-t 
g'ed never to leave the ifland, till I gavP my .con^:

and the two carpenters ; but my Jack of all trades ' 
was the raofl: acceptable preient I could make 
them. My tailor fell immediately to work, and 
made every one of them a fliirt ; after which, he 
learned the women -how to few and ftitch, there- 
by to become the more helpful to their hufbands. 
Neither were' the carpenters lefs ufeful, taking in 
pieces their clumfy things, inflead of which they 
made convenient and handfome tables, (tools, bed- 
fteads, cupboards, lockers and (helves. But when 
I carried them to fee Will. Atkin’s baiket-houfe, 
they owned they never faw fuch a piece of natu- 
ral ingenuity before : I am fure^ faid one of the 
carpenters, the man that ' buUt this has no need of 
us i you need^ Sir, do nothings but give him tools. 

I divided the tools among them in this manner : 
to every man I gave a digging-fpade, a (hovel, and ■ 
a rake, as having no harrows or ploughs ; and to- 
cvery feparate place a pick-axe, a crow, a broad 
axe, and a faw, with a (lore for a general fupply, 

, (hould any be broken or worn out, I left them 
alfo nails, ftaples, hinges, hammers, chiiTels, knives; 
fcilTars, and all forts of tools and iron work j and 
for the ufe of the fmith, gave them three tons of 
unwrought iron for a fupply : and as. to arms and 
amunition, 1 ftored them even to profufion, or at 
leaft to equip a IVifficient little army againft all 
oppofers whatfoever. . 

The young man (whofe mother was unfortu- 
nately (tarved to death,) together with the maid, a 
pious and well educated young woman, feeing 
things fo well ordered on (hore (for I made them 
accompany me,) and confidering they had no oc- 
calion to go fo far a voyage as to the Egfl Indies, 
they both dedred of me, that I would leave' them

readily agreed to, ordering them a plat of ground,

and her children ; the young man, and the maid, 
who, by the way we made a wife of before our. 
departure; three favages, who were flaves; the 
tayior, fmith, (who ferved alfo as a gunfmirh,) 
and my other celebrated perfon called Jack of all

that a thoufand men might have, ranged the ifland 
a month, and looked purpofely for it, without be- 
ing able to find it, though the Spaniards had en- 
larged its boundaries, both without and within, 
in a moll furprifing manner.

young French prieft of the order of St. Beneditf, 
whofe judicious and pious difeourfes, upon fundry 
occafions, merit an extraordinary obfervation : 
nor can his being- a French Papift prieft, I pre- 
fume, give offence to any of my readers, when 
they have this aflurance from me, that he was a 
perfon of the moft courteous difpofition, exten- 
five charity, and exalted piety. His arguments 
were always agreeable to reafon^ and his^conver- 
fation the moft acceptable of any perfon that I 
bad ever yet met with iirmy life.

of his carriage, I told him he lliould not be the

upon that very account, we did not differ in points ' 
dt faith, not decent in a part of the country, 
where the poor Indians ought to be infirudled in 
the knowledge of the true God and his Soil Jefus> 
Chrifl. To this he replied, that converfation 
might eafily be feparated from difputest that he 
would difeourfe with me rather as a gentleman, 
than a religious : but that if. he did enter upon re- 
ligious arguments, upon my defiring the lame, I 
would give Him liberty to defend my own prinew 

E les. He farther added, that he would 'do all that 
ecame him in his office, as a prieft as well as a 
Chriftian, to procure the happinefs of all that was 
in the ffiip : that though he could not pray with,* 
he would pray forms, on all occafionE : and then 
he, told me feveral extraordinary events of his life, 
within a few years pafi, but particularly in this- 
laft, which was the moll remarkable : that in this 
voyage -he had the misfortune to be five times fhip- 
ped and uniliipped : his firft defign Was to have 
gone to Mar^tinico, for which taking fhip at St, 
Malo, he was forced into Lilbon by bad weather, 
the velfef running aground in the mouth of the 
Tagus ; that from, thence he went on board a Par*

tuguefe fhip, bound to the Mnderas, whofe rtiafter 
<being but an indifferent mariner, arid out of his 
reckoning, they were drove to Fial, v^hefe felling 
their comhaodity, which was corn, they refolved 
to take in their loading at the ifle of May, and to 
fail to Newfoundland ; at the banks of v;hich, 
meeting a French fliip bound to Quebec, in the 
anver of Canada, and from, thence to Martinico ; 
in this fliip he embafked, the mailer ,oF whifch dy- 
at Quebec, that voyage was fufpended and 
iafily, fliippiiig himfelf for France, this lall fliip 
was deftroyed by fire, as before has been related. 
' At this time w.e talked no further : but another 
rnorning he comes to me, juft as T Was going to 
Vifit the Engliffimen’s colony, and tells me, that 
as he knew the prorperity, of the ifland was my 
principal defire, he had fobething to communicate, 
Agreeable to tpy defign, by which perhaps he might 
put it, more than he yet thought it was, in the 
way of the benediction of Heaven. How, Sir? 
faid I, in a furprife, are we not yet in the way 
of God’s hlelfing, after all thefe fignal providences 
and deliverances, of which you have had fuch an 
ample relation ? He replied^ I hope. Sir, you are 
in the way, and that your good defign will prof- 
per : but ftill there j^re Tome among you that are 
hot equally right in their aftions ; and remember, 
Ibefeechyou, Sir, that by his crime, re- 
moved God’s blelfing from the camp of the chil- 
dren of Ifrael ; that though iix and thirty were 
entirely innocent, yet they became the obje£ts of 
divine vengeance, and bore the v/eight of the pu- 
hiftiment accordingly. . . 

So lenfibleAvas 1 touched with this difeourfe, and 
fb fatisfied With that ardent piety that. inflamed his 
foul, that I defired him to accompany- me to the 
Engliffimen’s plantations, which he was very glad 
6f, by fcafhn thefe' were the fubjefls of What he 

Y defigued

defigned to difcourfe with me about ; and while 
we walked oh together, he began in the following 
manner : ~ 

Sir, faid he, I muft confefs it is a great unhap- 
pinefs that weidifagree in feyeral doftrinal articles 
of religion ; but furely both of us acknowledge 
this, that there is a God, who having given us , 
fome Rated rules for our fervice and obedience, 
we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend 
him, either by ncglefting what he has command- 
ed, or by doing what he has forbidden us. This 
truth every Chriflian owns, that whenever any 
one prefuraptuoufly (ins againR God’s command, 
the Almighty then withdraws his bleffing from him ; 
every good man therefore, ought certainly to pre- 
vent fuch negleft of, or fin againft, God and his 
commands. I thanked the young prieft for ex- 
preffing fo great a concern for us, and defired bim 
to explain the particulars of what he had obfcr- 
ved, that, according to the parable of Achan^ I 
might remove the accurfed thing from among us. 
Why then. Sir, faid he, in the firfl: place, you 
ha^-e four Engliflimen, who have taken favage 
women to their wives, by whom they have feveral 
children, though none of them are legally mar- 
ried, as the law of God and man requires ; they, 

.1 fay, Sir,, are no lefs than adulterers, and as they 
Rill live in adultery,, are liable to the cuffe of 
God. I know. Sir, you may objeft the want of a 
prieR, or clergyman of any kind; as alfo, pen, 
ink, and paper, to write down a contrail of mar- 
riage, aqd have it figned between them. But nei- 
ther this, nor what the Spanifli governor has told 
' you of their chufing by confent, can.be reckoned 
a marriage, nor any more than an agreement to 
keep them from quarrelling among themfelves; 
for, Sir, the effence cr facrament of matrimony

fent, but in the legal obligation "Which compels 
them to own and Acknowledge one another to 
abftain from other perfons, the men to provide 
for their wives and children, and the women to 
the fame an^l like conditions, mutatis mutandis on 
their fide : whereas, Sir, thefe men, upon their 
own pleafure, on any occafion, may forfake thofe 
women, and marry others, and by difowning their 
children fuffer them utterly to perifh. Now, Sir, 
added he, can God be honoured in fuch an unla^v- 
ful liberty' as thk? how can a blefling fucceed the 
befl: endeavours, if men are allowed to live' in fo 
licentious a "vi'ay ? 1 was indeed ftruck with the 
thing myfelf, and though that they were much to 
blame, that no formal contrail had been made, 
though it had been but breaking a flick between 
them, to engage them to live as man and wife, 
never to feparate but love, cherifh, and comfort 
one another all their lives ? yet. Sir, faid T, when 
they took thefe women, I was not here; and if it 
is adultery, it is pall my remedy, and I cannot 
. help 'it. True^^ Sir, anfwered the young priell, you 
dannot be chargedwith that'faH if the crime ’which 
•was done in your ahjence ; but I btfeech you, don*t 
fiatten ybutfelf, that you are Under no obligation 
now to put a period to it ; ’which, if you negleSl t& 
do, guilt ’will be entii-ely on you alone^ Jlnce it is 
certainly in nobody^ s poiver but yours to alter their 
condition, I mult confefs, I was fo dull, that I 
thought he meant I iliould part them, and know- 
ing that this would put the whole illand in eonfu- 
lion, I told him I could not cOnfent to it upon any 
account whatfoever. Sir, faid he, in a great fur- 
_ prife, / do not mean that you Jhould feparate, hut 
marry them, by a ’written contra^, flgned by both 
man and -woman, and by all the •witneffes prefent, 
’which' ail the European la-ws decree to be p/

reafon they could have not to let him marry them, 
whofc authority in that alFair. is owned to be as 
authentic, as if they were married by any of our 
clergymen in England, 

, The next complaint he had to make to me, was 
thisj that though thefe EngHfii fubjecls of mine 
had lived with thefe women feven years, and tho* 
they were of good underftanding, and capable of 
inftrudion, having learned not ,anly to fpeak, bu| 
to read Englifh, j^et all this vvhile they had never 
taught them any thing of the Ghriftian religion; 
or the knowledge of God, much lefs in what man- 
ner he ought to be ferved* -^nd is not this an 
accountable negleSif’ faid he, warmly. Depend upon

whatever he requefted,. and defired him to proceed

into Perfia, India, and China, men who are wil- 
ling to die for the fake of God and the Chriftianr 
faith, in order to bring poor infidels into the way 
of falvation. Now, Sir, as here is an opportu- 
nity to convert feven and thirty poor favages, I 
wonder how you can pafs by fuch an occafion of 
doing good, which is* really worth the espence of 
a. man’s whole life. 

1 mufV confefs 1 was fo confounded at this dif^ 
courfe, that I could not tell how to femfwer him. 
Sii'l he, feeing me in diforder, I JJ?all be tery 
Jhrry if I have given you offence^ Noj Sir, faid I,. 
I am rather confounded,; and you know my cir- 
cumftances, that being bound to the Eaft Indies in 
a merchant ftitp, I cannot wrong the owners fo 
much, as to detain the fliip here, the men lying, 
on victuals and wages on their account. If I flay 
above ‘ twelve days, I mull pay 3 1. Sterling per 
diem demurrage, nor mufl: the lliip flay above’ 
eight days more ; fo that 1 am unable to engage 
in this work, ’unlefs-I would leave the lliip, and 
be reduced to my former condition. The priefl, 
though he owned this was hard upon me, yet laid 
it to my eonTcience, whe her .theblelfing orfaving 
feven and thirty fouls was not worth venturing, 
all that 1 had in the world ? Sir, faid I, it is very 
true t but as you are an ecclefiallic, it naturally 
falls into your profelTion why therefore 4on’t 
you rather offer to undertake it yourfelf, than 
prefs me to it ? Upon this he turned about, ma- 
king a very low bow, I moll humbly thank God 
and you, Sir, faid he, for fo bleffedacall; and 
moll willingly undertake fo glorious an office, 
which will lufficiently compenfate all the hazards, 
and difficulties I have gone through in a long and 
uncomfortable voyage. 

While be was thus fpeaking; I coulH difcover a 
rapture in his face, by his colour going^^ and co-

filing : at the fame time liis eyes fparkled Jik^fire, 
with all thp figiis of the inofl; sjealous traftfports. 
And when I aflted whether he was in carneft ; Sir, 
faid he, it w^s to preach to thejndians, I coiifent- 
ed to conic along with you; thefe infidels, even 
hi this little ifland, are infinitely of rr ore worth 
than my poor life ; if fo' that I flioOld prove the 
liappy inllrument of faving thefe poOr- creatures 
fouls, I care not if 1 never fee nfy native country 
again. One thing I only beg of you ipo're^ is, that^ 
you would leave Friday with me, to be niy inter- 
preter, without whofe afliftancc neither of us will . 
underftand each other. 

This requefl: Very fenfibly troubled me, firfti 
upon Friday *^5 being bred a proteflant, and fecond- ; 
ly, for the affeddon 1 bore to him for his fidelity : 
butlm'mediately the remembrance of Friday’s fa- ’ 
ther coming into my head, I recommended him tO 
him as having learned Spanifli, which the prieft 
alfo undreftood, and' fo was thorcugly fati'sfied > 
v/ith him. 

When we came to the Englinimen, after I had 
told them what neceflary things I had drme for 
them, Ftalked to them of the fcandalous life they ■ 
led, told them what notice the clergyman had ta- 
ken of it, and alked them If they were married 
men or batchelors ? They anfwcrrd, tv >’0 of them ; 

, were widowers, and the other three Angle men. 
But, faid I, with what confcience can you call ' 
thefe your wives, by whom you hav-e fo many ' 

■ children, and yet are not lawfully married ? They 
all faid, that they took them before the governor 
as fuch, having nobody elfe to marry thcrn, which ; 
they thought as legal as if they had had a parfon. ' 
No doubt, faid I, but in the eye of God you arev 
fo : but unlefs I am aflured of your honell: inten- 
tion never td defcrt thefe poor creatures, I can 
do nothing more for you, neither can yoii cxpeft-’

while they had breath ; and that if there was 
clergyhjan in the fliip^ they v/ould be married

I, that 1 have a mini fter with me, who lhatl mar- 
ry you to-morrow morning, if you are willing; 
fo I ^ould have you confult to-night, with the* 
reft about it. I told him, the clergyman was d 
Ffenchmanj and knew not a vvord of Englifh, but ? 
that 1 v/ould aft as a clerk between them. And' 
indeed this buiinefs met with ftich fpeedy fuccefs,?’ 
that.they all told me, in a few minutes after, that" 
they were ready to be formally married as foon’ 
as I pleafed ; with which informing the prieft, he' 
was exceedingly rejoiced. 

Nothing now remained, but that the women* 
Ihould be made fenribie of the meaning of the* 
thing*; with which being well , fatisfied, they with* 
their huibahds attended at my apartment the next' 
morning: there was my prieft, habited in a black 
veft, Tomething like a caflbe with a fafli round it, ^ 
much refemblittg a minifter, and I was his inter- 
preter. But the ferioufnefs of his behaviour, and* 
the fcruples he made of marrying the women, who 
were not baptized, gave, them an exceeding reve- 
rence for his perfon : nor indeed would he marry 
them at all, till he obtained my liberty to dif-' 
eburfe both •ndth the men and women, and then'* 
lie told than. That in the fight of all indifferent . 
men, and in the fenfe of the laws of fociety, they? 
had lived in open adultery, which nothing now 
but ' their i con fent fo marry, or final feparation,^

ny, in marrying a profefled Ghrifiian to a hea- 
then idolater, unbaptized ; but yet there was time 
enough to make them profefs the name of Chrift, 
without which nothing could be done; that, bc- 
fides, he believed themfelves very indifferent Chri- 
flians ; and confequently had not difcourfed with 
their wives upon that fubjed:; and that unlefs they 
promifed him to do fo, he could not marry them, 
as being exprefsly forbidden by the laws of God. 

All this they heard attentively, and owned rea- 
dily, But^ Lord^ Sir! faid Will Atkins to me, 
how fliould we teach them religion^ who know. no- 
thing of it ourfelves ? How can we talk to our wives 
of God,. Jefus Chrift, heaven and hell ? why^ they 
•would only laugh at us, who never yet have prac- 
tifed religion, but on the cont^-ary, all manner of 
wickednefs. Will Atkins, faid I, cannot you tell; 
your wife, fiie is in the wrong, and that her -gods 
are idols, which can neither hear, fpeak, nor un- 
derftand; but that our God, who has made, cam 
deflroy all things ; that he rewards the good, and' 
puiiilhes the wicked; and at will bring us to. 
judgment .? cannot you tell her thefe things ? . 
That’s true, faid Atkins, but then die’ll tell me, 
it is utterly falfe, lince I am not punidied and* 
fent to 'the devil, who hath been fuch a wicked 
creature. Thefe words I interpreted to the priefl: I. 
O ! faid he, tell him, his repentance will make 
him a very good mini tier to his fpoufe, and qua>- 
lify him to preach on the mercy and long-fuffering., 
of a merciful Being, who delires not the death of 
a finner, and even defers damnation to the lalt 
judgment ; this will lead liim to the above doc- 
trine, and will make him an excellent preacher to 
his wife. I repeated this to Atkins, who, being; 
more than ordinarily affefted with it, replied, I 
know all this; Sir, and a great deal more; but 
how can I have the impudence to talk thus . to my 

wife^

the earth, to himfelf, to her, the woods, and the 
trees. Immediately we could perceive him ftar| 
upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift 
up both his hands ; at which the tears ran down 
my clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfor- 
tune was, we could not hear one word that paf- 
fed between them. Another time he would em- 
brace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kifling 
her with the greateft tranfports, and then hoth 
kneel down for feme minutes together. Such rap- 
tures of joy did this occafion in my young prieft, 
that he could fcarcely contain himfelf; And a lit- 
tle after this, we obferved by her motion, as fre- 
quently lifting up her hands, and laying them on 
her bread, that fhe was mightily affeded with his 
difeourfe, and fo they withdrew from our fight. 

When we came back, we found them both wait- 
ing to be called in ; upon which we agreed to ex- 
amine him alone, and fo I began thus to difeourfe 
him. Prithee, Will. Aitkins, faid I, what educa- 
tion had yon, What was your father ? 

JVJ A. A better man than ever I fhall be ; he 
was, Sir, a clergyman, who gave me goodinftruc-

K. C. What, did you kill him with your hands ?

his heart, by the mod unnatural turn of difobe- 
dience to the tendered and bed of fathers.

W. A. No, I have neither thanked; him for his

Such fiirprifing accotint as this “wa's, proved

young clergyman, who was mightil}'^ concerned he 
could not talk to her himfelf- Sir, faid he, there

tb'niafry her t I mean, that Ihe ought to be bap-

a^ain^ afk her liulbahd, whether he has ever talk-

the natufe of faith, and redemption in and by him, 
of the Holy Spirit^ the refurredllon, lall judge-

melted into tears at this queflion, faying, that he 
had faid fomething to her of thefe things, but his 
inability to talk of them, , made him afraid leff 
her knowledge of them fhould rather make her 
contemn religion, than be benefited by it: but 
that if I would difcourfe with her, it would be 
very evident my labour would not be in vain. Ac- 
cordingly I'called her in, and placing myfelf as in- 
terpreter between the religious prieff and the -vVo- 
man, 1 intreated him to go on ; but furely never 
was fuch a fermon preached by any clergyman in 
thefe latter days, with fo much zeal, knowledge, 
and fincerity ;■ in Ihort, he brought the woman to 
embrace the knowledge of Chriif, and of redemp- 
tion'by him, with fo furprifing a degree of under- 
ftanding, that ftje made it her own requefl to be 
baptized. 

He then performed his office in the facrament

the woman being made a Ghriftian, lie married

fedionately exhorted him to lead a holy life for-

live to return to his own country, where he might , 
have a far better choice. At thefe words, fmiling, . 
he interrupted me, thanking me for my good’ ad-

mindful of him when I returned to England, but 
give his letters to his friends ; and that when he 
was redeemed, the plantation and all its improve- 
ments, however valuable, fliould be returned to 
me again. Bus as for the marriage be propofed, 
that it was not himfelf, but that it .was between 
my Jack of all trades, and the maid Sufan. 

' I was indeed agreeably furprifed at the mention- 
ing this match, which leemed very fuitaWe, the 
one being a very ingenious fellow, and .the other 
an excellent, dexterous, and fenfible houfewife, 
fit to begovernefs of the whole illand : fo we mar* 
ried them the fame day ; and as .1 was her father, 
and gave her away, fo I gave her a handfome por- 
tion, appointing her and her hulband a convenient 
large fpace of ground for their plantation. The 
lharing out of the land I left to Will. Atkins, who 
really divided it very juftly to every perfon’s fa- 
tisfadtion : they only delired one general writing 
under niy hand for the whole, which I caufed to 
Te drawm up, llgned, and fealed to them, fetting 
out their btmnds, and giving them a right to the 
whole poflelTion of their rcfpcdlive plantations, 
with their improvements, to them and their heirs, 
referving all the reft of the illand as ray own pro- 
perty, and a certain rent for every particular 
plantation aftdr eleven years. As to their laws and 
government, I exhorted them to love one another: 
atid as to the Indians who lived in a nook by them- 
felves, I allotted three or four of them planta- 
tions, and the refl willingly chofe to become fer- 
vantS"to the other families, by which means they 
were employed in uleful labour, and fared much 
tetter ihan they did before Belldes, the favages 
being thus mixed with the Chriftiatis, the work of 
their converlion might be fet on foot by the latter, 
in the clergyman’s abfence, to uur equal fatisfac- 
tior. The young priell, however, was a little

I therefore told him, we flioultl call them all toge-

were Papifts^ and I to the Englifh who were Pro-r 
teftants, and make them promife that they rwould 
never make any diftinftion in religion, but teacft 
the general true knowledge of God, and his fon 
Jefus Chrift, iri order to convert the poor fava- 
ges : and this indeed they all promifed us accord‘d 

When I came to Will Atkin’s houfe, I foujtd 
his baptised wife, and the young woman newly 
married to mj' Jack' of all trades, were become 
great intimates, and difcouding of religion toger 
ther. O Sir, fays Will. Atkins, when God hag 
jinners to reconcile to himlelf, he never wants an 
inftruftor ; I knew I was unworthy for fo good a 
work, and therefore this young wmman has been 
fent hither as it were from Heaven, Who is fuffi- 
cientyto convert a whole jfland of layages. Thd ‘ 
young woman bluflied, arid was: going to rife ; b'-it 
1 deftred her to fit ftill, and'hoped that God \Vduld 
blefsher in fo good a work : and then pullulg out 
a bible, (which I brought on purpofe in my poc- 
ket for him J. Here Atkin's, faid i), here is an'af? 
ftftant that perhaps you had not before. So con- 
founded was the, poor man, that it w|^ fome time 
before he could, fpeak ; at laft turning to his wife,. 
My dear, he faid, did I not tell you that God 
could hear what we faid ? Here’s the book I pray?

God then heard us, and now has; fent it. The 
woman was furprifed, and thought really GTod had 
fent that individual bodk from heii'enirbut I turn-

cannot" be expreiTed ; no man being more thankfub 
for any thing in the world, than he was for his^ 
Bible, xior deGred it from a better principle, 
i After fevefal religious? difeourfes, I delired thei 
young:woman to give me an account of the ahs 
guiih file felt when flie was flarving to death for 
hunger ; to which, {he readily confented, and be- 
gan in the following manner r 

“ Sir,” faid jfhe,“ all our visuals being gone, 
^fter I had failed one day, my ftomach was very 
iickilli, and at the approach of night, I was inplins 
ed to yawning,, and fleepy. When I flept upon 
the couch three hours, I awaked a little refrefheda 
three hours after ray ftomach being more and more 
ftckifli, 1 lay down again, l)ut could not fleep, be-f 
ing very faint, and ill. Thus I pafTed the I’econd 
day with a ftrange variety, firft hunger,^ then lick 
again, with Teachings to vomit : that night 1 
dreamed I was at Barbadoes, buying plenty of 
provifions, and dined heartily. But when 1 awa^ 
iced, my fpirits were exceedingly, funk, to find my-* 
felf in the extremity of famine. There was but 
one glafs of wine, which being mixed with fiigar^ 
1 drank up: but for want of fubftance to digeli 
upon, the fumes of it got into my head, and made 
me fenfelefs for fome time. The third day 1 was 
fo ravenous and furious, that I could have eaten 
a little child if it had comeftn -my w:ay ; dhsing 
which time I was as madias any creature in bed^ 
lam. In one of thefe fits I fell down, and ftruck 
my face againft the corner of a pallet bed, wher& 
my miftrefs lay : . the blood gulhed out of ihy nofe^ 
but by m.y excefliye bleeding, both the violence of 
the fever, and the ravenous part of the hunger a.i 
bated. After this I grew fick again^ ftrove to vo-

niit, but could not} then Bleeding a fecond time^ 
I fwooned away as dead } when I came to myfelf I 
had a dreadful gnawing pain in my ftomach, which 
went ofF towards night-, with a longing defire for 
food. I took a draught of water and fugar, but 
it came up again ; then 1 drank water without 
fugar, and that flaid with me. 1 laid tne dov\m on 
the bed, praying God would take me away ; after 
1 had numbered, i thought myfelf a-dying, there- 
fore recommended my foul to God, and wifhed 
fome body would throw me into the fea. All this 
>vhile my -departing miflrefs lay by me ; the laft 
bit of bread Ihe hatj, fhe gave it to her deal* child, 
my young mailer. The; morning after, I fell in- 
to a violent pallioi) of crying, and after that into 
hunger. 1-efpied the blood that came from my 
nofe in a bafon, which I immediately fwallowed 
up. At night I had the ufual variations, as pain 
in the llomach, lick, lleepjr, and ravenous ; and 
I had no thought but that 1 fliould die before mor- 
riing In the morning came on terrible gripings 
in my bowels. At this time I heard my young 
maftcr’s lamentations, by which I underllood his 
mother was dead: J'oon after the failors cried, A 
fali^ a fnil-t hallowing as if they were dillradled, 
for joy of that relief, which afterwards we re- 
ceived from your hands.” 

. Surely never was a more dillind account of 
flarving to death than this. But to return to the 
difpofi^ion of things among my people, I did not 
take any notice to them of the Hoop that I had 
framed, neither would 1 leave them the two pieces 
oF brals cannon, or the two quarter-deck guns 
that I had on board, left, upon any difguH, they

274 LIFE ANn AD V'EN'FITRES^ 

there were only one hundred and twenty ; too' 
many indeed for us, fex'eral of their canoes con- 
taining about fixteen or feventeen men. 

As they approached us, they feemed to be in 
the greatert amazement, not knovv-ing what to 
make of us. They rowed round the fhip, which 
occafioned us to call to the men in the boats not’ 
to fuffer them tb conie near them. Hereupon they' 
beckoned'to the favages to keep back, wliich they] 
accordingly did; but at their retreat they let fiy 
_about fifty arrows among ds, and very much- 
wounded one of our men in the longboat. I cal-' 
led to them not to fire upon any account, but 
handing them down fome deal boards, the carpen-’ 
ters inade diem a kind, of a fence to Shield theta ^ 
from the arrows. In half an hour dfter they came 
fo near afterh of usy that we had a perfed fight 
of theta; then they rowed a little farther out, till’ 
they came direftly alongfide of us, and then ap- = 
preached fo near us, as they could hear us fpeak ; 
this made me order all our men to keep clofe, and 
get stheir guns' ready; In the taean time I order- ' 
dd Friday fO' go but' Upon deck, and aik them in ;

who fell under the cloud of three hundred arrows, 
not lefs than feven piercing' through his body, kil- 
ling one of the bell fervants, and faithfulleil of 
companions in all niy folitudes and affliftions. 

So enraged was I at the death of poor Friday, 
that the guns, which before were charged with 
only powder, to frighten theta, I ordered to be 
loaded with finall fliot ; nor did the gunners fail

in tiieir aim, but at thisrbroadiide fplit, and over-, 
fet rhirtpen oi* fourteen ot their canoes, wliich 
killed numbers of them, and fet the reft a-f\vira- 
■ining : the others, frightened out of their wits, 
little regarding their fellows drowning, fcpured 
away as fall; as they could. One poor wretch our 
people took up, fwimming for his life, an hour 
after. He was very fullen at firft, fo that he 
would neither eat nor fpcak: but i took a way to 
cure him, by ordering them rethrow him into the 
fea,. which they did, and then he came fwimming 
back like a cork, calling in his tongue, as I fup- 
pofe, to fave him. So we took him on board, but 
it was a long time before we could make him 
Ipeak or underftand Englifh ; yet when we had 
taught him, he told us, they were going with, 
their kings to fight a great battle ; and when we 
aiked him, what made them come up to us ? he 
faid, io makes de great "wonder look : where it is to 
be noted, that thofe natives, and thole of Africa, 
always add two e’s at the end of Englilh words, 
as makee^ takee^ and the like, from which it is a 
very difficult thing to make them break off. 

Being mow under fail, we took our lafl: farewel 
of , poor honeO: Friday, apd interred him \vith all 
poflible decency and folemniry ; putting him into 
a coffin, and committing him to the deep, at the 
fame time cauling eleven guns to be fired for him. 
Thus ended the life of one of the moll grateful, 
faithful, honcll, and afFeftionate fervants, that e- 
ver any man was bleffed with in the world. 

Having now a fair wind for Bralils, in about 
twelve days time we made land; in the latitiide of 
five degrees fouth of the line. Four days we kept 
on S. by E. in fight of fliore, when we made cape 
St. Augulline, and in three days we came to an 
anchor off the bay of AIL Saints. I had great diffi-

with them. By this floop, among other things, I 
fent my fubjcfts 3 milk-cows and 5 calves, 'about 
22 hogs, 3 lows big with pig, 2 mares and a flone- 
horfe. I alfo engaged three Portugal women to 
go for fake of the Spaniards, which, v/ith the per- 
fecuted man’s two daughters, were fufficient,'fmce 
the refl had wives of their own, though in ano- 
ther country: all which cargo arrived fafe, no 
doubt, to their exceeding comfort, who, with' 
this addition, were about lixty or feventy people, 
befides children. 

At this place my truly lionefl and pious clergy- 
man left me ; for a fliip being ready to fet fail for 
Lilbon, he alked me leave to go thither j but I

failed for the Indies, but we heard no more of 
them. 

In our pafTage we touched at the ifland of Mada- 
gafcar, where, though the inhabitants are natu- 
rally fierce and treacherous, and go conftantly 
-.armed with bows and lances, yet for fome time 
they treated us civily enough ; and, in exchange 
for knives, fciflars, and other trifles, they brought 
'us eleven good fat bullocks, which we took part- 
ly for prefent frefli viduals, and the remainder to 
fait for the fhip’s ufe. 

So curious was I to view every corner of the 
world where I came to, that I went on fliore as 
often as 1 could. One evening, when on fhore, 
,we obferved numbers of .the people {landing ga- 
zing at us at a diilance. We thought otirfelves 
'' ill no danger, as they had hitherto ufed us kindly. 
However, we cut three boughs out of a tree, 
flicking them at a diflance from us, which, it feems, 
in that country, is not only a token of truce and 
.amity, but when poles or boughs are fet up on 
the other fide, it is a fign the truce is accepted. 
In thefe treaties, however, there, is one principal 
thing to be regarded, that neither party come 
beyond one another’s three poles or boughs; fo that 
the middle fpace is not only fecure, but is alfo allow- 
ed,as a market for traffic and commerce : when the 
truce is thus accepted, they flick up their javelins 
and lances at the firft poles, and come on unarm- 
ed ; but if any violence is offered, away they rvm 
to their poles, take up their weapons, and then 
the truce is at an end. This evening it happened 
that a greater number of people than ufual, both 
men and women, traded among us for fuch toys 
as we had, with fuch great civility, that we made 
us a little tent of large boughs of trees, fome of 
themed refolving to lye on fliore all night. But, 
for my part, i and fome others took our lodging - 

in 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. l7f 

in the boat, with boughs of trees fpread over it, 
having a fail fpread at the bottom to lye upOn. 
About two o’clock in the morning, we were awa.^ 
kened by the firing of mulkets, and our men cry- 
ing out for help, or elfe they would all be mur- 
dered. Scarce had we time to get the boat afhore, 
when our men came plunging themfelves into thd 
water, with about four hundred of the iflanders 
at their heels. We took up fev'en of the men; 
three of them very much wounded, and one left 
behind killed, while the enemy poured their ar- 
rows fo thick among us, that we were forced to 
make a barricade, with boards lying at the fide of 
the boat, to fhield us from danger : and having 
got ready our fire-arms, we returned them a vol- 
ley, which wounded feveral of them, as we could 
hear by their cries. In this condition We lay till 
break of day, and then making fignals of dillrefs 
to the Ihip, which, . my nephew the captain heard 
hnd underfiood, he weighed anchor and flood as 
hear the fhore as poffible, and then fent another 
boat with ten hands in her to affifl us ; but we caf- 
led to them not to come near, informing them of 
onr unhappy condition. However, they ventti- 
red ; when one of the men taking the end of a 
tow-line in his one hand, and keeping our boat 
between him and our adverfaries, fwam on board 
us, and made fall our line to the boat ; upon- this, 
flipping our cables, they towed us out of the reach 
of their arrows, and quickly after, a broadfide 
was given them from the fliip, which mac|e a moft 
dreadful havock among them. When we got on 
board, we examined into the occafion of this fray ; 
the men who fle^ informed us, that an old wo- 
man, who fold milk within the poles, had brought 
a young woman with her, who carried roots or 
herbs, the fight of whom fo much tempted onr 
men, that they offered rudenefs to the maid, at

which the old woman fet up a great cry j nor 
would the' fail ors part with the prize, but carried 
her among the trees, while the old woman went 
and brought a whole , army down upon them. At 
the beginning of , the attack one of our men was 
killed with a lance, and the fellow, who began 
the mifchief, paid dear enough for his miflrefs, 
though as yet we did not know what had .become 
of him ; the rell luckily efcaped. The third night 
after the action, being curious to underlland how 
affairs ftood, I took the fupercargo, and twenty 
flout fellows with me, and landed about two hours 
before midnight, at the fame place where thofe , 
Indians flood the night before, and there we di- 
vided ouB- men into two bodies, the boatfwain 
commanding one, and I another. It was fo dark, 
that we could fee nobody, neither did we hear 
any voice near us: but by and by the boatfwain 
“falling over a dead body, we agreed to halt till 
the moon fliould rife, which we knew v/ould be 
in an hour after. We perceived here no fewer 
than two and thirty bodies upon ^ the ground, 
whereof two were not quite dead. Satisfied with 
this difeovery, I was for going on board again ; 
but the boatfwain, and the reft told me, they 
woifld make a vifit to the Indian town^ where 
thofe dogs, fo they called them, refided, afking 
me at the fame time to go along with them; for 
they did not doubt, befides getting a good booty, 
bpt they fhould find Tom Jeffery there, for that 
was the unhappy man we miffed. But I utterly 
refufed to go, and commanded them back, being 
unwilling to hazard their lives, as the fafety of 
the Ihip wholly depended upon them. Notwith- 
ftanding all 1 could fay to them, they all left me 
but one, and the fupercargo: fb we three return- 
ed to the boat, where a boy was left, refolving 
-to flay till they returned. At parting I told theiji

I fuppoied moft of them would' run :he fame fate 
with Tom. JelFery. To this they rej)lied, Come 
l>o^s^ come along^ we^ll viarraut iveUl come off fafe 
enough : and fo away they went, notwithftanding, 
all my admonitions, either concerning their own 
fafety, or the prefervation of the fliip. Indeed 
they were gallantly armed, every man having x 
mufket, bayonet, and a piflol, befides cutlafles, 
hangers, pole-axes, and hand-granadoes.. They 
came to a few Indian houfes at firfl, which not: 
being the town they expected, they went farther, 
and finding a cow tied to a tree, they concluded 
that file would be a fufficient guide, and fb it pro-' 
fred ; for after they unt'ed her, file led them di- 
really to the town, which conllfted of above two 
hundred houfes, feveral families living in forae of 
the huts together. At their arrival, all being in 
a profound fleep, the failors agreed to drvidethem- , 
felves info’ three bodies, and fet three parts of 
the town on fire at once, to kill thofe that were 
efcaping-, and plunder the refl of the houfes* Thus 
defperately refolved: they went to work ; but the 
firfl party had not gone far, before they called 
out to the reft, that they had found Tom. Jaf- 
fery ; whereupon they all ran up to the place,, 
and found the poor fellow indeed hanging up na- 
ked by one arm, and his throat cut almoft from 
ear to ear :■ in a houfe that was hard by the tree 
they found fixteen or feventeen Indians, who hath 
been concerned in the fray, two or three of them, 
being wounded, who were not gone to fleep;. this 
houfe they fet on fite flrft, and in a few minutes 
after, five or fix places more in the town appear- 
ed in flames* The conflagration fpread like wild- 
fire, their ' houfes being all of wood, and covered 
with flags or ruflies. The poor affrighted inhabi- 
tanrs endeavoured to run out to fave their lives,, 
but: they were driven back into the flames by the.

together in bodies. - By this time the whole towm 
.was in a flame, yet their fury rathef increafed,'

Jeffery. The terrible light of this conflagration 
jnade ine very uneafy, and roufed my nephew the 
captain, and the relt of his men, who knew no-*- 
thing of the matter. When he perceived the dread- 
ful fmoke, and heard the guns go off, he readily 
concluded his men were in danger; he therefore 
takes another boat, and comes afhore himfelf, with 
thirteen men well armed. He was greatly fur- 
priled to fee me and only two men in the boat, 
but more fo when 1 told him. the Rory ; but tho’’ 
,1 argued with him, as 1 did wdth liis men, about 
the danger of the voyage, the interefls of the: 
merchants and. owners, and the fafety.of the Ihip,, 
yet my nephew, like the red, declared, that he; 
would rather lole the fliip, his voyage, bis life^ 
and all, than his men fliould be loll for want of 
help : and fo away he went. For my part, feeing 
him refolved to go, I had not power to Ray be- 
hind. He ordered the pimiace bac.k again tor 
twelve men more, and then we marehed direRly- 
.as the flame guided us. But furely. never vvas 
fuch a feene of horror befield, or more difmak

Drogheda in Ireland, - where he neither fpared" 
man, woman, nor child. 

The firrt:. objeft, I think, met with, was the 
ruins of one of their habitations, before which, 
lay four nWn and three women killed, and two 
more burnt to death among the fire, which was 
now decaying. Nothing could appear more bar- 
barous than this revenge; none more cruel than 
the authors of it. As we went on, the fife in- 
creafed, and the cry proceeded in proportion. Wc' 
had not gorre much farther, when we beheld three 
naked women, followed by fixteen or feventeen 
men, flying with the greatcfl: fwiftnefa-from our 
men,, who fhot one of them in our fight. When 
they perceived, us whom thev fuppofed alfo theii* 
murderers, they fer up a mofl dreadful fhriek, and. 
both of them, fvvooned away in the fright. This 
w'as a light which might have foftened the hardefl 
heart ; and in pity v^e took fome ways to let them 
know we would not hurt them, v^hile the poor 
creatures with bended knees, and lift-up hands,, 
made piteous lamentations to us to fave their lives., 
1 ordered our men not to hurt a^ny of the poor- 
creatures vvbatfoever j but being willing to un- 
derhand the occafion of all this, 1 went' among 
^efe unhappy w'l etches, whomeither underftood. 
me, nor the good! meant them blowevcr, be- 
ing reiblved to put an end to this barbarity, I 
ordered the men to follow me. We had not gone 
fifty yards before we came up with the boatfwain,, 
with, four of our men at his heels, all of them - 
covered with bloodand duh, and in fearch of more 
people, to fatiate their vengeance, As foon as we 
favv them we called out, and- made them underhand- 
who we were; upon which they came up to us,, 
fetting up a halloo of triumph^ in token that more 
kelp was come. Koble captain, faid he to my

done with thefe vlllanous hell-hound dog?, we’lF 
root out the Very nation of them from the earthy, 
and kill more than poor Tom has hairs upon his 
head : and this he went on till I interrupted him. 
Blood thirlly dog ! laid I, will your cruelty never 
end? I charge you touch not one creature more ; 
Hop your hands, and (land flill, or you’re a dead 
man this moment. \Vhy, Sir, faid he, you neither

have done; but pray come hicher, and behold an 
inftance of compaflion, if fuch can merit your 
clemency; and with that he fiiewcd me the poor 
fellow vvith his throat cut, hanging upon the tree. 

Indeed here was enough to fill their breafls with., 
rage, wh'ch howevcrl thought had gone too far, 
agreeable to thsie \vords of Jacob to his fons Si- 
meon and Levi : Curfid be their anger for it -was 
fierce ; and their wrath for it was cruel. But this., 
fight made my nephew and the reft as bad as they; 
nay, my nephew declared, his concern was only- 
for his men ; as for the people, not a foul of them- 
ought to live. Upon this the boatfwain and eight 
• more direclly turned about, and went to finilh the 
intended tragedy ; which being out of my power 
to prevent, I returned back both from' the difinal. 
fight, and’ the piteous cries of thofe unfortunate 
creatures, who were made vidims to their fury.- 
Indeed it was an eggregious piece of folly in me to 
return to the boat with but one attendant ; and I 
had very near paid for it, having narrowly efca- 
ped forty armed Indians, who had been alarmed 
by the conflagration ; but having palTed the place 
where they ftood, I got to the boat accompanied- 
with the fupercargo, and fo went on board, fend- 
ing the pinnace back again, to allift the men ifi 
^vhat might happed. When I had got to the boat,, 
the fire was almoft extinguifiied, and the noife was^ 
abated; but I hadfcarce been half an hour on board 
‘ the 



or ROBINSON CRUSOj:. 285 

the (hip, when I heard* another volley given by 
our failors, and a great fmoke, which, as I after- 
wards found, was our men falling upon rhofc hpufes 
and perfons that ftood between them and the fea : 
but here they fpared the wives and children, and 
killed only the men, to the number of about fix- 
teen or feventeen. By the time they got to the 
(hore, the pinnace and the (liip’s boat were rea- 
dy to receive them, and they all got fafe on board, 
not a man of them having received the lead hurt,- 
except two, one of whom drained his foot, and 
the other burnt hi? hand a little ; for they met 
with no reiidance, the poor Indians being unpre- 
pared, amazed, and confounded. 

I was extremely angry with everyone of them, 
but particularly with the captain, who, , indead of 
cooling the rage of the men, had prompted them 
on to farther mifehief, nor could he make me any 
other excufe, but that as he was a man he could 
not niader his paflions, at the light of one of his 
men fo cruelly murdered. As for the red, know- 
ing they were not under my command, they took 
no notice of my anger; but rather boafled of their^ 
revenge. According to all their accounts, they 
killed or dedroyed about one hundred and fifty 
men, women, and children, befidcs burning the 
town to afltes. They took their companion Tom 
Jeffery from the tree, covered him with fome of 
the ruins, and fo left him. But however this ac- 
tion of our men might feeni to them judifiable, 
yet I always openly condemned it with the appel- 
lation of the MaJJacre of Madagafcar. For tho’ 
they had flain this Jeffery, yet certainly he was 
the fird aggreffor, by attempting to violate th& 
chadity of a young innocent woman, who ven- 
tured down to them on the faith of the public ca- 
pitulation, which was fo treacheroufly broken. 

While we were under fail, the boa tfw a in would 

oftea 


a86 LIFE and ADVENTURES 

often defend this bloody action, by faying, that 
the Indians had broke the truce the night before^ by 
Jhooting one of our men without provocation ; and 
tho' the poor fellow had taken a Utile liberty with 
the wench^ he ought not to have been murdered in, 
fo v>illainous a manner : and that they had adled 
nothing but what the divine laws 'commijjioned to be 
done to fuch homicides. However, I was in the 
fame mind as before, telling them that they were 
murderers, ,ard bid them depend upon it, that 
God would blafl their voyage for fuch an unpa- 
ralleled piece of barbarity. 

When we came into the gulf of Perfia, five of 
our men, who ventured on fhore, were either kil- 
led or made flayes by the Arabians, the reft of 
them having fcarce time to efcape to their boat. 
This made me upbraid them afrefli with the juft 
retribution of Heaven for fuch aftions ; upon 
which the boatfwain very warmly allied me, whe- 
ther thofe men, on whom the tower of Siloanr 
fell were greater finners than the reft of the Ga- 
lileans ; and befides. Sir, faid he, none of thefe 
five poor men that are loft were with us at the. 
malTacre of Madagafcar, as you call it, and there- 
fore your reprehenfion is very unjuft, and your 
application improper, Befides, added he, you are 
continually uling the men very ill, upon this ac- 
count, and being but a palTenger yourfelf, we are 
not obliged to bear it ; nor can we tell what ill 
defigns you may have to bring us‘ to judgment for 
it in England ; and therefore if you do not leave 
this difcourfe, as alfo not concern yourfelf with 
any of our affairs, 1 will leave the fliip, and not 
fail among fuch dangerous company. 

All -this I heard very patiently; but it being of- 
ten repeated, I at length told him, the concern I 
had on board was none of his bulinefs ; that I was 
a conliderabie owner in the fliip, and therefore 

had 



o r ROBINSON CRUSOE. 287 

liad a right to fpeak in common, and that I was no 
way accountable to him, nor to any body elfe.’ As 
no more paffed for fome time after, I thought all 
had been over. At this time we were in the road 
of Bengal, where, going on lliore with the fuper- 
cargo, one day, in the evening, asl waspreparing 
to^go on board, one of the men came to me, and 
told me, 1 need not trouble myfelf to come to the 
boat, for thaft the cockfwain and others had ordev- 
ed him not to carry me on board any more. This 
infolent meflage much furprifed me; yet I gave 
him no anfwer to it, but went direftly and ac- 
quainted the fupercargo, intreaung him to go on 
board, and by acquainting the captain with it, 
prevent the mutiny which I perceived would hap- 
pen, But before I had fpoken this,- the matter 
was effeded on board : for no fooner was he gone 
off in the boat, but the boatfwain, guiiner, cai'- 
penter, and all the inferior officers, came to the 
quarter-deck, defiring to fpeak with the captain ; 
and there the boatfwain made a long harangue, 
exclaiming againll me, as before mentioned ; that 
if I had not gone albore peaceably for my own di- 
^erfion, they by violence would have compelled 
me for their fatisfa^Hon ; that as they had (hipped 
with the captain, fo they would faithfully ferve 
him ; but if 1 did not quit the Ihip, or the captain 
oblige me to it, they would leave the ffiip imme- 
diately ; hereupon, turnirg his face about by way 
of hgnal, they all cried out, 0„v£ and ALL, 
C-NE and ALL. 

You may be fure, that though my nephew was 
a man of great courage, yet he could not but be 
furprifed at their fudden and unexpcded behavi- 
our : and though he talked floutly to them, and 
afterwards expoflulated with them, that in com- 
racn juilice to me, who was a confiderablfe owner 
in the fliip, they could not turn me, as it were,

out of ray own houfe, which might bring their 
Jives in danger, fliould they ever be taken in En- 
gland : nay, though he invited the boatfwain on 
Ihore to accommodate matters* with me, yet all 
this, I fay, fignified nothing:: they would have 
nothing to dp vvith me, and they were refolved to 
go on Ihore, if I came on board. Well, faid my 
iiephew, if you are fo refolved, permit me to talk 
with him, tind then I have done: and fo he came 
to me, giving me an account of their refolution, 
how one and all deligned to forfake the fliip when 
I canie on board, for which he was mightily con- 
cerned. I am glad to fee you, nephew, faid I, 
and rejoice it is ho worfe, iince they have not re- 
belled againll you : 1 only delire yoti to fend my 
hecelTary things on Ihore, with a fufficient fum of 
ihoney, and I will find my w,ay to England as well 
as I can. Though this grieved my nephew to the 
heart, yet there was ho^ remedy but compliance j 
in lliort, all my necelTaries were fent me,' and fo 
this matter was over in a few hours, 

I think I was now near a thoxifand leagues far- 
ther off England by fea than at my little kingdom, 
except this difference', that I might travel by land 
over the Great Mogul’s country to Surat, from 
thence up to Baffbra, by fea tip the Perfian gulpb, 
then take the way of the caravans over the Afa- ^

glifli goods I had with me of great Value, beOdes 
a thoufand pieces of eight, and a letter of credence 
for more, if there was any fuch neceffity. The 
goods I foon difpofed of to advantage, and bought 
here feveral good diamonds, which I could eafdy 
carry about with me. One morning the Englifh 
merchant came to me, as being very intimate to- 
gether^ Countryman., faid hb, I have a projecf to 
communicate to you., nohich,, I hope., ’will fuH to both 
our advantage. To be Jl:ort., Sir, "we are both in a 
remote part of the 'world from our country, hut yet 
in a place 'where nlen of, hufinefs may get a great 
deal of money. No'w, if you ■will put a thoufand

merchant, and ■we'll go a trading voyage to China ; 
for 'why Jhould -we lye fill like drons, 'while the 
vjhole -world is in a continual motion. 

This propofal foon got my confent, being very 
agreeable to my rambling genius ; and the more 
fo, becaufe I looked upon mj'’ countryman 10 be a 
very liiicere perfon ; it required fome time before 
we Could get a velTel to our mind, and failors to 
inan it according1J'>; at length we bought a fhip, 
and got an Englifh mate, boatfwafn, and gunner, 
a Ontch carpenter, and three Portuguefe foremaft- 
men; and, for want of others, made fliift with 
Indian feamen. We firfl; failed to Achin, in the 
ifland of Sumatra, and then to Siam, where we 
bartered otir wares for fome arrack and opium, 
the lafl of which bore a great pride among the 
Chinefe ; in a word, we w'ent up to'Suflcan, ma- 
king a very great Voyage ; and, after eight months 
time, I returned to Bengal, very well ^ fatisfied 
with- this adventure, having not only got a'fuffi- 
cient quantity of money, but an infight of getting 
a great deal more. 

The next voyage my friend propofed to me,* 

B b ■w'ds 


290 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

was to go among the Spice iflands, and bring homd 
a load ot cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts, 
iflands belonging partly to Spain, but where the 
ljutch trade very confiderably* We were not 
long preparing for this voyage, which we made 
no lels fuccefstul than the laft, touching at Bor- 
nea, and feveral other places which I do not per- 
Icdlly remember, and returning home in about five 
months time. We Toon fold our fpices, which 
were chiefly cloves, and fome nutmegs, to the 
Perfian merchant's, who carried them awky for 
the gulph; and, in fliort, making five to one ad- 
vantage, we were loaded with moneys 

Not long after my friend and I had made up our 
accounts, to our entire fatisfadlion, there came in 
a Dutch coafler from Batavia, of about two hun- 
dred tons. The crew of this veflel pretended 
themfelves fo fickly, that there were not hands 
fufficient to undertake a voyage, and the captain 
having given out that he intended to go to Europe, I 
public notice was given that the fiiip was to be 
ibid. No fooner did this come to our ears, but 
we bought the fliip, paid the mailer, and took 
pofleflion. We would alfo haye very willingly 
entertained fome of the men ; but they having 
received their fliare of booty, were not to be 
found, being all together fled to Agra, the great- 
city of the Mogul’s relidencej and from thence 
Were to travel to Surat, and fo by fea to the Per- 
fian gulph. And indeed they had reafon to fly in 
this manner : for the truth of it was, the pre- 
tended captain was the gunner only, and not the 
commander : that having been on a trading voy- 
age, they were attacked on fliore by the Malay- 
ans, who killed three men, and the captain rafter 
whofe death the other eleven men run away with 
the fltip to the bay of Bengal, and left the mate 
and other five men more on fhore ; but of this af-

fair we fliall have occafion to fpeak at more length 
hereafter. 

• However they came by the Ihip, we thought 
we bought it hondtly ; neither did we fufpeft any 
thing of the matter ; when the man fliewed us a 
bill of fale for the ihip (undoubtedly forged) to one 
Emanuel Cloftcrlhoven, which name he went by. 
And fo without any more to do, we picked up 
fome Dutch and EriglHli feamen, refolving -for 
another voyage for cloves among the Philippian 
and Malacca iflands ; in fliort, we continued thus 
five or fix years, trading from port to port with 
extraordinary fuccefs ; in the fev^enth year we 
undertook a voyage to China, defigning to touch 
at Siam, and buy fome rice by the way. In this 
voyage, contrary winds beat us up and down for 
a confiderable time among the iflands in the ftraits . 
of Malacca. No fooner were we clear of thofe 
rugged feas but we perceived our fliip had fprung 
a leak, which obliged us to put into the river 
Cambodia, which lyes northward of the gulph, and 
goes up to Siam. 

One day as I was on fliore refrefhing myfelf, 
there comes to me an Englifhman, Who was a 
giinner’s mate on board an Englifti Eaft India fliip,

faid he, to be fhort, beeaufe time is precioas, th^t

danger 't and therefore^ if you have any regard to 
your life, and the lives of your men, take the ad- 
vantage, without fail, of futting out to fea at high 
water ; by which means, as you have a whole tide 
before you, you will be gone too far out of their 
reach before they can come down. 

I am mighty well fatisfied, faid I, in this parti- 
cular, and of your kindnefs, which merits my 
greateft efteera ? pray, Sir, what amends fliall I 
make you ; He replied, 1 know not what amends 
you are willing to make, becaufe you may have fome 
doubts of its certainty ; ' hut to convince you of the 
truth of wbat I fay, I have one off er to make to you. 
On hoard one of the Englijh Jhips, I have nineteen 
months pay due to me, and this Dutchman that is 
with me has fven months pay due to him, which if 
you will make good to us, we will go along with you. 
If you Jhall find, that there is nothing in what we 
have faid, then we fhall defire nothing ; hut when 
you are convinced that we have favedthe fhip, your 
life, and the lives of the men, we will leave the 
whole to your generofity. 

So realbnable did this every vvay appear, that 
I immediately confehted, and we went direftly on 
board. As foon as we came on board, my part- 
ner calls joyfully out. That they had flopped the

fing a moment^s time; upon which in great fur- 
Pfile, the captain was called, who immediately 
ordered the anchor to be got upj and though the 
tide was not quite down, yet being allifled with a 
little land breeze, we flood out to fea. I then 
called my partner into the cabin, and related the

Scarce had wc finiflied our difcburfe, upon this' 
head, but a failor came to the cabin-door, with a 
inefTage from the captain, that we w’ere chaled' 
by five floops Full of armed men. Very well, faid 
I, it Is plain now there is fomethiug in it. And 
fo- going upon deck, 1 told all the men there vras 
a defign for feizing the fliip, and of executing us 
for pirates ; and allied them, whether they would 
faithfully (land by us, and by one another.^' Ta 
which they unanimoufly replied, that they would 
fight to their lall drop of blood. I then afked the 
, captain, which w ay he thought beft for us to rn.a- 
nage the battle.'^ Sir, laid he, the^only method is 
to keep them off nviih our great /hot as lon^ as ’we 
are ahle^ and then have recourfe to our fmall arms t 
and "when both thefe fail us, then retire to clofe 
quarters-, "when perhaps the enemy, "wanting mate- 
rial's^ can neither break open our balk headr, nor 
get in upon us. Mean time the gunner was order- 
ed to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of 
the fteerage, and fo load them with mulliet bullets,, 
and fmall pietes of old iron ; and the deck being 
cleared, we prepared for the engagement, ftill 
how'cver, keeping out at fea. The boats follow'- 
ed us with all the fail they could make, and we 
could perceive the two foremofl: were Englilhy 
which outfailed the reft by two leagues, and which 
we found w'ould come up with us ; hereupon we 
fired a guii without ball, intimating that they Ihould 
bring to, and we put out a flag of truce, as a 
lignal for parley ; but finding them crouding after 
usi till they came within fliot, w e took in ojjr 
white, and hanging out the red flag, immediately 
fired at them with ball we then called to thent 
with a fpeaking trumpet, bidding them at their 
peril keep blF. 

' But all this fignified notliing j for depending up-

^ on the ftrength that followed them, they were 
refolutely bent for mifchief ; hereupon 1. ordered 
them to bring the (hip to, by which means, they 
laying upon our broadfide, we let fly at them at 
once, one of whom carried away the ftern of jthe 
hindermoft boat, and obliged them not only to 
take dovvn their fail, but made them all run to the 
head of the boat, to keep them from finking and 
fo flie lay by, having enough of it. In the mean 
time w'e prepared to welcome the foremofl boat 
in the fame manner. While we were doing this; 
one of the three hindermofl boats came up to the 
relief of that which was difabled, and took the 
men out of her. We again called to parley with 
them j but inflead of an anfwer, one of the boats 
came clofe under our ftern ; whereupon our gun- 
ner let fly his two chace-guns, but miffing, the 
men in the boat fliouted, and waving their caps, 
came on with greater fury. To repair this feem?* 
ing difgrace, the gunner foon got ready, and firing 
the fecond time, did a great deal of mifchief among 
the enemy. We waved again, and bringing our 

" quarter to bear upon them, fired three guns more, 
when we found the boat a-finking, and feveral 
men already in the fea ; hereupon, manning our 
pinnace, I gave orders to fave as many as they 
could, and infiantly to come on board, becaufe 
the reff of-their boats were approaching : accord- 
ingly they did fo, and took Up three of them, one 
of whom was almofl paft recovery ; and then 
crouditig all the fail we could, after our men came 
on board, we fio6d out fartlier to fea, fo that the 
other three boats gave over their chace,' when they 
came up to the firft two. Thus delivered from 
imminent danger, we changed bur coiiffe to the 
eaftward, quite out of the courfe of all European 
Ihips.

iarly of the two feamen, the meaning of all this, , 
the Dutchman, at once, let us into the fecret. 
He told us, that the fellow who fold us the fliip, 
was an arrant thief, who had run away with her ; 
that the captain was treacheroufly murdered on 
the coaft of Malacca by the natives there, with 
three of his men j that he, the Dutchman, and 
four more, being obliged to have recourfe to. the 
woods for their fafety, at length efcaped by means 
of a Dutch fhip, in its way to China, which had 
fent their boat on (hore for frelli water : That, af- 
ter this he went to Batavia, where two of the 
feamen belonging to the Ihip (who had deferted 
the reft in their travels). arrived, and there gave 
an account that the fellow who ran away with 
the fliip had fold her at Bengal to a fet of pirates, 
who went a cruifmg, and had already taken one 
Englifli and two Dutch fliips richly laden' 

Now, though this was abfolutely falfe, yet con- 
cerning us direftly, my partner truly faid, that 
our deliverance was to be efteemed fo much the 
more by reafon, had we fallen into their hands, 
we could have expefted nothing from them but ' 
immediate death, confidering our accufcrs would 
have been our judges : and therefore his opinion 
was, to return directly to Bengal, where being 
known, we could prove how honeftly we came by 
the fliip, of whom we bought her, and the like, 
and where we were fure of feme juftice; at leaft 
would not be hanged firft, and judged afterwards, 

I was at firft of my partner’s opinion ; hut when 
J had more ferioufly conlidered- of the matter, I 
told him we ran a great hazard in attempting to 
return^ being on the wrong fide of the Itraits of 
Malacca, and that if, upon alarm given, we fliould 
be taken by the Dutch ofFBatavia or Englifli elfe- 
where, our running away would be a fufficient 
evidence to condemn us. This danger indeed 

ftartled

Barbed not only my partner, but likewife all the 
fliip’s company ; fo we changed our former refo•^ 
lution, and refolved to go to the coafl: of Ton- 
quin, and fo to that of China, where purfuing 
our firft defign as to trade, we might likewife have 
an opporttinity to difpofe of the flxip fome way or 
other, and to return to Bengal in any, country 
velTel we could procure. This being agreed to, 
we fleered away N. N. £► about 50 leagues off 
the ufual courfe to the eaflr, which put us to fome 
incoilveniencies. As the wind blew fteadily a- 
gainft us, our voyage became very tedious, and 
we began to be afraid of want of provifion ; and 
what was flill worfe, we apprehended, that as » 
thofe Ihips, from whofe boats we had efcaped, were 
bound to China, they might get before us and 
have given frefh information, which might create 
another vigorous purfuit. Indeed I could not 
help being grieved, when I confid^red that 1, who 
had never wronged or defrauded any perfon in 
my life, was now purfued like a common thief ; 
and, if taken, to run the greatefl; danger of being 
executed as fucli ; and, though innocent, I found 
myfelf under the neceffify of flying for my^fafety : 
and thereby efcape being brought to fhame, of 
which I was even more afraid than of death itfelfh 
It was ealy to read my dejedlion in my counte- 
nance. My mind was oppreifed, like thofe un- 
happy innocent perfons, who, being overpower- 
ed by blafphemous and perjured evidences, wick- 
edly refolved to take away their lives, or ruin, 
their reputation^ have no other recourfe in this 
world to eafe their fofrow, but fighs, prayers, 
and tears. My partner feeing me fo concerned, 
encouraged me as well as he could ; and, after 
deferibing to me the feveral ports of tliat coafl, 
he told me, he would either put in on the coafl 
of Ccchinchina, pr el.fe in the bay of Tonquin, .

from whence we might go to Macao, a town once 
poflelTed by the Portuguefe, and where flill many- 
European families refide. 

To this place we fleered, and early next morn- 
ing came in fight of the coafl ; but thought it ad- 
vifible to put into a fmall river, where we could 
either over-land, or by the fliip’s pinnace, know 
what veflels were in any ports thereabouts. This 
happy flep proved our deliverance ; for next morn- 
ing there came to the bay of Tonquin two Dutch 
fhips, and a third without any colours ; and, in 
the evening, two Englifh fhips fleered the fame 
courfe. The river where we were was but fmall, 
and run but a few leagues up the country north- 
ward ; the country was wild and barbarous, and 
the people thieves, having no correfpondence with 
any other nation, dealing only in hfli, oil, and 
luch grofs commodities j and one barbarous cuf- 
tom they flill retained, that when any veffel was 
unhappily fhipwreckcd upon their coafl, th*>y make 
the men prifoners or flaves ; fo that now we might 
fairly fay we were furrounded by enemies both> 
by fea and land. > 

As the fliip had been leaky, we took the oppor-f 
tunity, in this place, to fearch her, and to flop ■ 
up the places which let in the water. We accor- 
dingly lightened her, and bringing our guns and 
other moveable things to one fide, we effayed to 
bring her down, that we might come at her bot- 
tom: but, upon fecond confideration, we did not* 
think it fafc to let her lye on dry ground, neither* 
indeed was the place convenient for it. The in- 
habitants, not uled to fuch a fight as to fee a fhip 
lye down on one fide, and heel in tow^ards the 
Ihore, not perceiving her men, who were at work » 
on her bottom, with flages and boats on the ofF- 
fide, prefently imagined the fhip had been call a- 
way, and lay fall on the ground. Agreeable to 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 299 

this fuppolition they furrounded us with ten or 
twelve largeiaoats, with a refolution, undoubted- 
ly, to plunder the fliip, and to carry away thofe 
they found alive for flaves to their king. But 
when they perceived our men hard at work on the 
fliip’s bottom and fide, walking, graving, and Hop- 
ping her, it filled them all with fuch furprife, that 
they Hood gazing, as tho’ they were confounded. 
Nor could we imagine what their defign was; 
however, for fear of danger, we handed down 
arms and ammunition, to thofe at work, in order 
to defend themfdves ; and indeed this precaution 
was abfolutely necelTary ; for, in a quarter of an 
hour after, the natives, concluding it was really 
a fliipwreck, and that we were faving our lives 
and goods, which they thought belonged to them, 
came down upon our men, as though it bad been 
in a line of battle. We lay at prefent but in a 
very unfit pofture to fight ; and before the ftages 
could be got down, or the men in the boat come 
on board as they were ordered, the Cochincljinefes 
were upon them, and two of their boats boarding 
our longboat, they began to lay hold of our men 
as prifoners. The firll they feized was a ftout 
Englilh failor, who never fired his mulket, like a 
fool, as I imagined, but laid it down in the boat ; 
but he knew what he was doing ; for by main force 
he dragged the Pagan out of the boat into ours, 
by the two ears, and knocked his brains out againft 
the boaPs gunnel : A Dutchman that was next 
him fnatched up' the mullcet, and knocked down 
five more with the butt end of it ; however, this 
was doing very little to their number; but a ftrange 
unexpefted accident, which rather merits laughter 
than any thing elfe, gave our men a complete vic- 
tory over them. 

It feems the carpenter, who was preparing to 
grave the outfide of the fliip, as well as to pay

the feams, where he caulked, to flop the leaks^ 
had gotten two kettles juft let down in the boat, 
one filled with boiling pitch, and the other with 
rofin, tallow, oil, and fuch ftufF as the lliipwrights 
ufe ; the carpenter’s man had a great iron laddie 
with which he ufed to fupply the workmen with 
hot ftulF, and as two of the enemies entered the 
boat where the fellow ftood, he faluted them with a 
full laddleof thehot boiling liquor, which, *the poor 
creatures being half naked, made them roar out, 
and jump into the fea. Well done, Jack, fays the 
carpenter, give them the other dbze ; and fo ftep- 
ping forward himfelf, takes a mop, and dipping 
it into the pitch-pot, he and his man fo plentifully 
flung it among them, as that none efcaped being 
fcaldedr upon which they mil made the belt of 
their way, crying and howling in fuch a frightful 
manner, that in all my adventures 1 never heard 
the like. And indeed never was I better pleafed 
with any conqueft than I was with this, there be- 
ing fo little bloodfhed, and having an averfion to 
killing fuch favage wretches, (more than was ne- 
ceflary,) as knowing they came on errands, which 
their laws and cuftoms made them think were juft 
and equitable. By this time all things being in 
order, and the fliip fwimming, they found their 
miftake, fo they did not venture a fecond attack: 
Thus elided our merry fight ; and having got fome 
rice, bread, roots, and fixteen good hogs on board 
the day before, we fet fail, not daring to go in- 
to the bay of Tonquin, but fteered N. E. towards 
the ifle of formofa, or as though we would go to 
the Manillas, or Philippine iflands, for fear of 
meeting with any European fhips. When we an- 
chored at the ifle Formofa, the inhabitants, not 
only courteoufly fupplied us with provifions and 
frelh water, but dealt very fairly and honeftly 
with us in their bargains and agreements. From 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3<>r 

this place we {leered north, keeping flill ofF the 
coafl of China, till we were beyond all its ports 
where European fliips ufually come; and at length 
being come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we 
refolved to put into the firil trading port we 
fhould come at ; and (landing for the (hore, a boat 
came off two leagues to us with an old Portuguefe 
pilot on board, who offered his fervice ; we very 
gladly accepted him, and fent the boat back again. 
And now, having the old man on board, I talked 
to him of going to Nanquin, the mod northward 
part of the coad of China. What will you do 
there ? faid he, fmiling, I told him we would fell 
our cargo and purchafe calicoes, raw and wrought 
iilks, tea, &c. and fo return the fame way back. 
O, faid he, you had better put in at Macao, where 
you may buy China wares as cheap as at Nanquin, 
and fell your opium at a greater advance. Buc^ 
faid T, we are gentlemen as well as merchants, 
and de{ign to fee the great city of Pekin, and the 
magnificent court of the monarch of China. Why 
then, faid he, you (liould go to Ningpo, where 
there is a navigable river that goes through the 
heart of that vad empire, two hundred and feven- 
ty leagues from the fea, which crolles all the ri- 
vers, paffes coniiderable hills, by the help of the 
(luices and gates, and goes even up to the city -of 
Pekin. You may go to Nanquin, if you pleafe, 
and travel to Pekin, and there is a Dutch flnpjull 
before bound that way. At the name of a Dutch 
or Englifh fliip, I was druck wdth confufion they 
being as great a terror to me in this Veffel, as an. 
Algerine man of war is to them in the Mediter- 
ranean. The old man finding me troubled, Sir, 
faid he, 1 hope the Dutch are not now at war 
with your nation : No, faid I, but God knows 
what liberty they may take when out of the reach 
of the law. Why, fays he, what occafion is there

.foi* peaceable merchants to fear ? For, believe 
;jne, they never meddle with any but PIRATES. 

At the mentioning of the word pirates, my 
countenance turned to that of fcarlet ; nor was it 
poflible for me to conceal it from the old pilot ; 
who taking notice of it, Sir, faid he, take what 
jcourfe you pleafe, Fll do you all the fcrvice I can, 
Signior, faid J, 1 am a little concerned at your 
mentioning ; I hope there are none fuch 
in thefe feas, becaufe you fee in what a weak con- 
dition we are to defend ourfelves. “ O, Sir,”y«/V 
“ if that’s all, don’t be concerned, I don’t 
“ remember one in thefe feas thefe fifteen years, 
“ except about a month ago one was feen in the 
“ bay of Siam, but fhe is gone to the fouth- 
“ ward ; neither was flie built for a privateer, but 
“ was. run away with by a reprobate captain, and 
fome of his men, the right captain having been 
“ murdered by the Malayans^ 

What ! faid I, (as though ignorant of what had 
happened,) did they kill the captain ! “ No,” 
he,^ “ it is generally thought the Malayans 
“ murdered him ; but peidiaps they might procure 
“ them to do it, and therefore they juftly deferve 
“ hanging. The rogues were lately difeovered 
“ in ihe bav of Siam, in the river of Cambodia,

and had much ado to efcape the five boats that

“ the Qaptain or the feamen, but hang them every 
“ one up at the yard arm, without any formal

Being fenfible, that, having the old man on 
hoard; he was incapable of doing me any mifehief, 

Well, 



o r ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

Well, Signior, faid I, it is for this very reafon I 
would have you carry us up to Nanquin, where 
neither Englifh nor Dutch fllips come ; and I midt 
tell you their captains are a parcel of rafh, proud, 
infolent rakals, that neither know what belongs 
to juftice, nor how to behave themfelves as the 
laws of God or nature direct. Fellows that would 
prove murderers to punilh robbers, and take upon- 
them to adjudge innocent men to death, without 
any proof to prove them guilty } but perhaps I 
may live to call them to account for it, in a place 
where they may be taupjtt how jullice is to be ene-' 
cuted. And fo I told him all the ftory of buying 
the Ihip, and how we were faved by the means of 
two men; that the murder of the captain by the 
Malayans, as alfo the running away wish the fliip,' 
I believed to be true ; bur that v^/e, who bought it, 
were turned pirates, was a mere fidtion, to cover 
their cowardice and foolifli behaviour, when they 
attacked us, and the blood of thofe men we kill in 
our own juft defence, lay to their door,, who fent 
to attack us by furprife.

And will you deliver one melTage from me to them ? 
“ Yes, (faid he,) if you will give it under your 
“ hand, that I may prove it is not my own pro- 
“ dudion.” Hereupon I wrote a large account 
of their attacking me in their long-boat, the pre- 
tended reafon and unjufl: dehgti of it; th^t they 
had done what they might be afliamed of, and 
could not anfwer for at any tribunal in England. 
But this letter was written in vain. Providence 
ordered things another way. We failed diredly 
for Nanquin, and in about thirteen days fail, came 
to an anchor at the fouth-wed point of the great 
gulf of that place, where we learned that two 
Dutch Ihips were gone the length before us, and 
that we fhould certainly fall into their bands. We 
were all at a great Jofs in this exigency, and would 
very gladly have been on fliore almoff any where ; 
but our old pilot told me, that if I would fail to 
the fouthward about two and forty leagues, there 
was a little port called Qiiinchange, where no 
European fliips ever came, and where we might 
confider what was further to be done. According- 
ly we weighed anchor the next day, calling only 
twice on fliore by the way to get frelh water. The 
country people very courteouhy fold us roots, tea^ 
rice, fowls, and other provihons. After five days 
fail we came to the port, and landed with un-^ 
fpeakable joy. We refolved to difpofe of our- 
felves and effeds in any other way pofTible, than 
enter on board that ill-fated veflel more; for no 
Rate can be more iniferable than a continued fear, 
which is a life of death, a confounder of our un- 
derflandings, that fets the imag'nation at work to 
form a thoufand frightful things that may never 
happen. And we fcarce flept one night, without 
dreaming^ of halters, yard-arms, or gibbets ; of 
fighting, being taken, and being killed ; nay, fo

violent were our apprehenfions, that we would 
bruife our hands and heads againft the fides of the 
cabin, as though actually engaged. The flory of 
the Dutch cruelty at Ampona often came into our 
thoughts when awake; and, for my part, ! thought 
my Condition very hard, that, after fo many dif- 
ficulties, and fuch lignal deliverances, I fliould be 
hanged in my old age, though innocent of any' 
Grime that deferved fuch punilhmenr ; but then fe*- 
Jigion Xvould feem to reprefent to me, as though 
the voice of it had faid, Conlider, O man ! what 
fins you have been formerly guilty of, which now 
thou art called to an account for, to expiate with 
thy blood! And as to thy innocence, what art 
thou more innocent than thy blelTed Redeemer 
Jefus Chrill, who fuffered for thy olFences, ancf 
to whofe providence you ought to fubmtt, let 
what will" happen ? After tins natural courage 
would infpire me to refill to the lall drop of blood,^ 
and fooner die than I'ulFer myfelf to be taken by, 
booriili, rafcally. Dutchmen, who had. arts to tor- 
ment beyond death itfelf. 

But now, thank kind Heaven, being alliore, our. 
old pilot procured us a- lodging and a warehoufe 
for our goods; it was a licile hut with a large 
-warehoufe joining to it, all . built with canes, and 
pallifadoed round with large ones; to keep, out 
pilfering thieves, which are very numerous in 
that country. The raagifirates allowed us a little- 
guard during, the night, and we employed -a -cent w 
nel with a kind of halbert for three pence- a-day. 
The fair or mart, we found, had been over for 
fome -time however, there remained in, the river 
four Junks and two Japan fliips, the merchants of' 
the latter being on fliore. In the firfl place, our* 
old pilot brought us acquainted with the mifllonary.

and auflere, applying themfelves to the work they 
came about with great earneftnefs ; but the third, 
who was a Frenchman, called father Simon, was 
of a freer convcrfation, not feemingly fo fcrious 
and grave, yet no worfe Chriftian than the other 
tv/o, one of whom was a Portuguefe, and the other 
a Genoefe. Father Simon,- it fcems, was appoint- 
ed to go to Pekin, the royal feat of the Emperor 
of the Chinefe ; and he only waited for another 
priefl, who was ordered from Macao to accom- 
pany him. We never met together, but he was 
prompting me to keep him company in his jour- 
ney Sir, faid he, I will fliew you the glorious 
things of this mighty Empire, and a city, the city 
of Pekin, far exceeding London or Paris, put 
them both together. One day in particular, being 
at dinner with him, I (hewed fome inclination to 
go ; which made him prefs the more upon me and 
my partner, to gain our perfect confent. But^ 
father Simon, faid my partner, luhat fatisfaSHon 
can you have in our company^ -whom you ejleem as 
heretics, and confequently ohjeSis not ^worthy your 
regard} Oh ! faid he, you may be as good Catho- 
lics in time as thofe I hope to convert to our re- 
ligion. And fo^ faid I, we fJ:all have you preach-- 
ing to us all the way ^ injlead of pleajiug us with a 
defeription of the country. Sir, faid he, however 
our religion may be vilified by fome people, it is 
very certain it neither diverts us of good manners 
or Chrirtian charity ; and as we are gentlemen, as 
fuch we may converfe together, without making 
one another uneafy. 

But we (hall leave him a while, to confider our 
fliip and the mcrchandife w'hich we bad to difpofe 
of. There was but very little trade in the place 
„ where we were ; and I was once refolved to ven- 
ture to fail to the river Kilara, and fo to the city of 
Nanquin : but Providence ordered it otherwife,.

by our o!d pilot’s bringing a Japan merchant to 
us, to fee what goods we had. He immediately 
' bought our opium, for which he gave us a very 
good price in gold by weight, fome wedges of 
which were about ten or eleven ounces. It came 
into my head, that perhaps he might buy the fliip 
too; and I ordered his interpreter to propofe it 
to him. He faid nothing then, but fiirunk up his 
fhoulders ; yet in a few days after he came ac- 
companied by a mifliionary prieft, who was his in- 
terpreter, with this propofal. That as he had bought 
a great quantity of our goods^, he had not money 
enough to -purchafe our Jhip ; hut if I f leafed^ he 
’would hire her 'with all my rnen^ to go to Japan, 
and from thence 'with another loading to the Philip* 
pian ijlands^ the freight of both "wbich he "would 
very ■willingly pay to us before ; and at their return 
/o Japan, "would buy the /hip. Upon this we allced 
the captain and his men, if they were willing to 
go to Japan ; to which they unanimoufly agreed. 
While tins was in agitation, the young man my 
nephew left to attend me, told me, That as 1 did 
not care to accept this profpedi of advantage^ he 
•would manage it for me as I pleafed^ and render 
me a faithful account of his fuccejs^ "which Jliould 
he "wholly mine. Indeed I was very unwilling to 
part with him : but confidering it might be for the 
young man’s good, I difcourl’ed my partner about 
it,- who, of his own generolity, gave him his fhare 
of the veflel, fo that 1 could do no otherwife than 
give him mine ; but however, we let him have but 
the propertjy of half of it, and referved a power, 
(that when we met in, England, if he had obtained 
fjiccefje, he fliould account to us for one half of 
the profits of the (hip’s freight, and the other 
fliould be his own. Thus having taken a writing 
under his hand, away he failed to Japan, where 
the merchant dealt very honeftly by him, got hiiri 

■a li-

a licence to come on fhore, fent him loaded to^ 
the Philippines with a Japanele fupercargo, from 
whence he came back again loaded with European 
goods, cloves, and other fpiceries. By this voy- 
age he cleared a confiderable fum of money, which 
determined him not to fell his lliip, but to trade 
on his own account : fo he returned to the Ma- 
nillas, where getting acquaintance, he made his 
fliip free, was hired by the governor privately to 
go to Acapulco in America, on the Mexican coaR, 
with a licence to travel to the great city of Mex- 
ico. . 1 his traffic turned out greatly to account, 
and my friend finding means to get to Jamaica, 
returned nine- years after exceeding rich into En« 
gland. 

In parting with the fliip, it comes in courfe to 
conlider of thofe men who had faved our lives 
when in the river of Cambodia : and though, byr 
^ the way, they were a couple of rogues, who 
thought to turn pirates thfcmfelves, yet we paid 
them what they had- before demanded, and gave 
each of them a fmail fum of money, making the 
Englilhman a gunner, and the Dutchman a boat- 
fwain, with which they were very w'ell contented* 
We were now' above rooo leagues farther from 
home than when at Bengali All the comfort we 
could expeR was, that there being another fair 
to be kept in a > month’s time, we might not only 
purchafe all forts of that country’s manufafrures,-- 
but very polhbly fintl fome Chin efe junks, or vef- 
~ fels from Tonquin, to be fold, which would carry 
us and our goods wherefoever we pleafed* Upon 
thefe hopes, we refolved to eon t inn e ;. and to di- 
vert ourfslves, we took feveral little journeys in 
' the country. About ten days after we parted with 
our fliip, we travelled to fee the city of Nanquin,

lines, which lets it ovit to the |rearert advantage. 
At our return, we found the pried w as come from 
Macao that was to accompany father Simon ta 
Pekin. That father earneuly folicited me to ac- 
company him, and I referred him to ray partner. 
In fliort, we both agreed, and prepared accord- 
ingly; and we were fo lucky as to have liberty to 
travel among the retinue of one of their Manda- 
rines, who is a pidnciple magiftrate, and much 
reverenj:ed by the jieople. 

We Were five and twenty days travelling thro^ 
this miferable country, infinitely populous, but as; 
indifferently cultivated ; and yet their pride, is in- 
finitely greater than their poverty, infomuch that 
the priefls tbemfelves derided them. As we palTed 
by the houfe of one of their country gentlemen, 
two leagues ofFNanquin, we had the honour, for- 
footh, to ride with the Chinefe fquire about two 
miles. Never was Don Qviixote fo exadlly imi- 
tated, never fuch a compound of pomp and pover- 
ty feen before ! 

His habit, made of calico, was diHy, greafy, 
and very proper for a Merry Andrew or Scara- 
mouch, with all its tawdry trappings, as hanging 
fleeves, taffels, 6"c. though torn and rent in almoft 
every ^part ; his veil: underneath it was no lefs 
dirty, but more greafy, refembling the moft ex- 
quifite floven, or greafy butcher. His horfe (worfe 
than Rofinante, of tlie famous fteed of doughty 
Hudibras) was a poor ftarved, decrepit thing, chat 
would not fell for thirty fiiillings in England : and 
yet this piece of worfliipful pomp was attended 
with ten or twelve flaves, who guarded their ma- 
ftcr to his country-feat. We flopped at a little 
village for refrefhment : and when w'e came by 
the country-feat of this great man, we found him 
fitting under a tree before his door, eating a mefs. 



310 LIFE and adventures 

of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in the 
middle, and a bag filled with green pepper by him, 
and another plant like ginger, together with a 
piece of lean mutton in it ; this was his Worfhip’s 
repaft : but pray obferve the ftate of the fool ! 
two women flaves brought him his food; which 
being laid before him, two others appeared to per- 
form their refpeftive offices ; one fed him with a 
fpoon, while the other fcrapped off what fell upon 
his beard and talFety veil:, and gave it to a particu- 
lar favourite to eat. And thus we left the wretch 
pleafed with the conceit of our admiring his mag- 
nificence, which ra their merited our fcorn and de- 
• tertation. 

At length we arrived at the great city of Pekin,, 
accompanied by two fervants, and the old Portu- 
guefe pilot, whofe charges we bore, and who fer- 
ved us as an interpreter by the way. We had 
fcarce been a week at Pekin, but he conies laugh- 
ing to us. Ah ! Signior Inglife, faid he, me fome- 
ihing tell you make your heart glad, but make me 
Jo try ; for you bring me here 25 days journey, and 
now you leave me go back alone: and -which -way 
Jhall I make my port after, without de Jhip, with^ 
out de horfe, without pecune ? fo he called money 
in his broken Latin. ' He then informed me, that 
there was a great caravan of Mufcovite and Polifii 
merchants in the city, who were preparing to fee 
out for Mufeovy by land within fix weelcs ; and 
that he Was certain we would take this opportu- 
nity, and, confequently that he mufi: go home by 
himfelf. Indeed this news infinitely furprifed and 
pleafed me. Are you certain df this ? faid 1, Yes, 
Sir, faid he, me Jure iJs true. And fo he told 
me, that having met an old acquaintance of his, an 
Armenian, 7« Me Jlreet, who was among them, and 
who had come from Allracan, ivith a defign to go

his refolution, he ivas novj refolved to go with the 
caravan^ and to return' by the river Wolga to 
Allracan. Well, Signior, faicl I, don’t be difeon- 
tented about your returning alone ; and if by this 
means I can find a paflage to England, it will be 
your own fault if you return to Macao at all. And 
fo confulting with my partner what was befl to 
be done, he referred it to me as I pleafed, having 
our affairs fo well fettled at Bengal, that if we 
could convert the good voyage we had made in 
China filks, wrought raw, he would be fatisfied to 
go to England, and fo return to Bengal in the 
company’s fliips. Thus refolved, we agreed, that 
if our pilot would go with us, we would bear his 
charges either to Mufeow or England; and to 
give him in a prefent the fum of 170 pounds Ster- 
ling. Hereupon, we called him in, and told him 
the caufe of his complaint fhould be removed, if 
he would accompany us with the caravan ; and 
therefore we defired to know his mind At this 
he lliook his head, Great long journey^ faid he, wtf 
no pecune, carry me to Mufeow, or keep me there. 
But we foon put him out of that concern, by ma- 
lting him fenfible of what we would give him here 
to lay out to the befl: advantage: and as for his 
charges, we would fet him fafe on fhore, God wal- 
ling, either in Mufeovy, or England, as he plea- 
fed, at our own charge, except the carriage of 
his goods. At this propofal he was like a man 
-tranfported, telling us, he would go with us all 
the world over ; and we made preparations for 
our journey ; but it was near four months before 
all the merchants were ready. 

In the mean time, my partner and the pilot 
went exprefs to the port where we firfl: ptit in, 
to difpofe of what goods had been left there, while 
1 accompanied a Chinefe merchant, who was going 
to Nanquin, and there bought 29 pieces of damalk.

with about 300 more of other fine filks ; and by 
the time my partner returned to Pekin, I had them 
all carried thither: our cargo. in filks amounted 
to 4500I. Sterling, which, together with tea, fine 
calicoes, nutmegs, and cloves loaded 18 camels 
for oi|r fliare, belides what we rode upon, with 
two or three fpare horfes, and two more loaden 
with provilions : the company now was very great, 
making about 400 horfe, and above 120 men, well 
armed and provided. We were of feveral nations, 
among whom were five Scots merchants inhabiting 
in Mufcow, and well experienced in trade. 

We fet out from Pekin the beginning of Febru- 
ary our flyle ; and in two days more, we pafTed 
through the gate of the, great China wall, which 
was eredcd as a fortification againft the Tartars, 
being 108 Englifli miles long. We then entered 
a country not near fb poptilous, chiefly under 
the power of plundering Tartars, feveral compa- 
nies of whom we perceived riding on poor ftarved 
horfes, contemptible as themfelves, without order 
or difcipline. One time our leader for the day 
gave us leave to go a hunting. But what do you 
think we hunted, only a parcel of fheep, which 
indeed exceeded any in the world for wildnefs and 
fwiftnefs ; but while we were purfuing this game, 
it was our chance to meet with about forty Tar- 
tars, who no fooner perceived us, but one of them 
blew a horn, at the found of which there foon ap- 
peared a troop of forty or fifty more, at about a 
mile’s diflance. Hereupon one of the Scots mer- 
chants (who knew their way) ordered us to ad- 
vance towards them, and attack them immediately. 
As we advanced, they let fly a volley of arrows, 
which happily fell a little fliort of us : this made 
us halt a little, to return the compliment with buU 
lets ; and then being led tip by the bold Scot, we 
fired our piflols in tlieir faces, and drew out our 

^fwords j 


OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

fwprds ; but there was no occafion ; for they flew 
like timorous Iheep, and only three of them re- 
mained, beckoning to the reft to come back. But 
our brave commandtr gallops up to them by him- 
felf, fliot one dead, knocks another off his horfe, 
while the third ran away ; and thus ended our 
battle with the Tartars. . 

We travelled a month more through the emper- 
or of China’s dominions ; and at length coming 
to one of their towns about a day and a hall’s 
journey from the city of Naum,“I wanted to bu^ 
a camel. The perfon I fpoke to would have 
brought me one, but, like a fool, .1 muft go along 
with him, about tw& miles from the village. My 
old pilot and I walked on foot, forfooth, for fome, 
variety, when coming to the place where the ca- 
mels were kept as in a park guarded by Chinefe 
foldiers, we there agreed and bought one, which 
the Chinefe man that came with me led along the 
road. But we had not gone far, before we were 
attacked by five Tartars, mounted on horfeback, 
two of whom feized the man, took the camel from 
him, and rode away, while the other three ap- 
proached us, the firft of whom fuddenly feized 
me as I was drawing my fwoid, the fecond knock- 
ed me down; but my old trufty Fortuguefe, ta- 
king a piftol out of his pockety w’-hich I knew no- 
thing of, and coming up to the fellow that flriick 
me^ he, with one hand, pulled him off his horfe, 
and then fliot him dead upon the fpot ; then taking 
his feymitar, he ftruck at the man that ftopt us, 
but milling him, cut olF one of his horfe’s ears, 
the pain of which made him throw his rider to the 
ground. The poor Chinefe, who had led the ca- 
mel, feeing the Tartar down, runs to him, and 
feizing upon his pole-axe, wrenched it from his 
hands, and knocked his brains out. But there 
Was another Tartar to deal with, w'ho*feeming

neither inclined to figlit, nor to fly, ^nd my old 
man having begun to charge his piftol, the very 
fight of it flruck fuch a terror into the wretch, 
that away he Icoured, leaving my old pilot, ra- 
ther my champion and defender, an abfolute vic- 
tory. 

By this time being awakened from my trance, I 
began to open my eyes, wondering where I was, 
having quite forgot all that palled ; but my fenfes 
returning, and feeling a great pain in my head, 
and feeing the blood was running over my cloaths, 
I inflantly jumped upon my feet, and grafped my 
fword in my hand, with a refolution to take re- 
venge ; but no enemies now remained, except the 
-dead Tartar, with his horfe (landing by him. The 
old man feeing me recovered, whom he thought 
(lain, ran towards me, and embraced me with the 
greatefl tendernefs, at the fame time examining 
into my wound, which was far from being mortal j 
when we returned to the village, the man demand- 
ed payment for his camel, which I refudng, we 
brought the caufe before a Chinefe judge, who 
aiSed with great impartiality; having heard both 
fides, he alked the Chinefe man that went with 
me, whofc fervant ^he was ? Sir, faid be, I am 
nobody’s, but went with the (Iranger, at his re- 
qued: why then, faid the judge, you were the 
(iranger’s fervant for the time, and the camel be- 
ing delivered to his fervant, it is the fame as tho’ 
delivered to.himfelf, and accordingly he mud pay 
for it. Indeed the cafe was fo fairly dated, that 
I had nothing to objed to it : fo having paid for 
that I was robbed of, I fent for another, but did not 
go myfelf to fetch it, as I had enough of that fport 
before. 

The city- of Naum is a frontier of the Chinefe 
empire, fo fortified, as fome will tell you, that 
nhiiions of Tartars cannot batter down their walls ;

hy which certainly one- might think one of our 
cannons would do more execution than all their 
legions. 

When v.?e were within a day’s march of that 
city, we had information that the governor had 
fent meffengers to every part of the road, to in- 
form the travellers and caravans to halt, till a 
guard was fent to prote^ them from the numerous 
bodies of Tartars that lately appeared about the 
city. This news put us into great conlternation j 
but, obeying the orders, we Ropt, and two days 
after, there came two hundred foldlers from a 
garrifon of the Chinefe, and three hundred mere 
from Naum: thus guarded both in the front and 
rear, with our men on the flanks, we boldly ad- 
vanced, thinking we were able to combat with ten 
thoufand Mogul Tartars, if they appeared. 

Early next morning, in our march from a little 
well fltuated town called Changu, after having 
pafTed a river, and entered upon a defart of about 
15 or 16 miles over, we foon beheld, by a cloud 
o£ duTt that was raifed, that the enemy was ap- 
proaching. This much difpirited the Chinefe. 
My old pilot took notice of it, and called out;, 
^ignior Inglefe, thore.fellows mufl be encouraged, 
or they will ruin us all ; and I am afraid, if th^ 
Tartars attack us, they will all run away. Why 
Signior, faid I, what lhall be done in this cafe 
Done, fays he, why, let fifty of our men advance, 
and flank them on each wing, I know the fellowsr 
will fight well enough in company. We accord- 
ingly took his advice, and marched fifty to the 
right wing, and the fame number to the left, and 
with the reft made a line of referve, leaving the 
lafl: two hundred men to guard the camels, or to 
aflift us as occafion required. 

'1 bus prepared, a party of the enemy came for- 
'ward,, viewing our pollure, and-'^raverflng the

ground on the front of our line. Hereupon we 
ordered the two wings to move on, and give them 
afalute with their fliot; which accordingly was done. 
This put a flop to their proceedings; for im- 
mediately wheeling off to their left, they all march- 
ed away, and we faw not more of them. They 
had undoubtedly given an account to their compa- 
nions of what reception they might exped, vyhich 
made them fo eafily give over their enterprife. 

When we came _to the c'ty of Naum, we re- 
turned the governor hearty thanks, and difperfed 
a hundred crowns among the foldiers that guard- 
ed us. We relied there one day, and then pro- 
ceeded on our travels, paffing feveral great rivers 
.and defarts ; and on the 13th of April, we came 
' to the frontiers of Mufeovy, the firfl: town of 
which was called Argun. 

This happy occafion, as I thought, of coming 
into a Lhriftian country, made me congratulate 
the Scots merchant upon iti he fmiled at that, 
telling me not to rejoice too foon; for, faid he, 
except the Ruffian foldiers in garrifon, and a few 
inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the reft 
of this country, for above a thoufand miles, is in- 
habited by the mofl ignorant and barbarous Pa- 
gaus. 

We advanced from the river Arguna by mode- 
rate journeys, and found convenient garrifons on 
the road, filled with Ghriftian foldiers, for the fe- 
curity of commerce, and for the convenient lod- 
' giiigsof travellers; but the inhabitants of the coun- 
try were mere Pagans, worfhipping the moon, 
fun, and flars. We particularly obferved this 
idolatry near the r.'ver Arguna, at a city inhabited 
by Tartars and Ruffians, called Nerifinkey. Being 
curious to fee their way of living, while the cara- 
van continued to reft themfeives in this city, I 
went to one of their villages, where there was to 



©p ROBINSON CRUSOE. 317 

Se one of their folemn facrifices. There I beheld^ 
upon the Rump of an old tree, an idol of wood, 
more ugly than the reprefentation of the devil 
himfelf: its head refembled no living, creature i' 
its ears were as big and as high as a goat’s horns, 
a crooked nofe, four cornered mouth, and horri- 
ble teeth : it was clothed in flieeps Ikins, had a- 
great Tartar bonnet, with two horns growing- 
through it, and was, eight foot high, without feet, 
legs, or proportion. Before this^ idol there lay 
16 or 17 people, who brought their offerings, and 
were making their prayers, while at a diltance 
Rood three men, and one btillock, as viRlms toj- 
this ugly monfler. 

Such Rupendous faccilcges as this, in robbing' 
the true God of his honour, filled rne with the 
greateR aRonifinnent and. refleftion; which looni 
turning to rage and fury, I rode up to the image,,

your zeal carries you fo far, rather than you 
ftiould be alone, I will accompany you, and bring 
a flout fellow equal to yourfelf, if you will, to 
aflifl you in this delign: and accordingly he brought 
one captain Richardfon, who hearing the flory, 
readily confented ; but my partner declined it^ 
being altogether out of his way : and fo we three, 
and my man-fervant, refolved. to execute tliis ex- 
ploit about midnight ; but upon fecond thoughts 
we deferred it to the next night, by reafon that 
the caravan being to go from thence next morn- 
ing, we fhould be out of the governor’s power. 
The better to effectuate my defign, I procured a 
Tartar’s flicep-lkin robe, a bonnet, with a bow 
and arrows, and every one of us got the like ha- 
bits. The firft night we fpent in mixing combuf- 
tible matter with aqua-vitse, gun-powder, &c. ha- 
ving a good quantity of tar in a little pot y next 
night we came up to the idol about eleven o’clock, 
the moon being up. We found none guardingJt; 
but we perceived a light in the boufe, w' her ewe- 
had feeh the priefts before. One of our men was 
for firing the hut, another for killing the people, 
and a third for making them prifoners, while the 
idol was deftroyed. We agreed to the latter ; fo 
knocking at the door, we feized the firfl that open- 
ed it, and Hopping his mouth, and tying his feet, 
we left him. We ferved the other two in the like 
manner; and then the Scots merchant fet fire to- 
the compofition, which frightened them fo much, 
that we brought them all away prifoners to their 
wooden god. There we fell to work, with him, 
daubing him all over with, tar mixed with tallow

arid brimftone, flopped his eyes, ears, and mouth 
full of gun-powder, with a great piece of wild fire 
in his bonnet, and environed it with dry forage. 
All this being done, we unloofed and ungagged the- 
priioners, and fet the idol on fire, which the gun- 
powder blowing up, the lhape of it was deformed,, 
rent, and fplit, which the forage utterly confu- 
med ; for we ftaid to fee its deflrutlion, left the 
ignorant idolatrous people fiiould have throwrr 
themfelves into the liames» And thus we came 
away undifeovered, the morning appearing as bu- 
fy among our fellow-travellers, as no body could 
have fufpeded any other, but that we had been in 
our beds all night. 

Next morning we fet out, and had gone but a 
fniall diflanee from the city, when there came a 
multitude of the people of the country to the 
gates of the cky, demanding fatisfaiflion of the 
Ruffian governor for iofulting their priefls, and 
burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu^ who dwelt 
in the fun, and no mortal w'ould violate his image,, 
but fame Chriflian mifereants ; and being already 
no lefs than thirty thoufand flrpng, they announ- 
ced war againfl him and all his Chriflians. 

The governor- aflTured them he was ignorant of 
the matter, and that none of his garrifon bad been 
abroad ; that indeed there was a caravan tliat 
went away that morning, and that he would fend 
after them to inquire into it; and whoever were 
the offenders, fhonld be delivered into their hands. 
This fatisfied them for the prefent, bift the gover- 
nor fent to inform us, that if any of us had done 
it, we ffiould make all the hafte away poffible, 
while he kept them in play as long as he could. 
Upon this we marched two days and two nights,, 
flopping but very little, -till at lafl we arrived at 
a village called Plothus, and hailed to Jarawena, 
another of tlie Czar’s colonies. Oa the third day,

liorfe on the other fide _of it to the north, who' 
fuppofed we had paffed on that fide of the lake j- 
but having either found their mifhtke, or beings 
certainly iiifonned of the way we took, they came 
upon us towarals the duik of the evening, juft as 
we had pitched our camp bet ween two little but 
very thick v^^oods, with a little river running be- 
fore our front, and forne felled trees, with which > 
we coyered our rear; a precaution we always 
took, and which we had jufl finilhed, when the- 
enemy came up. They did not fail on us imme- 
diately, but fent three meflTengers, demandit g the- 
men w'ho had infulted their prieiis, and burnt. 
th.e\t ^oA Cham Chi Thaungu^ that they might be 
burnt with fire, that if this was cotnpiied w-ith,.. 
they^ would peaceably depart;, but if not, they 
would deflroy one and all of us. ^)ur men fia-^ 
red at one another on receipt of this mefl’age, but- 
Nobody was tke word,, as indeed nobody knew it,, 
but he who did it. Upon which the leader of the.': 
caravan returned, for anfwer, That they were- 
jieaceabie merchants, who meddled ’ with none of* 
their priefis .and .gods ; and therefore defiredthem 
not to diflurb us, and put us to the, necelTity of- 
(defending ourfelves. Bvit fo far was this from* 
fatisfying them, that the next morning, coming- 
to our right, they let fly a volley of arrows a- 
mong us, which happily did not hurt any, becaufe 
we fheltered ourfelves behind our baggage. We 
expelled howevet.to come to. a dofer engagement j. 
but were happily, faved by a cunning fellow, a* 
Gofiack, who obtaining leave of the Reader to go 
out, mounts his horfe, rides diredly from' our. 
rear, and taking a circuit, comes up to the Tar-- 
tars, as though he had been fent exprefs, and tells*, 
thenr aTormd ftory, that the wretches who hath

burnt the Cham Chi 7 haungti^ were gone to Sihell- 
ka, with a refolution to burn the god Shal Ifar^ 
belonging to the Tonguefcs. Upon which, belie- 
ving this cunning I'artar, who was fervant to 
our Mufcovites, away they drove to Siheilka, 
and in lefs than three minutes were out of our 
fight, nor did we ever hear of them more. 

When we came to the city of Jarawena, we 
refted five days, and then enttred into a frightful 
•defart, which held us twenty -three days march, 
infelted with feveral fmall companies of robbers, 
or Mogul Tartars, who never had the courage 
to attack us. After we had pafied over this de- 
fart, we found feveral garrifons to defend the ca- 
ravans from the violence of the Tartars, In par- 
ticular the governor of Adinikoy olFered us a 
guard of fifty men to the next ffation, if we ap- 
prehended any danger. The people here retained 
the .fame paganlfm and barbarity, only they w'ere 
not fo dangerous, being conquered by the Mufco- 
vites. The clothing, both of men and women, 
is of theflvifis of bealls, living under the ground 
in vaults and caves, which have a communication 
with one another. They have idols almoft in e- 
vcry family ; befides, they adore the fun andftars, 
-water and fnow ; and the lead uncommon thing 
that happens in the elements, alarms them as 
much as thunder and lightning does the unbe- 
lieving Jews. 

Nothing remarkable occurred in our march 
- through this country. When we had got through 
the defart, after two days further travel, wc came 
tojenezo, a Mufcovite city, on the great river 
fo called, which, we were told, parted Europe 
from Afja, The inhabitants here were very little 
better, though intermixed with the Mufcovites 
but the wmnder will cfeafe, when I inform my rea- 
der of wdiat was obferved tq me, that the Czar

322 XIFE and adventures 

rather converts the Tartars with foldiers than 
clergymen, and is more proud to niakc them faith* 
£ul lubjefts, than good Chriftians. 

From this city to the river Uby, we travelled 
over a pleafant, fruitful, but very uncultivated 
country, for want of good management and peo- 
ple, and thofe few are moftly pagans. This is 
the place where the Mufcovite criminals are ba- • 
nifhed to, if they are not put to death. The next 
city we came to, was the capital city of Liberia,* 
called Toboliki, when, having been almofl: feven 
months on bur journey, and winter drawing on 
ftpace, my partner and I confulied about our par- 
ticular affairs, in, what manner we fliould difpofe 
of ourfelves, We had been told of fledges and 
rein-deer to carry us over the fnow in the winter 
feafon, the fnow being frozen fo hard, that the 
fledges can run upon the furface without any dan- 
ger of going down. As I was boupd to England, 

I now behoved either to go with the caravan to 
Jeroilav/, from thence weft to Narva, and the 
gulf of Finland, and fo by land or fea to Den- 
mark ; or elfe I -muft leave the caravan at a little 
town on the Dwina, and fo to Archangel, where 
I was certain of fliipping either to England, Hol- 
land, or Hamburgh. Une night I happened to 
get into the company of an illuftrious but bani- 
flied prince, whofe company and virtues were fuch 
as made me propofe to him a method how he might 
obtain his liberty. My dear friend^ faicf he, as I 
am here happily free from my miferahle greatnefs^ 
•with all its attendants of pride:, ambition, avarice, 
and luxury ; if I Jl>ould efcape from this place, 
thefe pernicious feeds may again revive, to my lajl- 
ing difqiiietude ; therefore let me remain in a hlej^

prife, I flood filent a while, nor was he in lefs dif- 
order ; by which perceiving he wanted to give vent 
to his mind, I delired him to conlider of it, and fo 
withdraw. But about two hours after he came to 
my apartment ; Dear friend^ faid he, though 1 can- 
not cQnfent to accompany you^ I JJ^all have this fa- 
tisfadiion in parting^ that you have me an honejl 
man^ JJill ; hut as a tejlimony of my ajfe^ion to 
you^ be pleafed to accept this prefent of fables. 

In return for this compliment, I lent my fer- 
vant next morning to his Lordfhip, ‘with a fmall 
prefent of tea, two pieces of China damallt, and 
four little wedges of gold : but he only accepted 
the tea, one piece of damafk, and a piece of gold, 
for the curiolity of the Japan flamp that was upon 
if. Not long after, he lent for me, and told me. 
That what he had refufed h'mfelf, he hoped upon 
bis account I would grant to another, whom he 
fhould name ; In fliort, it was his only fon, who 
was about 200 miles dillance from him, on the 
other fide of the Oby, whom he faid he would 
fend for, if I gave my confent. This I foon com- 
plied with: upon which he fent his fervants next 
day for his fon, who f eturned in twenty days rime, 
bringing feven horfes loaded with valuable furs. 
At night die young lord Was conducted incognito 
into our apartment, where his father prefented 
him to me. We then concerted the bell ways for 
travelling, and after having bought a confiderable 
quantity of fables, black fox fkins, fine erminies, 
&c. 1 which I fold at Archangel at a good piece,) 
we fet Out from this city the beginning of June, 
making a fmall caravan, being about thirty-two 
horfes and camels, of which 1 reprefented the head. 
My young lord had wdth him a very faithful Sibe- 
rian fervant, well acquainted with the roads ; we

their ftriftnefs in examining travellers, left any of 
the banilhed perfons of dillindion Ihould efcape. 
Having palled the river Kama, we came to a city 
on the European fide, called Soloy Komofltoi, 
where we found the people moftly Pagans as be- 
fore. We then palled a defart of about two hun>- 
red miles over; but in other places, it is near 
feven hundred. In palfing this wild place, we were 
befet by a troop of men on horfeback, and about 
five and forty men armed with bows and arrows* 
At firft they looked earneftly on us, and then pla- 
ced thcmfelves in bur way. We were above fix- 
teen men, and drew up a little line before our 
camels. My young lord lent out his Silaerian fer* 
vant to know who they were ; but when he ap- 
proached them, he neither knew a word they faid, 
nor would they admit him to come neap them at 
his peril, but prepared to Oioot him. At his re- 
turn he told us he believed them to be Calmuck 
Tartars, and that he thought there were more of 
them upon the defart. This was bur a fmall com- 
fort to us; yet feeing a little grove about a quar- 
ter of a mile’s diftance, we moved to it, by the 
old Portuguefe pilot’s advice, without meeting 
with any oppofition. Here we found a marfliy 
piece of ground, and a fpring of water running 
into a little brook on one llde, which joined ano- 
ther like it a little farther off, andthefe two form- 
ed the head of the river called Writflea. As foon* 
as we arrived, we went to work, cutting down 
great arms off the trees, and laying th,em hanging 
(•not quite off) from one tree to another, Jn this 
fituation we waited the motions of the enemy, 
without perceiving any advancement they made 
towards us. About two hours before night, be- 
ing joined by fome others, in all , about fourfeore 
horfe, among whom we fancied were fome wo- 
men, thf’y came upon us with great fury. We

tongue to know their bufinefs j but they, either 
not knowing, or feeming not to underftand us, 
■came direftly to the wood-fide, not confidering 
that vve were fo fortified, as that they could not 
break in. Our old pilot the Portuguefe proved 
both oUf captain and engineer, and ddircd us not- 
to fire, till they came within piftol-fiiot? and when 
he gave the word of command, then to take the 
fureft-aim : but he did not bid us give fire, till 
they were within two pikes length of us, and then 
we killed fourteen of them, wounded feveral, as 
alfo their ho rfes, having every one of us loaded 
our pieces with two of three bullets at leaf!:. So 
much were they furprifed at our undauntednefs, 
that they retired about a hundred roods of us. In 
the mean while, vve loaded our pieces a^jain, and 
Tallying out, fecured four or five of their horfes, 
whole riders we found were killed, and perceived 
them to be Tartars. About an hour after, they 
made another attempt, to fee where they might 
break in ; but finding us ready to receive them, 
they retired. 

All that night we wrought hard, in ftrengthcn- 
ing our fituation, and barricading the entrances 
into the woods ; but when day-li^t came, wehad 
a very unwelcome difcovery ; for the enemy be- 
ing encouraged by their afliftance, had fet up ele- 
ven or twelve tents in form of a camp, about three 
quarters of a mile from us. I muft confefs, I was 
never more concerned in my life, giving myfelf 
and all that I had over for loll. And my partner 
declared, that as the lofs of his goods would be 
his ruin, before ^ey Ihould be taken from him, • 
he would fight to the lafl drop of bis blood. As 
we could not pretend to force our -way, vve had 
recoude to a flratagem ; vve kindled a large fire, 
which burnt all night j and no fooJierwas it dark,

led Kertza, and from thence came to a large town 
named Ozonoys, where we heard that feveral 
troops of Calmuck Tartars h&d been abroad upon 
the defart, but that we ^Y^re pall all danger. In 
five days after we came to Veuffima, upon the ri- 
ver Witzedga ; from thence we came to Lawi*en- 
Ikoy, on the third of July, where, providing our- 
Iplves with two luggage boats and a conve- 
nient bark, we embarked the feventh, and arrived 
at Archangel the eighteenth, after a year, five 
months, and three days journey, including the 
.eighth , mohths and odd days at Tobollki. We 
came from Archangekthe tv/entieth of Augufl in

Chap. I. Of SOL ITUD E. 

H Oweve ftfolitude is looked upon as a reflraint 
to the pleafures of the world, in company 
and converfation, yet it is a happy flate of ex- 
emption from a fea of trouble, an inundation of . 
vanity and vexation, of confufion and difappoint- 
ment. While we enjoy ourfelves, neither the 
joy nor forrow of other men affeft us : we are 
then at liberty, with the voice of Our foul, to 
fpeak to God. By this we fliun fuch frequent tri- 
vial difcourfe, as even becomes an obllruclioii toe 
virtue; and how often do we find, that we had 
reafon to wifli we had not been in company, or 
faid nothing when we were there? for either we 
olfend God by the impiety of our difcourfe, or lay 
ourfelves open to the violence of defigning peo- 
ple by our unguarded expreflions; and frequently 
feel the coldnefs and treachery of pretended friends,., 
when once involved in trouble and afilidion ; of 
fuch unfaithful intimates (I fiiould fay enemies) 
who rather by falfe innuendoes would accumulate 
miferies upon us, than honeflly aflift us when fuf- 
fering under the hard hand of Adverlity. But in 
a ftate of folitude, when our tongues cannot be 
heard, except by the great Majedy of heaven, 
how happy are wc, in the blefled enjoyment of 
convening with our Maker 1 It is then we make 
him our friend, which fets us above the envy and 
contempt of wicked men. When a man converfes 
with himfelf, he is fure that he does not converfe , 
with an enemy. Our retreat Ihould be to good 
company, and good books. I mean not by foli-

tude, that a man fliould retire into a ce|l, a de- 
fart, or a nionaflery : which would be altogether 
an ufelels and unprofitable reflraint : for as men 
are formed for fociety, and have an abfolute ne- 
cellity and dependence upon one another ; fo there 
is a retirement of the foul, with which it^converfes 
in heaven, even in the midfl of men ; and indeed 
no man is more fit to fpeak freely, than he who 
can, without any 'violence to himfelf, refrain hi& 
tongue, or keep filence altogether. As to reli- 
gion, it is by this the foul gets acquainted with 
the hidden myrteries of the holy writings; here 
Die finds thofe flood of tears, in which good men 
wafli themfelves day and night, and only makes a 
vifit to God, and his holy angels. In this con- 
verfation the truefl: peace and mofl folid joy are 
to be found; it is a continual feafl of contentment 
on eartiv and the means of attaining everiafling 
happinefs in heaven. 

ehap.II. Of HONESTY, 

HoNESfY is a virtue beloved by good men, and 
pretended to by all perfons. In this there are fe- 
veral degrees : to pay every man his own, is the 
common law of honefly; but to do good to all 
mankind, is the chancery law of honefly : and this 
chancery-court is in every man*s breafl, where 
his confcience is a lord chancellor. Hence it is, 
that a mifer, tliough he pays every body their 
own, cannot be an honefl man, when he does not 
dlfcharge the good offices that are incumbent 
on a friendly, kin(,l, and generous perfon ; for, 
faith the prophet ifaiah, chap, xxxii. ver. 7, 8. 
The injhruments of a churl are evil : he devifeth 
•ujicked devices to deflroy the poor viitb lyiag nvords^ 
even vihen the needy fpeaketh right. But the libe^ 
ral foul devifeth liberal t hinge, and by liber fll things:

thing the law requires ; but fhould we throw eve- 
ry poor debtor in prifon till he has paid the ut- 
moH farthings hang every nialefaftor without 
mercy, exa£l the penalty of every bond, and the 
forfeiture of every indenture, this would be down- 
right cruelty, and not honefly : and it is contrary 
to that general rule, To do to another that ■which 
you ■would have done unto you. Sometimes neceUi- 
ty makes an honeft man a knave : and a rich man 
an honefl: man, becaufe he has no occafion to be 
a knave. The trial of honefly is this ; Did' yoir 
ever want bread, and had your neighbour’s loaf 
in keeping ; and would flarve, rather than eat it ? 
Were you ever arrelled, having in your cullody 
another man’s calh, and would rather go to goal, 
than break it } if fo, this indeed may be teckoned 
honelly. For King Solomon tells us, that a good

ment., and -which -when a man has once hjly he has 
nothing left -worth keeping. 

Chap. III. Of/uffering JFFLfCTIONS.

larger will be our recompenfe. Let the provo^ 
cation te what it will, whether from a good-na- 
tured and cohfeientious, or a wicked, perverfe, 
and vexatious man ; all this we IhouJdf take as 
from the over-ruling hand of God, as a punifli- 
ment for our fins. Many times injured innocence 
may be abufed by falfe oaths, or the power of 
wicked, jealous, or malicious men ; but we often 
find it, like the palm, rife the higher, the more 
it is deprelTed; while the juftice of God is eminent- 
ly remarkable in punifliing thofe, one way or o- 
ther, who defire to endeavour to procure the 
downfal of an innocent man : nor does God fail . 
comforting an afflicted perlbn, who with tears and. 
prayers folicits the throne of Heaven for deliver- 
ance and protedlion. David fays, that his Jhul 
•was fult of trouble^ and his life drew near unto the 
grave. But certainly David’s affliftions made him 
eminently remarkable, as particularly when pur- 
fited by King Saul, and hunted as a partridge o- 
ver the mountains. But one thing which Hands 
by innocence, is the love of God ; for were we

As converfation is a great part of human ttapfc-

air of humour and pleafantnefs fit ever upon his

in the foul, the natural concomitant of profligate 
principles. 

They err very much, who think religion, or a 
ftrift morality, difcompofes the mind, and renders 
it unfit for converfation ; for it rather infpires us 
to innocent mirth, without fuch a counterfeit joy 
as vitious men appear with ; and indeed wit is as 
coniiilent with religion, as religion is with good 
manners ; nor is there any thing in the limitation 
of virtue and religion that fliould abate the plea* 
furcs of this world, but on the contrary rather 
ferves to increafe them. 

On the other hand, many men, by their own vice' 
and, intemperance, difqualify thenrfelves- for con- 
verfation. ConVerfation is immoral, where the 
difcourfe is indecent, immodeft, fcandalous, flail- 
derous, and abulive. How great is their folly, 
und how much do they expofe therafelves, wheni, 
they affront their beft friend, even God himfelf, 
who laughs at the fool ’^hen his fear cometh? 

The great fcandal atheiffical and immoral dif- 
courfe gives to virtue, ought methinks, to be pu- 
nifhed by all good magiftrates : make a man once 
ceafe to believe a God, and he has nothing left 
to limit his foul. How incongruous is it to good 
government, that a man fliall be puniflied for 
drunkennefs, and yet have liberty to affront, and 
even deny the Majeffy of heaven ? when if, even 
among men, one gives the lie to a gentleman in 
company, or perhaps fpeaks an affronting word, 
a quarrel will enfue, and a combat, and perhaps 
murder be the confequence ; at the leaff, he will 
profccute him at law with the utmoft virulence 
and oppreffion. 

The next thing to be refrained, is obfcene dif- 
courfe, which is the language only of proficients 
in debauchery, who never repent but In a goal oV

their clifcourfe, till the body becomes too nafty 
for the foul to ftay any longer in it. ' 

, Nor is falfe talking to be lefs avoided ; for ly- 
ing is the llieep's cloathing hung upon the wolf’s 
back: it is the Pharifee’s prayer, the whore’s 
bufs, the hypocrite’s painty the murderer’s fmile,. 
the thief’s cloak, it is Joab’s embrace, and Judah’s 
" kifs ; in a word, it is mankind’s darling fin, and 
the devil’s diflinguifliing charafter. Some add lies, 
« to lies, till it not only comes to be improbable, 
but even impolTible too : others lie for gain, to de- 
ceive, delude, and betray : and a third lies for fport,, 
or for fun. There are other liars, wro are per- 
fonal and malicious ; who foment differences, and! 
carry .tales from one houfe to another, in order 
to gratify their own envious tempers, without 
any regard to reverence or truth. 

Chap. V. Of the frefent flate of religion in the 

•world, 

I doubt, indeed, there is much, more devotion 
than religion in the world, more adoration than 
fuppHcation, and more hypocFify than fincerity i 
and it is very melancholy to confider, what num^- 
befs of people there are furniflied with the powers 
of reafon and gifts of nature, and yet abandoned’ 
to the grofTefl ignorance and depravity. But it 
would be uncharitable for us to imagine (as fotne 
Papifts abounding with too much ill-nature, the^ 
only fcandal to religion, do) that they will cer- 
tainly be in the flate of damnation after this lifej; 
for how can we think Lt confiflent with the mer- 
cy and goodnefs of an infinite Being, to damn 
thofe creatures, when he has not furnifhed them 
with the hght of his gofpel ; or how can fuch proud,, 
conceited, and cruel bigots, preferibe rules to the 
juflice and mercy of God.^ ; 

We 



or ROBINSON CRUSOE. 333^ 

We are told by fome people, that the great 
image which King Nebuchadnezzar let up to be a- 
dored by his people, held the reprefentation of 
the fun in its right hand, as the principal object 
of adoration. But to wave this difcourfe of hea- 
thens, how many felf-contradiding principles are 
t'here held among Chriftians ? and how do we 
doom one another to the devil, while all profefs 
to worlhip the fame Deity, arid do exped the 
fame falvation. 

When I was at Portugal, there was held at that 
time^the court of jullice of the inquifition. All 
the criminals were carried in procellion to the 
great church, where eight of them were habited* 
in gowns and caps of canvafs, whereon the tor- 
ments of hell were difplayed, and they were con- 
demned and burnt for crimes againft the catholic 
faith and blefled virgin. 

I am forry to make any reHeftion upon Ghrifti- 
ans ; but indeed in Italy the Roman religion feems 
the moft cruel and mercenary upon earth: and a 
very judicious perfon, who travelled thro* Italy 
from Turkey, tells us, “ That there is only the 
** face and outward pomp of religipn there; that 
“ the church protefts murderers and alTalfins, and 
then delivers the civil magiflrates over to Sa- 
tan for doing jullice ; interdicts whole king-. 
“ doms, and Ihuts up the churches for v/ant of 
** paying a few eccleliaflical dues, and fo puts a 
“ flop to religion for want of their money ; that 
the court of Inquifition burnt two men for 
“ fpeaking dilhonourably of the blelTed virgin : 
“ and the milfionaries of China tolerated the wor- 
“ fhipping the devil by their new converts : that 
“ Italy was the theatre, where religion was the 
** grand opera ; and that the Popifti clergy were 
“ no other than the flage-players.” 

As to religion in Poland, they deny Chrifl to 

be 



334 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

be the MefTiah, or that the Mefllab has come ia 
the flefli. And as to their Proteftants, they are 
the followers of Eaelious Socinus, who denied our 
Saviour’s divinity ; and have no concern about 
the divine infpi ration of the Holy Ghoft. 

In Mufcovy their churches are built of wood, 
and indeed they have but wooded priefls, though 
of the Greek church: they pray as much to St# 
Nicholas, as Papifls do to the Virgin Mary, for 
protedion in all. their difficulties and afflidions. 

- As to Lutherans, they only differ from the Ro- 
mans in believing confubttantiation, inftead of 
tranfubllantiation ; but, like them, they are much 
pleafed with the external gallantry and pomp, , 
more than the true and real pradice of it. 

. In France I found a world of priefls, the llreets 
every where crouded with them, and the churches , 
full of women ; but furely never was a nation fo_^ 
fjtll of blind guides, fo ignorant of religion, and 
even as void of morals, as thofe people who con- . 
fefs their fins to them. 

Does it not feem ftrange, that while all men 
own the Divine Being, there fliould be fo many 
different opinions as to the manner of paying hinv 
obedience in the Chriftian church ? I know not > 
what reafon to aflign for this, except it be theip. 
different capacities and faculties. 

And indeed, upon this account, we have per- 
ceived in all Chriftian countries what mortal feuds, 
have been about religion : what wars and blood-; 
filed have molefted Europe, till the general pacifi-i 
cation of the German troubles at the treaty of. 
Weftphalia ; and fmce thofe times, what perfecu-i 
tion in the fame country among the churches of 
the Lutherans : and fiiould I take a pjorpecl at . 
home, what unhappy divifions are between Chrifti- 
ans in this kingdom, about Epifcopacy and Pref- 
hytery, the church of England men and the dif-' 

Centers j

fenters ; oppofing one another like St. Paul and 
St. Peter, even to the face; that is, they carry 
on the difpute to the utmofl: extremity. 

It might be a queflion, why there are fuch dif- 
ferences in religious points, and why thefe breaches 
fhould be more hot and irreconcilable ? All the 
anfwer 1 can give to this, is, that we inquire more 
concerning the truth of religion, than any other 
nation in the world ; and the anxious concern we 
have about-it, makes us jealous of every opfnion, 
and tenacious of our own ; and this is not becaufe 
we are more furious and^rafli than other people ; 
but the truth is, we are more concerned about 
them, and being fenlible that the fcripture is the 
great rule of faith, the ftandard for life and doc- 
trine, we have recourfe to it ourfelves, without 
lubmitting to any pretended infallible judge upon 
£arth. 

There is another queftion, pertinent to the for- 
mer, and that is, what remedy can we apply to 
this malady ? And to this I mull negatively an- 
fwer, Not to be lefs religious, that we may dif- 
fer the lefs. This is flriking at the very root of* 
ajl religious differences ; for certainly, were they 
to be carried on with a peaceable fpirit, willing 
to be informed, our variety of opinions would npjt 
have the name of differences ; nor fhould we fepa- 
rate in communion of charity, though we did not 
^gree in feveral articles of religion. 

Nor is there a lefs ufeful queflion to flart, 
namely, where will our unhappy religious differ- 
ences end.^ To which, I hope, I may anfwer, in 
Heaven; there all unehriftian and unbrotherly 
differences will find a period ; there, we (hall em- 
brace rfiany a finner, that here we think it a dif- 
honour to converfe with ; and perceive many a 
heart we have broken here with cenfures, re- 
proaching, and revilings, made whole again by

the balm of the fame Redeemer’s blood. Here 
we fliall perceive there have been other flocks 
than thofe of our fold ; that thofe we have excom- 
municated, have been taken into that fuperior 
communion : and, in a word, that thofe contra- 
difting notions and principles, which we thought 
inconnftent with true religion, we fliall then find 
reconcilable to themfelves, to one another, and 
to the fountain of truth. If any man alk me, why 
our dilFerences cannot be ended upon earth ; I 
anfwcr, were we all thoroughly convinced, that 
then they would be reconciled, we would put an 
end to them before; but this is impolfible to be 
done: for as mens certain convidlions of truth 
are not equal to one another, or to the weight or 
lignificancy of fuch veracity ; fo neither can a ge- 
neral eflTcft of this affair be expelled on this fide 
of the grave. 

Before I conclude this chapter, I fliall beg leave 
to difeourfe a little of the wonderful excellency 
of negative religion and negative virtue. ,The 
latter fets out like the Pharifee, with, God, I thank 
thee ; it is a piece of religious pageantry, the hy- 
pocrite’s hope: and, in a word, iris pofitive vice: 

" for It is cither a mafk to deceive others, or a mill 
to deceive ourfelves. A man that is clothed with 
negatives, thus argues : I am not fuch a drunkard 
as my landlord, fuch a thief as my tenent, fuch a 
fwearer as his neighbour : neither am I a cheat, 
an atheift, a rakifli fellow, or a highwayman : no 1 
I live a fober regular retired life : I am a good 
man, I go to church, God I thank tliee. Now, 
though a man boafts of his virtue in contradiclion 
to the vices mentioned, yet a perfoh had better 
have them altogetheri, than the man himfelf ^ for 
he is fo full of himfelf, fo perfuaded that he is 
good and religious enough already, that he has no 
idiDughts of any thing, except it be to pull ofiPbis 

hat- - 



Gt ROBINSON CRUSOE. . 337 

hat to God Almighty now and then, and thank 
him, that he has no occahon for him^ and has the 
vanity to think t lat his neighbours mull imagine 
well of him too. 

The negative man, though he is no tJrunkard, 
is yet intoxicated with the prideofhis own worth: 
a good neighbour and peace-maker in othor*fami- 
lies, but a tyrant in his own ; appears in church 
for a fliow, but never falls upon his knees in his 
clofet j does all his alms before men, to be feen 
of -them; 'eager in the duties of the fecond table, 
but regardlefs of the firft ; appears religiou§, to 
be taken notice of by men, but without inter-' 
oourfe or communication between God and his 
own foul : Fray, what is the man ? or what com- 
fort is there of the life he lives ? he is infenfible 
of f;irh, repentance, and a Chrillia-n mortified 
life; in a word, he is perfedlly a flranger to the 
elTential part of religion. 

Let us for a while enter into the private and 
retired part of his conveiTation : Vv hat notions 
has he of his mi.'pent hours, and of the progi*ers, 
of time to the great centre and gulf of life, eter- 
nity.^ does he know how to put a right value on 
time, or efteem the life blood of his foul, ~as it 
really is, and ad.in all the moments of it, as one 
that mufi account for them ? If then you can form 
an equality between what he can do; and what he 
fliali receive; lefs can it be founded upon his ne- 
gative virtue, or what he has forborn to do, and 
if neither his negative nor pofitive piety can be 
-equal to the reward, and to the eternity that re^ 
ward is to lall for, what then is to become of the 
-Phari fee,' when he is to bcjudged by the fincerity 
of his repentance, and rewarded according to the, 
infinite grace of God, with a (late of bleflednels 
to an endlefs eternity , ' 

When the negative man converfes, with the irt-

338 LIFE and ADVENTURES 

vilible world, he is filled with as much dread and 
horror as Felix, when St. Paul reafoned to him 
of temperance, righteoufnefs, and of judgment to 
come; For Felix, though a great philofopher, of 
great power and reverence, was a negative man, 
and he was made fenfible by the apoftle, that as a 
life of virtue and temperance was its own reward, 
by giving a healthy body, a clear head, and a com- 
pofed life ; fo eternal happinefs mull proceed from 
another fpring ; namely, the infinite unbounded 
grace of a provoked God, who having ereded a 
righteous tribunal, Jefus Chrifl would feparate 
fuch as by faith and repentance he had brought 
home and united to himfelf by the grace of adop- 
tion, and on the foot of his having laid down his 
life as a ranfom for them, had appointed them to 
falvation, when all the philofophy, temperance 
and right.eoufnefs in the world befides had been 
inelFedual. And. this, I fay, it was that made 
Felix, this negative man, tiemble. 

■ Chap. VI. Of liflning to the voice 'of Providence, 

The magnificent and wife King Solomon bids’ 
us cry after knowledge, and lift up our voice for 
iinderflanding; by which is meant, religious know- 
ledge; for it follows: Then fait thou underjiand 
the fear of the Lord, and find the knovjledge of 
God. By which undoubtedly he meant, to inquire 
after every thing that he has permitted us to know, 
and not to fearch into thofe ways, that are un« 
fearchaWe, and are effedually locked up from our 
•knowledge. Now, as liflning to the voice of pro- 
vidence is my prefent fubjecl, I intend, in the firfl: 
place, to write to thofe who own, r. That there 
is a God, a firft great moving caufe of all things, 
and eternal power, prior, and confequently fu<- 
perior to all created power or being. 2, That 

this 



or ROBINSON CRUSOEs 

this eternal power, which is God, is the fovereigri 
creator and governor of heaven and earth. 

To avoid all needlefs diftinftions, what perfons 
in the Godhead exercife the creating, and what 
the governing power, I offer that glorious text, 
Pfal. xxxiii. 6. where the whole Trinity is intit-' 
led to the whole creating work; and therefore, 
in. the next' place, I ffiall lay down thefe two pro- 
politions. 

I. That the eternal God guides by his providence^ 
the 'whole univerfe^ 'which 'was created by hiS 
po'wer* 

II, That this providence manifefts a particular 
care over^ and concern in the governing and_ 
direhiing many the mojl noble creature upon 
earths 

It is plain, that natural religion proves the’ 
by intimating the neceffity of a providence 
girding and governing the world, from the con-' 
fequence of the wifdom, juftice, prefcience, and 
goodnefs of the Almighty Creator ; for otherwife, 
it would be abfurd' to think, that God fliould cre- 
ate a world, without any care or providence over 
it, in guiding the operations of nature, fo as ta 
preferve the order of his creation. 

Revealed religion gives us a light into the care 
artd'eoncern of hia providence, by the climate’s 
being made habitable, the creatures fubjedted and 
made nourifliing, and all vegetative life made me^ 
dicinal ; and ^ all this for the fake of man, who is 
made viceroy to the King of the earth. The fhort' 
defeription I fhall give of providence is this: I hat 
it is that operation of the power, of the wifdom, 
jultice, and goodnefs of God, hy which, he influent 
ces, "-governs, and, diredls, not: only the means, 
but the events of all things, which concern us in-

this fublunary world ; the fovereignty of which 
•we ought always to reverence, obey its motions,, 
obferve its di^lates, and lilten to its voice. The 
prudent nian forefeeth the evil, and hidech him^ 
i’elf ; that is, as 1 take it, there is a fecret provh 
dence intimates to us, that fome danger threatens, 
if we ftrive not to fliun it. 

The fame day that Sir John Hot ham kept out 
Hull againlt the royal martyr King Charles I. the 
fame day Sir John Hotharn was put to death by 
the parliament for that very adlion ; the fame day 
that the king himfelf ligned the warrant for the 
execution of the Earl of Stafford, the fame day 
of the month was he barbaroufly murdered by the 
blood thirffy Oliverian crew: and the fame day 
that King James the Second came to the crowa 
againff the bill of eXclufion, the fame day he was 
voted abdicated by the parliament, and the thtone 
filled with King William and Q^ueen Mary. 

The voice of fignal deliverance from fudden 
dangers, is not only a juff call to repentancCj but 
a cautiqa againff falling into the like danger j but 
fuch who are utterly carelefs of themfelves after, 
lliew a lethargy of the worft nature, which feems. 
to me to.be a kind of praflical .atheifm,- or at leaft 
a Jiving in a contempt of Heaven^ when he re- 
ceives goixl at the hand of his Maker, but is un- 
concerned front whence it comes, or to thank the 
bountiful hand that gave it ; neither when he re- 
ceives evil, does it alter his manner of life, or 
'bring him to any Hate of humiliation. 

We have a remarkable ffory of tvvofoldiers be-.« 
ing condemned to death in Flanders. , 'Ihe gene- 
ral being prevailed upon to fpare One of them,,

The officer appointed to fee the execution, order-^ 
ed them to throw again ; they did fo, and each of 
them threw three fives ; at which the foldiers that 
flood round, fhouted, and faid neither -of them was 
to die. Upon this the officer acquainted the council 
of war, who ordered them to throw a third time^ 
when they threw two fours ; the general being 
made acquaint with it, fent for the men, and par- 
doned them love, fays he, in fuch extraordi- 
nary cafes, to lilten to the voice of providence. 

-We read in the holy writings, how God fpcaks 
to men, by appearance of angels, or by dreams 
and vifions of the night. As God appeared to A- 
braham, Lot, and Jacob fo angels liave appear- 
ed to many in other cafes, as to Manoah and his 
wife, Zachariah, the virgin Mary, and to the a- 
poflles; others have been warned in a dream, as 
Icing Abimelech, the falfe prophet Balaam, and 
many others.' 

. - It is certainly a very great and noble inquiry, 
what we ffiall be after this life t for there is fcarce 
a doubt, that there is a place referved for the re- 
ception of our. fouls after death : for if we are to 
be, we nmfl have a where, which the feriptures 
affert by the examples of Dives and Lazarus, The 
dodlrine of fpirits was long believed before our 
Saviour’s time ; for when the difeiples of the blef- 
fed Jefus perceived our Saviour walking on the 
' fea, they were much furprifed, as though they 
had feen a fpirit. Nay, inthofe ages of the world, 
■it was- believed that fpirits intermeddled in the af- 
fairs of mankind ; and throughout the^ Old Tef-

Abundance of flrange notions pofleffed me, when: 
I was in the defolate ifland ; efpecialiy on a moon- 
fliine night, when every bulb feemed a man, and 
every tree a man on horfeback. When I crept 
into the difmal cave, where the old goat lay expi- 
ring, whofe articulate groans evenrefembled thofe 
of a man, how was I furprifed ! my blood chilled 
in my veins, a cold fweaty dew let on my fore- 
head, my hair flood upright, and my joints, like 
BeHliaiZar’s knees, ftruck againlt one another. 
And indeed, though I afterwards found what it 
was, the remains of this furprife did not wear off' 
for a great while; and I had frequently returns 
of thofe vapours on different occalionsj^ and fome- 
times without any occafion at alL

I lighted a candle, I could perceive no living crea-

How intelligences are given or received, we do- 
not know; nor are we fenfible how they are con- 
veyed from fpirits unembodied, to ours that are- 
in life ; or on the contrary from us to them'; the 
latter certainly is done withopt the help of .the* 
organs, and the former is conveyed by the under- 
flanding^ and the retired faculties of the foul. 1 
The fpirits, without the h?lp of voices, con- 
verfe, and the more particular difeoveries of the ' 
eonverfe of fpirits, feem to me as follow ; to wit^. 
dreams, voices, noifes, impulfes, hints, apprehen- 
fions, involuntary fadnefs, b'a ' , 

Dreams of old were the ways by which God> 
himfelf was pleafed to warn men what fervices tO' 
perform, and what to Ihun. Jofeph was directed’ 
of God in a dream to go to E^pt andTo were: 
fhe wifexmen warnpd in a dream to depart into- 
their own country another way, to avoid the fury 
of Herod. 1 am not like thofe who think dreams 
are the mere dofings of a delirious head, or the- 
relics of a day’s perplexities of pleafures ; but,, 
on the contrary, 1 muft beg leave to fay, I never 
met with any capital mifehief in my life, but 1 had 
fame notice of it by a dream; and had I riot beem 
a thoughtlefs unbelieving creature, L might have 
taken many a warning, and avoided many of the- 
evils I afterwards fell into, merely by total ne- 
gle£l of thofe dreams, . 

I was

I was once prefent at a cUfpute between a lay- 
man and a clergyman, upon the fubjedt of dreams^ 
The firlh thought no regard fliould be given untO' 
them : that their communication from the invili- 
ble to the vifible world was a mere chimera ; with- 
out any folid foundation. For, i. faid he, if 
dreams were from the agency of any prefcient 
being, the motives would be more diredt, and the 
difcoveries more plain j and not by allegories and 
emblematic fancies, exprefllng things imperfeft and 
obfcure, 2. Since, with the notice of evil, there 
was not a power given to. avoid it, it is not likely 
to proceed from a fpirit, but merely fortuitous, 
3. That the inconllancy of fuch notices, in cafes 
equally important, proves they did not proceed 
from any fuch agent. 4. That as our mofl dif- 
tinft dreams had nothing in them of any , fignifi- 
cancy, it would be irrational and vain to think 
that they came from heaven. And, 5 that as men 
were not always thus warned or fupplied with 
notice of good or evil, fo all men are not alike' 
fupplied with them ; and what reafon could we 
give, why one man or one woman fliouldnot have 
the lame hints as another. 

To all this, the clergyman gave anfwer ; i. That, 
as to the lignification of dreams, and the objec- 
tions againlt them as being dark and doubtful^ 
they are exprefled generally by hieroglyphical 
“reprefentations, fimihes, allulions, and figurative 
emblematic ways, by which means, for want of 
interpretation, the thing was not underftood, and 
confequently the evil not Ihunhed. 2. That we 
charge God foolifhly, to fay, that he has given 
/' the notice of evil without the power to avoid it ; 
for if any one had not power to avoid the evil, it 
was no notice to him ; and it was want of giving 
due heed to that notice, thnt firft men negledted 
themfelves, and then charged the Judge of all the

good. It is a miflake to fay, dreams have np irn- 
pprt at all: we m ght with more reafpn have faid, 
none that we could perceive the reafon of, owing 
to our blindnefs and fupine negligence, too fecure 
at one time, and too much alarmed at another; fo 
that the Ipirit^ which we might be faid to be con- 
verfing with in a dream, was conftantly and equal- 
ly kind and Careful ;*but our powers are not al- 
ways in the fame ftate of a£Hon, not equally at- 
tentive to, or retentive to the hints that were, 
given. And, 5. to ahfwer the lall queftioUj why 
people are not equally fupplied? This feemed to. 
be, no quellion ; for Providence itfelf might havft 
fpme fhare in the diredlion .pf it, and then 'that 
Providence might be limited by a fuperiot direc- ^ 
tipn ; That as to. the cdnverfe of fpirits, he could 
not call it a ftated^ converfe ; fuch a .thing there -

notion of in a ffate'of common life, and the emp- 
tinefs of our notion, that the planets are habita- 
ble worlds, that is, created like ours for the fub-- 
iiflence and exiftence of man and beaff, and the 
jtrefervation of the vegetative and fenfitive life : 
no, no; this k, I alllire you, a world of fpirits ; 
for here I law a clear deinonflration of Satan being^ 
the prince of the poiver of the ait\ keeping his 
court or camp, with innumerable angels to attend 
him ; but his power is not fo great as we imagine, 
he can tempt us to the crime, but cannot force us 
to commit itt Humanum efl peccare. Neither has 
the devil power to force the' world into a rebellion 
againfl Heaven, though his legions are employed' 
among favage nations to fet up their mafier for a 
god, who make the Heathens either worfliip him 
in perfon, or by his reprefentatives, idols, and 
monrters, with the cruel facrifices of human blood. 
Now, as to the limitations of the devil’s power, 
you muft underftand, that as there are numbers 
of evil fpirits employed in mifchief, fo there are' 
numbers of good angels fent from the higher and 
blelTed abodes to difconcert and oppofe their mea- 
fures j and this every Chriftian, I hope, believes, 
when he prays to God, the Father of fpirits, to 
give his angels charge over him while he flumber- 
eth and fleepeth. For if thefe preventing powers, 
the devil was not reffrained, the earth would be 
fubjefted to dearth, droughts, and famine-; the* 
air infefted with ncfccious fumes ; and in a word, 
mankind would be utterly deflroyed, which might 
oblige our Maker (if 1 may be allowed the expref- 
fion) to the necelTity of a new Fiat, or el fe have* 
no more creatures to honour and worlhip him*. 

As the devil never wanted inlinuatoi s, I fliall 
obferve, that I learned a way how to make man 
dream of what I pleafed. For inftance let us fup» 
pofe one to be found afleep; let- another lay hi^

mouth clofe to his ear, and whifper any thing fo 
foftly as not to awake him, the fleeping man ihall 
dream of what has been fo whifpered in his ear ; 
nay,, I can afiure you, thofe infinuating devils can 
do this even when we are awake, which I call im- 
pulfes of the mind; for from whence, but from 
thefe infinuators, come our caufelefs palTions, in- 
voluntary wickednefs, or linful delires ? Who elfe 
form ideas in the mind of man when he is afleep, 
£>r prefents terrible, or beautiful figures to his fan- 
cy? Mr. Milton reprefents the devil tempting Eve 
in the fliape of a toad, lying jvtft at her ear, when 
in her bow’er Ihe lay faft aljeep ; and brings in 
Eve telling Adam what an utieafy night’s reft fhe 
had, and relating her dream to him.. And likewife 
I believe that good fpirits have the fame inter- 
-courfe with us, in warning us againft thofe things 
that are evilj and prompting us to that which is 
good. - 

Were we to have the eyes of our fouls opened, 
through the eyes of our bodies, we lhould fee this 
very immediate region of air. which We breath in, 
thronged With fpirits now invifible, and which 
•otherwife would be the moft terrible: welhould 
view the fecret tranfaftions of thofe meffengers 
who are employed when the parting foul takes its 
leave of the reludlant body, and perhaps fee things 
nature would Ihrink back from with the utlnoft 
terror and amazement. In a word, the curtain 
of providence for the difpofition of things here^^ 
and the curtain of judgment for the determination 
of the ftate of fouls hereafter would be alike drawn 
hack ; and what heart could fupport here its future 
ftate of life, much lefs that of its futtire ftate after 
life, ,even good or bad. 

A gentleman of my acquaintance, being about 
feven, miles diftanC from London, a friend that 
came to dine with him, folicited him to go to the

city. What, faid the gentleman, is there any 
occaiion for me? No, Sir, faid the other, nothing 
at all, except the enjoyment of your good com- 
pany } and fo gave over importuning him. Juft- 
then a ftroUg impulfe of mind urged the gentle- 
man, and purfued him like a voice, with Go to 
London, Go to London. Hark ye. fays he to his 
friend, is all well at London ? Am i wanted there ? 
Or did you alk me to go with you on any particu- 
lar account? Are all my family well? Yes, in- 
deed Sir, laid he, I perceived them all very hearty ? 
and I did not aflc you to go to London upon any 
particular account whatfoever, excCpt it was for 
the fake of your good company. Again he put 
off t is refolution : but fliil the impulfe fuggefled 
to him. Go to London, and at length he did fo. 
When he came there, he found a letter and raef- 
fenger had been there to feek him, and to tell him 
of a particular bufinefs, which was firfl and Ikfl 
above a thoufand pounds to him, and which might 
inevitably befen loft, had He not gone to London 
that night. ' , 

The obeying of feveral hints, or fecret impul- 
fes argues great wifdom. I know a man that was 
under misfortunes, being guilty of mifdemcanors 
againft the government ; when, abfconding for 
fear of his ruin, all his friends advifing him not 
to put himfelf in the hands of the law, one morn- 
ing as he awaked, he felt a flrong impulfe darting 
into his mind thus. Write a letter to them : and 
this was repeated Ihveral times to his njiind, and 
at laft he anfwcrtd to it, as if it had been a voice, 
Whom Jhatl I ’Write to P Immediately it replied. 
Write to the judge ^ and this impulfe purfued him 
for feveral days, till at length he took pen, and 
ink| and paper, and fat down to write to him ; 
when immecUateiy words flowed from his pen, like

fireams from a fair fountain; that charmed evert 
Himfelf with hopes of fuccefs. In fliort, the letter 
was fo ftrenuous' in argument, To pathetic in its 
eloquence, and fo perfuafively moving, that whert 
the judge had read, it, he fent him an anfwer he 
might he eafy, he would endeavour to make that 
matter light to him f and indeed' never -left exhort-

ked me, but finding it a dream, he compofed him- 
felf again to fleep, when he dreamed a fecond time' 
the fame dream. This made him a little uneafy j; 
but thinking it proceeded from the impreflion made 
bri his mind by the former, he went to fleep agaiix^ 
and dreained the fame dream u third time alfoi." 
3o troubled was he at this, that he arofe, and 
knocked* at his mother’s chamber, told, his con- 
cern, and his apprehenlions that all were not right 
at his relation’s houfe.. Dear fon,, fays the goodt 
old gentlewoman, do not mind jiiefefoolifii dreams;,

then indeed he put on his night-gown, and %vent to

this apparition, he corifuked feveral friends, wha 
advife“d him to take the adviee. But after all, it 
was not an apparition, but a grave and piousAgen- 
tleman, who met him by mere accident, and had 
been fenfible of his wickednefs; and who never 
undeceived him, left it flipuld hinder his reforma- 
tion. Were we always willing to make good ufe 
of Satan^s real appearances, I know not but it 
would go a great way to banilh him from the vi- 
sible world; for l am very pofitive, he would fel- 
dom vifit us, if he thought his coming would do* 
us any good : but fo abfolutely is he at the com- 
mand of Heaven, that he muft go, even to do the 
work he abhors. 

Some people make a very ill ufe of the general 
notion, that there are no apparitions nor fpirits 
at all ; which is worfe than thofe who fancy they 
-fee them upon every occafion ; for thofe carry 
their notions farther, even to annihilate the devili 
and believe notliing about him, neither of onekihdl 
or other : the next ftep they come to is to con- 
clude, Therd is no God^ and fo atheifra takes its- 
rife in the fame fink, with a carelelfnefs about fu- 
turity. But there is no occafion to enter upon 
ah argument to prove the being of the Almighty, 
or to illuftrate his power by words, who has fo 
many undeniable teftimonie? in the breafts of eve*- 
ry rational being, to prove his exiftence ; and we: 
have fufficient proofs, enough to convince us of 
the great fuperintcndeney of divine Providence 
in the minuteft alFairs of this world ; the manifeft 
•cxlftefice of the inviiible worlds; the reality of fpi- 
rits, and intelligence between us and themi What 
I have faid, I hope will not miflead any perfon, or 
be a means whereby they may delude tnenifeives ;
