, "THE kind reception given to the

author's system of writing in words of
one syllable has encouraged her to add
to her works the ' popular story of'
"The Swiss Family Robinson " as a
twin book to " Robinson Crusoe."
The monosyllabic rule has been strictly
adhered to throughout, the only excep-
tion occurring necessarily in the title of
the book itself. The author's object
' has been to provide what the reviewer
of her former works in the Atheimum
has called "a field of exercise for a
child who has just learnt to cbnquer
words." "There is sure to be some
success," he continues; "and it is a
greabpoint in all teaching to let the
rst 1ndependent exercise be one in
which victory is really to be won by
moderate effort."

CHAPTER I.

FOR six days a fierce wind set in, which
. . tore our sails to shreds; the white foam
of the waves swept our decks, and the
storm drove our ship so far out of its
COurse, that there was no one on board
who could tell where we were. All
were worn outwith toil and care, and the
paths of the men were heard no more,
fibut they fell on their knees to pray.
'My wife and boys clung round me
in great dread; but I said to them,
" God can save us if He will. He
knows each rock that lies hid, and

'sees' each storm as it comes; yet if He
32 T ke S wz'ss quz'bl Roezhson.

should think it good to call us to.

Him, let us not grieve at it: weYshall
not part." At these words I saw my
wife dry her tears, and from that time
she was more calm. .

All at once we heard the cry of

" Land! Land l " The ship had struck
on a rock, and the force of the shock
with which she went threw us off our
feet.
' Then came a loud crack as if the
.ship had split in two, when we heard
the chief mate call out, "' Launch the
boats!" These words went like a
sword through my heart, and the
cries of my boys grew more and more
shrill. << *
" Fear not, my dear ones," said I;
"the ship still lifts us out of the sea,
and the 'land.is near. Stay here, and
I will try to saveyou." ' - . "
, I went on deck, but was soon thrown
down by the wild surge of the sea.
Once more there came a wave of such
huge bulk that I strove with it in
vain, and fell flat on the deck.
'_ The ship was all but in two. The
:whole of the crew had got in the boat,
'and 'I could see the last man cut the
rope. I gave a loud call for them to wait
till we could join them; but from the
war of the waves my voice was not
heard, and all hope from the boat was

ost.
The stem, which held those most
r dear 'to me on earth, stood like awedge,
' with a rock on each side of it. I could
{see in the south a trace of land, which
- though Wild and bare, was now the
aim of all my hopes; for there was no
more aid to be had from man.

'I left the deck to go down to my

32
wife and boys. I then put on a calm
look, and said, "Be of good cheer. If
the wind should go down we may yet
reach the land." .

This made my dear boys dry their
' tears, for at all times they put their
trust in .what I told them. But my
wife, who knew best how to read my
thoughts, saw how full of care they
were; and by a sign I made known
to her that I had not much hope that
the wind would go down.

"Let us take some food," said she;
"it will give" us' strength."

Night came on, and it grew dark;
we heard the wild waves boil with rage,
and they tore down the planks with
a loud crash. "' How could the boats
livethrough such a storm as this?"
thought I.

The boys went to bed and slept, all
but Fritz, whom I took with me on
,deck to watch. He and I could swim;
but as the rest could not, we set our
thoughts to work out some plan by
which we could get them to land,
should the ship break up

There were casks on Iaboard, and we
thought we might bind two of them fast
with ropes, and leave a space in which
to place one of the boys, who might put
an arm in each cask, and so float to
shore; the same for the rest of them,
and one for my wife. We put by
some knives, string, and such like
things, which we thought might be
of use in case we should reach the
coast.
. At length Fritz, worn out with hard'
work, fell to sleep. My wife and I
had too much on our minds for rest.
We brought the load of our grief, our

9
doubts, and fears, to the throne of God,
and left them there; for we did our
best not to give way to them, lest they
should chill our sense of Gods lovey,
and dry up the spring of our faith in
His m1 ght.

Oh, how the time did seem to lag
with us throu h that long dark night!
But, like all t ings else, it came to an
end at last. Words are too weak to
tell of the joy with which I saw from
the deck the first faint streak of dawn
' shoot up the sky.

The wind was now more calm, the
sea less rough, and this brought a ray
of hope to my heart. I went to fetch
my wife and yboys on deck; and the
young ones were struck with awe to
find no one there. " The crew, where

are they 3" said they. "Who works
the ship ?" "
' "My boys," said I, "One more
stron than man has brought us through
it til now, and if He think fit He
will stretch out" His arm to save us.
Let all hands set to work, and think
the while on this, God helps us
_ when we help those round us. Now

we must think of what it will be best
for us to do."

Fritz.--" Let us leap in the sea and
swim to shore."

Ned.--" That may do well for you
who can swim; but all the rest of us
would sink. Can we not make a raft
on which we could all go ?"

"That might do," said I, "if we
had strength5 for the work, and if a
raft were a more safe thing to go to
land on. - But set off, boysf all of you,
and seek for what there is on board
that may be of use to us."
' As fOr me, I made my way to
Where the food was kept, and my wife
went to the live stock and fed them,
for they were much in wantof food.
Fritz sought for arms, and Ned- for
tools. Jack, by chance, went were the
Chief Mate's two great docrs were
kept, who leapt on him in pfay, and
were so rough that he gave a cry, as
he thought they meant to tear him;
but want of fooyd had made them too
weak to be fierce, and 1n a short time
,he got up from where he fell, and rode
on the back of one of the dogs, and'
with a grave look came up to me as
I left the hold whence I. had been
drawn by his cries. I could not keep
a smile from my face when I told him
of the great risk he had run, and that
- he ought to be on his guard with dogs
that had been kept from food so long.
' Now my boys all came round me
with their stores. Fritz had. found six
ns, some bags of shot, and some
fibrn flasks, and these held all that we
could want for the use of our arms.
Ned brought an axe, a spade, knives,
nails, and gthe like; buty young Frank
brought a large box, which it was as
' much as he could do to hold, and when
the rest of the lads saw what was in
it, they gave a loud laugh." You may
laugh if you will, " said ZDI, " but Frank
- has3 brought the best prize of all, for
w these fishg hooks, of which I see the
' box is full, may save our lives; still
Fritz and Ned have done well too."
~ " For my part, said my wife, "I do
but bring good news. I have found
' a cow, an ass, two goats, six sheep, and
' a sow. I have fed them, and I hope
they will do well."19>> T lze Swiss Family [306th071.

I told my boys that I thought they
had all done great things, saye Jack.
" But," said I, "he has brought me
two great mouths to fill, which will do
- more harm than-good." .

Jack--"The dogs can help us to
hunt when we get to land."

"Ah!" said I, "but can you tell
us how to reach the land ?" i

"Yes," said my brave Frank, "put
us each in a great tub and let us float
to shore. I went on Aunt's. pond in
one."

" A good thought l" said I ; "we may
take a hint from a child. Be quick,
boys, give me the saw, with some
nails, and we will see what we can
do." .

I found some casks in the ship's,
hold, which we brought on deck; they
were made of strong wood, and were
bound with hoops; in fact, were just
the right thing. My boy s and I cut
each of these four casksy in two with
our saw; but it was a work of great
toil to join eight tubs, so as to make
them all the same height.

We drank some Wine which we found
in one of the casks, and this gave us fresh
strength for our work. At last our job
came to an end, and we saw with Joy
our small fleet of boats all 1n a line;
yet I could not guess how it was that
my wife should be still so sad at heart.

"I could not trust my life in
one of those tubs!" said she. But
I told her to wait till the work was
done. I then sought out a long thin

plank and put the tubs on it; but
lpeft a piece at peach end to form a curve
like the keel of a ship. We then

drove 1n nails to make 13the tubs firm
to the planks, and in the same way
putw'b'oards on each side of it, so as
to make a sort of boat, which I thought
might float in a calm sea.

But to our grief we found that our
raft was of such a weight that we could
not move it an inch." I' sent Fritz to
bring me the jack screw, and with this

and a thick pole I found I could lift
one end of the boat. Ned said he
thought the screw was slow. "What
we gain in time we lose in force," said
I. "The jack is not meant to move
fast, but to raise weights; and the more
weight there is, of course the more slow
it must be." I then took a'strong rope
to fix to the stern of the boat, one end
of which I bound fast to the beam
of the ship. I next put two round
poles for the boat to roll on, and went
to work with the jack to launCh it.
The boys all stood on the ship's deck
in great joy to see it glide off, and then
float like a swan on the waves; and
had it not been for the rope, it would
have gone off to sea. But our raft
leant so much to one side that there
was not one of the boys who would
dare to go in it. ' _
. At thls I was quite cast down, when
all at once I thought the cause must
be that it was too light: so I threw in
all I could lay hold of, and soon made
'my boat fit for use.

" Which of us is to go in first ?" said
the boys, who all made a rush at once.
But this I put a stop to, as I thought
that--full of fun as they were--they
might tip the boat on one side, and get
thrown in the sea:

. It was now time to clear the way for.>>
the flight. I got in one of the tubs and
made the boat fast in a cleft in the
ship's side. I then came back with
an axe and a saw, and cut off from the
wreck, right and left, all that might
come in our way. The next thing was
to look out for some oars, and we had
the good luck to find some.

This had been a day of hard work
for us all. One more night was to be
spent on board the wreck, though we
knew not that it would be there till the
dawn of the next day. And now we
sat down to a meal, for we had scarce
had time to snatch a piece of bread all
day.. We then went to rest, and were
more at our ease than we had been on
the past night.

I thought the best thing my wife
could do would be to wear the dress of
a youth who had been one of the ship's
crew, as it would be more warm, and
wouldsuit the raft best, and be most
fit for all the toils that were in store for
her. She felt strange 'in her new dress,
but at last I saw her laugh at it, as did
our young ones. She then went to her
berth and slept well, which gave her
strength for the next day.

--

CHAPTER II.

' AT dawn we all woke up, and I said,
"We must now, my dear boys, go on
the wide sea in search of a home.
Give all the poor beasts on board the
yvreck food to last them for some days. .
We could not take them with us, but
we might come back in our tubs for
them. , Are you all here? Get what
you wish to take with you, but let it be'16 me Swiss Family Radium>>.

things that will meet our wants when
we get to land." if:

I had put the guns on our raft, and
I told my wife and the lads each to
seek for a game bag, a chest of tools
and nails, and sails to make a tent
with; and the boys brought so much
that I thought we must leave half,
though I took out of the tubs those
things which I had thrown in to give
weight. '

Just as we got on board the cock
gave a loud crow as a hint that we had
left no food for him and the hens. So
I took all the birds with us, geese,
'ducks, fowls, and doves. We put
. twelve of them in a tub with a lid
to it, and the rest we let loose, in the
hopes that the geese and ducks might
swim to shore, and the fowls and doves

fly there.

r
Where was my wife all this time?
She came at last with a huge bag, which
she threw in the tub that held her dear
Frank, and I made sure it was meant
_ for a seat for him.

This is the way we each took our
place on the raft :--In the first tub sat
my wife; in the next, Frank; in. the
third, Fritz, a good big boy, with sound
sense and full of life; in the fourth, our
dear Jack, ten years old, yet stout of
heart; and the fifth and sixth held all
sorts of food. Then in the next tub
stood Ned, who was twelve years old,
with more thought of self than the rest,
and slow to move. I was in the eighth
tub, bent on my task, which was to
guide the boat that held all that was
most dear to me in this world.

.As we left the wreck the tide rose,
which I thought might be a help to us.

C
We each took an oar, in hopes that in
the end we should reach the blue
.shore. But, oh, how far off it did
\ seem! '

For some time it was all in vain, as
the boat would turn round and round.
But at last I found the way to steer it
so as to make it go straight on.

As soon as the two dogs saw us
leave the ship, the leapt in the sea and
swam up to us; gut though my boys
had a great wish to take them with us,
I could not let them come in the boat,
lest they should tip it downon one side.
This was a source of great grief to all,-
for we did not think they would have
the strength to swim to shore. Be that
as it might, Spring and Flox took to
the waves with a dash, as much as to
say they did not mean to be left. They
came up now and then to put their fore
paws on the raft, and by this means
they kept up with us.

We went on and on, and I had much
doubt if we should reach the land.
'As we drew near to it, my hopes were
the more faint, so drear did the coast
seem; and, worst of all, it had a dark
ridge of rocks in front of it, that wore
the look of a frown, as if to warn us off.

Now and then we came up to some
casks from the wreck, and we drew
them with us all the way, by means
of a rope. We did not cease to ply
our oars} till we got to the coast, and
then, to our great joy, we found a break
in the chain of the rocks, and the sharp
eye of Fritz made out some trees. I '
could not .see them, but, by good luck,
Jack hadbrought a small glass, which
he drew from his pouch with some
pride, and gave it to me. By the aid

C2
of this I saw a small creek with rocks
on each side of it; and as I found that
the ducks and geese made up to it,
I knew it was all right. It was, in
short, a small bay, and there we got
on shore.

All who could do so leapt to land in
a trice; and our poor Frank, who had
been laid down in his tub like a salt
fish, did his best to crawl out, but had
to wait for my wife to help him. The
dogs, which were the first to get to
shore, leapt round us with a loud bark;
the ducks and the geese kept. up their
cry; and the fowls, which we had just
let loose, lent their Cluck. All these
sounds, with the noise of the boys' talk,
made a strange din. _

The first thing we did when we
came safe to land, was to bow down
and give thanks to God, in whoseT lze S 1023:? Family 1305:3230". 2!

hands were our lives. To cast off 'our
own strength, and lay hold of the
Lord's, is the way to be strong--too-
strong for earth and hell to shake us.

If we make God our guide, how can
we go wrong? If we make Him our
shield, why need we fear? If we make
His Word the lamp of our feet, how
can we stray? He is our life, our
God, our all; the Lord is our strength.

When we took all we had out of the
boat--how rich we felt with these few
things! We found a good place for
our tent in the shade of the rocks: so
we set to work with a pole and pegs,
and then we brought out the food.

I sent my sons to fetch some grass
and moss to spread in the sun to dry,
that we might sleep on it at night, and
while all the boys, down to Frank,
were at work at this, I found a place
near a stream for us to cook in. The
flat stones of the rock made a. 00d
hearth, and it did not take long to fight
up a bright fire of dry twigs; then
I put 1n the pot some squares of the
new kind of soup, and left my wife and
Frank to cook our meal. The poor
child took this soup for glue, and said
he knew not how he could dine as there
was no meat to dress. '

To land the guns was Fritz's care,
and he took one of them with him to
the side of the stream. Ned would
not join him, for the rough road was
not to his taste: so he bent his way to
the coast. Jack set off to a ridge of
rocks which ran down to the sea
to look for shell fish, while I went
to try and draw some of the casks on
shore. But I found that the place
where I had come to land was too steep
to get them up; so I went in search
of one that lay more on a line with the
sea. I had not been there long when
I heard screams from my dear Jack.
I took' up my axe and ran to his aid,
and found himup to his knees in a
pool with a huge crab, which held his
leg tight in its sharp claw. Though
the crab made off when I came up,
I did not lose sight of it, and as Jack
had a mind to take it home, I gave
it to him. But as soon as he took the
crabinhis hand, it gave him such a
blow that the-poor boy threw it off and
set-up a sad wail once more, and it was
as much as I could do to. keep a smile"
from my lips. In a great rage my boy '
flung a large stone at .it, which put an
end to its life. When we, came back
to the tent Jack't'sai'd in a loud voice,

"A crab! Such-aahuge crab! Ned!
where's Fritz 2' Take care it does not
bite you, _Franl< !" They all soon
came round him. "Yes, here's the
claw that caught hold of my leg," quoth
Jack; "but I paid him out, the rogue !"

"What is it that you boast of ?" said
I. "You would not have come off so
well, had I not brought you aid in time;
and, pray, do you not call to mind the
blow on your face? The poor crab
did but make use of his arms to save
his life; but you had to hurl a great
stone at him with yours: so you have
no cause to be proud, my boy."

Ned thought the crab would be a
good thing to put in the soup ,but my
wife set it zDby for the next day. I then
went to that part of the shore where
it had been caught, and drew my casks
to land there. .

I told Jack that he was the first boy
to bring us food, for none of the rest
had done so.

"I saw some shell fish on a rock "
said Ned; " but I could not get at them,
for the sea made my feet wet.

"Nay," said I, "I must beg of you
to get us some then; for we must all
work for the good of the rest, and take
no heed of wet feet, for the sun soon
dries them."

"I may as well bring some salt at
the same time," said he; "I saw lots
of it in the cracks of the rocks, and
I think it must have been left there
by the sea "

y" No doubt, my young sage, said I.
"Where else could it have come from?
And- you would have done more good
to fill a bag with it, than to dwell on
the laws that brought it there. But
if you wish to eat your soup with a zest,
be quick and get some salt." So he
set off, and soon came back with some; _
but it was full of sand and earth.

To stir the .pot my wife made use
of a small stick, and when she came to
taste that which clung to it, she said,
"The soup is good, but how are we
to drink it? We have brought no
plates nor spoons! And how can we
raise this large pot to our lips P"

We all cast a grave look at the pot--
our grave look then grew to a dull gaze
--when all at once we burst out in a
loud laugh at our sad plight.

" If we had but Some large nuts,"
said Ned, "we might split them and
make both spoons and plates of them I "

"If," said I; "but we have none!
We might as well wish for some fine
gold spoons with our coat of arms on
them, if it were of use to wish."T [:5 Swiss Famiey 16052323072. 27

"Well," said Ned, " we can use
shells."

"That is a good thought," said I;
"set off, Ned, at once, and get some.
And mind, my brave boys, no grunts,
and groans, though we find it hard to
hold our spoons, and you should have
to dip your hands in the hot soup."

"At these words off ran Jack, who
was up to his knees in the sea by the
time that Ned had got to the spot.
He tore down the shells from the rocks
and threw them to Ned, who put them
in his game bag (but took good care to
let a large one fall in his pouch for his
own use), and then they came back
with their spoil.

Fritz had not yet come home, and
my wife was full of care'lest all was not
right with him; but just then we heard
his voice hail us some way off. He
soon came up with. a feint that he- was
sad, and at the same time hid his hands.
But Jack, who took a peep, said in
a loud voice (by way of a joke), "Good
sport; a young pig!" The beast
which Fritz had shot was in truth no
pig at all, but a kind of hare, which
lives on nuts and fruit.

Though all the rest of the boys had
a wish to hear Fritz tell of what he
had seen and done, I thought it right
to take my son Jack to task for the
false tale he had spread, though I but
in jest.

Fritz told us he had been on the left '
' side of the stream, where the land lies
low; and "as to the casks," said he,
"I could not count them, to say not
a word of. chests, planks, and all sorts
of things from the wreck. Should we
not do well 'to go and fetch them?
And at dawn of day we ought to go
there to look to the live stock, for we
must at least have the cow: our bread
cakes would not be half so hard if
we had some milk to soak them in."

Ned.--" How much more nice, too,
they would be l "

Fritz.---" Then I found a wood, and
some rich grass for the cow. I can't
see why We should stay down here, in
this dull nook."

"Stay," Said I, "we are but just
~comel But first tell me, did you see
a trace of our poor ship mates ?"

Fritz.--'-' No sign at all of man on
land or sea; but I saw a strange sort
of beast as big as a hog, with feet'like
'a hare."

The time-had now come to sit down
to our meal of soup ; the boys all burnt

their hands, of _ course, save Ned, who
took his large shell from his pouch, and
when it was full of soup, set it down to
cool, quite proud of it.

" You have shown some thought, my
dear N ed," said I ; "but how is it you
take So much more care of your own
self than of the rest? Now, pray, give
what is in the large shell to those poor
dogs. We can all dip our shells in the
pot, but the dogs can't do so: so they
may have your soup, and you must eat

as we do."
' This struck the heart of Ned, and
when he put his shell on the ground
, the dogs took their meal from it. As
we all sat With our eyes cast on our
shells to wait for the soup to get cool,
the dogs fell on Fritz's hare (for so he
chose to call it). All the boys sprang
up to drive them off ; but Fritz, in a
great rage, took up his gun and struck
' One of them with the stock end of it,
still the force of the blows bent it, and
would have been the death of the dog
if I had not held him back.

As soon as he had had time to cool
I took him to task, and told him he had
thrown .us all in a state of great fear;
and, what was still worse, he had spoilt
the un, which 'might have been of so
muci use to us; add to this the hard
blows he gave would kill most dogs.
" Rage such as this," said I, "leads to
all crlme. Do you not know what Cain
did ? " '

" Oh," said Fritz, " I grieve to think
of What I have done."

As soon as, we had had our meal
the fowls came round us to pick up the
crumbs. .My wife then took out her
bag, and fed them with some grain.

When they had had their fill, our
doves flew to the rocks, the fowls took
their perch'on the tent, and the ducks
and geese went to roost in a marsh near
the sea.

The sun sank all at once, and it was
time for us to go to rest. We took
care to load the guns, then knelt down
_ to pray, and went to our beds of moss ;
' . but, hot as the day had been, we found
the night was Cold.

Once more I took a peep out, to see

if all was still, and then lay down to
rest, and we all slept.

C H A P T E R I I I.
AT} break of day I heard the cock

crow; in fact, it woke me from my

> sleep. 'The first thing I did was to
rouse up my wife, and tell her of a plan
I had thought of, which was to go all
round the coast of the isle in search
of our friends from the wreck, and she
thought as I did, that this ought to be
our first care.

My wife, who saw that we could not
all go, said she would stay where she
was with her three young ones, while
Fritz and I went on our search. 'I
told her that to get back by the light of
day we must start at once, and should
want a good meal first; yet what was
there for us to eat? "Jack's great
crab will be the thing,"flsaid she; but
it was not to be found. So whilst my
wife made up the fire and put on the
pot, I woke up.the boys. "Where is
the crab ?" said I to Jack; and he
fbfdilght it from a hole in the rock,
Where he had put it to be out of the

D
reach of the dogs, which ate up all that
they could find. Said I to Jack, -
" Will you give up your crab to Fritz?
We think the claw that caught hold
of your leg will make a good meal for
him to start on, for we shall soon be on
a long march, and we must first break
our fast."

When he heard this, Jack gave up
his crab with a good grace.

Ned and the two young ones leapt
round me like kids, to beg of me to let
them join us. "But," Said I, "if you
all go, who is to take care of our new
home ?"

I meant to take Turk, and with him '
and our gun I thought we should make
a great show of strength. I then bade
Fritz tie up Flox and get out the guns.

Fritz gave a deep blush, and did' his
best to get his gun straight. I .let him
,goon for some time, and then told him
to' take one of mine, for I knew he felt
painfor what he had done. The dog,
too, gave a snarl at him; but though
he held out some of the hard bread to
him, and gave him a kind stroke on the
:head, still it was all one, for Turk
Would not trust him, while Flox would
-.lick his hand.

"Give him the claw of my crab,"
said Jack.
' " Fear not, Jack, my boy," said Ned,
"for they will be sure to meet with
nuts. Think of a nut as big as your
. head, with a cup full of milk in it l "
' "Please bring it to me if you find
one, Fritz," said Frank.

'I then told them all that we would
pray to 'God first to bless our work,

[and then lose no time, but set off at
once.
D 2
"Ding dong! Ding dong! -Ding
dong l". said my wild Jack, as in play
he took off the sound of the church
bells; but I chid him for it, and told
him that though love for the Lord was
a thing of joy, yet it was not right to
joke while we were on our knees to
pray to Him.

Poor Jack came and knelt down close
to me, to show me that he saw what
Ihad said to him in the same light as
I did. I gave all the three boys a
kiss, and toOk leave of my wife and
them. i

I thought it best to load the gun
which I had left with my wife, and told
her to keep near the boat, as it would
prove her best friend in time of need.
We all wept when we took leave, for we
did not know what our fate might be ; but
the noise of the swift stream which we
had to cross would seem to drown the
sobs of those we had left, and we bent
our thoughts on the work we had in
hand.

We each took a large bag for game,
a gun, and an axe. The right bank of
the stream was so steep that there was
but one place through which we could
cross it, and that was near the sea.
But at last, with some toil, we got to
the left bank. We had not gone more '
than a few yards through grass which
was as tall as we were, when we heard
a noise as if some wild beast ran
through it up to the spot where we
stood.

I felt proud to see that Fritz was so
brave as to stand and point his gun
to the place whence the sound came.
What was our joy to find that this fierce
foe should turn out to be Turk, whom
our grief, when we took leave of my
dear ones, drove from our thoughts,
and we made no doubt that they had
'sent him off to join us. Fritz did
not fire, and I gave him all praise
for this, as by so rash an act we should
have lost our best friend. '

>>The sea was on our left, and on our
right ran a chain of rocks, from the side
of which spread fine woods, and on the
skirts of these we took our way; We
kept a bright look out for our ship
mates. Fritz had a great wish to fire
his gun to show'them where we were,
in case they might be near us; but
I told him I thought there would be
a risk in that, for "if there were wild
tribes on the isle, they might rush on
us, and kill us.

Fritz--"I can't see why we should
search for the crew at all. I am sure
the brutes left us to our fate on the
wreck! " \ " i i
' " Fritz," said I, " we must do good to'
those that hate us, if they stand in need
of our help. You must bear in mind
that we have things from the wreck
which they have as much right to as
we, and that there would not have been
room for us in the boats; add to this,
if they were cast in the sea by the storm,
which I make no doubt they were, we
should have been lost too."

Fritz--" But we might make such
good use of our time if we were to go
to the wreck to bring the live stock on
shore."

" Should we not do more good," said
I, "to save the life of a man than that
'of an ass, or a cow? The beasts on
board the ship have food to last them
some days, and while the sea is so calm
there is no fear."
We now came to a small wood which
ran down to the sea shore, in the shade
of which we ate our food, whilst birds
stood on the boufhs all round us, whose

gay plumes ma e up for their harsh
song.

Turk gave a loud bark at what we
thought must be an ape in one of the
trees, and when Fritz ran to look out
for it,.he fell on a large round bird's
nest; at least, so he thought it was.
But when I broke the shell, I found it
was one of the nuts>> which Ned had
set his heart on.

" But," said Fritz," where is the
sweet milk which he talks so much
0 .

I told him the milk was found in the
nuts when they were half ripe; but as

this nut was ripe, the juice had got
thick and hard.
It took us a long time to get through
the wood; but at last we left this maze
of boughs and roots, and came to a
broad plain, where,_ to my joy, I found
the gourd tree, which bears fruit on its
stem. ' .

" The shells of these gourds," said I,
" will make plates, cups, spoons, and
forks."

Fritz leapt with glee at the thought.

" Now we can drink our soup like
men of high rank," said he; and he
soon set to work to cut spoons from the
rind, in which he put sand, so that the
sun should not warp them, and left 4
them to dry till we came back.

"Can you tell me why the gourd
tree bears fruit on the stem, and not on
the boughs P " said I.

" To be sure; the boughs would not
bear the weight of it," quoth he.
We then set out once more on our
search, and I took up my glass to spy
round me, but saw no signs of our
friends. At last we got to a tongue
of land that ran out in the sea, to the
top of which we came at last with much
toil, and from it we had a fine View
of sea and land, but still no trace of
man; and I felt sure that our mates
had been lost in the sea.

. We now sat down once more to rest.
" This sea," said I, "which looks so
calm, ought to fill our minds with
thoughts of peace; yet while I think
of those who, but four days since, were
swept off by the rude lash .of its Wild
waves, and, as I fear, lie dead in this .
smooth sea, its smile would seem to
mock them ! "

We had now to pass through ground
on which grew a vast crop of canes,
which made it hard work for us to walk,
and I felt some fear that there might
be snakes in it, which I knew chose
out such spots, so we made Turk go
in front of us, that he might start them,
and with his loud bark put us on our
guard.

When I cut the canes, I was much
struck to see a juice like glue come
out, and of course I must needs taste
it. I found it was sweet, and gave me
as much strength as a glass of wine

But when Fritz put it to his lips, he
said,--

"Oh, such luck! What will the
boys say to this ? "

He ate so much of it that I felt
'bound to check him; and when we
'left he took a load of the canes on his

back.

We now came to a wood of palm'
trees, where a group of apes took fright
at us, and at the bark of the dog they
fled to the top of the trees, and there,
with grins and shrill cries, sat to watch
us. I held back Fritz's arm, for he
would have shot at them.

"We have no right," said I, "to kill,
save for food; and, 'in- fact, these apes
will be of more use to us with life in
them, than if they were dead, as I will
show you. I then threw stones at
them, and they in their rage took nuts
by the score to hurl at me, so we soon
had a good store of the nuts, from-
which we drank the milk. We gave
Turk the rest of the crab, bound~ up
a store of nuts by the stems, and set off
on our way home.

\
CHAPTER IV.

As we went, we must needs suck the
canes, for they were so good, till Fritz
had great fears that there would be but
a poor feast for those whom we had left
at home. But I told him I thought
there was more cause of fear from the
sun, which might turn the juice sour;
in that case there would be no need to
spare them.

"Well, my flask is full of milk for

them, that's one good thing," said

Fritz.

" Nay," said I, "there is more fear
still of the nuts, for you may make sure
that they will turn sour."

We now got to the spot where we
had left the spoons, and we found them
quite dry, and as hard as a bone. We
had not gone far when Turk made a
dart at a troop of apes, who sprang from
place to place in sport. He hit hold
of one of them that held her young one
in her arms, which made her flight
'more slow. . -
. Fritz ran with all his might to save
the old ape from Turks Jaws, and so
lost his hat canes, and cups; but he
found that she was dead The young
ape leapt on his back, and put its paws
in his curls, and no cries or threats
cOuld rid him of it.

I ran up to him with a laugh, fOr
I saw the .ape was too young to hurt
him. As it would not stir, all Fritz
could do Was to take the cub home
as it was; for since it had lost its dam, _
the young thing would fain look to hini
to screen it from harm It was but the
size of a cat, though the old ape was
as tall as Fritz. .

I did not wish to have one more
mouth to fill ; but Fritz was loth to part
with his pet, and said that till we had
the cow, it should have his share of
the milk from the nuts. In the mean
time Turk made a meal of the old ape,
from which Fritz strove to drive him.

" Nay," said I, "if you drive the dogs
off such game as they have the luck to
find, they might spring on one of the
young boys some day when they are
much in want of food. Fritz thought
we were well off to have two such fine
dogs, and that the ass too would be
of great use to us.

When Turk came up to join us the
young ape took fright at him, and crept
up the breast of Fritz's coat.

He did not care to have him quitefi

so near, and the thought struck him
that he would tie the cub with a cord
to Turk's back, and lead the dog.
Turk did not at all like this at first;
but a threat and a coax made him yield
in the end.

We went on at a slow pace for some
time, and I could but think of the state
of joy in which our young ones would

.'be thrown when they saw us come
home with the ape like two Beast Show
men.

We had but just got to the banks
of the stream which ran near our tent,
when we "heard Flox give a loud bark,
as much as to say, "Here they are!"
Then Turk gave a bark, to tell them,
"Here we come!'_' But at these
sounds the young .ape took fright, and
leapt from Turk's neck to Fritz's head,
and come down- he would not.7716-520sz Family Robinson. 49

Turk was but too glad to break loose,
that he might run to meet Flox and
the boys, who were soon at our side,
and in great glee to see us back once
more. Each boy had a kiss, and then
came shouts of praise at the sight of the
new pet. '

" An ape! a real live ape l Oh what
a love ! How did you catch him P "
"burst from the lips of Ned and Jack":
but Frank, who stood in some fear of
him, said, "I call him a fright."

Jack--"I am sure his looks are twice
as good as. yours. See how he laughs.
How I should like to see him eat l"

Ned.-----" Now, if we had but some
of the nuts with milk in them! Have
- you found some P"

" But I fear you have met with some
risks," said my wife.

It-was in :vain- to try to tell them all
E
at once what we had done; .At length,
when they let us have some peace, I
told them where we had been, and that
we had brought them all sorts of geod
things; but that I had not seen a trace
of our friends from the ship.

" God's will be done l" said my wife.
" Let us thank Him that He has
brought you safe back to us. This day
- has been like a whole week .to me!
But put down your load, and .let us '
' hear you talk of all that you have seen
and done. We, too, have found work.
to do, though we have not gone through
all the toil that you must' have 'had.
Boys, see if you can ease them of
their load." : -

Jack took my _gun,,Fzrank the gourds,
and my wife the game: bags. Fritz
soon gave out the canes, and put the.
ape on Turk's back, to the great glee of
the rest of the boys. He gave his gun
. to Ned, who said the gourds were of.
too great a Weight for him to take, so
my dear wife lent a hand, and we went
' on our way to the'tent. ' . ,

. Fritz.--" It strikes me that if Ned
' knew that the gourds held his dear nuts
With milk in them, he would not give
them up so soon." '

_ ' Ned.-----" Give them to me; I will
_' take them, and the gun too."

'My wife had a good meal for us at
the fire. She had put some'sticks in
the. shape of a fork on the hearth,
which made a rest for a thin spit, on
which all sorts of fish were put to roast,
and a goose too. Frank was set to
turn the spit, and the pot was on the
fire, from which came forth the fumes
of some good soup.

At the back of the hearth stood one

- E 2.52 The Swiss Fania-1355mm.
of the-casks, Which held 'a Dutch cheese

in a case of lead. All this Was sweet
to our sight and smell, and we felt sure
would soon be so to our taste; and for
the time We lost sight Of the fact that
we were on a lone shore where, till
now, man 5 foot had not been set.

I could not think my boys or my
Wife had lost much time since we left
them; but I told them that they must
not kill our geese quite so fast, as we
ought to keep them for stock. "

" Have no p,"fear said my wife, " this
is not one of our own, it 15 a wild goose
which was brought home by Ned;
Jack and Frank caught the fish at the
reeks, while 'I brought the cask up
the tent and broke the lid of it, to
get to this good cheese."

Fritz. --" Lets feed'oui' young ape,
who has lost his dam's"milk;?SS.
Jack.--" I have been to try him, and
he-will not eat."
I told the boys that he must be fed

"with the milk from the nuts till he

could eat. Jack said he should have

.all his share; but Ned and Frank, on

their part, had a wish to' taste the
milk. .
Jack.--" Nay; but the poor cub

must live l "

. "And so must we all," said my wife;
"so now come and sup, and we will
have the nuts by and by."

We sat down on the ground, and

"the meal was spread. My boys cut

the nuts in two with our saw, and made
spoons of the'shells. Jack took good
care that the poor ape should have his
share; and the way the boys fed him
was to put the end of a cloth in the
milk, and then let the cub suck it.
.As night had 'now come on we all
went to rest. - The young ape was laid
on some-moss to keep him warm, with
Fritz and Jack b his side; the fowls
went to roost on t e tent, and we were
all soon in a deep sleep.

But we had not slept long, when we
heard a great noise, which the dogs and
the fowls' had set up, and we thought,
' of course, that some'foe was near. My
wife, Fritz, and I, each 'took a gun
and went out, when by the light of the
moon we saw a fierce fight, for our
'. brave dogs had round them - 3. Score

' Fritz and -I let off our guns, at which
two fell dead, and the rest "fled, but
Turk and Flox soon f5ut them'to death, '
and then, like true dogs, ate them. We>>
were lad to find itwas 'no worse a foe,
and t en went back to our beds, and
Slept till- the cock woke us with his loud
brow, and then my wife and I set our
thoughts to work to make plansfor the
day.

CHAPTER. v.

. "WELL, my dear," said I, ".I see
some toil lies in our path this. day;
Fritz and I must go on our raft to the
wreck, for if we are to save the live
stock, we lmust'go at once; and there
are bales and bales of goods on board
' which may be of much use to us. Yet
I know not what to do first, for we must
have some place here to stow them in."

"All may be done," said my wife,
" in due time; and though I shall be
in a sad state of fear till I see you both
back, still I yield to the good it will
be to us all, so let it be done this
day. " 1 ~ . _. .
V I then went to rouse my boys. Fritz
was the first to jump up, and he ran

for a dead wolf, which he found had got
quite stiff. He put it on its legs at the

door of the tent, to make the rest of
the boys start; but as soon as the dogs
saw it, they sprang on it,: and 'WOuld
have torn it to shreds, had not Fritz
gone to work the ri ht way this time,
which was to coax t em off with food. .
But this loud bark woke the boys, who
made a rush at the doOr of the tent-.-
to see the cause of 1t all
Jack was the first to come out, with '
the ape on his arm; but as sOon as the

young thing saw the wolf which lay -

dead at the door, he sprang back to his
bed and hid 1n the moss, .till no part

of him but the tip of his "snout could
be seen. Jack took the wolf for a dead
dog; and Ned, in a tone of some pomp,
said, " This is a gold fox."

' .- >> Wetthen sat down to break our fast,
when Ned gave a sly look at a cask
which stood by. -

" Ah," said he, " if we had but some
lard to spread on this hard bread, how
good it would be. Could we not get
at this cask ? "

. He then brought out some lard from

' ' a crack in the side of it.

. "Your taste for good. things, Ned,
has brought us a great boon. Come,
my boys, who wants bread and lard ?"

As our dogs lay at our feet, I saw
that they had got deep wounds in the
neck; so my ~wife put some of the
lard on them, which gave the poor
brutes much ease. Ned thought they
ought to have Spikes round their necks
to keep off their foes. \
" I will make them some," said

Jack. '
-While Fritz got out the boat, I set

11 a'hiorh ost, on the to ofwhich. ' 1
p 1? P P '

I put a piece of sail cloth for a flag, and
I told my wife and boys that they must
let it floatin the air as long as all went
on well; but if they stood in need of
us they were to let down the flag and '
fire a gun three times, when we should
come back with all speed. I told my
wife- that we ._might have, to stay on
board all night. ' =
' " Well," said-she, " if I thought you
would be on the. raft, 51 should rest at
ease, but not if you slept on the wreck."
Our guns .were all. we took, as we
thought we should 'find food on board.
But I. must add .thatFritz woulditake.

>>; Gig
the ape, that 'he' might give it some
milk from the cow, as he thought it did
not seem "quite up to the mark." So
we took our leave, and went off in the
boat. '

When we had got mid way down the
bay, a strong stream drove us on for
three parts of the way; at last we came
to the creek of the rock from which
I had made my first start. Then we
went on board the ship. . _

Fritz's first care was to feed the live
things, each of which we heard greet
.us in its own way. The young ape was
put to the goat to suck, and this he
did with so great a zest that it made '
us hold our sides to laugh at so droll
a sight._

Now that we had made our way to
the wreck, the next thing we had to
think of was how weshould get back.We knew that the wind which blew

in our teeth as we came, would serve us
now if we had a sail ; so a mast and sail
were of course the first things for us to
look out for. We found a strong pole
for a mast, and to fix the sail to a yard
did not take us long. We theny put ~

aplank on the top of the fourth tubp on
our raft, and so made a deck. Fritz
ran up a red flag to the top of the mast
as a sign to those whom we had left on
shore, to let them know that we should
not go back that night.

The next day we found all sorts of
things that we could turn to some use
on shore, such as shot, tools, and cloth;
and we took care this time to bear iri
mind spoons, knives, forks, plates, pots,
pans and a jack to roast with.

We found a chest full of good things
to .,eat such as the new kind of soup,.
hams, soifie bags of maize, wheat, seeds,
and herbs. We took all the" tools we
"could find room for, some guns, swords,
and a large roll of cloth. Our tubs
were full to the brim, and we left but
just room to stand. We now sent up
our flag to say that all'was right, and
went to rest for the night. '

CHAPTER VI.

AT break of day I went on deck to
i look through a good glass which I had
"found in the shlp,' and I could see my
wife with her face my way, as well as
the flag, which flew in the breeze. So a
as I knew that all went well with her,
'I sat down to eat a full meal.

' As to the live stock, it was plain that
if we made a raft for them, the beasts
would not rest on it; the great fat sow
mi ht swim to land,_ but as to the test we
- di not see our'way with them. At last
Fritz thought of a plan by which they -
might reach the shore;"'but which it
took us two- hours to put in force, and _
this was the wayof it :' the cow and the
ass had a cask'on each side of them, '
well bound withstrips of sail cloth, and
weput a blockifd wood on the head '
of each to hold. him by. We sent the '
ass off by a hard push, and he swam
well when he had once made a plunge
- or two. The cow, sheep, and goats,
all took'to the ,sea as if they did not
mind it, but. the sow broke loose from
us, and. was the first to reach the land.

' We then got, in our boat, bound all
the blocks of wood (which held the beasts)

to its stern, and drew with us our train.T/ze SszvS'Famz'Zy Robina)>>. 63

We thought much of our sail, for with
such a load as We had, we could not
have got on with our oars.

Once more I took up the glass to
look for my Wife and boys, when a
loud cry from Fritz rang 1n my ears:

"We are lost! Web are lost! See
that hug e fish. ' " '

But the bold boy tOok hold of his

gun, and sent two balls at its head, and
as it swam it left a track of blood.

We were now not far from the shore,
so we let down the sail and took our
oars, and when the beasts felt the
ground we cut off the wood and each
went on shore just in- the way he
thought most fit.

So we came to land. But where
were all those Whom we had left? We
could see no trace of them!

But we had not long to wait; for
they soon came up to greet us; and
when our first burst oPS joy had gone off,
we sat down to tell our tale 'from first
to last. My wife's joy was great to see
the ass, cow, sheep; sow, and goats, and
more than all, to hear how well Fritz's
plan to get them to land had been
brought to bear. '_ _ i n

We then setgto work to bring on
shore all our stores. I saw that Jack
wore- a belt oPS skin, in which were put
fire arm's; Said I, "Where could you
have found such a thing .73? '

"I made it," said he, "audathis is
not all; look at the dogs I"

The ,-'dogs had each a {thong round
his neck, thick with spikes. ' _-

"It Was I that thought ofit," said
Jack, " but I had help 'when I came to

sew the nails on." . - ~

I told him I should like to know-
whereahe got the thong, the nails, and
the threadfrom? '

Jack then said, "The thong was
made out of the skin of Fritz's wolf,
find" the rest came from the large

a .

%There is still more in it; do but
say what you want!" quoth my wife.

I sent Fritz to bring the ham from
the raft, and, to the joy of all, it was
set out on the top of the lard cask. My
wife brought out twelve dove's eggs, '
which were like white balls ; and wh11e
she spread our meal, Fritz and I took
' our load out of the boat, and made use
of the ass to help us.

We sat down to cheese, ham, and
. eggs, with the ass, cow, sheep, goats,
dogs, sow, and fowls all round us. The
geeseand ducks kept to the marsh,

where they ate the small crabs. I sent
F
Fritz for some wine from the stores;
and then my wife gave us a sketch of
all that she and the two young ones had
done while we were on the wreck.

_--o.--_.

CHAPTER IVII.'

" As to the way in which I spent the
first day," said she, "I will spare your
kind heart, for I was in such great fear
that I'kept my eye the whole time on
the flags and si ns from the ship, which
with the aid 0 the glass I could .see
well. But to day, as I. was sure that
all went well with you, I set out with
the". two dear boys in search of some
spot to pitch our tent in, that had more
to boast of than. this poor bare place.
'We went forth with game bags, and
" knives at oursides; the boys took our
food, and I shut up the tent door with
the hooks. Turk and Flox went with
us as our guides; but when we got to
the stream we were in a great strait, for
we knew not how to cross it. So we
kept for some time to the left bank,
when by hook or by crook the boys got
me through it. _

. "We had now come to what we
- thought was a wood, Which was in good
truth but a group of twelve trees, all
of a great height, and which would seem
as if the air was their home more than.
'the earth; and the trunks sprang from
roots, each of which made an arch- to
_ .hold up the boughs. Jack put a piece
.of twine round the trunk of one of these,
to see what size it was, and found it to

be two score feet round the stem; and
F 2
as far as we could judge, it was three
score feet high. A short smooth turf
grew at the foot, and near it ran a>> Clear
brook with a bank of bright green moss
on each side of it. On the whole, it
was as sweet a spot as the eye could
rest on. Here we sat down to eat our
meal. The two dogs, which soon came
to join us, did not seem to craVe for food,
as I thought they would, but lay down
to sleep at our feet.

"As for me, so safe and so full of
peace did this sweet spot seem, that
I 'could but think that if we were to
' build a home on the top of these high
trees, I could find it in my heart to
spend the rest of my life here.

"When We set out to go home we
took the road- by the sea shore, in hopes
that the waves would have cast-up things
from the wreck which might be of use
to us. . We found chests and casks
which we had not the strength to move
far, though we took them out of the
reach of the tide. In the mean time
the dogs caught small crabs which they
ate as fast as they could catch them. I
was glad to see this, as I knew the poor
things could not get their own food.

" As we sat down awhile to rest from
this hard work, I saw Flox scratch a
hole in the sand and eat some small
things out of it with a great zest. Ned
.stood to watch him, and then said:

" ' They are eggs l round white eggs I
and such good ones !'

" We took twelve of them, and left
Flox the rest for her pains. '

" While we put our spoil in the game
bags, we saw in' front of us asail. Ned
was quite sure it was our raft, but
Frank was much in dread lest it should
be a boat full of ' wild men who wOuld
eat us up.' 'Yet we soon drove off these
fears, and leapt'from stone to stone, till
we got to 'th'e'place where you were to
land.":- .,., ' . '. . , . . .

" Them" "said I, "I make out from ,
what you tell-me," that you have found
a high tree where you would have us
perch like fowls. But how 'are we to
get up '? '"

" h," said my wife; "can yOu not
call to mind the large lime tree near our
town in which a ball room had been
made ?' .We went up to that'by Stairs;
so why could you not make stairs. in
those huge stems 3': There we should
live in. peace, and haveno'fear Of wolves
or foes that prowl by:ri'ight."

I said. I Would think of what 'could

be done. 'uwmwmwmmm 'n

CHAPTER VIII.

THE next day we set our wits to
work to make a plan. In the end we
thought that we would build a home on
the spot my wife spoke of in terms of
x such high praise. '
_ " But the store house for our goods,"
said I, " must be in the rock, as well
as a place to fly to in time of need,
which shall be known to none but
us.
I told my wife that the first thing to
be done was to build a bridge, that we
might bring all our goods to the house
and stores. v -

"A bridge!" said my wife. " Why
can't we make use of a ford as we have
done?' The cow and the ass could
take our stores."

A
I told her that a bridge we must
have, and that the boys and I would
make it, while I set her to work to

stitch up some strong bags to put shot
in

As our minds were now made up
for this change of home, I woke up the
boys and told them of our plans. We
all gave a loud laugh when we saw the
young ape suck the goat, who took to
it as if she had been its dam. And as
to my wife to see her milk the cow, one
might vow that she had been born a.
milk maid. She gave us some of the
warm milk, and put the rest in flasks _
for us to take in the boat, and I then
had to go in search of planks of wood
to build the bridge with.

I took both Fritz and Ned with me
this time, as I saw we should have a
good load to bring on shore.
When we came up to a small isle at
the mouth of the bay, we saw there a

vast flock of gulls and sea birds of that A

kind, which, with their harsh cry fed
on ahuge fish. This fish was the shark
which Fritz had shot through the head,
and he found on it the marks of his
two balls.

Ned struck some of the birds rig ht
and left, and put the rest to flight. We
cut off the skin of the shark,g which I

thought might be of use, and put it in
the boat.

, We found loads of planks there,
Which had been thrown up by the hig li
tide, and as these were all that I could

wish for to build our bridge with, I did

not go to the wreck. We chose out
1th0se which we thought would best suit

us, and by the aid gof the jack screw
and some strong poles we bound them

a;
to the stern of the boat, and then put
off. As we went on, Fritz set' to work to
dry the sharks skin to make'files with,
and Ned in the mean while must needs
muse on the fact that the sharks mouth
is so made that to seize his prey he
must turn on his back, and 'this gives
his prey a chance to save their lives;
else, with such a maw, he would lay
waste the sea. At last we came to
land, and a loud call soon brought the
boys to our side. -

They had been hard at work at the
banks of the stream. Frank had
round his neck a net. full of fine craw
fish, and Jack had the same. " Frank
was the first to find these fish," said
Jack, " when he and I went in search
of the best place to build the bridge."

" Thank you," said I ; "then may be
you will plan the works." -
"' Yes, yes," said Jack, "but just
hark at what we saw. When we got
to the stream, Frank gave a loud call
to me, and when I came up to him I
saw F ritz's wolf with a coat of crabs
on him! I ran to fetch a net that we
found on the shore, and we caught all
these as soon as we had cast it, and
could have got .more if you had not
just then come up."

. I told Jack to keep as much as we
should want to eat," and put the rest
back in the stream, and I was glad to
find that We had such good food in our
reach. We now brought our planks
on shore. I; thought well of Frank's
site for the bridge; but it was a long
way from our store of planks. To get
these to the left side of the stream, we
bound a rope to the horns of the cow
(as its chief strength lies in the head),76 T fle S wz'ss thmz'ev Roeimon',

and one end we made fast to the
planks; and by the aid of the ass we
took all the wood we had need of to
the spot which the dear boys chose for
the site of our bridge.

To find out the breadth of the
stream Ned hit off a good plan, which
was to tie a stone to a ball of twine and
fling it to the left bank, and then draw
it back, and in this way we could judge
of the width of the stream by the length
of the string. 50 we brought from the
coast those planks which were of the
right size. We found the stream was'
one score feet wide ; _ but to give
strength I made the planks rest three
feet on each bank.

But now we were in a great strait;
for we knew not how we were to hoist
the planks on the left bank of the

stream, when the cow and the ass had
brought them there. . I said this
must be thought of while we ate our
meal. " Craw fish and Rice Milk "
was the bill of fare. But we were first
shown the two bags for the ass, which
my wife had made of the wolf's hide
with twine and a nail to pierce the holes
with. As we ate our meal, to talk of
our bridge was the one thing to do, and
we gave it the name of the Swiss
Bridge. '

We then went to work, and sent the
ass and cow, with Ned and Jack on

' their backs, to swim_ to the left bank -

with the long planks, and so'the thing
was done. I laid down boards on the
top of these strong planks cross ways;
_ but I would not fix them, as I thought
that if we should meet with a foe we
might want to take down the bridge.
When it was made, my wife and I went
up and down it with as much glee as
the boys. Worn out with the toil of
the day, we then made our way home
and went to rest.

CHAPTER IX.-

THE next day, with all my dear ones
round me, I went to pray; and we then
took leave of our first home on the isle,
for we had now to set out for our new
house in the trees, I bade my boys
keep near me in a group, and on we
went.

We brought out the ass, the cow,
the sheep, and the goats. The bags
were put on the backs of the first two
of these, and were full of things of .
weight, such as pots, pans, cheese,
bread, and flour.

All was in trim for the march, when
my wife came in haste to beg of me to
make room for her large bag which
held so much ; nor would she leave the
f0w15, .lest they should fall a prey to the
wolves; but her chief thought was to
have a seat found for Frank, as he
could not walk so far. I could but
smile at her wants, when room was so
scarce ; but I gave in,.and made a good
place for Frank on the back of the ass,
where he sat witha pack on each side
of him.

The boys came back, and said the
could not catch the fowls; but my wifZ
said she would soon bring them.
"Well, if you do," quoth our pert
Jack, " I will let you roast me in the
place- of the first chick you take."

\
" Then my poor Jack," said She, " you
will soon be on the spit! Look here !"
As she said this she threw down some
grain for them near the tent, and then
some more in the tent, which the fowls
came to eat; she then went in, shut the
door, and caught them all. To tie the
wings of each to its feet was soon done,
and they were put in nets, which-were
slung on the cow and ass.

All that we could not take with us .,
we shut up in the tent, the door of
which we made fast, and put chests
and casks in front of it, and took our
way to our new home. '

My wife and Fritz went first, then
came the cow and ass with their loads,
and Jack drove the goats. The young
ape sat on the back of his nurse, where
his grins and tricks did not fail to cheer
our hearts on the way, and he was quite
a pet with us all. Next came Ned
with the sheep; then I, like the Jews of
old, with my flocks and herds .in front
of me, came last. The two dogs ran
first to the front, then to the rear, as if
they thought we were all in their
charge.

.__...o..___

CHAPTER x'

OUR march was slow. We had ere
long to cross the new bridge, and here
we had one more than we had set out
with; for the sow--which was so wild
when it was her turn to be caught that
we had to leave here--now came to join
us, with grunts which would seem to
.say, "This change is not at all to my

mind."
G
As soon as we had got to the left
side of the stream the beasts set off to
feed on the rich grass, and but for our
dogs, we should not have known how
to catch them; so I told our "guard "
we would take the road near the coast,
where there was no grass to tempt
them. We had not left the long grass
half an hour, when our dogs made a .
rush back to it with loud barks and '
howls, as if they were in fight with
some foe.

Fritz and Jack ran off to the spot
with their guns in their hands, when
Jack, who leapt in the high grass up
to the dogs, said, with a clap of the
hands: _

" Be quick: here's a great beast like
a Hedge Hog, with quills as long as
my arm ! " v .

When I got up to it, it made a fierce
noise, and was so bold as to set up its
quills at us, as it had done at the dogs,
who gave sad howls at the pain they
were put to. At last, to put an end
to the fight, Jack sent a shot in the
head of the poor beast, at which it
fell dead.
., "Jack is proud of his feat," said
Fritz, "but he is too young to make
use of a gun, for he might have shot
one of the dogs, and what would be
still worse, one of us."

But I said that all did well to act for
the good of the rest; '
_ My wife was then sent for, to see
this strange beast. Her first thought
was to dress the wounds of the poor
dogs made by the quills. As Jack had
a great wish to take so strange a beast
with us, I put it in some soft grass, so
that the quills might not break.

G2
At last we got to the end of the
march, and I must say I was much
struck with the trees; for they were
of a bulk which I could not have
_ thought of. And we gave all thanks
to my dear wife who had sought out so '
nice a home for us.

We took the load from the backs of
the cow and ass, and bound fast their
fore legs, that they might not stray; but
the sow we let go In the way of her
own will, and the fowls and doves were
let loose. We then all sat down on
the grass to think of the best site for our
new home. '

It was my wish to mount the tree
that night. All at once we heard the
sound of a gun; but Fritzs voice set
us at our ease. He had crept out and

shot a fine Pole Cat, which he held up

to Our View with great pride.
- "Well done!" said I; "you ought to
have the thanks of the fowls and doves,
for the cat would soon have made a
prey of them."

"Pray shoot all the rest, Fritz, else
we shall not have a chick left for the
spit, said Ned.

I told Fritz to skin it at once, and
throw the flesh to the dogs. I left my '
wife to cook our meal, while I made
the quills fit for her to sew with. To .
do this I held a large nail in the fire
till it was red hot, and then sent it
through the head of the quill to make
the eye.

All the time my thoughts were full
of my house 1n the air.

As we knew of no way to climb to the
top of the trees, I hung the beds (which
I had brought from the ship) from the

roots, for as I have said, they grew in
the shape of an arch some way from
the ground, while on the top of; the

roots we spread the sails to keep the
dew off. '

CHAPTER XI.

WHEN my wife sat down to sew, I
went with my sons to the shore in search
of wood to build our house with; and'
we saw avast deal that had been thrown
up by the high tide, but none fit for our
use. -

As I knew that a. house could not
be built in a tree if there were no steps
to go up it, I did not at first see that '
my way was clear.

But by and by the thought struck me
that we might make steps with two ropesr" w mam-rm r: "1*": 1.":er wt" '~ "'1'

Tie Swiss Family Robinson. 87

.for the sides, and bits of cane to mount
up by, which we did with great ease,
:though we had to nail all the canes to

'sz the. ropes to make them safe. We

then drew them up by means Of a cord,

- -_ which I shot up in the tree from a bow

.With a weight at the end of it", so that
. it might. fall backto the ground.

All the boys were mad to climb up
it, but I. chose Frank to go first, as he
Was the least weight: so up he went while
Awe held'the ropes firm. Then went
<<Fritz With the nails and tools, so that

" 'the two boys sat on their perch in the

sky, and made loud cries to us poor folk
:;down on the dull earth.

Then I took boards up to make the

; floor- of the house with, and came down
by the light of the. moon. But I was

. tin great fear when I found that Fritz

Wand>> Jack had .,.not been seen, and still
more so when I heard their clear tones
ring forth 1n song from the tip top of
the tree, where it was by no means safe
to go When there, they were so
struck with the grand v1ew which lay
spread at the foot, that they burst out
with a hymn of praise.

I could not find it in. my heart to
scold my dear boys when they came
down, but told them to tie up the ass
and the cow for the night, andg
wood for our fires, which we should
stand 1n need of to keep off Wild beasts.
The doves had flown to the top of the
tree to perch there for the night, and
we found the fowls at roost on the
steps. - '
Now that the toils of the day had?
come to an end, we sat down to our meal. .
Then I lit up my watch fires, and weik'fgz
all went to rest, and slept--rall-- save one,
that is,----and that one was I ; for care
kept sleep' from my eyes ti'll near the
dawn of day, as-I did not think we were
_ safe, but when I had had a short sleep
' I rose, and we were all once more at
work.

CHAPTER XII;

MY wife had the cow and the gOats
to milk, and when she had done that
she went in search of wood for our use,
While Fritz and I went up the steps
with axe and saw to get rid of each
branch, bough, and twig, that came in

3 Logrway. We had put the last stroke
Io'th floor, and next had to hoist up
_ Ema-Xi] for a roof.

.The'huge trunk of the tree made
' next, and got to the top with ease. I took
Frank on my back", and then drew in
the steps; and now we felt safe, like the
knights of old when their draw bridge
'C was up.

CHAPTER XIII.

WE did not wake till the sun
.shone on us, and as it was the Lord's
Day, of course we did no work, but we
fisang hymns, which We- knew by heart,

:and we could pray, though we had no
books

The next day all the lads shot with
bows, and I made a small one for
Frank. So he set off w1th his bow 1n his
, hand, of which he was as proud as a
'Iaprince.
a back to our room, and the front let' in
a fresh breeze from the sea, of which
we had a fine View. With the rest of
the wood we made a bench and a few
chairs.

While we took our meal the young
ape leapt first to this boy, then to that,
for food, and ate what scraps they gave

him just as we did, and with such fun-

in his looks that he kept us on the broad
' laugh the whole time.

Our great sow now came back to us
with grunts of joy. We had not seen
her for two days, and my wife gave her
all the milk she could spare to show that
we were glad to see her. The boys
then set a light to the fires, the dogs
were bound to the roots of the trees,
and we went up our steps for the night.

My three big boys soon ran up them; _

my wife, who trod with more care, went
It was my whim to ~ give names to all
those parts of the isle which were well
known to us. The bay where we first
came to land, Ned said we ought to
call the Bay of Tears when we thought
of all those that poor Jack had shed '
there. - . '

" Nay," said my wife, "as it is the _
place where we first set foot on dry '
ground, I think we should give it the
name of the Bay of Joy. Our first
home had the name of Tent House;
the small isle where the fish was found,
Shark Isle'; and the swamp where the
canes were cut, Bow Marsh. .-

My wife and boys'had a glass of sweet ;
wine to' drink the health of the chicks __
. and all Who were at Kite's Nest--for this
was the name I gave to our- new home.

When the heat of the day had gone off, ' i

we set out to Tent House to get more. . i

'
food, and to bring the geese and ducks.
Thistime we did not go by the banks
of the stream, but kept in the shade
of the chain of rocks till we got to the
Swiss Bridge. Ned wore a belt of
skin from the hide of the wolf.

' Each of us had a gun and game bag
save Frank, who, with his fair face, his
gold-hair, his bow and darts,. was a
sweet sight to look at. Then came
Turk and Flox, but someway off, for they
were in fear of Frank's darts. Knips
--the ape--took his seat on the back
liofflf Flox, who could not shake him
0 . .

' ' New and bright scenes now burst on
Our View on all sides. The fig tree
grew here, the fruit of which was of

'- . great size and good to the taste. Jack

was .soon on the top of the sand rocks
'to pick some ; but it had not struck hlm
that the figs hadsmall thorns as fine as
a pin's point, which, of course, stung his
hands and hurt him. He came back
with sad cries, and we could see him
dance with the pain. I took out the
thorns, and put him in the right way to
treat the fruit, which was to run a piece
of stick through the fig, and then pare
it; and soon all the boys sat down to
eat them, and gave the best sign that
they thought them good. -
WhileI put the stores on the ass and
cow, my wife and Frank had to cook
all the good things. Ned and Jack
went to try to catch the geese and ducks,
'which had grown so wild, that but for
a bright thought of Ned's, they could
not have done 50. His plan was to '
fix apiece of cheese to a thread for a
bait, which was made to float on the
stream ; the ducks soon took the cheese
down their throats, and were drawn out
by>> the thread. He then cut off the
thread close to- the beak, and left the
rest of it in their craw, and threw them
neck and heels in the game bag.

 

CHAPTER'XIV.

I HAD seen on the shore some wood
which I thought would serve to build'a
sledge with, on which we could take
our. casks and Stores from Tent House
to Kite's Nest. The next day at dawn
I. woke up Ned, and left the rest to
sleep.. We went down to the shore,
and set to work at the wood, and cut
it the right length with the saw; we
then bound it to the ass, who drew it
with a good heart. We threw on it a
small chest that we found sunk half way

in the sand, and Ned led the ass.

The chest was full of the clothes of
the crew, which were wet with the sea;
but my wife thought much _of them, for _
she said that our own would soon be
worn out. Fritz and Jack had shot'
some birds, but I said, "It will save
. our shot if you set. snares to catch
them." And I taught them how to do
so with threads which we drew from
the leaves of plants that we had found.

Then my two boys and I made the
sledge, but while we were at work on it '- /
we heard a great noise from the fowls.
Ned went out to look round him, and
saw the young ape seize and hide the
eggs. from the nests, of which he had
amade a store at the foot of our tree.
When my wife heard of it, Knips had
a box on the ear, and from that time he
was shut up till all the eggs had been
brought in. When Jack went up the
trees to set the snares he found that the
doVes built there. I told him to keep
as sharp look out that our own birds Were
not caught in them, and by no means to
'fire his gun in the tree.

"0----

CHAPTER XV.

~ AT the end of the day I had made

my sledge in this way: in the first
place," there were two long planks of

' wood with a curve in the-m, and on
a . "these Were three short ones put cross
E *2 ways. The ' fore and hind parts were

:in the form of horns, so that the load

might not fall out.

' Two ropes were bound on to 'the
i H
front, and my sledge was made. My
wife was loud in her praise of it, and
Ned and I set off with it to Tent
House for some more casks, as our- food
had got low; and I left- the rest in the
care of Fritz. We bound the cow and
- ass to the sledge, made a whip out of,
a cane and a piece of twine, and took
our way by the shore, as that was the
best road for the sledge; and by the
help of Swiss Bridge we were soon 'at
Tent House. Here we took out the
ass and cow and let them graze, and
soon set to work to load the sledge once
more with all that we could find that
was good to eat. ,'

So hard at work Were we at this, that
we did not give the beasts a thought, -
but they took it in their heads to cross . _
the bridge, and roam out of sight. I '
told Ned to look to them, and in the
mean time _I cut a load of the {rush
Which grew in that part. When Ned
.came back I found he had made good
use of his Wits, for he took care to lift
SSoff the first planks of the bridge, so that

_.;there was now no fear that the beasts
jiWould stray

We took a bathe, and then Fritz

:Went to fiShr He had not been gone
long .When I heard him cry out:

" Oh pray come and help me; here

is such a huge fish! I canpt hold it, it
' Will break my line. '"

I ran up to lend my aid, and found
:.that poor Fritz lay with his face on the

- _ ground, and gave tugs at. his line, to

Which hung so largea- fish that it all but
{broke it.

I drew it to a pool, and we thought

' 'our- good cook would be much struck

With such a prize; so I put some salt'
. H 2 .
to it, and brought 'it home on the
sledge. .

--

CHAPTER XVI.

WHEN'I got home I found that the
boys were clad in the clothes which we
found in the small chest, and this new
style of dress brought screams of mirth
from all, as the clothes did not suit
their shape or their age; but my wife
thought that to wear these was not so
bad as to go with none at all. The
next day when I rose, ~I broke the news
to her that I must go once more to the

wreck, and bade Fritz get out all that . L

we should want. . _
-My Wife was as sad this time as the

last', and to add to her grief, Ned and

Jack i-were no where to be found.
But we set out for Tent House, and
on our way we heard cries so loud
as to fill the air. " We gave a start,
and all at once Ned and Jack leapt
from some trees, mad with glee to find
that their plan to join us should (as they

':thought) turn out so well. Their fun
' was to make us think that a tribe of

-:wild men stood round us to close us in ;
but I sent them both back, and told

them that it was erng to come out

' when they had not had leave to do so.

At this they felt much shame, and hung
doWn their heads; but to cheer them
up, I bade Fritz give Ned his watch
that he might know how the time went
while we Were gone. And as I had
seen a case full of them in the ship,'
I knew it would be no loss to us. .We
got out our boat, and by the aid of the
stream which ran through the bay we -
soon came up to the ship.

The first work to turn our hands to
<<was to make a new raft. We found at
least ten tubs, which we. threwin the
sea, and laid some long planks on them,
and these we bound to them with ropes.
This took up the whole of the first day,
and we had but time to eat some cold
meat which we had brought with us,-
and then we went to rest for the
night.

 

CHAPTER-XVH.

THE next day we put the goods on
the raft, and took all that we could lay
our hands on. There were rich gems
- of great cost, gold, and some small
..ca,_sh; these we had at first a wish to
take, but soon gave them up for things
that 'would be of more use to us, such
' as a case of plants and treeswhich were
kept in damp moss. I saw with joy
two. or three plum trees, some young
Shoots of the vine, and a peach tree.
How I did long to plant them !

-_ There were pigs of lead, cart wheels,
' tongs, coils of wire, sacks of maize, peas,
Cats, and a small hand mill. We knew
,not What to take, and what to leave, but
we. brought as much as it was safe for
the-raft to hold, and then we made for
the shore. -

Though the wind Was fair, yet we
got On at a slow rate, for the mass we
had-to tug kept us back. When we
eame on shore Fritz gave a shout. All
'ran to greet us, and great was their joy
to's'eesuch a load of goods, I sent the _
boys for the sledge to take some of our-
freight on shore at once, as the ebb
tideg left our boat dry on the sand.

By the aid of the jaCk screw we "
brought two large rolls of lead from the
raft; and these were a great boon to us,
as we stood in need of them to make
shot with. We took on shore the chest
of tools, and wheels for our sledge, and
then we sat down 1n the shadeb to rest-
and eat our meal. .

"And now, said my wife,' 'since
you have had such a hard days work,
I think I can give you some wine to
cheer you up."

She then brought out some choice
wine from a small cask that had been
cast on shore by the waves, and which
i116 and the boys had brought to Kites

est.

My wife went up the steps to stow
the goods, which took all our strength
to hoist up to her. This done, we lay
down on our beds, and I need not add
that our sleep that night was sound and
sweet. '

 

'_CHAPTER XVIII.

DAY by day we went to the wreck,
for awhole week, for we had found a

great prize there in the shape of a boat.
"To work! To work l " said I to

the three boys.

Each piece of it had a chalk mark
to show where it was to join to the next.
.I saw it would take some days to make,
and'I could get no sleep that night for
the thought of it.

.To cleara space on deck for it took
us an hour .or two, and we came on
shore each night when our work was
done, but not to the Kite's. Nest; for my
dear wife had left it and come to Tent
House, as she thought it would suit us

' best to be there while we had this long ~

job in hand. At last our boat was set
up. It was light, and had the look of'
a craft that would sail well.' At the
head was a short deck, and the masts
and sails were stout. To caulk all 'the
seams with tow and tar was the last
thing We did, but just for the look of it
we put two small guns in, which we
bound to its side by chains.>> And HOW

the boat stood on the stocks, but how '

could we get it to float? The ship's
side was so strong that to force a way.
for it was not to be thought of; all at
once- a bold plan struck me, but in-
which there was some risk that all might

b FR":

. (a
be lost as Well-as won. In a'word, that
part of the ship which stood in the way
of the launch, I blew up. But I did

not make my scheme known lest it

- should not turn out as I could wish.

'So I laid down a long match and then
came on shOre. , -

. When it blew up, "What's that?"
said all my boys at once, with a start.

"It .must be some foe," said Jack.
Fritz thought it might be a ship out
at sea in" want of help; but Ned said,
'-' Let's get out the glass and see."

. My wife's fears were that we had left
a light on board, and that this had
blown up the wreck. '

" Be that as it may," said I, " we will
go and find out the cause of it,' for
it is from the wreck that " the sound
came. Who will go with me? My
three sons. at once leapt in the boat,
and off we went, and as we had each
an oar, we were soon on board the ship,
'Which 'lay just" where we had left it;
part of the side was gone, and in its
place stood our boat safe and sound. -.

"All hail! All hail! " I sang out.
" The boat is our own, for now we can

launch her I" A
' "Ah, I see," said Fritz, "you have
blown up the ship. But how could you
do it so as to save the boat 3'"

" You will see by and by," said I.

To launch,- load, and fit out our boat
took us two days.

At last we put up our masts and sails,
and when We got to the Bay, I gave
my boys leave to fire one of the guns: '
so Ned and Jack put the match to
it, and bang! it went. - My wife and
Frank ran out in great fear, but our
shouts of joy soon told the glad tale,
and a" plank was put that my wife might
get in the*boat; and she could but praise
, our skill, "for," said she, "the boat
rides on the waves like a queen in full
state."

- We soon came on shore, and when
.We had got as far as the Swiss Bridge
my wife held out her hand to point
with some pride to a plot of ground

which she and Frank had laid out in
beds and walks.

" "See! this is our work l" said she.
3' Here are peas, and beans, as well as
pines, and maize."

.._.--o..___

CHAPTER XIX.

A WE then got to Kite's Nest, to the
' great joy of my wife, who had a dread
of the heat of Tent House. The: next
day I found that the doves had built 1n
our tree, and that the nests had eggs in
them. We brought out the fruit trees
which we had found on board the ship,
and we laid out a piece of ground to
plant them in. As we had no meat to
eat we went outwith our guns in search
of game. My wife went with us this
time, as she had a wish to see the world.
The three boys and I' set off with our
guns, next came my wife, and Frank--
' who led the ass, ---then Knips on the
back of the mild F lox .
We soon came to the wood, where
Fritz and I had the fight with the
apes. Ned gave a look at the nuts,
but there were no apes there this time
to throw them down. '
" Do they not fall from the trees
when they are ripe. ? " said Ned; when
down- fell a nut at his feet, then one or
two more: " My words act like a
charm. '" said he; " I have but to speak,
you see, and they fall at my feet."

' " Here comes the rogue that sent
them " saidI, when I saw a huge land
crab come down from the tree. -

Jackstrucka blow at him, but did
not hit him. The beast spread out his
claws and made up to him, when poor
Jack fled in great fear. But a loud
_. laug h from the rest gave him pluck,
and he threw off his coat and put the
beast to death.

' All got round it to see what it was
like, and I told them that when the nuts
do not break by the fall, the crab puts .
its claw in they small holes whichp are
at the .top of the shell to take out the
nut, which it eats. We then went to
the. Gourd Wood, where my "wife and
boys were much struck with the growth of
the large gourds which they found there.
When we sat down to our meal, Fritz
made a large spoon out of one of them
to skim the milk with, as Well as bowls
and flasks; while Ned--Who had no
taste for work of that sort--went for a
stroll in the thick wood.

All at once we saw him run to us in
great fear, and cry out, " A wild boar!
A great wild boar ! " '

_ Fritz and I took up our guns and
ran to the spot, but the dogs ,went

first. We soon heard barks and loud

, . grunts, by whichwe knew that a fight

went on, and off'we set in the hope of

a good prize. ' .
What did we see,--a wild boar?

No, but our own great sow, which Turk

and Flox held by the ears'! She had
grown so wild that she 'had left us to
live in the woods; and of eourse I
made the dogs give up their prize;

.__.__0_

\ CHAPTER 'XX.

THE next day I thought I would
vroam far and near till I made sure ,
that we were in good truth on an isle;
and I took with 'me Fritz, Turk, and
the ass. As 'we went through a wood

' of. oaks we met with the sow once more,
but this time she did not run from us.

Fritz shot some. birds of the jay

' tribe, and he had not had time to load
his gun when we heard a strange noise
like a drum, but not soloud, and at the
same time a sharp, harsh cry. We both

.madea rush with our guns to a copse,
:. ' , I:14 lee 510sz Faniz'e/ mama.

and there we fOund a green bird, Which
spread his wings and gave a strut up
and down the branch of a tree, where
he made his shrill note, and the sound
of the drum came from his Wing, which -.
he struck on the stem of it. I knew
.this to be the green grouse, and as all
at home were much 1n want of food, _
Fritz shot the bird. -
In this tour we met with no sort of
fright, and no one thing to boast of.
We then came home to turn our hands-
to a cart; for we found we could not go
far from home for the want of One:
We made a rough sort of thing with
the wheels which we had brOug ht frOm
the wreck, and found it of great use to:
us ' e.
In the mean time my wife and three?
sons had set to work to plant the vines,
and the quince, plum, and pear trees
near our new home. The rest I put in
the ground round Tent House, which
was our strong fort now, and held our
arms and stOres, It was shut 1n by a
high hedge of thiCk trees, so that no
man or beast could get to it. There
was but one way in, and that was near

SWiss Bridge, the first planks of which
we took up zswhen we left it- All this-
took us three-months to do. .

Our clothes were now ina bad state,
and we could see no .Way to get new
ones, save by a sail to the wreck 1n our
neW boat-z so off we went, and we found
it in much the same state as we had
left it.

We brought some of our own clothes,
bales of cloth, some tar, doors, locks,
bolts, and all the guns that we had
strength to move; in fact, we might be
said to sack the ship, and when we had
done this, I made up my mind to blow
it up. So we put a long match which
I knew would take some hours to burn,
and went at once to the Bay to watch
the wreck.- My Wife spready our meal
on a point of land where we could see
the ship, and just as the sun went down, '
off It went with a crash, and a pile of
flame burst up to the sky. *
When we heard thisy we could nOt
but shed tears, as we lost the sole bond
which bound us to the land from which
the ship had brought us; and we went '
back with sad hearts to Tent House. -'

CHAPTER 'XXI.

THE next day we made a search for
wood, and found loads of it strewn on
the shore from the ship. My wife who
came to help us, saw on a small lake
one of our geese and two ducks, each
with a brood in her wake. She had a
wish to get some eggs of the Wild fowl
to put in the hens' nests. So we made
a tour in search of some, took our food
with us, and a large sail to make a tent
with. The day was all that we could
wish, not too warm nor too cold, and in
high glee we sang as we went.

We came to a large plain where the
canes grew, at the back of which were
palm woods, and then the sea. We
were so much struck with the place that
we thought we should do well to move
from Kite's Nest to this sweet spot;
but we soon gave up the thought.
_" For," said I, "where shall we find a
home so safe and snug as our dear nest
up in the tree ?"
So our tent here was to be kept as'
a place to rest and eat our meals in
when we made a tour. We let the ass
and cow graze on the rich grass round
us, and spent the night here. The
next day we set to work to tie up the
large canes, and put them in the cart
to take home, for we had need of them
as props for our new fruit trees. '
_ This hard work made my boys long
for some milk from the nuts, and they
did all they could to climb the smooth
bare trunk of the tree, but in vain;
at last I gave them some of the rough
skin of the shark to brace on their legs,
which I had brought for that use.
Then I taught them to climb by the
aid of a rope, which was flung round
the tree with a noose, when they soon
got to the top, and an axe which was
hung to their belt, did the rest of the
work, for the nuts fell down by scores.
On these we made a feast, and the jests
of Fritz and Jack went round; for they
did not spare poor Ned, who was lost
in some new thought.

When all at once up he sprang, took
the shell of a nut in his left hand, and
in his right a tin flask, and with a rave
air spoke thus :---" Dear friends, feel
that all praise is due to the shark, whose
skin gave you the means to climb so
well. And though in the nuts which
you have sent down to us we have
found at once meat and drink, yet I
hOpe by my skill to tempt your lips
with some juice from this flask that will
give joy to your hearts, and bring to
mind the good feasts of our. old
Swiss home.' _

He then bound his legs with the
' shark's skin, and sprang up a palm,
' which he had long been seen to gaze-at .

through his glass.

Ned took no heed of the loud laugh
which the boys gave at this 'speech;
but as soon as he got to the top, he
struck the tree with. his axe, and a
tuft of light green leaves fell at .our

.feet, which I knew were those of the

palm.

He now came down and held out-
to me his cup, which was full of a
wine as pink as the rose, and then

Said, "I beg of you to drink my_ i5

health."

It was the true palm Wine; of it we
all drank, and gave great praise to

Ned, who thought no more of the-
jokes which had been thrown out at .-

him.

As it now grew late we set up the V

tent for the night, when all at once our

Q
ass, which till now had' stood quite still
near us, gave a loud bray, stuck up his
ears, and with a kick right and left,

. gave a plunge, and was lost in the cane
wood.

This I did not like at all; for I felt

loth. to. lose the poor ass that was of so

'- \mUCh use to us, and more than this, I

had my fears that some beast of prey was
near, which he might have-caught sight

'of. . The dogs and I sought far and
. near for a trace of him, but in vain ; so

then to guard the tent I made a large fire,

' which I sat to watch till the night was

half spent, when as all was still, I crept
to my bed of moss in the tent to sleep.
At break of day we all fell on our knees

- to thank God for His gift of health and

strength.
CHAPTER XXIL

I THEN went with Jack in search of
the ass, for I thought Fritz and Ned
would make the best guard for my wife.
We made a search in the cane wood'for
an hour or more, but still in vain. At
last we saw the marks of hoofs and the
foot marks of some beast that weknew
not of.

A long way off we saw some vague
things, which I took for wild beasts, 7
and as I went through a wood to see if
our ass were with them, we came face
to face with a ' herd of wild bulls
and cows. And to see them troop
up to us, lift their heads, and .fiX
their large eyes on us, struck me with
such awe that at first I could not use
my gun. ',-

By good luck the dogs were in the
rear, We drew back a pace or two,
got out our arms, and then made off on

:one side, when up came Turk and

Flox, and though we did all we could

to hold them in, they would fly at the
herd.

_ -And now a scene took place which

"it makes my hair stand on end to think
of. We heard a whole troop of them

lift up their voice and .roar, we saw them

beat the ground with their feet, and
'butt with their horns. our brave dogs
, 'Went straight'at them, and fell on a calf

which they took hold of by the ears.

_. The cow, whose eyes were red and
' whose blood would seem to boil with

rage, came full drive at us to shield

' her young one, and With her the whole

herd. -
._ Just then--r-I shake with fear as I
write it--I made a sign to' my brave
Jack, who was more cool thany I, and
we shot at them.

This made the whole herd pause for 'i '

a while, and they took to flight '50 fast ,

that ere the smoke from the guns was

blown off they were out of sight. My ' '

dogs still held their prize, and the cow,

though she had two wounds from our_ -

shot, bmade a rush at us, and tore up
the ground 1n her rage. She then set
at the. dogs to toss them with her
horns; but just then I came up, and

sent a shot 1n her head, which laid her ..

dead on the spot.
We now had time to take breath

We had seen death stare us in the face ~, '
' and we gave thanks to God, who.

had brought us through such great
risks.

The dogs still held the calf by the "

ears; the poor thing kept 'up a loud
roar all the time, and I had my fears
lest the dogs should .be hurt, or lose
"their prize. I went up to give them
'help', but knew not how to act. It
Would have been no hard task to kill
"the calf; but' I had a great wish
to bring him home and tame him,
"that he might take the place of our
'ass. ' a

-' \Now Jack hit on the right thing to
"do; "'he flung a rope round the hind
legs of the calf, and so threw him _
down} then I came up, put a strong
rope in the place of the thin one,
. .iand bound a loose cord round his fore
. e s. -

, 'gjack thought? of the joy with which
*'those at home would hail us when they
saw .us with this prize. But how

' - :were we to get the calf to move '? He
would not stir a step; at last I thought
of the mode made use of 111 the East,
which Is to bore a hole 1n the nose, and
put a cord through it. This .cord was
to serve as my rem to guide the poor.-
beast, and the plan did well.

I did not wish to leave the whole of
the cow I had put to death, as the meat'
is so good, so I cut out the tongue and
some of the best parts of the loin, put
salt on them, and took them with me;
and I torethe skin off the fore legs, as
I knew I could make good boots with
it. We let the dogs feast on the rest,
and while they made their meal on
it, we went .to a stream to wash,
and then sat in the shade of a large tree:

Clouds of birds of prey came from
all parts to feast on the cow, and a
fight was kept up the whole time, till
none was left but the bare bones. -
.' In the mean time the same sort-of .
work went on at the tent; for while
, Fritz and Ned had gone to the wood
to cut down a palm tree, a troop of,
' apes got in the tent, and ate all they
could find.
We made a fire of green wood, in
the smoke of Which we put the flesh
' of the wild cow, and left it there all
' night, and we found it was nice to the
taste. - -

fCHAPTER'XXIu.

THE next day we all set off home,
and were. glad yto find that the calf
'could graze. He was now put to draw '

" the cart by the side of his nurse (our
own cov'v), and these took the place of
our lost ass.
' Fritz and Jack now went to cut
down the short wood to make a road-
for the cart, and as they did so, the--
dogs, who were with them, burst
out 1n howls and cries. I had much
fear lest they should have met w1th
a beast of- prey; so I made a rush to?
the spot, that I might use my gun, and ;
found that the dogs kept some beast at- _' -
bay; but I could not see what it was
fory the thick shrubs.
Fritz told me he had caught a %
glimpse of some wild beast with a
black skin; but Jack, who lay on the
ground to spy at it, burst out with a" .
loud laugh, and said.- "It 1's one more
trick of that old sow! All she seems
good for, I think, is to make fools of
us!" Half in a rage, and half in'

1
3
1.215
mirth, we made our way up to the spot,
and there she was with ten young ones
a, few day 5 old. We were glad to see our
old friend with all these pigs round her,
for which we gave her a stroke, and a soft
grunt made it quite plain that it was as
great a source of Joy to her as it was to
The poor thing knew not that our
_ plan was to eat her young ones as soon
' as they were fit for the spit, and my
wife aiiid boys could not bear the
thoughts of it. But I told them we
'must eat meat or die.

At length we came to Kites Nest,
where our first work was to make some
stairs 1n the place of the rope steps ,
and this took us a month to do.

' " Come! come and see Flox!" said
Frank,- in high glee , "she has six
pups. ' but I- fear they are all blind. "

As these were more than we could
I
' keep, I had all put to death save two;
to which Frank gave the names of Bob
and Nell. Frank, too, made great pets .
of. three young kids which were just
born, as well as the lambs; and to love
and make much of these was a new life
to him. For fear our sheep should
stray as the ass had done, we hung
some small bells, which we had brought
from the ship, round their necks.

._0__..

CHAPTER XXIV.

ONE day, just as we had come to the
end of our work at the stairs, we heard
some way off a noise like the roar of a
wild beast, but with it a long sharp
sound and a strange kind of hiSS. Our
dogs stuck up their ears, while we all
, ot up a tree to look out, in no small
' fear of the noise, which we thought
came more and more near. At length
-.Fritz threw down his gun, and said
with a loud laugh," It IS our friend the
ass, come back to us with a song of
0y"
., 5 We were now sure that he was right,
" and could not but feel a slight blush to
think that we had been put to such
fright by an ass. We soon saw him 1n
the wood, and with him a friend of
his own kind, which I at once knew
to be the wild ass, and that it .Iwould
'be a great thing for us if we could
mcatch him.
- The wild ass, as soOn as he got sight
of Fritz, threw up his head and gave
.a- start back, as it was no doubt the first
man that he had seen. Fritz went up

' to old Griz with some oats and salt,
K 2

 

    
  
 

, ._ .v MW
and this he came straight up to eat as his
old treat; the Wild ass, too, With a toss of
the head and a snuff of the air came so
near. that Fritz could throw a rope with a
noose on. his head Thepoor- beast swung
round to fly from him, but that drew
the cord so tight as to stop his breath;

so he lay down with his tongue out.

I made all haste to throw a rope round'r "
his neck, and put a split cane .on- his
nose, inst as smiths do to tame a: horse"

the first time. they shoe :him.' -=I then"
took off the noose, and when I had

made the rope fast to the: roots of two,"

trees, I left him to come ..to

In the mean time my Wife and; the:

rest of my boys had come round us to see

this fine beast,- whose form was so full.
of grace that he was all but as gOOd as";
a horse.- In a short time he rose, and; '

beat the earth with his feet to get- loose ;:

but the- pain in his nose made him lie
down once more. - -

. We took care __to tie "the feet of our
oWn ass, so that he should not stray,
and When we had put a stout" rope
on him we left him near his friend

-'------0-----

CHAPTER XXV

I MADE use of all- the means I could
think of to tame our new guest, and at
the end of a month I thought I might
try to break him 111-. -This was a long
and tough task. We first put some
Weights on his back, but still he would
not let us mount h1m. _.

At last I thOught of the mode they
<<make use of 1n the Far West to tame
the wild horse and I made up my
mind to try it. In spite of the bounds
and kicks of the fierce beast, I leapt on
his back, and took one of his long ears
in my teeth and bit it till the blood
came.' Up he Went on his hind legs,
stood for a while quite stiff, then>> came
doWn on his fore feet, while I still held
on by his car. At last I thought I
might let him go ; he made some leaps,
but soon went off in a sort of trot--
From that time he was quite our slave ;
my sons all got on his back, and they
gave him the name of Light Foot. I
had put loose cords on his fore legs,
which we kept on for some time; and,
as he would not bear the bit, we had to
guide him by a stick, with which we
struck the right or left ear, as we might,
wish him to- go. '
As the time for the great rains was
now at hand, we- had to make sheds
_ for our beasts, to keep' them safe and
dry. We first made a roof on the top
of the roots of our tree. For this we
made use of canes,' which we had to
bind fast, and then to fill the cracks
With moss and clay, and smear the
whole with tar to keep out the rain.

By the aid of some boards we made
this one roof serve as well>> for our fowl
house, hay house, and store room. .

- One night when we were in. the wood
We heard the loud cries of some birds,
and we made up our minds that Knips
must have 'had- a fight with some'tof
them. So Ned went off to see what
the noise was, and we soon heard him
shout out, "Be quick! a fine heath
fowl's nest, full of eggs. Knips wants
to suck them, and the old One is fat

,'.himY=" . 4
" Fritzran up and caught both the old
birds, while Ned brought back a large
nest full- of eggs. Knips 'had done
us a good turn this time; for- the
nest lay hid. in a bush with such long
leaves--of which Ned had his hand
full--that but for the sharp sight of the
ape we could not have found it out.
I need not say how glad Ned was to
take the nest and eggs home to- my
dear wife, and the long leaves he meant

to give to : Frank, to serve as toy
swords. -

 

.CHAPTER XXVL

' WE then set out on our way back, Ned
with the two fowls, while I took charge
of the eggs, which I found were still
warm, and I had some hopes that the>>

bird would hatch out the brood when ., r
we got to Kite's Nest. Fritz rode
Light Foot-and in his wish to be first
' to take the good news to .my wife, struck
his steed with a bunch: of the long leaves
which he took from N ed.>> :- This gave
:Light Foot such a start that he flew
out of- sight, like a shaft from a bow,
and did not stop till he got to his home.
:My wife-put the eggs in the nest 'of one
of her hen-s, while the heath fowl was
made safe in a cage and hung up in' our
room to make her tame. In-a few days
' a. scorevof young chicks came forth from
theegg's, and were soon-as tame as our"
own fowls; though when :they were full ,
grown I cut their wings, lest in a wild
mOOd they mightfly off.

' Frankdid. not long care for the new
toy that 'Nedv had brought him in the
shape of ' the long leaves, and they were

I . ,gthrown on one side. But Fritz by
chance took up some of theseleaves, which
were now quite dry and soft, and he told
Frank to make whips of them to drive
the sheep and goats, of which the small
boy had charge. As he split these
leaves in strips, I found that they were
a kind of flax, and when I told this to
my wife, she said, " Bring me all the
leaves you can at once, and I will
make you socks, shirts, coats, thread,
cords--in fact, give me but flax and
tools, and I know not what I could
not do."

So Fritz and Jack went off to get
a fresh store of the leaves.

.------o--.

CHAPTER XXVI-I.

IN the mean time my wife told me
what tools I must make, that, she
might spin and weave, and clothe
us from head to foot; her eyes were
bright with joy as she spoke, and
I gave her my word that I would do
all that she could ask. In a short time
our boys came back with a large store
of these leaves, which they laid at the
feet of my wife. The first thing was
to steep them till they were quite moist;
so we got out the cart and took a load
of leaVes to the marsh, where we threw
them out in a pond, with stones on the
top to keep them down.

In two weeks' time the flax was fit to
take out of the pond; we then spread
it in the sun, which made it so soon dry
that we brought it to Kite's Nest the
same night, and laid it up in the store.

As we thought that the time of rain
was now near at hand,webrought in, from
day to day, loads of roots, nuts, wood,
canes, fruit, and all that might be of use
to us. We made the most of the last
few fine days to sow our Wheat and
grain, that the rain might make them
grow. We had had a slight fall of rain,
the sky was dark with clouds, and the
wind rose. We did not think the change
would come so soon ; but we now heard
the winds rage through the woods, and
the sea foam and roar ; the clouds burst
in the sky, and rain fell night and day;
the streams kept no more to their
banks, and the fields were one huge lake.

By good luck we had made our home
high up in the vale, and we found that
we were left in a sort of isle in the
midst of the great flood. But the rain
came through the roof on all sides, and
from hour to hour we thought the Wind
would blow our house off the tree, and
all that were in it.
We set to work to move our beds
to the small space where the high roots
of the trees made a roof for our beasts ;
but there was no room to move, the
smoke of a fire would choke us, and
if we went out the rain would drench us.
For the first time since our wreck we did
now long and sigh for our old home.

I made the wild calf and Light Foot
half free, but took care that they should
not stray, and they had to seek a roof from
the boughs of the tree. We had need
of but few fires, for it was not cold, and
we had not much that we could wish to
cook ; but we had a good store of milk,
dry meat, fish, and Cakes. At break
of day we sent out some of our live
stock, round the necks of which we had
put bells; and at night Fritz and I had
to seek them and bring them in, when
we were sure to get wet through, So
my wife made us a sort of frock with a
hood out of some old clothes, which,
with the help of some gum, kept out
the rain.

The care of our beasts took up the
first part of the day, and then we had
to bake our cakes. Though we had a
glass door to our hut, the dark sky, and
the vast boughs of the tree, which hung
round us, made the night come on much
too soon. Our light we had to fix in
a gourd, round which we all sat.

__.a--_

CHAPTER XXVIII.

WHILE I wrote down all that took
place, my wife would mend our clothes,
and Fritz and Jack taught Frank to
read and write, or draw the plants,
beasts, and birds that they had been
struck with.

At dawn, and at the end of each day,
we read in turns from the Book of
God's Word, which we had brought
from the wreck. My kind wife would
now and then give us a feast in the
shape of a roast fowl, or duck, and once
in four or five days .we had fresh cheese
made in the gourd churn. '

What was left at our meals we gave
to our pets. We had four dogs, a tame
hawk, and the ape, which were to be
fed from our hands. But if the wild
calf, Light Foot, and the sow could not
have found their own food, they must
have been left to die, for we had none
to give them.

We made up our minds that should
we live till this time next year, we
would not spend it in such a house,
but that we would build a new one
which could be made safe from the
wind and rain, and then come back to
our tree at the warm time of the year.

One night we all sat round the fire
to talk of our plans, when the thought
came to my mind that we might choose
as the place of our home the rocks at
Tent House. This I knew would be
a work of great toil, but with time we
felt sure that it could be done.

I need not say what joy we felt when
at length we saw the sun spread its
bright rays through the dark clouds;
the winds were still, the floods had
sunk, and the air was mild and calm.
We went out with shouts of glee to
breathe the pure air, and gaze on the
fresh grass that now sprang up at our

feet.
All things had a look of youth once
more, and in the midst of these
bright charms, we lost sight "of our
cares, and sent up a hymn of thanks to
the God of all good. '

Our plants and seeds had done well ;
the air was sweet with their smell, and
the songs and cries of flocks of birds
that were at work with their nests gave
life to the scene. Our first task was to
clear out the rooms where we slept in
the tree, and in a few days they were
fit to dwell in.

My wife set to work with her flax;
while my sons led out the beasts to
graze. We then had to dry our flax,
and strip, beat, and comb it; and we.
drew out such soft, fine stuff that my
wife was wild with joy, and would let
me have no rest till I'had made her a
wheel.

In my youth I had had a taste for-

L
the lathe, and though I had now no
tools, I knew how a wheel and a reel
should be made; and as soon as I had
got these out of hand, my wife set to
work to spin with so much zeal that she
would scarce leave her wheel to take
a walk or to cook our meals. She got
Frank to reel off the thread as she spun
it, and would have had the rest take her
place when she left it; yet none of them
but Ned would do What they said was
"girls' work." '

CHAPTER XXIX.-

IN the mean time we went to Tent
House to see the state of things, and
found that the rain had done more harm
there than at Kite's Nest. The storm
had thrown down- the tent, and blown
off some of the sail cloth, and a great
part of our stores were so wet that they
were not good for food. Our fine yacht
was still safe, and fit for use, but our
tub boat was quite spoilt.

We now felt that we must have a
roof to shield us, more strong than a
tent or the boughs of trees. The rocks
round Tent House stood up like a hard
wall, and had no cracks through which
we could pierce them. But we made
up our minds to have some sort of cave
at all costs. So we set to work to hew
the stone. We chose a fine site for
a house, with a View of the whole bay,
and of . the two banks of the great
stream as well as of Swiss Bridge.

The sun had made the rock so hard
that our, first blows made but a slight

mark on it. But at the end of five or
L 2
six days, we found it more soft, and at
last we came to a sort of clay which we
could dig out with spades. This gave
us hopes, and in a short time we had
made way to a depth of eight feet. One
day while Jack was at work with a crow
bar, we heard him call out:

"I have cut through I"

" Not through your hand, child?"
said I.

" No," said he; "I have cut through
the rock."

Fritz ran in at the shout, and told
him he might as well have said at once
he had cut through the earth. But Jack
said, though Fritz might laugh, he was
quite sure he had felt aspace with his bar.

I took a long pole to probe the
hole, and found there must be a cave
of some size. But as I put my face
down to look in, a rush of bad air
brought on a sort of head ache, and
made me feel quite faint.

"Come off, boys," said I ; "the air
you would breathe there might cause
your death."

I then sent them to get some hay, to
Which I set a light and threw it in the
cave; but it was at once put out by the
foul gas.

We had brought from the ship a box
of squibs ; so I threw in some of these,
and set a light to them by a long match,
which gave us time to get out of the
way. When they went off the gas
came out with a rush, and the pure air
took its place. I put in some more hay
which burnt with a bright blaze, soI
knew that we were now safe from the
gas; but for fear of pits or pools I
would not go in till we had some lights.
So I sent off Jack onLight Foot to
tell the news to my Wife, and bring all
the lights they could find.

Jack went off with a crack of his whip
in such haste that he made my hair
stand on end. While he was gone,
Fritz and I gave more width to the
hole, and swept a clean road for my
wife. Just as we had done this we
heard the sound of wheels on the bridge,
and the cart came in sight, drawn by
the cow and ass, while Jack rode in
front on Light Foot, and blew through
his hands as if it had been a horn.

I then gave one light to each, with
some Hints and a steel ; and we took arms
with us, and set forth in a slow line for the
heart of the cave. I went first, then my
bi boys, and then my wife and Frank.
"(Tye had gone but a few steps, when we
came to a stop, quite struck with awe;
the scene round us was a blaze of bright

' *'i'lTee Swiss FamzZy 13065723072. I 5 I

light, and we found that we were in a
cave of gems, which hung from the high
roof in all forms and shapes.

The floor was smooth with fine dry
sand. I broke off one of the gems to
judge what they were, and found to my
great joy that it was a cave of rock
salt. This was in truth a mine of great
wealth ; for salt was good for our. beasts
as well as for us, and would cost us
now no toil to get.

Blocks of salt lay on the ground, and
I had some fears lest more should fall
on us: so when the rest had left, Fritz
andI let off our guns, but not more
than two or three lumps came down.
We were now sure that our cave was
quite sage as a place to dwell in: so we
spent each day at Tent House at work
on our {new home, and went back at
night to Kite's Nest. _
CHAPTER'XXX.

ONE day when we were at work at
the rock at Tent House we were struck
with a strange sight. A large part of the
sea would seem to boil, and now and
then small flames shot up and were
seen no more, While huge flocks of sea
birds flew round it with loud cries, and
here and there took a plunge in the
waves. We ran down to the bay and
found that this was a shoal of fish, so
dense that they were like a sand bank
some miles in length. We sent at once
for our pails to hold them, and made
plans as to how we should take so rich
a prize. Fritz and Jack stood up to
their waists in the sea, and threw them
up on the sand. My wife and Ned
then set to work to clean them and rub
them with salt, that we might have a
store of them for the cold time of the
year.

These fish drew to the spot a shoal
of sea dogs, some of which we caught
for the sake of their skin and oil, which
we might burn in lamps or use for
soap.

At this time I put my sledge on
wheels that I took from the guns of the
ship,'and made it so low that we could
place great weights on it.

- In a month we had one more shoal
of fish, which Jack was the first to find
out. They were so large that he was
sure they must be whales. Jack ran at
once for his bow, and made fast a ball
of string to a dart with a hook at the
end of it. He then made "the ball safe
on the shore, took his bow, put the dart
in it, and shot a large fish in the side.
The fish fought hard to get free, but at
length weak with the loss of blood, we
drew him to the land with the cord, and
put an end to him.

Ned took his rod and caught some
trout, while I struck some huge fish
with a large prong. The hard part of
our task was to get the spoil to land.
Fritz had struck a fish of at least eight
feet long, which was more than a match
for us all, till my wife brought up Light
-Foot, to whom we bound the line, and
so got this great prize to shore.

As we had more fish than we could
eat, we had to dry and salt some, or
boil them in oil; and the roe of the
large fish we kept by us as a great
treat. -

When this was done, our next task

was to plan a boat to take the place of

_ _,'_.

,__,.,~___..
our tub raft. I had a great wish to
make one of bark, as the wild men do:
so we set out in search of a tree for
that end. All those near our house
were worth too much to cut down, some
for their fruit and some for their shade:
_so we made up our minds to search for
trees a good way off, and on the road
we took stock of our plants and fields.
Our peas, beans, maize, and canes had
grown well, and the pines on the high
ground gave us hopes of a rich feast.
One fine day we set out for Kites
- Nest to see the state of things there.
We found my wifes fields of wheat,
oats, and beans were for the most part
fit to out, though our best crop was the
maize. But birds of all kinds, from the
heath fowl to the quail, had made their
homes round them, and it would seem
that they 'did not mean to leave much
for us. Fritz let loose his hawk and
flew it at some of them. The bird at
once went up in the air and shot down
on a fine fowl, which it laid at the feet
of Fritz. We got, too, a score of fat
quails, which made a nice feast for us.
My wife made some juice of green
maize, and this was a sweet and fresh
drink, as white as milk.

- We then put to rights our house at
Kite's Nest, and laid by our wheat till
we should have time to thrash and
grind it. Fritz thought we could build
a mill on the stream ; but for this bold
scheme, as yet, we had not time.

. The next day we set out on a tour to
look out for a spot on which to build
a farm house for some of our live stock,
where they could find their own food.
My wife chose out twelve young fowls,
and I took four young pigs, {our sheep,
and two goats. These, with all the
tools which we might need, were put in
the cart, and drawn by Light Foot, the
cow, and our old friend, the ass. Fritz
rode first on Light Foot to guide us;
and on the road we found some new
trees and plants, which were of great
use to us.

__.0_

CHAPTER XXXI.

WHEN we had made our. way through
the high rass of the plain, we came to
the top 0% a hill, from which we had a
grand View of the land that lay at our
feet. Trees grew thick on the sides of
the hill, and made a screen from the
north wind, and a fine stream ran

through the rich fields. We saw at
once that we must make this the site of
our farm.

We set up our tent, made a fire, and
went to work to cook some food.
Fritz and I then went in search of a
spot on which to build our farm house,
and we chose a group of trees which
grew so close as to make quite a wall
of wood. Here we brought our tools,
but as the day was far gone, we went
back to sleep in our tent. In our
search for trees and bark, our goats led
us to find out a rare kind of splce, and
some gum which would take the place
of pitch for the boat we meant to
make.

We went on with our work at the
new farm house, which took us some
days. We made the walls of thin
laths and reeds, six feet high, and we
took care to let in light and air. One
room was for our own use when we
chose to come to the farm, and all the
rest was kept for our live stock. But
we could not get on fast with our work
from want of skill.

While Fritz and Jack had gone to
Kite's Nest to bring back a fresh stock
of food, Ned and I thought we would
make a short tour. We went up the
stream for some time, which led us to a
large marsh, and here we found a lake
full of wild foWl. Round this lake
there grew some tall thick grass, with
ears of grain, which I found to be a
small kind of rice; and we took some
of it home to show to our good cook,
who would I knew think it a great

boon.
We then went round the lake, where

a new scene burst on our view on each
Slde. In the mean time Ned, W1th
great skill, brought down some birds,
while Knips found out some choice
fruits. In the midst of the birds of all
kinds, we were most struck with a pair
of black swans, and it was a treat to.
stand and watch them glide, like a ship
in full sail, on the bright face of this
clear lake. Ned would have shot some
more birds, but I bade him not break
the charm which the hush of the scene
gave to it. As to the lake, none but a
Swiss, who from his youth looks on
such scenes, can judge of the joy we '
felt. We thought we were once more
in our own dear land, but the huge
trees and the rare plants put us
in mind how far we were from it.

One of the dogs caught a most
strange beast as it swam at the edge
of the lake, and brought it to us. It
had web feet, a thick tail, small head
and ears, and a long flat bill, like that
of a duck. Nonetof us knew what
it was: so I gave it the name of the
beast with a bill, and I told Ned to
take it home and stuff it.

On our way back to Kite's Nest
we went through the wood of apes,
when the rogues threw a cloud of fir
cones at us ; but a few shots put them to
flight. . The cones were of use to us, so
we took a bag of them home.

We then- came to a small hill, from
the top of which we had a View of rich '
plains, streams, and woods full of bright

lants and gay birds. "Here, my
boys," said I, "here we will build a
house for the hot time of the year."
In ten days from this time we had built
a house, and we gave it the 'name of

View Hill. , - 4.
But I had not yet met with a tree
M
that would suit me for a boat. So We
went back, and at last I chose a sort of
oak, the bark of which was more like
that of the cork tree. We first had to
fell it, which took us 'some time; and
then we cut out the trunk in the shape
of a boat, though we made it look more
like a trough; and it was then left in
the sun to dry. . .

As there was still much to do to it, I
sent Fritz and Jack to Tent House
for the sledge, that we might move the
boat there. We now set hard to work
' at it, and made a mast, a keel, seats,
brass. rings for the oars, and stays for
the mast. To give it weight, I put
down some stones and clay with boards
on the top, and we could then boast
- that our boat was fit for sea.
CHAPTER XXXII.

IN the mean time our cow had borne
a young male calf: so as the rest of the
boys had steeds to ride, I gave it to
Frank to teach and train.

We now spent all our time at the
caveat Tent House, that we might have
it warm and snug when the rain and cold
should come. The beams and planks
from the ship were a great help to us
when we made the rooms that we
meant to live in, but the part for our
live stock we built of stone to keep out
the smell. The floor we made of a
sort of clay, which, when dry, was
smooth and hard, and on it we put
sail cloth, wool, and goat's hair, which
with some gum made a kind of felt.
We made one of these felt cloths for
each room to keep out the damp; so
that when the rain came at last, we had '
a warm and safe home. At break of
' day we went to our work room, while
my wife took her wheel or her loom,
and I made a sort of lathe out of the
wheel of a gun, with which Ned
'Cliilld turn some neat things with much
' s 1 .

' Our room was bright with lights,
which we did not spare, as we could get
them with so much ease. 'For Jack'
and Frank I made flutes out of reeds,
on which they soon learnt to play well,
and my wife, who had a good voice,
sang to their notes.

I made a small church in that part
of the cave which shone with so bright
a light, and here we went each day
to pray. Thus we spent our days free
from care and gloom. As far as we
knew, we might have to pass the rest of
our lives on this lone shore; We had
good health and sound hearts, so that
we could work with a will, and our
minds grew more full and strong from
day to day. i .

We saw round us on all sides the
signs of a wise and good God. In
Him I put my trust that He would
give us back to the world, or send some
friends to join us in the isle, where for
.~two years we had seen no trace of man.
To Him did our hearts turn, and to
Him we left our fate. .
